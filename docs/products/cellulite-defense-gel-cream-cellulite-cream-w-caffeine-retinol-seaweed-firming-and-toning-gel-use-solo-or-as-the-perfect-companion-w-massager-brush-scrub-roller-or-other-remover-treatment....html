            <li>The cream smells very nice and after applying and wait for 5</li>
            <li>So, if you can&#x27;t use something because the smell is so heinous, it probably isn&#x27;t going to be very effective</li>

            <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>

            <li>It feels good</li>

            <li>Good luck.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels great with a massager!!</li>
            <li>These are the good things.</li>
            <li>I work out about 6 hours  a week and eat good</li>
            <li>Its a good product.  </li>
            <li>It was a good smell and a tingly feeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Good luck to you all and wish me luck.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I saw good reviews</li>
            <li>You can do this along and see good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Consistant use will give you good results.</li>
            <li>It works great and the fragrance is really nice.</li>
            <li>Works good waiting for results, smoother skin</li>
            <li>LOVED this product.</li>
            <li>I just have this for 3 days, and it&#x27;s a good cream, does not make miracle, but reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>and it smells really good too</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream with Caffeine, Retinol &amp; Seaweed for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and the cooling feeling it gives is really nice.</li>
            <li>use good..</li>
            <li>It also is a good amount given.</li>
            <li>Product feels good on my skin....</li>
            <li>This is really good for toning</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 4 weeks and have seen good results.</li>
            <li>5 star will be for a company that can figure out how to get rid of it for good &amp; prevent it from occurring.</li>
            <li>I will update my review with her thoughts once she has used the product for a good bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Body Kerry are good products for the price.</li>
            <li>That cooling sensation makes me feel so good, as if my fat is melting away.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>This company is also great as they sent a check-up email to see how I liked the product after I had it for a week or so.  </li>
            <li>Which is a good thing</li>
            <li>(I am in a good shape)</li>
            <li>So my nutritionist recommended CLA and also advised that the cream was good, so I started both.  </li>
            <li>this one feels good when you put it on</li>
            <li>when applied, just the sensation alone made me feel like it was going to do some good.</li>
            <li>It is good and asdescribed by the seller.</li>
            <li>I Will be ordering again, and want to try their stretch mark cream to see if it works as good as this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>This cellulite cream contains ingredients that are known to be good for skin smoothing and reducing the look of cellulite.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Smell is strong but i like that !!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and looking forward for more beautiful legs .</li>
            <li>Exceptional customer service on behalf of company also.</li>
            <li>, i read all these great reviews and even googles it saw on blogs and did more research found it on youtube even on instagram people loved it .</li>
            <li>Best of the best this is my second purchase</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent seller (very kind).</li>
            <li>you apply the gel is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It feels great after work out shower because of minty feel but not for winter, I am sure.</li>
            <li>I just ordered the Vitamin C face &amp; neck moisturizer, which I can&#x27;t wait to try because, judging by the reviews and my experience with Body Merry, I&#x27;m sure it will work great.</li>
            <li>I can say that it feels wonderful on a hot day or after a good workout.</li>
            <li>It is more of a gel consistency which is great for distributing.  </li>
            <li>I am very sure that I am going to buy another cream</li>
            <li>Update:&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>Happy customer :)</li>
            <li>the best thing is the cooling sensation,very good for hot summer</li>
            <li>So many great things about this product where to start..</li>

            <li>I am reading all of the Amazing reviews and am dumbfounded as to why I haven&#x27;t gotten any of what they are all raving about.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>After taking a nice warm bath, just apply this</li>
            <li>It is mine and yours may differ from my own.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice product to have.</li>
            <li>ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li>I think the act of massaging the cream into my skin may be as effective as the product itself.</li>
            <li>nice cooling affect ..</li>
            <li>liked this item</li>
            <li>but this product is really nice</li>
            <li>the cream feels good on my body and it works better than I expect.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t seen results from this as of yet.</li>
            <li>Maybe if it lasted longer I would have liked it.</li>
            <li>I thought that was so nice</li>
            <li>Loved it and will have to order more.</li>
            <li>I used to work part time at a popular beauty store that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; and I tried everything there under their roof for stretch marks and cellulite.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice in my opinion and I like the tingle.</li>
            <li>so that was nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample ,review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Maybe now that it&#x27;s warm, I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
            <li>Just my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about and don&#x27;t know if they are more good for your body, or harmful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the tingling sensative is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell though</li>
            <li>So I can say this is a nice product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li>but I have to be honest</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be purchasing my own Body Merry cellulite cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a eucalyptus smell to me.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cream to use on your body.</li>
            <li>I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, of course being a nice dad, I did.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin warm and tingly for about 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged too.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can not say I recommend it</li>
            <li>; really does it the best.  </li>
            <li>However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I have recently received a great Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream from Body Merry (at no cost) and I have to say I’m impressed.</li>
            <li>I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice jar but still would have been nice to be in a pump style bottle.</li>
            <li>but I agree that all thoughts are my own</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>but I needed something to help with my butt and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to try Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My co-worker assured me it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>i loved the way the product felt after applying it feels minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am really loving this gel.</li>
            <li>Customer service is excellent, and I feel that they really care about the results  of this product.</li>
            <li>and when I gave my honest answer, I was told I was going to get all my money refunded.  </li>
            <li>but it feels nice.</li>
            <li>and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li>well it looks like creamy tapioca and smells like menthol, and kind of comes out looking like paste but one that is gone within seconds into your skin i used it after my shower just on my calf that would not work itself out and wala all gone within a day of use and my walking</li>
            <li>I am loving this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>Well, Too Be completely honest...</li>
            <li>and I have three sweaters on and can&#x27;t get warm.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>I bought it kind of on a whim after reading review for a couple minutes, threw it in the shopping cart and said &amp;</li>

            <li>Skin has a warming sensation - hopefully I see some results :)</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep dragging one way UP.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Probably need to try more for longer to see some results,but I&#x27;ll save money.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference within 2 weeks (while maintaining a healthy diet and exercising).</li>

            <li>my legs look dramatically better.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for many of the products.</li>
            <li>I apply mostly in my stomach area.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more of a gel than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love the way it makes skin feel all tingly after using.</li>
            <li>Item was ok.</li>
            <li>I think if I continued using the product I would see more results.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Overall great!</li>
            <li>I purchased Jergen&#x27;s Skin Tightening cream for under $8, and that gave my legs a better appearance.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles, as I will continue through summer.</li>
            <li>Communication with seller was also top notch.</li>
            <li>Use it in conjunction with getting your butt off the couch and doing some squats and you are gonna like what you see.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li>I love their guarantee and I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling feel,like it is working the minute you put the cream on</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>it has a tingling cooling sensation, I will start using it more often</li>
            <li>However, I can say that I love the way that it feels.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting it to work better</li>
            <li>I do however love the tingling menthol sensation on my skin and it relieves muscle aches after working out at the gym.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using my cellulite massager with the product as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>My dog decided to get into my cream, I wasn&#x27;t sure if she ate it or not</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I also ate healthy and worked out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure if I should give it four stars just yet.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so much better and goes on nonsticky.</li>
            <li>Love the cooling tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>... wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li>and, sure, I still have cellulite</li>
            <li>This cream definitely feels wonderful, tingly from the menthol.</li>
            <li>The menthol smell dims to a nice light floral scent.</li>
            <li>The people who review with outstanding results are either paid or lying.  </li>

            <li>and I had the slightest more confidence when putting on the bathing suit.  </li>
            <li>So hopefully more cellulite will disappear as i keep using it!!!!😀</li>
            <li>Thought it would be more like a cream.</li>

            <li>I love the cooling effect of this cream...</li>

            <li>As a bonus, I liked to tell myself that it was a great way to clear my sinuses</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I will continue to use the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for reviewing purposes.</li>

            <li>Cellulite Defense has all three of these ingredients and more.  </li>

            <li>Their cellulite cream contains caffeine, retinol, seaweed, organic cayenne, and more.</li>
            <li>But it has done enough to make me say I am impressed with the outcome so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably I have to use more to see some results.</li>
            <li>This stuff looks like pudding and feels like pudding, but it sure don&#x27;t act like pudding.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>

            <li>It does have a strong menthol smell to it, kinda like arthritis cream does</li>
            <li>Smells really strong to use in the morning before work.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I was expecting some strong medicinal aroma.  </li>
            <li>so I loved it a very simple yet eye catching design.  </li>
            <li>But too strong not to be noticed.</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell like sandlewood insence or something</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have a strong menthol smell</li>
            <li>I noticed that it has a strong minty smell that took me by surprise, after a while though it will vanish.</li>
            <li>It also has a strong scent that reminds me of Vick&#x27;s VapoRub.</li>
            <li>will say if you don&#x27;t like the strong scents of menthol you might not be a fan of the product.</li>
            <li>To me, it smelled medicinal and it was quite strong.  </li>
            <li>warning, this has a strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>The odor is strong</li>
            <li>I tought it might be too strong and people would wonder about it.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong mint scent, which you would have to give some time to get used to.</li>
            <li>I like the strong menthol smell...</li>
            <li>But the smell is way to strong.</li>
            <li>I use it with a strong Vitamin C serum  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell like strong medicine.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product with all the good reviews</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this by far has to be the best ,seeing good results in only rwo weeks,love this product reasonable price..definitely ordering more</li>
            <li>Merry&#x27;s Cellulite Gel-Cream is the perfect combination of key ingredients in the right combination to target that stubborn cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, But Smells pretty strong, Kind of like bengay</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles after the first week or so of my use just so I wouldn&#x27;t run out of this amazing product.</li>
            <li>The cream is cool, minty and gives you a likable tingle on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feeling of the cream is cool and refreshing suits</li>
            <li>I love the cool tingle it leaves after applying.</li>
            <li>To be honest at first</li>
            <li>The gelee is smooth and spreads onto the skin really easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like Ben gay</li>
            <li>i love the tingly feeling and the smell and even the texture it soaks up quickly</li>
            <li>I am in love and will now forever be a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not this super magic cream that erases all of your unwanted cellulite</li>
            <li>That’s obviously good news after all because you will not carry the same strong scent!</li>
            <li>I really like this cream and will order more when I am out!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this cream very much!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth....and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 4 or more weeks, as after just a couple days, it already looks nicer!</li>
            <li>Im happy with it lasting a month with NORMAL use; I think that&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li>Im happy with it lasting a month with NORMAL use; I think that&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry if it smells too strong when you first apply!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear dress like the other beautiful girls</li>
            <li>if you Google seaweed for cellulite control you will find that many beauty companies and jumping on that wagon because its very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using seaweed in a cellulite control cream is relatively new but very effective.</li>
            <li>Not for sure how long term, but as a easy quick fix, this has done great.</li>
            <li>As someone that love beauty products I was super excited to receive this Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream in the mail to give to a family member to try out.</li>
            <li>Super excited to see some results!</li>
            <li>I am noticing a huge difference in the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>Although this cream didn&#x27;t work with my skin because my own personal problems the customer service of this product is so amazing</li>
            <li>I see a huge difference in my thighs and butt area.</li>
            <li>now I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE FAN of Body Merry products, and couldn&#x27;t WAIT to try this cream based upon the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Diet, and exercise will make a huge difference too.</li>
            <li>Have I seen any huge results?</li>
            <li>Have I seen any huge results?</li>
            <li>and my skin feels smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have received this product for free for review.</li>
            <li>I didnt have much faith when i tried it out but to see how it works on cellulite is amazing.</li>
            <li>This cream feels and smells amazing and works very well.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free to review.</li>
            <li>Really work, amazing product.</li>
            <li>Smells like a light blend of citrus and eucalyptus and peppermint - energizing, invigorating, caffeinated, etc.  </li>
            <li>However, for the heck of it, I also tried using it on my face (obviously not for cellulite there LOL) and it DID tighten my skin.</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be very unusual,almost a ginger/cinnamon kind of thing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this light, minty gel since May 17th.</li>
            <li>it does work, if you have light cellulite.</li>
            <li>The biggest difference came when I coupled this with Advanced Clinicals Retinol Advanced Firming Cream (http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00DI9IIEK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3).</li>
            <li>I use Body Merry every morning after my bath and Advanced Clinicals every night before bed.</li>
            <li>but it feels great going on, like you can actually feel your skin tightening.</li>
            <li>* hopefully the Body Merry products will be available on Amazon.ca soon -</li>
            <li>The seller was nice enough to email shortly after receiving the product giving directions to get the best use out of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and tingly, almost like a muscle rub but not quite as intense.</li>
            <li>It has been awhile since I was comfortable wearing shorts.</li>
            <li>I use this when I get out of the shower and use a light amount and massage in an upward motion as it says on the box .</li>
            <li>The customer service is fantastic, and followed up to see if I was liking the cream.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the tingling sensation you will feel when you apply the Gel-cream to you skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one of those reviewers who is going to lie because I got a free product.  </li>
            <li>One of these are the pesky lumps, bumps, and areas that are just not as smooth as when we were in our hey-days.</li>
            <li>It has a light minty fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it has no artificial smell or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is a light gel with a medicinal herbal based scent that warms once it is applied</li>
            <li>My cellulite is still visible, and I didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for, but I like that my skin felt smooth.</li>
            <li>As the name suggests, it’s a gel-like cream that might not look too attractive when you open it and see what it looks like, but don’t be put off because of that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I have finally found a semi-permanent solution to my problem.</li>
            <li>I defiantly know that I don’t want cellulite making its way on my body &amp; if it does I want a way to fight to win my body back!</li>
            <li>Smooth skin.</li>
            <li>jiggled\\&quot; LoL I am almost done my bottle but will be buying next time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to contribute to a company that really cares about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li>received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li>but I was surprise how light the scent was it did not bothered me.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a week, so no noticeable results yet, but it smells great</li>
            <li>She also asked if I wanted to try another jar for free.  </li>
            <li>The company did offer to provide another bottle, free of charge, but I opted for the refund which they processed immediately.</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>I got this for free to review from Tomoson.</li>
            <li>and no I didn&#x27;t get a free jar of this for a review.</li>
            <li>This cream works great overall.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily which makes it easy to get dressed quickly after applying it.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is the best fast acting one I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I loved it, definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This cream that I have been using is working good so far not complaints.it tightens(firms)</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a repeat customer so this really made me love the product even more.</li>
            <li>So far, so good .....</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, seen a difference after the first week</li>
            <li>This would have been good information to be aware of as the first time I applied</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>it nice to go to bed with such a nice aromatic ambiance.</li>
            <li>We are still in the courting phase, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>She looks forward to more good results and a younger youthful look.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a week so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me.</li>
            <li>My main reason for reviewing is that this is an outstanding company!</li>
            <li>Very unique and well worth it.</li>
            <li>Cool gel that easily rubs into the skin and has a tingling feeling that lasts, which I like.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Khushboo!!!</li>
            <li>Feels very fresh, but have not seen an improvement......</li>
            <li>The best time to apply the cream is after a shower, reason being is your skin is clean and rid of dirt and dead skin.</li>
            <li>Works great :) all that baby fat skin hanging to almost gone been using for a week since its a small jar will be ordering more</li>
            <li>The light weight is due to the light consistency of the gel, which I think is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily &amp; dries quickly, so you can get on with your day.</li>
            <li>First off, I love how light it is.</li>
            <li>, and I&#x27;m sure with continued consistent use I will be dimple free with the aid of this product</li>
            <li>The fragrance fades quickly and can easily be worn anytime, it won’t interfere with your cologne or perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one goes on easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Is very very liquid and did not have a protective layer on top, so when i opened  spilled all over me.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li>I need to use this 6-8 weeks and will leave more information after that time but so far love the special and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The cream has a smooth consistency and absorbed fairly easy.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t disappeared completely but pretty soon I&#x27;m sure it will be history!!</li>
            <li>My experience with Body Merry cellulite defense gel-cream has been a unique one.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what results I get with continued use.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but well worth it to do before heading to the beach!</li>
            <li>it still felt/feels like ice n hot, but it was a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>Combat cellulite with our unique Caffeine + Retinol + Seaweed formula.</li>
            <li>This was a really unique product to try.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li>it smells funny and feels more like a muscle rub.</li>
            <li>After all, true beauty is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I have seen that it gives results, it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li>It has a cooling/tingling sensation that is quite significant.</li>
            <li>Feels cool for awhile after and skin feels incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>I think that for better results, you should massage or brush the areas first and then apply this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream so much!</li>
            <li>But as I was continuously using it more and more, I definitely noticed that my skin WAS smoother and tighter and held in more moisture for longer.</li>
            <li>After my first review I said I would need more time with the product...</li>
            <li>Nervous to try it again, but excited bc</li>
            <li>I was excited like a kid in a candy store.</li>
            <li>The gel-cream has a menthol smell and its pretty refreshing when you apply it.</li>
            <li>and I work out every day, eat pretty healthy and drink lots of water.  </li>
            <li>Im pretty sure thats helping.  </li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t know how else to describe that ) &amp; refreshing on application, I liked it so much that I wanted to apply it on my whole body but stopped myself from doing so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product although I&#x27;m not sure which one is more effective: this cream or the cellulite massager that I bought along with this item.</li>
            <li>Another thing that might not be your favorite, at first, is the scent.</li>
            <li>The feeling is even more intensified if your skin is hot from a shower beforehand.</li>
            <li>think that Body Merry’s Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is an incredibly unique product.</li>
            <li>As an avid blogger, I was able to review this product.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to sure of Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream at first</li>
            <li>Now I look forward to that fresh smell and cooling tingle feeling as it absorbs into my skin!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I was so excited to get started on this product, however after 3 months of using I didn&#x27;t see drastic results.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream and recieved this on February 8 2015 and was so excited.</li>
            <li>I think the best thing for cellulite and better looking legs is hard work - eating right and exercising.  </li>
            <li>I loved everything about this cream, most especially that it dramatically softened my skin right away.</li>
            <li>This customer is definitely not disappointed, and by the way I was expecting something stinky, and actually it does smell quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>it would be nice if the jar was bigger or if they gave more product in the jar....</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT--love the fact that all of the ingredients are natural and you can actually feel it working.  </li>
            <li>and since I didn&#x27;t get to really try the cream out, I was able to get a replacement for free.</li>
            <li>I ordered my second jar to get my legs nice and smooth, and I have no doubt this product will do the job!</li>
            <li>I quickly forgave myself for this when within days my husband commented on how smooth he noticed my legs were.</li>
            <li>so I was fascinated how easy it is to use - just seconds of massaging for it to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>but I only use once a day, even though the smell is not bad, in fact is kind of refreshing</li>
            <li>I liked it so much i purchased another right away.</li>
            <li>First thing you notice with this is the overwhelming menthol smell, its like a super cough drop.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of a special friend of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Right away, it feels like it goes to work!</li>
            <li>You feel it working right away!</li>
            <li>It looks visibly smoother picture in right is with this cream!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and experiencing this product for myself, I think the amount of time it takes for the gel to work its magic depends on the severity of the cellulite (ie places where my cellulite was less lumpy are completely smooth now, while my more lumpy bumpy areas are smoother but it is taking more applications before it is completely smooth).</li>
            <li>It is however very sturdy, light weight &amp; therefore travel friendly, I can easily slip it into my</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this so much and very anticipated to see what lies ahead!</li>
            <li>I want to try this natural and organic anti cellulite cream because all the ingredients are amazing: caffeine, retinol and seaweed.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing is, Body Merry offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee - if you don&#x27;t like the results you get, just contact them</li>
            <li>I liked the way it felt haven&#x27;t been able to see any long term effects from it though.</li>
            <li>I will probably repurchase this in order to try for a full 2-3 months before making up my mind.</li>
            <li>Retinol gives cool effect, but it feels like burning)))</li>
            <li>cool burning.</li>
            <li>I know it won&#x27;t cool to death my cellulite</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I find that after a full day, when my legs are sore using this its like hitting two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li>Their labels always have the container expiration date that I love so much.</li>
            <li>and I have to say so far I am loving</li>
            <li>I am impressed to say the least.</li>
            <li>Honestly, not that impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps the appearance of my legs and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels really neat and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>It stays cool for awhile</li>
            <li>Used it for a full month and saw no difference.</li>
            <li>I was surprised I liked this product.</li>
            <li>but I appreciated the impact it had on my mind when I needed it most.</li>
            <li>Has a cool enlivening feeling.</li>
            <li>It leaves a cool minty tingling on your skin</li>
            <li>Once applied I could feel the tingling from the menthol, and made my skin feel cool for about an hour afterwards.</li>
            <li>but then a sweet under note starts to come through</li>
            <li>I really like the tingling sensation :)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a cool, soothing feeling you get after you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li>I paid full price for it</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of the cream but haven&#x27;t noticed much for results.</li>
            <li>However, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li>if any creams really got rid of cellulite they wouldn&#x27;t be a price most if us can afford or on amazon.</li>
            <li>I like the sweet minty smell.</li>
            <li>I wanted to concentrate on just one area so that I could try to use the product for a full month to try to get the full effectiveness of it</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides that I loved the warming feeling it left after applying.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give a full review.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional blogger that writes my own opinions.</li>
            <li>It eaves my skin cool and tingling for about 15 minutes, but I can dress immediately.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Very minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li>and it goes on cool</li>
            <li>Thanks for your recommendations for use and how to apply this refreshing cream.</li>
            <li>because I know they&#x27;re all good with helping to reduce the look of cellulite and tighten the skin you definitely have to drink a lot of water exersise and watch what you&#x27;re eating .</li>
            <li>I like the smell and the cool feeling on my thighs.</li>
            <li>Can I get the full list of ingredients?</li>
            <li>The cream remains cool even after the massage, so you don&#x27;t feel overheated.</li>
            <li>and I have really been pleased with their quality and results.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I should Have Received A Full Jar.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it just feels good to put on.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it just feels good to put on.</li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s not a bad cream</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad either.</li>
            <li>i love this so far!!!</li>
            <li>It will be really great in the summertime when it is super hot outside</li>
            <li>you open the jar, it has kind of a strong describable smell.</li>
            <li>Even if I never notice a reduction in cellulite, this firms and moisturizes better and faster than most skin firming creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and at a lower price than many other brands.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>I have to give it some time to work, but the smell is relaxing to me even though it is strong when it&#x27;s first applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>And if you are anything like me and think about our furry little friends when shopping for beauty products then you&#x27;ll be happy to know that they are a cruelty free company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad feeling; I kind of enjoy it actually</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad feeling; I kind of enjoy it actually</li>
            <li>exercise more, drink even more water, and cut down on even more sugar....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything in 2 1/2 weeks that I would say is exceptional nor do I expect a miracle in that short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I also feel more toned and the texture of my back thighs looks better.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;I am super picky about products</li>
            <li>That being said, I can&#x27;t say that I see a tremendous or even the slightest bit of difference in my cellulite on my thighs.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely feel more confident about showing my legs after using this product.  </li>
            <li>If I had time to use it daily, I&#x27;m sure I would see even a greater result.  </li>
            <li>Drys super quick as well.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really quickly, you can put your clothes and go out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves a warming sensation that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>Cellulite Cream absorbs into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The cellulite on my upper thighs and upper arms looks so much BETTER!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells like Vics when rubbing it on, but that quickly resolves.</li>
            <li>The gel-cream absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured out really quick  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy and seems to absorb quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>, i will be ordering some more in the future:)</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly like a gel, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.ld never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>I am also 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>The cream disappears and dries on the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I love putting it on right after I get out of the shower, it just feels so refreshing because the cream is infused with a refreshing 100% natural ‘mint - green tea - lime’ fragrance, LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>I love this high quality product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this gel-cream very much</li>
            <li>:) forgot to take photo but will do so next time thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>This product came very fast and works so well !</li>
            <li>it very much!</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a skin massager with comfortable pressure as I have been told that you need to stimulate the cellulite to drain away, and this coupled with the activating ingredients in this cream its really working!</li>
            <li>and this is my very first review I&#x27;ve ever written on here.</li>
            <li>And, I was very interested in the reviews.</li>
            <li>My cellulite is less noticeable and I for sure am buying more!</li>
            <li>I have tried other cellulite creams, but I think this one is the most powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li>since I been using this I have seen a great difference and its been less than a month.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes I experienced this cool tingle.</li>
            <li>Strong smell &amp; really saw no difference</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and very pleasant--it has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li>Seller was kind enough to send me a full- refund for the item.</li>
            <li>I found that it absorbed really quickly into my skin and did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>but since I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results I figure I&#x27;ll wait until I am financially able to buy 2 or more jars &amp; then give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more!</li>
            <li>but it really works well!!</li>
            <li>This really works!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many creams and gels since I was 15 years old!</li>
            <li>I can see a very visible difference!!</li>
            <li>It really work !!</li>
            <li>This gel-cream really works!!</li>
            <li>I finished my first jar and my cellulite is almost gone!</li>
            <li>In the past, I have used Niviea Cellulite Be Gone and have received more consistent and successful results.</li>
            <li>After using this product twice a day I saw results within the first week!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered a second jar to have on hand because I already love this product!  </li>
            <li>For one the first thing I noticed was the scent!</li>
            <li>so far it is good, but to new to tell if the product will work or not.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight and refreshing gel-cream as the consistency of this gel-cream is designed to glide over large areas.</li>
            <li>I think anyone who has ever used IcyHot on an more sensitive area knows exactly what I am talking about!  </li>
            <li>Hope it works as I really was impressed with the customer service and so hard to find that today buying online.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to smooth out the skin’s surface very well.</li>
            <li>I think if you use this after a workout it can be very soothing while also helping to smooth out your cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>can be very soothing while also helping to smooth out your cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would feel amazing on your lower back if you had cellulite there.</li>
            <li>Tris is a great product, I started using it few days ago</li>
            <li>This has been an amazing addition to my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Tomoson.com, I received a  container of #BodyMerry Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream for free to test out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much like their moisturizer, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent</li>
            <li>I was quite happy with the results after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>but this is worth it.</li>
            <li>I excercise frequently and eat healthy</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  </li>
            <li>Some of my bigger lumps already appear to be more filled in.</li>
            <li>the tingle is also pretty cool.</li>
            <li>and I definitely see a lot of improvement in the appearance of my skin, as well as a nice tightening.</li>
            <li>Try it, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>So far i love it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it sure does help minimize the appearance and it makes me skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like sort of a fresh sea breeze scent and my  dimples</li>
            <li>so I can really come back and give a fair review.</li>
            <li>So far I like it much better than SHESSENTIALS Cellulite Cream with Retinol and Caffeine Skin Tightening and Body Firming Treatment.</li>
            <li>I am 32, and have struggled with cellulite most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>They actually reached out to me after about 3 weeks of use to see how I liked the product.  </li>
            <li>I found it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>well worth the weather we are having.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the try.  </li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite cellulite cream.  </li>
            <li>I know you can&#x27;t simply rely on a cream but have to put in your own work as well..</li>
            <li>Besides leave a relax and fresh it after use it.</li>
            <li>I love that it is also natural and organic, made in USA</li>
            <li>So I ordered it and have been using it for a couple weeks now and have had kind of mixed thoughts.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>I am going to see if once a day is worth the price.</li>
            <li>After applying to those pesky cellulite areas (ladies, you know where), the warmth and feel as it works and the aromatic therapy is, to me, worth using.</li>
            <li>and if provides any benefit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>Always worth a try for even the smallest improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says she is starting to see results from this, so she is happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>You are to rub the cream into your problem areas in circular motions until it is absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>With that said any and all opinions mentioned above are of my own and have not been altered in any way, shape or form.</li>
            <li>I will just continue using this and see how effective it is even when one forgets about exercising or forget the daily routine.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth trying and seeing what it does for you.</li>
            <li>I liked the product enough to order it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>You just rub it on in a circle motion until it is absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth it.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;</li>
            <li>You just rub it on until it is absorbed into your skin</li>
            <li>However,  since I paid about $30 for it, I wanted to get my monies worth and find a way to use it.  </li>
            <li>It smells like menthol and has a distinct &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, none of us are getting any younger, that&#x27;s why I was thrilled to try the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream from Body Merry.</li>
            <li>thing I love about this is that it is free from harsh chemicals, making it better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money - order</li>
            <li>I love this product so far.</li>
            <li>So I do think this is worth a try if you are looking for something to improve the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>So I do think this is worth a try if you are looking for something to improve the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>Works Great Absorbs Quickly No Sticky Feeling!</li>
            <li>but I can say that some other more affordable products had better results.</li>
            <li>This gel-cream also does a great job at quickly absorbing into your skin and it leaves no greasy residue like other gel-cream</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and subsides relatively quick (or i sleep off before i realize and wear it at nights</li>
            <li>The jar was going pretty quickly, so I bought another two jars after i read that it needs to be used twice per day and results will show in 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strange to be completely honest LOL.</li>
            <li>The first was very effective in making my cellulite less noticeable.</li>
            <li>The cream smells good not like other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell and how the cream felt on, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it due to no results.</li>
            <li>it has in it a lot of other ingredients that will work to help you fight the good fight agents that unsightly</li>
            <li>Its not especially unpleasant, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t work overnight, I have noticed a big improvement - most specially on my arms.</li>
            <li>kept eating right</li>
            <li>I am going to be right for the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a matter of finding that right product.</li>
            <li>it was right before bed.</li>
            <li>It seems they cant get the format right.</li>
            <li>When I did smell it I could tell right away there was menthol in it.  </li>
            <li>price was just right</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Since no body in there right mind would want cellulite to begin with.</li>
            <li>Can put on pj pants right after and within a couple minutes</li>
            <li>First use and I am already loving it, I can&#x27;t wait to see final results!</li>
            <li>The smell is strong if you are sensitive to that!</li>
            <li>The skin is a very large and porous organ.</li>
            <li>most women, I have some “extra baggage” from when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>The smell is different - not bad or good, but it does smell slightly of Vicks (which I actually love) which I attribute to the menthol.</li>
            <li>lol you forget to apply everyday like need be) and it&#x27;s already doing wonders!</li>
            <li>That is true that I don&#x27;t have a very severe cellulite problem.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky and well absorbed so it does not bother me in the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just an intense cool feeling.</li>
            <li>you get past the appearance and smell, this product is actually really great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gel-cream consistency is designed to spread over large areas and it absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re like 40 or more lbs overweight, and live a predominantly sedentary lifestyle with cellulite over most of your thighs and stomach, this cream is not going to be a long lost miracle worker for you.</li>
            <li>I just started using this, I&#x27;m actually laying in the bath right now trying to get the gel off of me and to warm up, the tingle feeling was too intense...</li>
            <li>It took me a little while to get consistent about applying 2x a day, but once I did I saw an amazing difference!</li>
            <li>And then enjoy the beauty of your new, non-dimpled skin.</li>
            <li>However I am certain that it has helped!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in &amp;#34;cellulite&amp;#34; bit then I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long</li>
            <li>I put this cream on my upper thighs and it blends in quickly, doesn&#x27;t have a distinct smell and will show results!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back in a few weeks, hopefully with Happy results!</li>
            <li>So far, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about what I&#x27;ve tried (vitamin C serum, cellulite gel-cream, and stretch mark cream).</li>
            <li>I tried a few different options that I picked up from the drugstore upon recommendation from some of my mommy friends, but was never that impressed with the results, so that&#x27;s the mind frame I went into this review with and to</li>
            <li>The color is a light tan color as well which I can only say did seem to fit well with the scent.</li>
            <li>It came super fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I tried this because of the many great reviews, but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li>In terms of the cream absorbing into the skin it does quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like how quickly this cream dries.</li>
            <li>I massage the nice smelling gel into my skin and let it dry and then use a massager for 5 or 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait, &#x27;til I had used half of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Too be fair</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and phthalates that I need to worry about touching my skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs super fast into my skin as well</li>
            <li>It absorbs super fast into my skin as well</li>
            <li>so very much</li>
            <li>The gel is very very silky..</li>
            <li>On its own (with that nubby little massager) it didn&#x27;t seem spectacular, but this cream compared to FatGirlSlim and EVELINE COSMETICS SLIM EXTREME and the machine resulted in fabulous results.  </li>
            <li>When beginning to use this product it has a very intense ice n hot feeling</li>
            <li>Within first week or two.</li>
            <li>90 days is more than enough time to see results.</li>
            <li>In My Skin Within The First Two Weeks.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I bought two different creams for better result.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for one week, after my workout at the gym, it has a refreshing tingling sensation immediately after application</li>
            <li>and it definitely makes it look better.</li>
            <li>it does take up to 8 weeks of consistently applying this product to see results</li>
            <li>First off, I can&#x27;t say this works (yet)</li>
            <li>so it smells a bit like icy-hot (it also gives that warm/cold tingling feeling for the first 2 minutes or so).  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a fan of thick creams because of the length of time it takes the product to soak into the skin, this could be a great option for you in that regard.</li>
            <li>I noticed first upon removing the cap was the scent.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>and my skin was much smoother - yay!</li>
            <li>I could see the difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>Imagine my excitement to find that it worked and my thighs were getting their sexy back.  </li>
            <li>and i can see more like feel my skin different.</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference in the first week.</li>
            <li>The only thing is just my son &amp; husband  ,doesn&#x27;t like the smell, I love the smell</li>
            <li>Most likely won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product (March 1st), so it has not had enough time to work its magic.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and plan to purchase more once current supply is depleted</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t magic, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely being buying more of this.</li>
            <li>This gel-cream is also cruelty free and made with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>You should also notice a difference within the first week of using.</li>
            <li>First I must comment on the customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so pleased overall.</li>
            <li>I did not use it consistently</li>
            <li>The first time that I tried this product, it had an immediate cooling sensation, almost a burning.</li>
            <li>I am able to wear a regular swim suit this year instead of a swim skirt!</li>
            <li>I just received my order today and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Detailed, prompt and professional responses to my inquiries as well as follow-up.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will be keeping this product in stock at the house :)</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s pretty soon to write a review</li>
            <li>So, the stretch marks and cellulite struggle is real!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what exactly the ingredients are</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use this cream and update my review again later! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use this cream and update my review again later! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love the way you can actually feel it working after applying.</li>
            <li>I only use on my thighs because that&#x27;s where the most noticeable cellulite are.</li>
            <li>I was not wrong.</li>
            <li>This really worked for me!  </li>
            <li>Literally, the first time I tried it I felt like I was sitting on ice.  </li>
            <li>if you use it consistently you will see an improvement in your skins appearance.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 3 months since my first jar.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more to last me throughout summer!</li>
            <li>The first day, it was.</li>
            <li>And, as I said earlier, I love the fragrance of this product and</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Great product and I can slowly see results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already ordering 2 more bottles, So it can be my daily leg cream</li>
            <li>makes the stomach smaller, I love it</li>
            <li>and I have read that retinol and seaweed really do help the appearance of cellulite and this product has both!  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>REALLY HELPED ME!  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I still have a 1/2 jar left, but I am going to order more</li>
            <li>First, if used twice a day, I saw results.</li>
            <li>I got this to try at a dicount and let me tell you this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t exactly notice the improvement of cellulite</li>
            <li>The cream is lightweight and has light scent as well as being natural.</li>
            <li>this product leaves you feeling very invigorated!</li>
            <li>First time I used it I could feel it working</li>
            <li>Will be interesting to see if they experience similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be re-ordering :)</li>
            <li>First off, it is a gel cream and like what the company stated it is easier to spread around &amp; massage unlike creams.</li>
            <li>It is my first time to use a cellulite gel cream</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it exactly like they said so</li>
            <li>A word of caution - the first time I tried this product</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it kind of freaked me out…it felt a lot like ‘icy hot’, but without the hot.</li>
            <li>It has a fairly intense smell, but this goes away as the product is absorbed into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The menthol was a recognizable ingredient in the cream which provided a cooling sensation after application (something I really appreciated after taking a run!).  </li>
            <li>I first applied this gel I was in shock.</li>
            <li>I have found that I personally only have to use this product once a week for my condition, however you may need to use it more often or even daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference by the end of the first week.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t have any open scratches or sores on the area because if you do this will irritate it slighlly.</li>
            <li>after first week I felt my skin firmer.</li>
            <li>First in the morning when I get dressed and again at night after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin tingle for the first 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It resembles butterscotch pudding though haha!</li>
            <li>From the first time you apply Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream you feel it.</li>
            <li>It also has organic cayenne to help with circulation and reducing the storage of fat, it is made in the United States, it is cruelty free and contains no harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I definitely feel like my legs are looking better...</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the results yet, but I can tell you it feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like to apply this after a harm or hot bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>Im almost into my first month and already seeing results.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4-stars because although I love how it makes my skin feel, I&#x27;m not seeing any cellulite reduction and beyond any benefits I might see, it is supposed to be a cellulite</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the first jar I finally started to notice results as I did better at remembering to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product to further my results! :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>really was hoping it would!</li>
            <li>Although the price is slightly higher (I pay $39) for the product...</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this is my first review.</li>
            <li>I also cut off all sugars from sweets  and only consumed sugars from fruits as well as incorporated healthy eating and excersises</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working!</li>
            <li>At first I thought &amp;#34;Hmm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gooey and smells funny.</li>
            <li>After I apply the cream, I can notice a cooling sensation which is most likely from the mint.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin does indeed feel a lot smoother and on the surface I can definitely begin to see the texture of my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>After I apply the cream, I can notice a cooling sensation which is most likely from the mint.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin does indeed feel a lot smoother and on the surface I can definitely begin to see the texture of my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>I am noticing a difference, but you have to be consistent and give it time for you to notice the effect of it.</li>
            <li>It smells almost exactly like Origins Body Souffle cream which is to-die-for.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I wish it came in a larger size!  </li>
            <li>You can feel it tingling on your skin (which to me is a good sign) and after a few minutes you can no longer smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>, we love to present ourselves as that, great impressions mean a lot to me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and must say, the customer service of this company is also extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>I know not everyone wants to smell like mint, but I was so surprised that after putting the cream on, the scent was not there at all, even though in the box, the scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>These amazing cellulite-gel is also all natural and organic so there is not a single ingredient that will harm you.</li>
            <li>It seems much more effective that most of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I applied it to the underside of my arms and under my chin and both areas seemed more smooth and less flabby looking.</li>
            <li>Not as strong but similar the smell is worth it if it helps with the appearance of hail damage.</li>
            <li>I simply have not used it daily, but when I have, I have been pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this for 2 people due to the caffeine, retinol, &amp; seaweed as taught on the Dr. Oz show for cellulite, that are also key ingredients for the most truly effective wrinkle treatments.</li>
            <li>I did when exercising though, like more squats and other things, so I&#x27;m sure that just naturally helped.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything will really get rid of cellulite if you don&#x27;t also combine this with eating right and exercising..</li>
            <li>This unique natural formula has piqued my interest</li>
            <li>I have added this into my daily routine and am excited for the outcome!</li>
            <li>The skin is left with a nice tingling sensation and soft feel.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good gel-cream that definitely improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It did  absolutely nothing for me, I&#x27;m starting to think most of these reviews on here are made up by the sellers.</li>
            <li>packaging is good, simple &amp; practical in a white container.</li>
            <li>slowly but surely (which is a hell of a lot better than not at all)</li>
            <li>I have several beach vacations this summer and wanted to make sure I was beach ready.  </li>
            <li>The gel-cream is extremely smooth, when I applied on the skin I got an instant cooling sensation (extremely useful</li>
            <li>The Cellulite Defense Gel Cream is honestly not pretty to look at, it&#x27;s a little goopy and jiggly, BUT it feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have seen a pretty decent improvement!</li>
            <li>I started to use this product right away along with a cellulite brush and after about 9 days I looked in the mirror and noticed a huge difference in how my buttocks and back of my legs looked.</li>
            <li>but I like that too because it makes my skin tingle which makes me feel that it is having a positive interaction with my skin.  </li>
            <li>I did not see any positive results.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>First of all, compliments and thanks to the GM of this company.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely product that goes a long way and the fragrance is divine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a jelly-like consistency (&amp;#34;gel-cream&amp;#34;) and it rubs into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li>I feel most of the people who left such &amp;#34;wonder product&amp;#34; reviews got free products.</li>
            <li>I will be a long term customer with this company for sure.</li>
            <li>With the first two I did not use a cellulite massager, because of this did not see too much improvement.</li>
            <li>It is semi-permanent in the way that as long as I apply this as soon as the bumps reappear then I will have another week free from bumps!</li>
            <li>I disliked the smell, it was a real strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time and wow!!!</li>
            <li>Hands down, amazing.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a cellulite cream that contained the 3 key ingredients which fight cellulite: caffeine which  is the classic ingredient in cellulite creams because it immediately tightens the skin; retinol which boosts collagen and works even better when combined with caffeine;  and seaweed which literally absorbs fat from under the surface of the skin and diminishes cellulite in that fashion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell and tingly feeling takes a little getting used to, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this about a week and half now and you can tell an amazing difference in my leg and thigh area.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It works better when I dry brush and use post shower after my workout.</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I did kind of notice a slight difference</li>
            <li>The cream is easy to apply and only takes seconds to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to be super busy in the morning with my kids</li>
            <li>, I like the smell, but its so strong that I can only put it on and have it on for about 10-20 minutes away from my husband who doesn&#x27;t like it at all.  </li>
            <li>The jar is a good size so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>By the time I put my clothes on, a bulk of the strong odor has dissipated enough that I can&#x27;t smell it all day or annoy my co-workers with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and I feel it more effective after showering and massage.</li>
            <li>Twice a day on large areas.</li>
            <li>It could certainly be PART of a weight loss</li>
            <li>I loved so much about this one because I could actually feel it working long after I put it</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t see results so fast with a beauty care product but this one is amazing .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much tighter I am as a result, but it the ingredients are proven effective and it&#x27;s organic, so I hope over time into my second jar I&#x27;ll see better tightening.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised and pleased that this cream actually works!</li>
            <li>use this product only on the top half of my thighs since this is where I think my body has the most jiggle.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see a change in my upper thighs and butt, plus I love the minty-cool tingle that lets me know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m more likely to spread cream all over my buns and thighs than exercise daily - we shall see… Btw I live in Canada and right now I have to order directly from the Body Merry website by contacting the owner and making shipping/payment arrangements - it&#x27;s an easy process -  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, and I find that this lotion adds the right moisture without irritation.</li>
            <li>It has a strong menthol smell and an icy cool tingly feeling that took a little getting used to at first, but now I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>After 1 use I could tell a definite difference, now after 5 days of using twice a day, it has made my stomach a lot firmer and smoother, visually it has done an amazing job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too much of it at all....</li>
            <li>water and work out does really help to get results faster</li>
            <li>the cooling sensation is intense and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>therefore i don&#x27;t think this product really addresses that issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost everything against cellulite and I feel that with this product I really have a defense against cellulite.</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping us in this adventure.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>and they say to see real results from any type of serum, cream, oil, etc</li>
            <li>I find it very soothing</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>I find the sensation to be much like when you use a muscle rub.</li>
            <li>It’s starting to soften and smooth out some.</li>
            <li>This one really is working.  </li>
            <li>I am a mother of two and wasn&#x27;t too sure about this cream since it&#x27;s so unknown</li>
            <li>so they didnt have to spread out much product i literally recived this about a week ago</li>
            <li>and they really help you try to find a product that will work for you.</li>
            <li>I really feel like this product penetrates the skin and firms the tissue underneath.  </li>
            <li>I have given this product 5 stars because I really like the way it feels when I massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li>I like the way it dries fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much of them</li>
            <li>I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li>Got this cream out of desperation to try (I have tried so many and spent a lot of money over the years).</li>
            <li>and then the massager brush just solidifies the whole process.</li>
            <li>The menthol odor is just way too much for me to handle.</li>
            <li>USED THE WHOLE THING</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really saw a difference after using.</li>
            <li>This stuffy really works with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works at firming the areas you apply it at.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s working, I don&#x27;t really care for the medicated smell though</li>
            <li>I feel like I have been waiting my whole life to find this stuff</li>
            <li>SOOOOO MUCH BODY</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>The cream works very well</li>
            <li>cream smells like peppermint and spreads really well</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they were very considerate, and refunded me for the cream.  </li>
            <li>Literally felt like I was gonna get frost bite on my legs because the cooling/tingling feeling was soooo intense.  </li>
            <li>I could not stand that cooling sensation though , just way to intense.</li>
            <li>but I know the cream is really helping improve the appearance of my legs.</li>
            <li>This stuff does really work.</li>
            <li>So I really didn&#x27;t know if this would work for me because it was fat deposits-to my surprise</li>
            <li>Now in about a month in another bottle I will be dress ready.</li>
            <li>Feels like the product works as it tingles but not noticing much difference..</li>
            <li>The scent was intense</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen much result on my thighs yet</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>this combinated with the brush really works</li>
            <li>It works very well to make skin look healthier and toned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Who knows what really works</li>
            <li>Of course, I use massage and that must have much to do with it.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>It automatically absorbs to your body and it is an very FREEZING feeling.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well for me though.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>It smells like a muscle pain reliever gel and really tingles.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels going on.</li>
            <li>I find it is a very relaxing part of my night-time routine.</li>
            <li>Also fast shipping</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I have seen too much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Works very well with execersibg and dieting</li>
            <li>and you really want to know and feel it working</li>
            <li>Also, I use the whole jar.. waiting for results, but nothing happen...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that because the effects take awhile to wear off.</li>
            <li>It seems absolutely therapeutic to me.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have too much cellulitis and even when I use it every day</li>
            <li>I really would appreciate a refund on this.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work for me</li>
            <li>I will have to reorder another jar very soon.</li>
            <li>Soaks in the skin fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time to apply and the tingly feeling bothers me anyways.</li>
            <li>it has a very minty smell to it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels when I massage this cream into my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really luv it</li>
            <li>I truly wish it had worked like others have said it does for them, but I really saw no change.</li>

            <li>My skin looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>really good!With my experience</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stay if it works for cellulite</li>
            <li>Therefore, be very cautious about where the product is applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really thought after reading some of the reviews on here that this product would work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>And you don’t need to put a lot on because it’s very efficient and</li>
            <li>I was recently given the opportunity to try this product for free.  </li>
            <li>I thought absolutely nothing was happening, and then I waited... and waited... and waited.  </li>
            <li>i was really suprised.</li>

            <li>I real like this cream.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really jiggly in it&#x27;s container.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to use this product I wished the jar would be bigger and it could be available on auto-ship option in order to receive it on the monthly basis without a care in the world.</li>
            <li>Much smoother look to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t attack cellulite.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything and the item arrived damaged in the package.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>a day use it is going fast.</li>
            <li>the odor was too much for my husband at night.  </li>
            <li>but I personally think those are free product reviewers)</li>
            <li>while I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in cellulite, my skin is much smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>This is really a 5-star product to me.</li>
            <li>but this works very  well.  </li>
            <li>THANKS Body Merry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much improved</li>
            <li>however, I wouldn&#x27;t think, this is going to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much cellulite and when I use this cream it doesn&#x27;t look like it do anything to me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t seen any type of change.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t buy more immediately bc its not in the budget this month, but I will definitely be wanting more next month when I have some extra money to throw around.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t buy more immediately bc its not in the budget this month, but I will definitely be wanting more next month when I have some extra money to throw around.</li>
            <li>and there really is a difference.</li>
            <li>The texture really does feel like a gel cream as well.</li>
            <li>I have used almost the whole jar</li>
            <li>This stuff is just too intense for me.</li>
            <li>I am a young and healthy 20 year old who exercises frequently.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, not only can I see the cellulite disappear but the smoothness and quality of my aging 56 year old neck and chest has improved by 100%.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several cellulite creams and this one by far is my favorite</li>
            <li>It sucks that I really believed the ppl that said is good.</li>
            <li>First let me say WOW you can really feel this one work!</li>
            <li>All I can say from the initial use is that I feel like I&#x27;m submerged in Icy Hot...not so much in a good way either.</li>
            <li>Body Merry was nice enough to send me a jar of their Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream last month to try and review.</li>
            <li>just recently tried it an so far i love how it works</li>
            <li>I am a sucker for a good cocoa/shea butter smell.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>It smells like menthol but sinks easily into the skin and has an icy cool tingle to it which I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>This cream tightens skin gets rid of cellulite and bumps and even 9 year old scars!!!</li>
            <li>I can definitely feel it working after the first use!!</li>
            <li>However, exercise and eating right are also key to its success.</li>
            <li>After opening the packing you are now greeted with contents, which is creamy, bold and a little strong, but you know that is the caffeine and seaweed along with retinol ready to help with the battle a head that is cellulite.</li>
            <li>I do understand that it can take several months of consistent practice to recover adequate results.</li>
            <li>After my second child I started getting mild cellulite on my thighs and this product has helped so much!</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>The tingling wasn&#x27;t too much to handle and the other reviewers were right about the smell; its something you get used to and almost come to enjoy.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to see that the president of this company cares enough to follow up with a letter to tell you exactly how to use it to see the most benefit and if not happy how to contact them.</li>
            <li>MANY other products and</li>
            <li>and I am due to order more.</li>
            <li>Other than that I was pleased with the cream and plan on trying it again.</li>
            <li>, now i am going to use it on other areas just to make sure i dont get any there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Warning: when I say strong, I mean STRONG.</li>
            <li>For good measure, we’ve also added potent natural and organic ingredients such as algae extract, kelp, coconut oil, japanese green tea leaf extract and cayenne.</li>
            <li>I like that fact that It was easy to rub in like a gel, but like a cream in that it didn’t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I would use this, and highly recommend it to anyone that wants results.</li>
            <li>Usually I don&#x60;t do reviews, but this product is so amazing that I had to write about it.</li>
            <li>It is not a thick cream, but I like it because it does work well with the massager &amp; absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>my husband and i are going to order this product for the next 3 months to see the full 90 results.  </li>
            <li>i am pretty sensitive with smells but tolerate it if it works.</li>
            <li>The fragrance barely leaves a trace once fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it!</li>
            <li>This gel-cream is actually more of a gelatinous product that easily absorbs into skin - just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>A small amount spreads easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Using this with the Garcina Cambodia has really helped me with my new years resolution to help me take care and do something to improve myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the following combination has made a huge difference for me: following a low-carb, low-sugar diet, drinking a LOT of water, dry brushing my skin, strength workouts (FitnessBlender.com is my favorite), using this gel-cream twice a day, and a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>There is also slight lime fragrance that I love.</li>
            <li>I dont know how this stuff lasted more than a couple weeks with some people putting it over half their bodies like I read in the reviews.</li>
            <li>I dont know how this stuff lasted more than a couple weeks with some people putting it over half their bodies like I read in the reviews.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs into the skin quick enough and does not remain greasy or leave any residue.</li>
            <li>The texture is also different because instead of being a regular cream, it is more like a gel/cream mix consistency.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using a cellulite gel – cream, when I first applied the cream it instantly turned watery.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my thighs, rear, and stomach.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d imagine that someone using it daily (or twice a day, as suggested) would blow through this quickly.</li>
            <li>yes, because if you are like me and many others, things work differently for different people.</li>
            <li>Love it only using it for 2 weeks and my cellulite are disappearing getting a next bottle</li>
            <li>I do realize that these products not only take time but also require commitment, and I am satisfied enough to continue using it, alternating with another cellulite cream, plus massage and exercise and diet.</li>
            <li>As I start to get a bit older I seen some signs of cellulite sneaking up on my thighs and the backs of my arms.  </li>
            <li>done with second jar and have used more regularly twice per day.</li>
            <li>but I felt this product was good enough it deserved a few minutes of my time.</li>
            <li>I like to use this gel in the morning and evening, but mainly on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>It also comes in a decent sized 4 ounce jar.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve mainly been doing it before bed.</li>
            <li>I mainly have been using this on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li>I mainly have been using this on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first when I ordered it because most of the reviews stated that they received this for free to review.  </li>
            <li>The fantastic customer service was the icing on the cake-- not sure that I&#x27;ve ever had such attentive response to my communication from a vendor!</li>
            <li>#34;I can for sure see a different c e, not sure if  this will sound like a compliment, but you don&#x27;t have them dimple thing on your butt and legs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>(now mostly noticeable if I flex tight)</li>
            <li>I get more of a tingle feeling on my skin than a tight feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and have recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and have recommended to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to add this anti cellulite cream to your beauty routine because it helps minimize cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the product is all natural, organic, and free from harsh chemicals such as Parabens, Sulfates and Phthalates.</li>
            <li>Any remaining odor just smells like you have been at a high class spa!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel cream has a high caffeine content, 0.4% retinol, and three types of seaweed (algae extract, kelp, and dulse).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind the strong menthol scent (kind of cleans out the sinuses) or even the cold butt cheeks afterward.</li>
            <li>I apply this directly after showering and I think that helps it but other than that I love it and</li>
            <li>The jar is so small and the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>I need to use it a little more to know how well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely gone!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>maybe it works better if there is just a little cellulite.</li>
            <li>Also I have used almost every &amp;#34;Firm&amp;#34; cream or treatment there is on the market and haven&#x27;t had nearly the results as this Product!!</li>
            <li>This product is not only good for its stated purpose, but also generally firms skin in other areas, like the neck.</li>
            <li>Exercising helped minimize a little, and tanning helped hide, but nothing was getting rid of the cellulite until this product. :)</li>
            <li>It has a decent smell and a tingling sensation that makes you assume it is working, but overall it really isn&#x27;t worth the asking price as it stands.</li>
            <li>I think this really works just make sure you use a little amount because this will give you the burning sensation!</li>
            <li>Tub went very quick than any other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical with this product because it does sound too good to be true, but even after a few days I see my skin feeling and looking tighter and more firm, DEFINITELY recommend!!</li>
            <li>Like every other Body Merry product I&#x27;ve purchased, the results have been very noticeable and super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed as I get older, the back of my thighs tend to show some cellulite issues, and I wanted to find just the right product to help with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell when you smell it straight out of the container, smells of soft Cologne with a hint of menthol.</li>
            <li>Directions are to apply 2X a day, preferably on dry, clean skin.</li>
            <li>My body really responds well with I natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I’m very self conscious of cellulite on my arms.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to smell like an old woman who has muscle pain.</li>
            <li>gross\\&quot; but I WAS WRONG LoL...</li>
            <li>My thighs are more firm</li>
            <li>but I assume it&#x27;s normal  </li>
            <li>Was able to notice a difference after using a few times.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I use it for a few more months I might see a difference.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to warm myself up for at least 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>A few minutes after applying you will feel a cooling sensation that lasts for the better part of an hour.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this for more than a few days</li>
            <li>They always say they can do the same things, but rarely can,</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve tried lots of different ones and this is the only one that has ever actually worked!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is interesting to see the results after a few weeks</li>
            <li>You put the cream on, and it takes an instant for it to be completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>Warning the cooling sensation is intense after the first use, but you get used to it after using daily.</li>
            <li>Does run out pretty fast when using twice daily.</li>
            <li>Normally I like things with menthol smells</li>
            <li>I have also been using it on my arms, as I want it to be more firm.</li>
            <li>I rarely do reviews, but this stuff actually works!</li>
            <li>received one of the products mentioned above complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care- this stuff seriously works like MAGIC!  </li>
            <li>The tingle of the menthol kept me up more than half the night!</li>
            <li>My butt and thighs look a lot more even and a lot less saggy!</li>
            <li>have tried other Body Merry products and loved them, so I tried to have an open mind when starting this about a week ago.</li>
            <li>However, I understand that certain lotions react differently for certain people</li>
            <li>i started working out eating right but felt it wasnt enough for my cellulite</li>
            <li>Got back to me right away.</li>
            <li>Right after application, you begin to feel an instant tingling.</li>
            <li>I do NOT use it twice a day, only once right after a shower &amp; still see results.  </li>
            <li>Cellulite no longer visible on back of my right thigh and</li>
            <li>SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li>are becoming less visible, I think..</li>
            <li>It feels smoother now and stretch marks are becoming less visible.</li>
            <li>They are greasy, sticky, and you have to wait a certain amount of time before you feel comfortable (i.e., dry) enough to put clothes on.</li>
            <li>These creams help reduce the appearance along with your new lifestyle.</li>
            <li>My family asked me if I bought a new perfume or something?</li>
            <li>This seems to be a relatively new product, with a diligent customer service, eager to hear from us regarding the effectiveness of the product, which is another plus.</li>
            <li>: You&#x27;ll notice a huge improvement in your skin, even after the first time you apply it, I&#x27;m just not sure you&#x27;ll notice any change in cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have to say that as far as the appearance of cellulite, this product so far has not made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>(I cracked the window in our bedroom for a few minutes while I put it on), if you&#x27;re more sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It feels like tiger balm once you apply on your body, gets pretty hot &amp; icy.</li>
            <li>At first, the Icy Hot freaked me out</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dries while I put on my makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much makeup).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, but my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>I also commend this company for using all natural ingredients that has worked very well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>#34;firming&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after applying this product, I feel a strong cooling sensation with a slight tingle.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to just about anyone, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a menthol smell for the first hour or so after use!</li>
            <li>I imagine that if I took jello and mixed it with pudding it would look very much like this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>When I finished my first jar, knowing both customers and company indicated it may be weeks before I&#x27;d see a difference in the actual cellulite, I put in a new order for two jars.</li>
            <li>Rather than changing the cellulite slowly but steadily over time, this new cream changes it more visibly faster</li>
            <li>Cellulite Defense Gel Cream by Body Merry is not the first cellulite cream I have tried and this may just be my last.</li>
            <li>After only one week, I see a VERY NOTICABLE difference!</li>
            <li>This is a review on the delivery and first impression only.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Not long enough to see any true results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still so surprised it worked so well!</li>
            <li>At first I used it daily, but now I use it two or three times a week for maintenance.  </li>
            <li>Healthy people who are awakened avoid Japanese product due to severe radioactive pollution...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing results, interested in seeing what occurs after the 2nd</li>
            <li>I am a big skeptic when it comes to these things, but this really does work!</li>
            <li>didn’t notice everything completely go away, after all, people don’t sell miracle in a bottle for THAT wish!</li>
            <li>For the first time in years I have seen some bounce back in my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time after my shower and have continued to use after my shower daily.</li>
            <li>So I noticed a difference as well, smoother for sure, not sure on the toning aspect.</li>
            <li>..... it&#x27;s not enough a jar of cream to see the result but used consistently with diet and exercise should work</li>
            <li>I am no longer self conscious about the backs of my legs when taking the kiddo to the pool!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m losing a bit of weight (a pound or two) by eating, small, and healthy</li>
            <li>but my skin is more firm as well!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin, especially legs, look so much smoother!</li>
            <li>have used the product almost consistently every day (ONCE A DAY) only two times twice a day.</li>
            <li>It is a slow and subtle process, but I already feel much more confident about my exposed legs when I go swimming!</li>
            <li>The smell does linger in the air for a little while after applying, but (thankfully) the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to stay strong on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I have noticed less cellulite on the front of my thighs, not so much on the back even though I concentrate a little more on the back (mostly because it has been there longer than the cellulite on the front).</li>
            <li>The quick absorb and fresh 100% natural mint, green tea, lime fragrance is an added bonus too!</li>
            <li>I Have enough left for one more application but will probably not need anymore in the near future!</li>
            <li>For easy use (and not to tired out easily) I find that resting one foot on a bed or dresser and dragging it from back of the knee all the way up to the buttocks works wonders.  </li>
            <li>Almost like an intense Icy Hot or something.</li>
            <li>I think this also depends on how sensitive your skin is (my skin is very sensitive).  </li>
            <li>The cream feels very cold, like icy hot, make sure to rub it in good, I use a cellulite brush.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not a tiny girl, nor are most woman with a cellulite problem, so the jar doesn&#x27;t last long  </li>
            <li>The cream is infused with a refreshing 100% natural ‘mint - green tea - lime’ fragrance, that barely leaves a trace once fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(less if you are planning to use more on a larger area).  </li>
            <li>More or less the jar just needs to be bigger.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it was was kind of skeptical because it has a very medicinal smell to it, but after using it several times you get used to the smell.</li>
            <li>With this cream and a little exercise i am on my way to being cellulite free.</li>
            <li>Very light gel soaked right in and did not leave the weird sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>Besides not being very careful (I learned my lesson quick)</li>
            <li>It is for women who are relatively within their appropriate weight or BMI category, and live active lifestyles but just aren&#x27;t body builders and cannot change the low level to medium level cellulite they have.</li>
            <li>They check in with you frequently to see how the product is working.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, when I responed to an email, a real-life person got back to me within a couple of minutes!</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t tell if it works for cellulite reduction....</li>
            <li>He responded to my inquiries promptly and professionally.  </li>
            <li>but so far, I do like this product.</li>
            <li>This cream contains natural and organic ingredients including caffeine, retinol, 3 types of seaweed, and organic cayenne.</li>
            <li>And if you are looking for a product to try, I can&#x27;t see any reason early on not to try this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this as often as I should, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far here are my thoughts...</li>
            <li>I will say this: If you are sensitive to caffeine, do not use this product in the evening.</li>
            <li>It seems to work so far.</li>
            <li>So far I like this cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using for about three weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not heavy  </li>
            <li>so so far no signs  </li>
            <li>So far I like my results</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just really sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am just too sensitive to frangrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of natural and organic ingredients including 3 types</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t think it penetrated the skin to really do its job as I could feel the greasy film wash off my legs when I would take a shower the next day.  </li>
            <li>I could definitely be using too much but because of the substance it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I saw no difference in my body after using the whole tub.</li>
            <li>It was delivered in record time; therefore, its too early to determine if it&#x27;ll work for me at this point, but I will do a follow up {by the way</li>
            <li>I have seen a marked improvement in about 1 month.</li>
            <li>So far it appears to work.</li>
            <li>This made my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>my husband was completely offended by it mi</li>
            <li>Made my skin soft but still have cellulite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old mom of 2.</li>
            <li>wow .</li>
            <li>and I have not seen any results so far regarding my cellulite</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I am not saying that the cellulite is gone, but its a bit lighter now, &amp; my skin feels smooth &amp; firm.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even when not applied near those areas.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is very soothing and relaxing to bust out these</li>
            <li>everything absorbs into your skin almost immediately, leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It BURNS on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I know that there is no miracle cream out there that will eliminate cellulite completely.</li>
            <li>It does not make my bumps disappear completely but it smooths out my skin and makes the bumps go away for about a week or two.</li>
            <li>I really did not expect this to do anything, but it actually reduced the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>and I thought \\&quot; wow</li>
            <li>, I am sensitive to perfumes</li>
            <li>So far it works.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so soft and feminine</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this product worked for me.</li>
            <li>but,  so far NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 60s</li>
            <li>So far it does seem to be working.</li>
            <li>I was quite sceptical as to the effect this cream would have on my cellulite, and I have to say I am quite surprised.  </li>
            <li>So much so, that I would have considered using it in non-cellulite areas as a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleasantly surprised to see that this worked.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised to see that this worked.</li>
            <li>This gel cream is a natural and organic product.</li>
            <li>am 49 years old, 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; 127lb.  </li>
            <li>love all orgarnic ingredients in it, beside Japanese green tea:(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, smooth, and firm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few similar products and this one smells a lot better than most.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually have to put on a thick robe to warm up.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a creamy texture... like a thick lotion.</li>
            <li>I can tell is strong so a little goes looooong way!</li>
            <li>It is not at all sticky and just sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I did dry brush first then use a premier cellulite massager brush,</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other creams in the meantime, and none have been effective for me.</li>
            <li>Half Full</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too early for me to be able to tell how it works long</li>
            <li>gave the cream 2 stars because it really did not meet my expectations, although this is not due to the quality of the product but to the fact that I just didn&#x27;t have enough for a review.</li>
            <li>In just a few weeks I have seen a significant difference</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny--money well spent!</li>
            <li>I recently purshased my second jar because I saw a difference with the first one.</li>
            <li>When I first received the product, my initial thought was that it&#x27;s definitely lighter (in weight) than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I bought this and kept forgetting to use it at first, but now that I keep it next to the bathroom sink I&#x27;ve finally been remembering</li>
            <li>and I can definitely see the love handle area began to firm!</li>
            <li>I use this mainly on the back of my thighs and my buttocks.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product, six or seven weeks ago, I received the jar with the red label and white print.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for about this product is that it has some sort of mentholated ingredient in it, and when I first used it, I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the intense icy sensation on my body!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations of this product, especially since I&#x27;ve used creams from Body Merry that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>The new cream also seemed to have higher concentrations of whatever menthol-type agent was used, and it did not leave my skin&#x27;s texture as soft as the previous cream.</li>
            <li>Dont drag it back and forth as it is important that the skin is pulled back up</li>
            <li>My cellulite might not completely disappear, but it is much smoother than it has been</li>
            <li>Plus I like that its made in USA, cruelty Free, &amp; doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>As soon as it is applied you can feel the icy hot sensation working to get rid of the fat under the skin causing the cellulite.</li>
            <li>feels like you put icy hot on your body...</li>
            <li>It sort of smells like Icy Hot Cream, if you&#x27;ve ever caught a whiff of that.</li>
            <li>Sort of like icy hot.</li>
            <li>Honestly though my only complaint is the size of this product and that it does not come in a larger size!</li>
            <li>Product is gel-like and feels like icy hot when applied.</li>
            <li>Also it smells like vapor rub and feels like icy hot when rubbed in and has a tingly feeling for about 20-30 mins.</li>
            <li>so no worries you will not smell like icy hot all day .This</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for two weeks now, and while I haven’t seen mind-blowing results in this short time, I have definitely noticed my skin is a bit tighter and more firm.</li>
            <li>Like you covered your skin with icy hot.</li>
            <li>I believe it will last a long time, but when I get down to 1/3 jar, I will order more.</li>
            <li>She only weighs 114 pounds and all the extra pounds are right in the middle.</li>
            <li>Depending on how often and how much you use will determine how long it last and most times a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>Definitely cant buy a new jar every week</li>
            <li>I then received two different jars (with the new silver band on the front).</li>
            <li>This new cream&#x27;s impact on the cellulite is also different.</li>
            <li>Truly youth in a magic little bottle!!!</li>
            <li>It is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens and sulphates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like all our products, it is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a long time Amazon customer, this is first and only product I&#x27;ve ever reviewed.</li>
            <li>I have used the cream for six weeks now and have seen the difference on my skin, the elasticity, and the smooth feeling that I had been missing for quite a while are back.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight minty scent to it and makes your skin feel really fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t that I am not active.  </li>
            <li>this might actually work&amp;#34; thanks to the feeling it left after applying it on.</li>
            <li>I think my expectations were a little high with all the positive reviews that I had seen.</li>
            <li>This did a great job on the stomach and cheeks- smells bad though ( like Icy Hot)</li>
            <li>The major problem I have with this product though is the smell.</li>
            <li>I am not extremely overweight</li>
            <li>and I saw a major difference in my feet as well.</li>
            <li>I usually let it dry well before putting clothing over it to make sure the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>Tub was only half full of cream when I received it.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it has a tingling/warming effect to it, kind of like a muscle rub but as long as you don&#x27;t put too much on it doesn&#x27;t feel that bad.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, it&#x27;s had very minimal almost imperceptible results.</li>
            <li>The fragrance and the cooling action are a little offsetting at first but, after a day or two of use, I have become quite fond of both.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY reduced on the back of my left thigh.</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to the positive reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t generally believed that cellulite cream works</li>
            <li>so I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called cellulite and its not fun even though it isn&#x27;t deadly and most of the time we can cover it up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that is really long enough to see a real difference.</li>
            <li>Merry believes in their product but also offers 90 day money back guarantee if you do not feel like this product is working for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3X so far.  </li>
            <li>I made that mistake once and barely slept a wink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with cellulite on my legs since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li>O_o  </li>
            <li>It is the strongest stuff I&#x27;ve ever smelled and after just one use, it was enough to make me not ever want to get near it again.  </li>
            <li>and I do see the potential, therefore, I am willing to court this product a while longer to see if we can have a long lasting relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that I did not like was the scent which the company describes as &amp;#34;100% natural mint-green tea-lime&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I gave birth over 4 years ago and developed cellulite in the last couple years.</li>
            <li>Far, It looks the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times thus far.</li>
            <li>Because the cream is infused with a 100% natural ‘mint – green tea – lime’ fragrance, it smells exactly like that.</li>
            <li>It was such an Icy Hot feeling.</li>
            <li>There is a love and hate relationship with cellulite creams because many simply do not work.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin with a tingling feeling a few minutes after using which lasts for awhile but isn&#x27;t bothersome, just sort of fresh and minty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My experience with the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is one I can compare to starting a new potential relationship.</li>
            <li>cellulite cream contains active ingredients combined with Retinol, Caffeine, &amp; Seaweed, along with naturally potent ingredients such as Algae, Kelp, Coconut Oil, Cayenne &amp; Green Tea Extract.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s mostly from the cream or from a combination of other things.</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say that everyone has different skin types and it might work for other and some it might not.</li>
            <li>Some actually helped and other just smelled funny.</li>
            <li>No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s helped with my cellulite because I am also using other products as well...</li>
            <li>It gets hot burning hot then cold feels like a ice hot patch</li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t really smell much other than a menthol type scent but keep in mind it is not by any means overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d keep buying it just for the scent, but at my age (42) I can&#x27;t afford to mess around ;)</li>
            <li>So when you are putting this one on be very careful not to hit lady parts that will give you a surprise and a very cooling feeling for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I will tell you what though, use this cream, drink more water, start doing squats, and start dry brushing and you will see SERIOUS improvement with your cellulite.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help with cellulite but oddly enough, it did clear up a chronic rash of inflamed hair follicles I had on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>It smells like BenGay to me and I am only 27 years old so going out in public smelling like</li>
            <li>and as a busy mom, it only happens about 2 - 4 times a week TOTAL...</li>
            <li>and I have been using it near my inner thighs twice daily as directed.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting the cellulite cream to have such a weird texture and strong smell.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly with no product residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks a little funny</li>
            <li>I was a little iffy about trying it at first just because I do not have a problem with Cellulite yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost maybe 4/5 lbs since I started using this cream, not bc of the cream obviously, but it wasn&#x27;t like I had some major weight loss in a month to skew the results.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast, I got it in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I saw results very fast within a few days.</li>
            <li>:  Also be careful if you apply it too high up</li>
            <li>I’ve always been a bit over critical of anti-cellulite lotions and creams, as cellulite is hugely genetic and the only hope I&#x27;ve ever had to getting rid of it has been hard exercise.</li>
            <li>I have recently lost 35 pounds at the age of 57 &amp; was quite dismayed to find too much loose skin on my thighs, along with some residual cellulite on the top outer thigh area &amp; abdomen, so I had to try and find a little extra help to alleviate this unsightly looking loose skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very suprise with the result especially since I have used other oils and creams, some costing over $50.</li>
            <li>I actually am almost done with the jar, unfortunately, so it&#x27;s barely a months supply.  </li>
            <li>Not sure its worth the money.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel that the gel-cream is really permeating my skin and getting down into the cellulite.</li>
            <li>I think I might need to use it a little longer than a month in order to see any positive results.</li>
            <li>Obviously I was skeptical when I first got this product, but I don&#x27;t think many women would turn down the chance at getting those supposed</li>
            <li>and it really tingles a lot, so be careful not to touch your eyes or any other sensitive areas immediately after application.</li>
            <li>Over time, the cooling sensation has become less intense</li>
            <li>Skin feels much firmer and dimples are definitely less noticeable.</li>
            <li>You really can’t go wrong when theres added potent natural and organic ingredients like algae extract, kelp, coconut oil, japanese green tea leaf extract and cayenne involved.</li>
            <li>I am really a pretty lean person but am 55 years old &amp; much of my complaint is skin laxity</li>
            <li>Hmmm... been using this pretty regularly in the mornings for a few weeks</li>
            <li>This cream has not only significantly decreased the appearance of cellulite but my skin is super soft!</li>
            <li>I feel that the first order should last 8 weeks if that is how long the average person would notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I thought I put too much on but that feeling was still there even the next time when I used half the amount.</li>
            <li>The skin is smooth and firm, the crepe skin around the knees and on the buttock area are less visible if not invisible, the appearance of cellulite is fading as well.</li>
            <li>It sokes in quickly so you do not have to wait to put on your clothes, and you feel it working long after it has dried!</li>
            <li>Smells like icy hot or some other muscle pain cream...</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t think this would work but maybe help a little.</li>
            <li>Some other ingredients include coconut oil, sweet almond oil, vitamin e, organic cayenne, and Japanese green tea leaf extract.</li>
            <li>I apply it on the back of my legs and then really rub it in using circular motions with this little hand held rubber studded massager.</li>

            <li> LOVED this product.</li>
            <li> I just have this for 3 days, and it&#x27;s a good cream, does not make miracle, but reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> and it smells really good too</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream with Caffeine, Retinol &amp; Seaweed for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and the cooling feeling it gives is really nice.</li>
            <li> use good..</li>
            <li> It also is a good amount given.</li>
            <li> Product feels good on my skin....</li>
            <li> This is really good for toning</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 4 weeks and have seen good results.</li>
            <li> 5 star will be for a company that can figure out how to get rid of it for good &amp; prevent it from occurring.</li>
            <li> I will update my review with her thoughts once she has used the product for a good bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Body Kerry are good products for the price.</li>
            <li> That cooling sensation makes me feel so good, as if my fat is melting away.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> This company is also great as they sent a check-up email to see how I liked the product after I had it for a week or so.  </li>
            <li> Which is a good thing</li>
            <li> (I am in a good shape)</li>
            <li> So my nutritionist recommended CLA and also advised that the cream was good, so I started both.  </li>
            <li> this one feels good when you put it on</li>
            <li> when applied, just the sensation alone made me feel like it was going to do some good.</li>
            <li> It is good and asdescribed by the seller.</li>
            <li> I Will be ordering again, and want to try their stretch mark cream to see if it works as good as this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream contains ingredients that are known to be good for skin smoothing and reducing the look of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Smell is strong but i like that !!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and looking forward for more beautiful legs .</li>
            <li> Exceptional customer service on behalf of company also.</li>
            <li> , i read all these great reviews and even googles it saw on blogs and did more research found it on youtube even on instagram people loved it .</li>
            <li> Best of the best this is my second purchase</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent seller (very kind).</li>
            <li> you apply the gel is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It feels great after work out shower because of minty feel but not for winter, I am sure.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Vitamin C face &amp; neck moisturizer, which I can&#x27;t wait to try because, judging by the reviews and my experience with Body Merry, I&#x27;m sure it will work great.</li>
            <li> I can say that it feels wonderful on a hot day or after a good workout.</li>
            <li> It is more of a gel consistency which is great for distributing.  </li>
            <li> I am very sure that I am going to buy another cream</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results of this product.</li>

            <li> I am reading all of the Amazing reviews and am dumbfounded as to why I haven&#x27;t gotten any of what they are all raving about.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> After taking a nice warm bath, just apply this</li>
            <li> It is mine and yours may differ from my own.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice product to have.</li>
            <li> ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> I think the act of massaging the cream into my skin may be as effective as the product itself.</li>
            <li> nice cooling affect ..</li>
            <li> liked this item</li>
            <li> but this product is really nice</li>
            <li> the cream feels good on my body and it works better than I expect.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t seen results from this as of yet.</li>
            <li> Maybe if it lasted longer I would have liked it.</li>
            <li> I thought that was so nice</li>
            <li> Loved it and will have to order more.</li>
            <li> I used to work part time at a popular beauty store that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; and I tried everything there under their roof for stretch marks and cellulite.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice in my opinion and I like the tingle.</li>
            <li> so that was nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample ,review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Maybe now that it&#x27;s warm, I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
            <li> Just my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about and don&#x27;t know if they are more good for your body, or harmful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the tingling sensative is nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell though</li>
            <li> So I can say this is a nice product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> but I have to be honest</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be purchasing my own Body Merry cellulite cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like a eucalyptus smell to me.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice cream to use on your body.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, of course being a nice dad, I did.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin warm and tingly for about 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged too.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can not say I recommend it</li>
            <li> ; really does it the best.  </li>
            <li> However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have recently received a great Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream from Body Merry (at no cost) and I have to say I’m impressed.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice jar but still would have been nice to be in a pump style bottle.</li>
            <li> but I agree that all thoughts are my own</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> but I needed something to help with my butt and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to try Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My co-worker assured me it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> i loved the way the product felt after applying it feels minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am really loving this gel.</li>
            <li> Customer service is excellent, and I feel that they really care about the results  of this product.</li>
            <li> and when I gave my honest answer, I was told I was going to get all my money refunded.  </li>
            <li> but it feels nice.</li>
            <li> and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> well it looks like creamy tapioca and smells like menthol, and kind of comes out looking like paste but one that is gone within seconds into your skin i used it after my shower just on my calf that would not work itself out and wala all gone within a day of use and my walking</li>
            <li> I am loving this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> Well, Too Be completely honest...</li>
            <li> and I have three sweaters on and can&#x27;t get warm.</li>

            <li> I was sent the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream by Body Merry for free to test and give my honest opinion on.</li>
            <li> Skin has a warming sensation - hopefully I see some results :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to keep dragging one way UP.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Probably need to try more for longer to see some results,but I&#x27;ll save money.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference within 2 weeks (while maintaining a healthy diet and exercising).</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> this feels really tingly and great after shower.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better in the&lt;br /&gt;morning.  </li>
            <li> I hope to see more results with continued use of this</li>
            <li> I found it quite enjoyable, I’m the type of girl who could sniff chest rubs and muscle rubs all day.</li>

            <li> this product free of charge but that in no way effects my honest option.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have tried the Dior and Clarins.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>

            <li> it’s magic.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased twice just to make sure, and no results</li>
            <li> my legs look dramatically better.</li>
            <li> I used it on my arms and they look better too.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling sensation it leaves for 30-60 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for many of the products.</li>
            <li> I apply mostly in my stomach area.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more of a gel than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Come shorts season, I think I will be using this more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll soon have one of everything they sell :)</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s a lovely cooling sensation and it does seem to hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes skin feel all tingly after using.</li>
            <li> Item was ok.</li>
            <li> I think if I continued using the product I would see more results.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Also love the consistency of it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Overall great!</li>
            <li> I purchased Jergen&#x27;s Skin Tightening cream for under $8, and that gave my legs a better appearance.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two more bottles, as I will continue through summer.</li>
            <li> Communication with seller was also top notch.</li>
            <li> Use it in conjunction with getting your butt off the couch and doing some squats and you are gonna like what you see.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li> I love their guarantee and I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling feel,like it is working the minute you put the cream on</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> it has a tingling cooling sensation, I will start using it more often</li>
            <li> However, I can say that I love the way that it feels.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to work better</li>
            <li> I do however love the tingling menthol sensation on my skin and it relieves muscle aches after working out at the gym.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using my cellulite massager with the product as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> My dog decided to get into my cream, I wasn&#x27;t sure if she ate it or not</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I also ate healthy and worked out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure if I should give it four stars just yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so much better and goes on nonsticky.</li>
            <li> Love the cooling tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> ... wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li> and, sure, I still have cellulite</li>
            <li> This cream definitely feels wonderful, tingly from the menthol.</li>
            <li> The menthol smell dims to a nice light floral scent.</li>
            <li> The people who review with outstanding results are either paid or lying.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I just started to use it</li>
            <li> I find the cream makes it feel a lot better.</li>
            <li> I was also eating healthy, running and weight training.  </li>
            <li> and I had the slightest more confidence when putting on the bathing suit.  </li>
            <li> So hopefully more cellulite will disappear as i keep using it!!!!😀</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more like a cream.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an ok cream.</li>
            <li> I have already placed 2 more orders for this.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cream gel.</li>
            <li> It smells menthol-like, sort of like Ben-Gay, but I love the smell, it&#x27;s invigorating.</li>
            <li> Two days of walking/jogging makes my legs look better than a month of using this product.</li>
            <li> I am thankful I was able to recieve a  discount to review this product with my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> many users swear this worked wonders for them.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I really love the smell and</li>
            <li> and it really feels great.</li>
            <li> Just ordered two more jars.</li>
            <li> but it sure does reduces the appearance.</li>
            <li> keep using it forever !! :)))</li>
            <li> love the way it feels and there is no oily residue, the smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt in the slightest and makes you feel like it is even working better.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> but I helped diminish the appearance of cellulite but please workout and eat healthy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m assuming because my skin is more dense)</li>
            <li> but it is still prominent.  </li>
            <li> and he really enjoyed the cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping I could use this cream,due to the great reviews on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I could</li>
            <li> Within a week of use my skin was softer and more supple on my legs and derriere.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Been using for about 3 weeks in conjunction with cellulite massager brush, cardio and better eating and cellulite has reduced .</li>
            <li> It really works, I have lost inches off my waist and thighs and I feel great.</li>
            <li> Some people may love it though..</li>
            <li> but I love the way it feels</li>
            <li> It increases your blood circulation and skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I have some cellulite at the top of my thighs</li>
            <li> I am almost out of my existing jar and will be purchasing more this afternoon.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better to use it during Warmer days.</li>
            <li> It is helping :)  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream particularly on my love handle and</li>
            <li> I love this cream and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more in the bottle</li>
            <li> , I add some retina A and works even better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> They all use so many ingredients thats</li>
            <li> There are of course many creams and remedies for cellulite removal.</li>
            <li> Review: Seems to work but more time needed...love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> and I love, love, love the results.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is mostly on the backs of my thighs and bum cheeks, since I&#x27;ve been using the gel (it&#x27;s really more of a gel texture)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered two more jars and will continue to do so.</li>

            <li> I love the cooling effect of this cream...</li>
            <li> However, in order to be able to use something to thoroughly provide testing, it would require you to be able to use it.  </li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t see where I am able to contact the seller.  </li>
            <li> and I got two more for her.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams before, NONE of them have worked for me.</li>

            <li> I will most be buying this again</li>

            <li> Body Magic offered me the opportunity to try out their cream about a week ago</li>

            <li> BUT i love how it feels</li>
            <li> and i love the cooling sensation makes it feel like it may work by getting circulation going?</li>
            <li> Ive tried many ....</li>
            <li> I have used two different solutions for cellulite and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> I feel so much more confident when wearing skirts, shorts and dresses and not to mention tank tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will update this once I have finished this bottle and determine whether I will buy more.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I liked to tell myself that it was a great way to clear my sinuses</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I hope to see more improvement as I continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 star because it is one of the better creams I have used.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of menthol but not like what is in the cellulite cream</li>
            <li> I have tried this Cellulite gel for 2 weeks with eating healthy and drinking a lot of water.</li>
            <li> Giving the product more time.</li>

            <li> Cellulite Defense has all three of these ingredients and more.  </li>

            <li> Their cellulite cream contains caffeine, retinol, seaweed, organic cayenne, and more.</li>
            <li> But it has done enough to make me say I am impressed with the outcome so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably I have to use more to see some results.</li>
            <li> This stuff looks like pudding and feels like pudding, but it sure don&#x27;t act like pudding.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple more weeks.  </li>

            <li> Smells good and absorbs very well</li>
            <li> this really helped to me to removed my unneeded fats on my legs, this is really good.</li>

            <li> I like the pudding like consistency of the gel-cream, its easy to put on and rub into your skin.  </li>
            <li> This cream is easy to put on.</li>
            <li> For the best results, you should massage the cream onto clean and dry skin twice a day (morning and night).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with strong scents.</li>
            <li> I used it as instructed, twice a day and saw no difference, It does give you a strong tingly sensation which makes you believe it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong minty smell</li>
            <li> It does have a strong menthol smell to it, kinda like arthritis cream does</li>
            <li> Smells really strong to use in the morning before work.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was expecting some strong medicinal aroma.  </li>
            <li> so I loved it a very simple yet eye catching design.  </li>
            <li> But too strong not to be noticed.</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell like sandlewood insence or something</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a strong menthol smell</li>
            <li> I noticed that it has a strong minty smell that took me by surprise, after a while though it will vanish.</li>
            <li> It also has a strong scent that reminds me of Vick&#x27;s VapoRub.</li>
            <li> will say if you don&#x27;t like the strong scents of menthol you might not be a fan of the product.</li>
            <li> To me, it smelled medicinal and it was quite strong.  </li>
            <li> warning, this has a strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> The odor is strong</li>
            <li> I tought it might be too strong and people would wonder about it.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong mint scent, which you would have to give some time to get used to.</li>
            <li> I like the strong menthol smell...</li>
            <li> But the smell is way to strong.</li>
            <li> I use it with a strong Vitamin C serum  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like strong medicine.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product with all the good reviews</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this by far has to be the best ,seeing good results in only rwo weeks,love this product reasonable price..definitely ordering more</li>
            <li> Merry&#x27;s Cellulite Gel-Cream is the perfect combination of key ingredients in the right combination to target that stubborn cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, But Smells pretty strong, Kind of like bengay</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles after the first week or so of my use just so I wouldn&#x27;t run out of this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The cream is cool, minty and gives you a likable tingle on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feeling of the cream is cool and refreshing suits</li>
            <li> I love the cool tingle it leaves after applying.</li>
            <li> To be honest at first</li>
            <li> The gelee is smooth and spreads onto the skin really easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Ben gay</li>
            <li> i love the tingly feeling and the smell and even the texture it soaks up quickly</li>
            <li> I am in love and will now forever be a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not this super magic cream that erases all of your unwanted cellulite</li>
            <li> That’s obviously good news after all because you will not carry the same strong scent!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and will order more when I am out!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this cream very much!  </li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear dress like the other beautiful girls</li>
            <li> if you Google seaweed for cellulite control you will find that many beauty companies and jumping on that wagon because its very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using seaweed in a cellulite control cream is relatively new but very effective.</li>
            <li> Not for sure how long term, but as a easy quick fix, this has done great.</li>
            <li> As someone that love beauty products I was super excited to receive this Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream in the mail to give to a family member to try out.</li>

            <li> I see a huge difference in my thighs and butt area.</li>
            <li> now I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE FAN of Body Merry products, and couldn&#x27;t WAIT to try this cream based upon the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Diet, and exercise will make a huge difference too.</li>
            <li> Have I seen any huge results?</li>
            <li> Have I seen any huge results?</li>
            <li> and my skin feels smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have received this product for free for review.</li>
            <li> I didnt have much faith when i tried it out but to see how it works on cellulite is amazing.</li>
            <li> This cream feels and smells amazing and works very well.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to review.</li>
            <li> Really work, amazing product.</li>
            <li> Smells like a light blend of citrus and eucalyptus and peppermint - energizing, invigorating, caffeinated, etc.  </li>
            <li> However, for the heck of it, I also tried using it on my face (obviously not for cellulite there LOL) and it DID tighten my skin.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be very unusual,almost a ginger/cinnamon kind of thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this light, minty gel since May 17th.</li>
            <li> it does work, if you have light cellulite.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference came when I coupled this with Advanced Clinicals Retinol Advanced Firming Cream (http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00DI9IIEK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3).</li>
            <li> I use Body Merry every morning after my bath and Advanced Clinicals every night before bed.</li>
            <li> but it feels great going on, like you can actually feel your skin tightening.</li>
            <li> * hopefully the Body Merry products will be available on Amazon.ca soon -</li>
            <li> The seller was nice enough to email shortly after receiving the product giving directions to get the best use out of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm and tingly, almost like a muscle rub but not quite as intense.</li>
            <li> It has been awhile since I was comfortable wearing shorts.</li>
            <li> I use this when I get out of the shower and use a light amount and massage in an upward motion as it says on the box .</li>
            <li> The customer service is fantastic, and followed up to see if I was liking the cream.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the tingling sensation you will feel when you apply the Gel-cream to you skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those reviewers who is going to lie because I got a free product.  </li>
            <li> One of these are the pesky lumps, bumps, and areas that are just not as smooth as when we were in our hey-days.</li>
            <li> It has a light minty fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the fact it has no artificial smell or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It is a light gel with a medicinal herbal based scent that warms once it is applied</li>
            <li> My cellulite is still visible, and I didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for, but I like that my skin felt smooth.</li>
            <li> As the name suggests, it’s a gel-like cream that might not look too attractive when you open it and see what it looks like, but don’t be put off because of that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I have finally found a semi-permanent solution to my problem.</li>
            <li> I defiantly know that I don’t want cellulite making its way on my body &amp; if it does I want a way to fight to win my body back!</li>
            <li> Smooth skin.</li>
            <li> jiggled\\&quot; LoL I am almost done my bottle but will be buying next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to contribute to a company that really cares about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li> received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li> but I was surprise how light the scent was it did not bothered me.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week, so no noticeable results yet, but it smells great</li>
            <li> She also asked if I wanted to try another jar for free.  </li>
            <li> The company did offer to provide another bottle, free of charge, but I opted for the refund which they processed immediately.</li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> I got this for free to review from Tomoson.</li>
            <li> and no I didn&#x27;t get a free jar of this for a review.</li>
            <li> This cream works great overall.</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily which makes it easy to get dressed quickly after applying it.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best fast acting one I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I loved it, definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This cream that I have been using is working good so far not complaints.it tightens(firms)</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer so this really made me love the product even more.</li>
            <li> So far, so good .....</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, seen a difference after the first week</li>
            <li> This would have been good information to be aware of as the first time I applied</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> it nice to go to bed with such a nice aromatic ambiance.</li>
            <li> We are still in the courting phase, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> She looks forward to more good results and a younger youthful look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me.</li>
            <li> My main reason for reviewing is that this is an outstanding company!</li>
            <li> Very unique and well worth it.</li>
            <li> Cool gel that easily rubs into the skin and has a tingling feeling that lasts, which I like.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Khushboo!!!</li>
            <li> Feels very fresh, but have not seen an improvement......</li>
            <li> The best time to apply the cream is after a shower, reason being is your skin is clean and rid of dirt and dead skin.</li>
            <li> Works great :) all that baby fat skin hanging to almost gone been using for a week since its a small jar will be ordering more</li>
            <li> The light weight is due to the light consistency of the gel, which I think is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily &amp; dries quickly, so you can get on with your day.</li>
            <li> First off, I love how light it is.</li>
            <li> , and I&#x27;m sure with continued consistent use I will be dimple free with the aid of this product</li>
            <li> The fragrance fades quickly and can easily be worn anytime, it won’t interfere with your cologne or perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one goes on easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Is very very liquid and did not have a protective layer on top, so when i opened  spilled all over me.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li> I need to use this 6-8 weeks and will leave more information after that time but so far love the special and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a smooth consistency and absorbed fairly easy.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t disappeared completely but pretty soon I&#x27;m sure it will be history!!</li>
            <li> My experience with Body Merry cellulite defense gel-cream has been a unique one.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what results I get with continued use.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but well worth it to do before heading to the beach!</li>
            <li> it still felt/feels like ice n hot, but it was a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> Combat cellulite with our unique Caffeine + Retinol + Seaweed formula.</li>
            <li> This was a really unique product to try.</li>
            <li> Overall though, I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> it smells funny and feels more like a muscle rub.</li>
            <li> After all, true beauty is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I have seen that it gives results, it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li> It has a cooling/tingling sensation that is quite significant.</li>
            <li> Feels cool for awhile after and skin feels incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> I think that for better results, you should massage or brush the areas first and then apply this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much!</li>
            <li> But as I was continuously using it more and more, I definitely noticed that my skin WAS smoother and tighter and held in more moisture for longer.</li>
            <li> After my first review I said I would need more time with the product...</li>
            <li> Nervous to try it again, but excited bc</li>
            <li> I was excited like a kid in a candy store.</li>
            <li> The gel-cream has a menthol smell and its pretty refreshing when you apply it.</li>
            <li> and I work out every day, eat pretty healthy and drink lots of water.  </li>
            <li> Im pretty sure thats helping.  </li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t know how else to describe that ) &amp; refreshing on application, I liked it so much that I wanted to apply it on my whole body but stopped myself from doing so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product although I&#x27;m not sure which one is more effective: this cream or the cellulite massager that I bought along with this item.</li>
            <li> Another thing that might not be your favorite, at first, is the scent.</li>
            <li> The feeling is even more intensified if your skin is hot from a shower beforehand.</li>
            <li> think that Body Merry’s Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is an incredibly unique product.</li>
            <li> As an avid blogger, I was able to review this product.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure of Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream at first</li>
            <li> Now I look forward to that fresh smell and cooling tingle feeling as it absorbs into my skin!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was so excited to get started on this product, however after 3 months of using I didn&#x27;t see drastic results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream and recieved this on February 8 2015 and was so excited.</li>
            <li> I think the best thing for cellulite and better looking legs is hard work - eating right and exercising.  </li>
            <li> I loved everything about this cream, most especially that it dramatically softened my skin right away.</li>
            <li> This customer is definitely not disappointed, and by the way I was expecting something stinky, and actually it does smell quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> it would be nice if the jar was bigger or if they gave more product in the jar....</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT--love the fact that all of the ingredients are natural and you can actually feel it working.  </li>
            <li> and since I didn&#x27;t get to really try the cream out, I was able to get a replacement for free.</li>
            <li> I ordered my second jar to get my legs nice and smooth, and I have no doubt this product will do the job!</li>
            <li> I quickly forgave myself for this when within days my husband commented on how smooth he noticed my legs were.</li>
            <li> so I was fascinated how easy it is to use - just seconds of massaging for it to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> but I only use once a day, even though the smell is not bad, in fact is kind of refreshing</li>
            <li> I liked it so much i purchased another right away.</li>
            <li> First thing you notice with this is the overwhelming menthol smell, its like a super cough drop.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of a special friend of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Right away, it feels like it goes to work!</li>
            <li> You feel it working right away!</li>
            <li> It looks visibly smoother picture in right is with this cream!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and experiencing this product for myself, I think the amount of time it takes for the gel to work its magic depends on the severity of the cellulite (ie places where my cellulite was less lumpy are completely smooth now, while my more lumpy bumpy areas are smoother but it is taking more applications before it is completely smooth).</li>
            <li> It is however very sturdy, light weight &amp; therefore travel friendly, I can easily slip it into my</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this so much and very anticipated to see what lies ahead!</li>
            <li> I want to try this natural and organic anti cellulite cream because all the ingredients are amazing: caffeine, retinol and seaweed.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing is, Body Merry offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee - if you don&#x27;t like the results you get, just contact them</li>
            <li> I liked the way it felt haven&#x27;t been able to see any long term effects from it though.</li>
            <li> I will probably repurchase this in order to try for a full 2-3 months before making up my mind.</li>
            <li> Retinol gives cool effect, but it feels like burning)))</li>
            <li> cool burning.</li>
            <li> I know it won&#x27;t cool to death my cellulite</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I find that after a full day, when my legs are sore using this its like hitting two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> Their labels always have the container expiration date that I love so much.</li>
            <li> and I have to say so far I am loving</li>
            <li> I am impressed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Honestly, not that impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps the appearance of my legs and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels really neat and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> It stays cool for awhile</li>
            <li> Used it for a full month and saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I was surprised I liked this product.</li>
            <li> but I appreciated the impact it had on my mind when I needed it most.</li>
            <li> Has a cool enlivening feeling.</li>
            <li> It leaves a cool minty tingling on your skin</li>
            <li> Once applied I could feel the tingling from the menthol, and made my skin feel cool for about an hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> but then a sweet under note starts to come through</li>
            <li> I really like the tingling sensation :)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a cool, soothing feeling you get after you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li> I paid full price for it</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the cream but haven&#x27;t noticed much for results.</li>
            <li> However, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> if any creams really got rid of cellulite they wouldn&#x27;t be a price most if us can afford or on amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the sweet minty smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to concentrate on just one area so that I could try to use the product for a full month to try to get the full effectiveness of it</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides that I loved the warming feeling it left after applying.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t give a full review.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional blogger that writes my own opinions.</li>
            <li> It eaves my skin cool and tingling for about 15 minutes, but I can dress immediately.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Very minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li> and it goes on cool</li>
            <li> Thanks for your recommendations for use and how to apply this refreshing cream.</li>
            <li> because I know they&#x27;re all good with helping to reduce the look of cellulite and tighten the skin you definitely have to drink a lot of water exersise and watch what you&#x27;re eating .</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the cool feeling on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Can I get the full list of ingredients?</li>
            <li> The cream remains cool even after the massage, so you don&#x27;t feel overheated.</li>
            <li> and I have really been pleased with their quality and results.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I should Have Received A Full Jar.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it just feels good to put on.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it just feels good to put on.</li>
            <li> In any case, it&#x27;s not a bad cream</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad either.</li>
            <li> i love this so far!!!</li>
            <li> It will be really great in the summertime when it is super hot outside</li>
            <li> you open the jar, it has kind of a strong describable smell.</li>
            <li> Even if I never notice a reduction in cellulite, this firms and moisturizes better and faster than most skin firming creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and at a lower price than many other brands.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> I have to give it some time to work, but the smell is relaxing to me even though it is strong when it&#x27;s first applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> And if you are anything like me and think about our furry little friends when shopping for beauty products then you&#x27;ll be happy to know that they are a cruelty free company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad feeling; I kind of enjoy it actually</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad feeling; I kind of enjoy it actually</li>
            <li> exercise more, drink even more water, and cut down on even more sugar....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything in 2 1/2 weeks that I would say is exceptional nor do I expect a miracle in that short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I also feel more toned and the texture of my back thighs looks better.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;I am super picky about products</li>
            <li> That being said, I can&#x27;t say that I see a tremendous or even the slightest bit of difference in my cellulite on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely feel more confident about showing my legs after using this product.  </li>
            <li> If I had time to use it daily, I&#x27;m sure I would see even a greater result.  </li>
            <li> Drys super quick as well.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really quickly, you can put your clothes and go out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves a warming sensation that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> Cellulite Cream absorbs into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The cellulite on my upper thighs and upper arms looks so much BETTER!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like Vics when rubbing it on, but that quickly resolves.</li>
            <li> The gel-cream absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured out really quick  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy and seems to absorb quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> , i will be ordering some more in the future:)</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly like a gel, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.ld never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> I am also 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> The cream disappears and dries on the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I love putting it on right after I get out of the shower, it just feels so refreshing because the cream is infused with a refreshing 100% natural ‘mint - green tea - lime’ fragrance, LOVE IT!  </li>

            <li> I would recommend using a skin massager with comfortable pressure as I have been told that you need to stimulate the cellulite to drain away, and this coupled with the activating ingredients in this cream its really working!</li>
            <li> and this is my very first review I&#x27;ve ever written on here.</li>
            <li> And, I was very interested in the reviews.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is less noticeable and I for sure am buying more!</li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite creams, but I think this one is the most powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li> since I been using this I have seen a great difference and its been less than a month.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I experienced this cool tingle.</li>
            <li> Strong smell &amp; really saw no difference</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and very pleasant--it has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Seller was kind enough to send me a full- refund for the item.</li>
            <li> I found that it absorbed really quickly into my skin and did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> but since I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results I figure I&#x27;ll wait until I am financially able to buy 2 or more jars &amp; then give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> Definitely ordering more!</li>
            <li> but it really works well!!</li>
            <li> This really works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many creams and gels since I was 15 years old!</li>
            <li> I can see a very visible difference!!</li>
            <li> It really work !!</li>
            <li> This gel-cream really works!!</li>
            <li> I finished my first jar and my cellulite is almost gone!</li>
            <li> In the past, I have used Niviea Cellulite Be Gone and have received more consistent and successful results.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice a day I saw results within the first week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered a second jar to have on hand because I already love this product!  </li>
            <li> For one the first thing I noticed was the scent!</li>
            <li> so far it is good, but to new to tell if the product will work or not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lightweight and refreshing gel-cream as the consistency of this gel-cream is designed to glide over large areas.</li>
            <li> I think anyone who has ever used IcyHot on an more sensitive area knows exactly what I am talking about!  </li>
            <li> Hope it works as I really was impressed with the customer service and so hard to find that today buying online.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to smooth out the skin’s surface very well.</li>
            <li> I think if you use this after a workout it can be very soothing while also helping to smooth out your cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can be very soothing while also helping to smooth out your cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would feel amazing on your lower back if you had cellulite there.</li>
            <li> Tris is a great product, I started using it few days ago</li>
            <li> This has been an amazing addition to my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Tomoson.com, I received a  container of #BodyMerry Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream for free to test out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Much like their moisturizer, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent</li>
            <li> I was quite happy with the results after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but this is worth it.</li>
            <li> I excercise frequently and eat healthy</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  </li>
            <li> Some of my bigger lumps already appear to be more filled in.</li>
            <li> the tingle is also pretty cool.</li>
            <li> and I definitely see a lot of improvement in the appearance of my skin, as well as a nice tightening.</li>
            <li> Try it, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> So far i love it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> but it sure does help minimize the appearance and it makes me skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like sort of a fresh sea breeze scent and my  dimples</li>
            <li> so I can really come back and give a fair review.</li>
            <li> So far I like it much better than SHESSENTIALS Cellulite Cream with Retinol and Caffeine Skin Tightening and Body Firming Treatment.</li>
            <li> I am 32, and have struggled with cellulite most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> They actually reached out to me after about 3 weeks of use to see how I liked the product.  </li>
            <li> I found it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> well worth the weather we are having.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the try.  </li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite cellulite cream.  </li>
            <li> I know you can&#x27;t simply rely on a cream but have to put in your own work as well..</li>
            <li> Besides leave a relax and fresh it after use it.</li>
            <li> I love that it is also natural and organic, made in USA</li>
            <li> So I ordered it and have been using it for a couple weeks now and have had kind of mixed thoughts.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> I am going to see if once a day is worth the price.</li>
            <li> After applying to those pesky cellulite areas (ladies, you know where), the warmth and feel as it works and the aromatic therapy is, to me, worth using.</li>
            <li> and if provides any benefit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> Always worth a try for even the smallest improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says she is starting to see results from this, so she is happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> You are to rub the cream into your problem areas in circular motions until it is absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> With that said any and all opinions mentioned above are of my own and have not been altered in any way, shape or form.</li>
            <li> I will just continue using this and see how effective it is even when one forgets about exercising or forget the daily routine.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth trying and seeing what it does for you.</li>
            <li> I liked the product enough to order it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> You just rub it on in a circle motion until it is absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth it.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;</li>
            <li> You just rub it on until it is absorbed into your skin</li>
            <li> However,  since I paid about $30 for it, I wanted to get my monies worth and find a way to use it.  </li>
            <li> It smells like menthol and has a distinct &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, none of us are getting any younger, that&#x27;s why I was thrilled to try the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream from Body Merry.</li>
            <li> thing I love about this is that it is free from harsh chemicals, making it better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the money - order</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> So I do think this is worth a try if you are looking for something to improve the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> So I do think this is worth a try if you are looking for something to improve the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> Works Great Absorbs Quickly No Sticky Feeling!</li>
            <li> but I can say that some other more affordable products had better results.</li>
            <li> This gel-cream also does a great job at quickly absorbing into your skin and it leaves no greasy residue like other gel-cream</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and subsides relatively quick (or i sleep off before i realize and wear it at nights</li>
            <li> The jar was going pretty quickly, so I bought another two jars after i read that it needs to be used twice per day and results will show in 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strange to be completely honest LOL.</li>
            <li> The first was very effective in making my cellulite less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The cream smells good not like other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and how the cream felt on, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it due to no results.</li>
            <li> it has in it a lot of other ingredients that will work to help you fight the good fight agents that unsightly</li>
            <li> Its not especially unpleasant, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t work overnight, I have noticed a big improvement - most specially on my arms.</li>
            <li> kept eating right</li>
            <li> I am going to be right for the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a matter of finding that right product.</li>
            <li> it was right before bed.</li>
            <li> It seems they cant get the format right.</li>
            <li> When I did smell it I could tell right away there was menthol in it.  </li>
            <li> price was just right</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> Since no body in there right mind would want cellulite to begin with.</li>
            <li> Can put on pj pants right after and within a couple minutes</li>
            <li> First use and I am already loving it, I can&#x27;t wait to see final results!</li>
            <li> The smell is strong if you are sensitive to that!</li>
            <li> The skin is a very large and porous organ.</li>
            <li> most women, I have some “extra baggage” from when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> The smell is different - not bad or good, but it does smell slightly of Vicks (which I actually love) which I attribute to the menthol.</li>
            <li> lol you forget to apply everyday like need be) and it&#x27;s already doing wonders!</li>
            <li> That is true that I don&#x27;t have a very severe cellulite problem.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky and well absorbed so it does not bother me in the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just an intense cool feeling.</li>
            <li> you get past the appearance and smell, this product is actually really great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gel-cream consistency is designed to spread over large areas and it absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re like 40 or more lbs overweight, and live a predominantly sedentary lifestyle with cellulite over most of your thighs and stomach, this cream is not going to be a long lost miracle worker for you.</li>
            <li> I just started using this, I&#x27;m actually laying in the bath right now trying to get the gel off of me and to warm up, the tingle feeling was too intense...</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get consistent about applying 2x a day, but once I did I saw an amazing difference!</li>
            <li> And then enjoy the beauty of your new, non-dimpled skin.</li>
            <li> However I am certain that it has helped!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in &amp;#34;cellulite&amp;#34; bit then I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long</li>
            <li> I put this cream on my upper thighs and it blends in quickly, doesn&#x27;t have a distinct smell and will show results!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back in a few weeks, hopefully with Happy results!</li>
            <li> So far, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about what I&#x27;ve tried (vitamin C serum, cellulite gel-cream, and stretch mark cream).</li>
            <li> I tried a few different options that I picked up from the drugstore upon recommendation from some of my mommy friends, but was never that impressed with the results, so that&#x27;s the mind frame I went into this review with and to</li>
            <li> The color is a light tan color as well which I can only say did seem to fit well with the scent.</li>
            <li> It came super fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the many great reviews, but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> In terms of the cream absorbing into the skin it does quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly this cream dries.</li>
            <li> I massage the nice smelling gel into my skin and let it dry and then use a massager for 5 or 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait, &#x27;til I had used half of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Too be fair</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and phthalates that I need to worry about touching my skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs super fast into my skin as well</li>
            <li> It absorbs super fast into my skin as well</li>
            <li> so very much</li>
            <li> The gel is very very silky..</li>
            <li> On its own (with that nubby little massager) it didn&#x27;t seem spectacular, but this cream compared to FatGirlSlim and EVELINE COSMETICS SLIM EXTREME and the machine resulted in fabulous results.  </li>
            <li> When beginning to use this product it has a very intense ice n hot feeling</li>
            <li> Within first week or two.</li>
            <li> 90 days is more than enough time to see results.</li>
            <li> In My Skin Within The First Two Weeks.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought two different creams for better result.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for one week, after my workout at the gym, it has a refreshing tingling sensation immediately after application</li>
            <li> and it definitely makes it look better.</li>
            <li> it does take up to 8 weeks of consistently applying this product to see results</li>
            <li> First off, I can&#x27;t say this works (yet)</li>
            <li> so it smells a bit like icy-hot (it also gives that warm/cold tingling feeling for the first 2 minutes or so).  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a fan of thick creams because of the length of time it takes the product to soak into the skin, this could be a great option for you in that regard.</li>
            <li> I noticed first upon removing the cap was the scent.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> and my skin was much smoother - yay!</li>
            <li> I could see the difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> Imagine my excitement to find that it worked and my thighs were getting their sexy back.  </li>
            <li> and i can see more like feel my skin different.</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference in the first week.</li>
            <li> The only thing is just my son &amp; husband  ,doesn&#x27;t like the smell, I love the smell</li>
            <li> Most likely won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product (March 1st), so it has not had enough time to work its magic.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and plan to purchase more once current supply is depleted</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t magic, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely being buying more of this.</li>
            <li> This gel-cream is also cruelty free and made with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> You should also notice a difference within the first week of using.</li>
            <li> First I must comment on the customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I did not use it consistently</li>
            <li> The first time that I tried this product, it had an immediate cooling sensation, almost a burning.</li>
            <li> I am able to wear a regular swim suit this year instead of a swim skirt!</li>
            <li> I just received my order today and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Detailed, prompt and professional responses to my inquiries as well as follow-up.  </li>
            <li> Definitely will be keeping this product in stock at the house :)</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pretty soon to write a review</li>
            <li> So, the stretch marks and cellulite struggle is real!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what exactly the ingredients are</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use this cream and update my review again later! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use this cream and update my review again later! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love the way you can actually feel it working after applying.</li>
            <li> I only use on my thighs because that&#x27;s where the most noticeable cellulite are.</li>
            <li> I was not wrong.</li>
            <li> This really worked for me!  </li>
            <li> Literally, the first time I tried it I felt like I was sitting on ice.  </li>
            <li> if you use it consistently you will see an improvement in your skins appearance.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months since my first jar.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more to last me throughout summer!</li>
            <li> The first day, it was.</li>
            <li> And, as I said earlier, I love the fragrance of this product and</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great product and I can slowly see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already ordering 2 more bottles, So it can be my daily leg cream</li>
            <li> makes the stomach smaller, I love it</li>
            <li> and I have read that retinol and seaweed really do help the appearance of cellulite and this product has both!  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> REALLY HELPED ME!  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I still have a 1/2 jar left, but I am going to order more</li>
            <li> First, if used twice a day, I saw results.</li>
            <li> I got this to try at a dicount and let me tell you this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t exactly notice the improvement of cellulite</li>
            <li> The cream is lightweight and has light scent as well as being natural.</li>
            <li> this product leaves you feeling very invigorated!</li>
            <li> First time I used it I could feel it working</li>
            <li> Will be interesting to see if they experience similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be re-ordering :)</li>
            <li> First off, it is a gel cream and like what the company stated it is easier to spread around &amp; massage unlike creams.</li>
            <li> It is my first time to use a cellulite gel cream</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it exactly like they said so</li>
            <li> A word of caution - the first time I tried this product</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it kind of freaked me out…it felt a lot like ‘icy hot’, but without the hot.</li>
            <li> It has a fairly intense smell, but this goes away as the product is absorbed into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The menthol was a recognizable ingredient in the cream which provided a cooling sensation after application (something I really appreciated after taking a run!).  </li>
            <li> I first applied this gel I was in shock.</li>
            <li> I have found that I personally only have to use this product once a week for my condition, however you may need to use it more often or even daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference by the end of the first week.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t have any open scratches or sores on the area because if you do this will irritate it slighlly.</li>
            <li> after first week I felt my skin firmer.</li>
            <li> First in the morning when I get dressed and again at night after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin tingle for the first 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It resembles butterscotch pudding though haha!</li>
            <li> From the first time you apply Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream you feel it.</li>
            <li> It also has organic cayenne to help with circulation and reducing the storage of fat, it is made in the United States, it is cruelty free and contains no harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I definitely feel like my legs are looking better...</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the results yet, but I can tell you it feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like to apply this after a harm or hot bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> Im almost into my first month and already seeing results.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4-stars because although I love how it makes my skin feel, I&#x27;m not seeing any cellulite reduction and beyond any benefits I might see, it is supposed to be a cellulite</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Towards the end of the first jar I finally started to notice results as I did better at remembering to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product to further my results! :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> really was hoping it would!</li>
            <li> Although the price is slightly higher (I pay $39) for the product...</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is my first review.</li>
            <li> I also cut off all sugars from sweets  and only consumed sugars from fruits as well as incorporated healthy eating and excersises</li>
            <li> You can really feel it working!</li>
            <li> At first I thought &amp;#34;Hmm</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gooey and smells funny.</li>
            <li> After I apply the cream, I can notice a cooling sensation which is most likely from the mint.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin does indeed feel a lot smoother and on the surface I can definitely begin to see the texture of my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> After I apply the cream, I can notice a cooling sensation which is most likely from the mint.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin does indeed feel a lot smoother and on the surface I can definitely begin to see the texture of my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> I am noticing a difference, but you have to be consistent and give it time for you to notice the effect of it.</li>
            <li> It smells almost exactly like Origins Body Souffle cream which is to-die-for.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I wish it came in a larger size!  </li>
            <li> You can feel it tingling on your skin (which to me is a good sign) and after a few minutes you can no longer smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> , we love to present ourselves as that, great impressions mean a lot to me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and must say, the customer service of this company is also extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> I know not everyone wants to smell like mint, but I was so surprised that after putting the cream on, the scent was not there at all, even though in the box, the scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> These amazing cellulite-gel is also all natural and organic so there is not a single ingredient that will harm you.</li>
            <li> It seems much more effective that most of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I applied it to the underside of my arms and under my chin and both areas seemed more smooth and less flabby looking.</li>
            <li> Not as strong but similar the smell is worth it if it helps with the appearance of hail damage.</li>
            <li> I simply have not used it daily, but when I have, I have been pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this for 2 people due to the caffeine, retinol, &amp; seaweed as taught on the Dr. Oz show for cellulite, that are also key ingredients for the most truly effective wrinkle treatments.</li>
            <li> I did when exercising though, like more squats and other things, so I&#x27;m sure that just naturally helped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything will really get rid of cellulite if you don&#x27;t also combine this with eating right and exercising..</li>
            <li> This unique natural formula has piqued my interest</li>
            <li> I have added this into my daily routine and am excited for the outcome!</li>
            <li> The skin is left with a nice tingling sensation and soft feel.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good gel-cream that definitely improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> It did  absolutely nothing for me, I&#x27;m starting to think most of these reviews on here are made up by the sellers.</li>
            <li> packaging is good, simple &amp; practical in a white container.</li>
            <li> slowly but surely (which is a hell of a lot better than not at all)</li>
            <li> I have several beach vacations this summer and wanted to make sure I was beach ready.  </li>
            <li> The gel-cream is extremely smooth, when I applied on the skin I got an instant cooling sensation (extremely useful</li>
            <li> The Cellulite Defense Gel Cream is honestly not pretty to look at, it&#x27;s a little goopy and jiggly, BUT it feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen a pretty decent improvement!</li>
            <li> I started to use this product right away along with a cellulite brush and after about 9 days I looked in the mirror and noticed a huge difference in how my buttocks and back of my legs looked.</li>
            <li> but I like that too because it makes my skin tingle which makes me feel that it is having a positive interaction with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did not see any positive results.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> First of all, compliments and thanks to the GM of this company.  </li>
            <li> This is a lovely product that goes a long way and the fragrance is divine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a jelly-like consistency (&amp;#34;gel-cream&amp;#34;) and it rubs into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li> I feel most of the people who left such &amp;#34;wonder product&amp;#34; reviews got free products.</li>
            <li> I will be a long term customer with this company for sure.</li>
            <li> With the first two I did not use a cellulite massager, because of this did not see too much improvement.</li>
            <li> It is semi-permanent in the way that as long as I apply this as soon as the bumps reappear then I will have another week free from bumps!</li>
            <li> I disliked the smell, it was a real strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and wow!!!</li>
            <li> Hands down, amazing.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a cellulite cream that contained the 3 key ingredients which fight cellulite: caffeine which  is the classic ingredient in cellulite creams because it immediately tightens the skin; retinol which boosts collagen and works even better when combined with caffeine;  and seaweed which literally absorbs fat from under the surface of the skin and diminishes cellulite in that fashion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell and tingly feeling takes a little getting used to, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about a week and half now and you can tell an amazing difference in my leg and thigh area.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> It works better when I dry brush and use post shower after my workout.</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I did kind of notice a slight difference</li>
            <li> The cream is easy to apply and only takes seconds to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to be super busy in the morning with my kids</li>
            <li> , I like the smell, but its so strong that I can only put it on and have it on for about 10-20 minutes away from my husband who doesn&#x27;t like it at all.  </li>
            <li> The jar is a good size so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> By the time I put my clothes on, a bulk of the strong odor has dissipated enough that I can&#x27;t smell it all day or annoy my co-workers with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and I feel it more effective after showering and massage.</li>
            <li> Twice a day on large areas.</li>
            <li> It could certainly be PART of a weight loss</li>
            <li> I loved so much about this one because I could actually feel it working long after I put it</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t see results so fast with a beauty care product but this one is amazing .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much tighter I am as a result, but it the ingredients are proven effective and it&#x27;s organic, so I hope over time into my second jar I&#x27;ll see better tightening.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised and pleased that this cream actually works!</li>
            <li> use this product only on the top half of my thighs since this is where I think my body has the most jiggle.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see a change in my upper thighs and butt, plus I love the minty-cool tingle that lets me know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m more likely to spread cream all over my buns and thighs than exercise daily - we shall see… Btw I live in Canada and right now I have to order directly from the Body Merry website by contacting the owner and making shipping/payment arrangements - it&#x27;s an easy process -  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, and I find that this lotion adds the right moisture without irritation.</li>
            <li> It has a strong menthol smell and an icy cool tingly feeling that took a little getting used to at first, but now I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> After 1 use I could tell a definite difference, now after 5 days of using twice a day, it has made my stomach a lot firmer and smoother, visually it has done an amazing job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use too much of it at all....</li>
            <li> water and work out does really help to get results faster</li>
            <li> the cooling sensation is intense and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> therefore i don&#x27;t think this product really addresses that issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything against cellulite and I feel that with this product I really have a defense against cellulite.</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping us in this adventure.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> and they say to see real results from any type of serum, cream, oil, etc</li>
            <li> I find it very soothing</li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> I find the sensation to be much like when you use a muscle rub.</li>
            <li> It’s starting to soften and smooth out some.</li>
            <li> This one really is working.  </li>
            <li> I am a mother of two and wasn&#x27;t too sure about this cream since it&#x27;s so unknown</li>
            <li> so they didnt have to spread out much product i literally recived this about a week ago</li>
            <li> and they really help you try to find a product that will work for you.</li>
            <li> I really feel like this product penetrates the skin and firms the tissue underneath.  </li>
            <li> I have given this product 5 stars because I really like the way it feels when I massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much of them</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li> Got this cream out of desperation to try (I have tried so many and spent a lot of money over the years).</li>
            <li> and then the massager brush just solidifies the whole process.</li>
            <li> The menthol odor is just way too much for me to handle.</li>
            <li> USED THE WHOLE THING</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really saw a difference after using.</li>
            <li> This stuffy really works with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works at firming the areas you apply it at.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working, I don&#x27;t really care for the medicated smell though</li>
            <li> I feel like I have been waiting my whole life to find this stuff</li>
            <li> SOOOOO MUCH BODY</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> The cream works very well</li>
            <li> cream smells like peppermint and spreads really well</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they were very considerate, and refunded me for the cream.  </li>
            <li> Literally felt like I was gonna get frost bite on my legs because the cooling/tingling feeling was soooo intense.  </li>
            <li> I could not stand that cooling sensation though , just way to intense.</li>
            <li> but I know the cream is really helping improve the appearance of my legs.</li>
            <li> This stuff does really work.</li>
            <li> So I really didn&#x27;t know if this would work for me because it was fat deposits-to my surprise</li>
            <li> Now in about a month in another bottle I will be dress ready.</li>
            <li> Feels like the product works as it tingles but not noticing much difference..</li>
            <li> The scent was intense</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen much result on my thighs yet</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> this combinated with the brush really works</li>
            <li> It works very well to make skin look healthier and toned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Who knows what really works</li>
            <li> Of course, I use massage and that must have much to do with it.</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> It automatically absorbs to your body and it is an very FREEZING feeling.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well for me though.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> It smells like a muscle pain reliever gel and really tingles.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels going on.</li>
            <li> I find it is a very relaxing part of my night-time routine.</li>
            <li> Also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I have seen too much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Works very well with execersibg and dieting</li>
            <li> and you really want to know and feel it working</li>
            <li> Also, I use the whole jar.. waiting for results, but nothing happen...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like that because the effects take awhile to wear off.</li>
            <li> It seems absolutely therapeutic to me.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have too much cellulitis and even when I use it every day</li>
            <li> I really would appreciate a refund on this.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work for me</li>
            <li> I will have to reorder another jar very soon.</li>
            <li> Soaks in the skin fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time to apply and the tingly feeling bothers me anyways.</li>
            <li> it has a very minty smell to it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels when I massage this cream into my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really luv it</li>
            <li> I truly wish it had worked like others have said it does for them, but I really saw no change.</li>
            <li> This product REALLY DOES WORK ...</li>
            <li> It REALLY works thou.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> really good!With my experience</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stay if it works for cellulite</li>
            <li> Therefore, be very cautious about where the product is applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really thought after reading some of the reviews on here that this product would work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> And you don’t need to put a lot on because it’s very efficient and</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try this product for free.  </li>
            <li> I thought absolutely nothing was happening, and then I waited... and waited... and waited.  </li>
            <li> i was really suprised.</li>
            <li> I think that really helps to get rid of cellulite and.</li>
            <li> This product really really works</li>
            <li> I lost 75 pounds, however, I lost the weight too fast which in turn caused me to have a lot of excess skin.</li>
            <li> Lingering fragrance of a high class spa!</li>
            <li> I did not notice much change.  </li>
            <li> This products  really work , I been  </li>
            <li> Thank u so much</li>
            <li> I real like this cream.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really jiggly in it&#x27;s container.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use this product I wished the jar would be bigger and it could be available on auto-ship option in order to receive it on the monthly basis without a care in the world.</li>
            <li> Much smoother look to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t attack cellulite.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything and the item arrived damaged in the package.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> a day use it is going fast.</li>
            <li> the odor was too much for my husband at night.  </li>
            <li> but I personally think those are free product reviewers)</li>
            <li> while I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in cellulite, my skin is much smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> This is really a 5-star product to me.</li>
            <li> but this works very  well.  </li>
            <li> THANKS Body Merry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much improved</li>
            <li> however, I wouldn&#x27;t think, this is going to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much cellulite and when I use this cream it doesn&#x27;t look like it do anything to me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t seen any type of change.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t buy more immediately bc its not in the budget this month, but I will definitely be wanting more next month when I have some extra money to throw around.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t buy more immediately bc its not in the budget this month, but I will definitely be wanting more next month when I have some extra money to throw around.</li>
            <li> and there really is a difference.</li>
            <li> The texture really does feel like a gel cream as well.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole jar</li>
            <li> This stuff is just too intense for me.</li>
            <li> I am a young and healthy 20 year old who exercises frequently.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, not only can I see the cellulite disappear but the smoothness and quality of my aging 56 year old neck and chest has improved by 100%.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cellulite creams and this one by far is my favorite</li>
            <li> It sucks that I really believed the ppl that said is good.</li>
            <li> First let me say WOW you can really feel this one work!</li>
            <li> All I can say from the initial use is that I feel like I&#x27;m submerged in Icy Hot...not so much in a good way either.</li>
            <li> Body Merry was nice enough to send me a jar of their Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream last month to try and review.</li>
            <li> just recently tried it an so far i love how it works</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for a good cocoa/shea butter smell.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> It smells like menthol but sinks easily into the skin and has an icy cool tingle to it which I enjoy.  </li>
            <li> This cream tightens skin gets rid of cellulite and bumps and even 9 year old scars!!!</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel it working after the first use!!</li>
            <li> However, exercise and eating right are also key to its success.</li>
            <li> After opening the packing you are now greeted with contents, which is creamy, bold and a little strong, but you know that is the caffeine and seaweed along with retinol ready to help with the battle a head that is cellulite.</li>
            <li> I do understand that it can take several months of consistent practice to recover adequate results.</li>
            <li> After my second child I started getting mild cellulite on my thighs and this product has helped so much!</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> The tingling wasn&#x27;t too much to handle and the other reviewers were right about the smell; its something you get used to and almost come to enjoy.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to see that the president of this company cares enough to follow up with a letter to tell you exactly how to use it to see the most benefit and if not happy how to contact them.</li>
            <li> MANY other products and</li>
            <li> and I am due to order more.</li>
            <li> Other than that I was pleased with the cream and plan on trying it again.</li>
            <li> , now i am going to use it on other areas just to make sure i dont get any there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Warning: when I say strong, I mean STRONG.</li>
            <li> For good measure, we’ve also added potent natural and organic ingredients such as algae extract, kelp, coconut oil, japanese green tea leaf extract and cayenne.</li>
            <li> I like that fact that It was easy to rub in like a gel, but like a cream in that it didn’t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I would use this, and highly recommend it to anyone that wants results.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x60;t do reviews, but this product is so amazing that I had to write about it.</li>
            <li> It is not a thick cream, but I like it because it does work well with the massager &amp; absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> my husband and i are going to order this product for the next 3 months to see the full 90 results.  </li>
            <li> i am pretty sensitive with smells but tolerate it if it works.</li>
            <li> The fragrance barely leaves a trace once fully absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it!</li>
            <li> This gel-cream is actually more of a gelatinous product that easily absorbs into skin - just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A small amount spreads easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Using this with the Garcina Cambodia has really helped me with my new years resolution to help me take care and do something to improve myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the following combination has made a huge difference for me: following a low-carb, low-sugar diet, drinking a LOT of water, dry brushing my skin, strength workouts (FitnessBlender.com is my favorite), using this gel-cream twice a day, and a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> There is also slight lime fragrance that I love.</li>
            <li> I dont know how this stuff lasted more than a couple weeks with some people putting it over half their bodies like I read in the reviews.</li>
            <li> I dont know how this stuff lasted more than a couple weeks with some people putting it over half their bodies like I read in the reviews.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs into the skin quick enough and does not remain greasy or leave any residue.</li>
            <li> The texture is also different because instead of being a regular cream, it is more like a gel/cream mix consistency.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using a cellulite gel – cream, when I first applied the cream it instantly turned watery.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my thighs, rear, and stomach.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d imagine that someone using it daily (or twice a day, as suggested) would blow through this quickly.</li>
            <li> yes, because if you are like me and many others, things work differently for different people.</li>
            <li> Love it only using it for 2 weeks and my cellulite are disappearing getting a next bottle</li>
            <li> I do realize that these products not only take time but also require commitment, and I am satisfied enough to continue using it, alternating with another cellulite cream, plus massage and exercise and diet.</li>
            <li> As I start to get a bit older I seen some signs of cellulite sneaking up on my thighs and the backs of my arms.  </li>
            <li> done with second jar and have used more regularly twice per day.</li>
            <li> but I felt this product was good enough it deserved a few minutes of my time.</li>
            <li> I like to use this gel in the morning and evening, but mainly on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> It also comes in a decent sized 4 ounce jar.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve mainly been doing it before bed.</li>
            <li> I mainly have been using this on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li> I mainly have been using this on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I ordered it because most of the reviews stated that they received this for free to review.  </li>
            <li> The fantastic customer service was the icing on the cake-- not sure that I&#x27;ve ever had such attentive response to my communication from a vendor!</li>
            <li> #34;I can for sure see a different c e, not sure if  this will sound like a compliment, but you don&#x27;t have them dimple thing on your butt and legs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (now mostly noticeable if I flex tight)</li>
            <li> I get more of a tingle feeling on my skin than a tight feeling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and have recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and have recommended to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to add this anti cellulite cream to your beauty routine because it helps minimize cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the product is all natural, organic, and free from harsh chemicals such as Parabens, Sulfates and Phthalates.</li>
            <li> Any remaining odor just smells like you have been at a high class spa!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel cream has a high caffeine content, 0.4% retinol, and three types of seaweed (algae extract, kelp, and dulse).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind the strong menthol scent (kind of cleans out the sinuses) or even the cold butt cheeks afterward.</li>
            <li> I apply this directly after showering and I think that helps it but other than that I love it and</li>
            <li> The jar is so small and the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> I need to use it a little more to know how well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely gone!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> maybe it works better if there is just a little cellulite.</li>
            <li> Also I have used almost every &amp;#34;Firm&amp;#34; cream or treatment there is on the market and haven&#x27;t had nearly the results as this Product!!</li>
            <li> This product is not only good for its stated purpose, but also generally firms skin in other areas, like the neck.</li>
            <li> Exercising helped minimize a little, and tanning helped hide, but nothing was getting rid of the cellulite until this product. :)</li>
            <li> It has a decent smell and a tingling sensation that makes you assume it is working, but overall it really isn&#x27;t worth the asking price as it stands.</li>
            <li> I think this really works just make sure you use a little amount because this will give you the burning sensation!</li>
            <li> Tub went very quick than any other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical with this product because it does sound too good to be true, but even after a few days I see my skin feeling and looking tighter and more firm, DEFINITELY recommend!!</li>
            <li> Like every other Body Merry product I&#x27;ve purchased, the results have been very noticeable and super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed as I get older, the back of my thighs tend to show some cellulite issues, and I wanted to find just the right product to help with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell when you smell it straight out of the container, smells of soft Cologne with a hint of menthol.</li>
            <li> Directions are to apply 2X a day, preferably on dry, clean skin.</li>
            <li> My body really responds well with I natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I’m very self conscious of cellulite on my arms.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to smell like an old woman who has muscle pain.</li>
            <li> gross\\&quot; but I WAS WRONG LoL...</li>
            <li> My thighs are more firm</li>
            <li> but I assume it&#x27;s normal  </li>
            <li> Was able to notice a difference after using a few times.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I use it for a few more months I might see a difference.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to warm myself up for at least 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes after applying you will feel a cooling sensation that lasts for the better part of an hour.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for more than a few days</li>
            <li> They always say they can do the same things, but rarely can,</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve tried lots of different ones and this is the only one that has ever actually worked!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is interesting to see the results after a few weeks</li>
            <li> You put the cream on, and it takes an instant for it to be completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> Warning the cooling sensation is intense after the first use, but you get used to it after using daily.</li>
            <li> Does run out pretty fast when using twice daily.</li>
            <li> Normally I like things with menthol smells</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on my arms, as I want it to be more firm.</li>
            <li> I rarely do reviews, but this stuff actually works!</li>
            <li> received one of the products mentioned above complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care- this stuff seriously works like MAGIC!  </li>
            <li> The tingle of the menthol kept me up more than half the night!</li>
            <li> My butt and thighs look a lot more even and a lot less saggy!</li>
            <li> have tried other Body Merry products and loved them, so I tried to have an open mind when starting this about a week ago.</li>
            <li> However, I understand that certain lotions react differently for certain people</li>
            <li> i started working out eating right but felt it wasnt enough for my cellulite</li>
            <li> Got back to me right away.</li>
            <li> Right after application, you begin to feel an instant tingling.</li>
            <li> I do NOT use it twice a day, only once right after a shower &amp; still see results.  </li>
            <li> Cellulite no longer visible on back of my right thigh and</li>
            <li> SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li> are becoming less visible, I think..</li>
            <li> It feels smoother now and stretch marks are becoming less visible.</li>
            <li> They are greasy, sticky, and you have to wait a certain amount of time before you feel comfortable (i.e., dry) enough to put clothes on.</li>
            <li> These creams help reduce the appearance along with your new lifestyle.</li>
            <li> My family asked me if I bought a new perfume or something?</li>
            <li> This seems to be a relatively new product, with a diligent customer service, eager to hear from us regarding the effectiveness of the product, which is another plus.</li>
            <li> : You&#x27;ll notice a huge improvement in your skin, even after the first time you apply it, I&#x27;m just not sure you&#x27;ll notice any change in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have to say that as far as the appearance of cellulite, this product so far has not made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> (I cracked the window in our bedroom for a few minutes while I put it on), if you&#x27;re more sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It feels like tiger balm once you apply on your body, gets pretty hot &amp; icy.</li>
            <li> At first, the Icy Hot freaked me out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries while I put on my makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much makeup).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, but my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> I also commend this company for using all natural ingredients that has worked very well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> #34;firming&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after applying this product, I feel a strong cooling sensation with a slight tingle.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to just about anyone, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a menthol smell for the first hour or so after use!</li>
            <li> I imagine that if I took jello and mixed it with pudding it would look very much like this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> When I finished my first jar, knowing both customers and company indicated it may be weeks before I&#x27;d see a difference in the actual cellulite, I put in a new order for two jars.</li>
            <li> Rather than changing the cellulite slowly but steadily over time, this new cream changes it more visibly faster</li>
            <li> Cellulite Defense Gel Cream by Body Merry is not the first cellulite cream I have tried and this may just be my last.</li>
            <li> After only one week, I see a VERY NOTICABLE difference!</li>
            <li> This is a review on the delivery and first impression only.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Not long enough to see any true results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still so surprised it worked so well!</li>
            <li> At first I used it daily, but now I use it two or three times a week for maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Healthy people who are awakened avoid Japanese product due to severe radioactive pollution...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing results, interested in seeing what occurs after the 2nd</li>
            <li> I am a big skeptic when it comes to these things, but this really does work!</li>
            <li> didn’t notice everything completely go away, after all, people don’t sell miracle in a bottle for THAT wish!</li>
            <li> For the first time in years I have seen some bounce back in my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time after my shower and have continued to use after my shower daily.</li>
            <li> So I noticed a difference as well, smoother for sure, not sure on the toning aspect.</li>
            <li> ..... it&#x27;s not enough a jar of cream to see the result but used consistently with diet and exercise should work</li>
            <li> I am no longer self conscious about the backs of my legs when taking the kiddo to the pool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m losing a bit of weight (a pound or two) by eating, small, and healthy</li>
            <li> but my skin is more firm as well!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin, especially legs, look so much smoother!</li>
            <li> have used the product almost consistently every day (ONCE A DAY) only two times twice a day.</li>
            <li> It is a slow and subtle process, but I already feel much more confident about my exposed legs when I go swimming!</li>
            <li> The smell does linger in the air for a little while after applying, but (thankfully) the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to stay strong on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I have noticed less cellulite on the front of my thighs, not so much on the back even though I concentrate a little more on the back (mostly because it has been there longer than the cellulite on the front).</li>
            <li> The quick absorb and fresh 100% natural mint, green tea, lime fragrance is an added bonus too!</li>
            <li> I Have enough left for one more application but will probably not need anymore in the near future!</li>
            <li> For easy use (and not to tired out easily) I find that resting one foot on a bed or dresser and dragging it from back of the knee all the way up to the buttocks works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Almost like an intense Icy Hot or something.</li>
            <li> I think this also depends on how sensitive your skin is (my skin is very sensitive).  </li>
            <li> The cream feels very cold, like icy hot, make sure to rub it in good, I use a cellulite brush.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not a tiny girl, nor are most woman with a cellulite problem, so the jar doesn&#x27;t last long  </li>
            <li> The cream is infused with a refreshing 100% natural ‘mint - green tea - lime’ fragrance, that barely leaves a trace once fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (less if you are planning to use more on a larger area).  </li>
            <li> More or less the jar just needs to be bigger.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it was was kind of skeptical because it has a very medicinal smell to it, but after using it several times you get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> With this cream and a little exercise i am on my way to being cellulite free.</li>
            <li> Very light gel soaked right in and did not leave the weird sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> Besides not being very careful (I learned my lesson quick)</li>
            <li> It is for women who are relatively within their appropriate weight or BMI category, and live active lifestyles but just aren&#x27;t body builders and cannot change the low level to medium level cellulite they have.</li>
            <li> They check in with you frequently to see how the product is working.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, when I responed to an email, a real-life person got back to me within a couple of minutes!</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t tell if it works for cellulite reduction....</li>
            <li> He responded to my inquiries promptly and professionally.  </li>
            <li> but so far, I do like this product.</li>
            <li> This cream contains natural and organic ingredients including caffeine, retinol, 3 types of seaweed, and organic cayenne.</li>
            <li> And if you are looking for a product to try, I can&#x27;t see any reason early on not to try this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as often as I should, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far here are my thoughts...</li>
            <li> I will say this: If you are sensitive to caffeine, do not use this product in the evening.</li>
            <li> It seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> So far I like this cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about three weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not heavy  </li>
            <li> so so far no signs  </li>
            <li> So far I like my results</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just really sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just too sensitive to frangrances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of natural and organic ingredients including 3 types</li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t think it penetrated the skin to really do its job as I could feel the greasy film wash off my legs when I would take a shower the next day.  </li>
            <li> I could definitely be using too much but because of the substance it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I saw no difference in my body after using the whole tub.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in record time; therefore, its too early to determine if it&#x27;ll work for me at this point, but I will do a follow up {by the way</li>
            <li> I have seen a marked improvement in about 1 month.</li>
            <li> So far it appears to work.</li>
            <li> This made my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li> my husband was completely offended by it mi</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft but still have cellulite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old mom of 2.</li>
            <li> wow .</li>
            <li> and I have not seen any results so far regarding my cellulite</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I am not saying that the cellulite is gone, but its a bit lighter now, &amp; my skin feels smooth &amp; firm.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even when not applied near those areas.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is very soothing and relaxing to bust out these</li>
            <li> everything absorbs into your skin almost immediately, leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It BURNS on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I know that there is no miracle cream out there that will eliminate cellulite completely.</li>
            <li> It does not make my bumps disappear completely but it smooths out my skin and makes the bumps go away for about a week or two.</li>
            <li> I really did not expect this to do anything, but it actually reduced the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> and I thought \\&quot; wow</li>
            <li> , I am sensitive to perfumes</li>
            <li> So far it works.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel so soft and feminine</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> but,  so far NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 60s</li>
            <li> So far it does seem to be working.</li>
            <li> I was quite sceptical as to the effect this cream would have on my cellulite, and I have to say I am quite surprised.  </li>
            <li> So much so, that I would have considered using it in non-cellulite areas as a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleasantly surprised to see that this worked.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised to see that this worked.</li>
            <li> This gel cream is a natural and organic product.</li>
            <li> am 49 years old, 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; 127lb.  </li>
            <li> love all orgarnic ingredients in it, beside Japanese green tea:(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, smooth, and firm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few similar products and this one smells a lot better than most.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually have to put on a thick robe to warm up.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a creamy texture... like a thick lotion.</li>
            <li> I can tell is strong so a little goes looooong way!</li>
            <li> It is not at all sticky and just sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li> I did dry brush first then use a premier cellulite massager brush,</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other creams in the meantime, and none have been effective for me.</li>
            <li> Half Full</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too early for me to be able to tell how it works long</li>
            <li> gave the cream 2 stars because it really did not meet my expectations, although this is not due to the quality of the product but to the fact that I just didn&#x27;t have enough for a review.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks I have seen a significant difference</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny--money well spent!</li>
            <li> I recently purshased my second jar because I saw a difference with the first one.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, my initial thought was that it&#x27;s definitely lighter (in weight) than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I bought this and kept forgetting to use it at first, but now that I keep it next to the bathroom sink I&#x27;ve finally been remembering</li>
            <li> and I can definitely see the love handle area began to firm!</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on the back of my thighs and my buttocks.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, six or seven weeks ago, I received the jar with the red label and white print.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for about this product is that it has some sort of mentholated ingredient in it, and when I first used it, I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the intense icy sensation on my body!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations of this product, especially since I&#x27;ve used creams from Body Merry that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> The new cream also seemed to have higher concentrations of whatever menthol-type agent was used, and it did not leave my skin&#x27;s texture as soft as the previous cream.</li>
            <li> Dont drag it back and forth as it is important that the skin is pulled back up</li>
            <li> My cellulite might not completely disappear, but it is much smoother than it has been</li>
            <li> Plus I like that its made in USA, cruelty Free, &amp; doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> As soon as it is applied you can feel the icy hot sensation working to get rid of the fat under the skin causing the cellulite.</li>
            <li> feels like you put icy hot on your body...</li>
            <li> It sort of smells like Icy Hot Cream, if you&#x27;ve ever caught a whiff of that.</li>
            <li> Sort of like icy hot.</li>
            <li> Honestly though my only complaint is the size of this product and that it does not come in a larger size!</li>
            <li> Product is gel-like and feels like icy hot when applied.</li>
            <li> Also it smells like vapor rub and feels like icy hot when rubbed in and has a tingly feeling for about 20-30 mins.</li>
            <li> so no worries you will not smell like icy hot all day .This</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for two weeks now, and while I haven’t seen mind-blowing results in this short time, I have definitely noticed my skin is a bit tighter and more firm.</li>
            <li> Like you covered your skin with icy hot.</li>
            <li> I believe it will last a long time, but when I get down to 1/3 jar, I will order more.</li>
            <li> She only weighs 114 pounds and all the extra pounds are right in the middle.</li>
            <li> Depending on how often and how much you use will determine how long it last and most times a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Definitely cant buy a new jar every week</li>
            <li> I then received two different jars (with the new silver band on the front).</li>
            <li> This new cream&#x27;s impact on the cellulite is also different.</li>
            <li> Truly youth in a magic little bottle!!!</li>
            <li> It is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens and sulphates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like all our products, it is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a long time Amazon customer, this is first and only product I&#x27;ve ever reviewed.</li>
            <li> I have used the cream for six weeks now and have seen the difference on my skin, the elasticity, and the smooth feeling that I had been missing for quite a while are back.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight minty scent to it and makes your skin feel really fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t that I am not active.  </li>
            <li> this might actually work&amp;#34; thanks to the feeling it left after applying it on.</li>
            <li> I think my expectations were a little high with all the positive reviews that I had seen.</li>
            <li> This did a great job on the stomach and cheeks- smells bad though ( like Icy Hot)</li>
            <li> The major problem I have with this product though is the smell.</li>
            <li> I am not extremely overweight</li>
            <li> and I saw a major difference in my feet as well.</li>
            <li> I usually let it dry well before putting clothing over it to make sure the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> Tub was only half full of cream when I received it.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it has a tingling/warming effect to it, kind of like a muscle rub but as long as you don&#x27;t put too much on it doesn&#x27;t feel that bad.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, it&#x27;s had very minimal almost imperceptible results.</li>
            <li> The fragrance and the cooling action are a little offsetting at first but, after a day or two of use, I have become quite fond of both.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY reduced on the back of my left thigh.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the positive reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t generally believed that cellulite cream works</li>
            <li> so I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called cellulite and its not fun even though it isn&#x27;t deadly and most of the time we can cover it up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that is really long enough to see a real difference.</li>
            <li> Merry believes in their product but also offers 90 day money back guarantee if you do not feel like this product is working for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3X so far.  </li>
            <li> I made that mistake once and barely slept a wink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with cellulite on my legs since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li> O_o  </li>
            <li> It is the strongest stuff I&#x27;ve ever smelled and after just one use, it was enough to make me not ever want to get near it again.  </li>
            <li> and I do see the potential, therefore, I am willing to court this product a while longer to see if we can have a long lasting relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that I did not like was the scent which the company describes as &amp;#34;100% natural mint-green tea-lime&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I gave birth over 4 years ago and developed cellulite in the last couple years.</li>
            <li> Far, It looks the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times thus far.</li>
            <li> Because the cream is infused with a 100% natural ‘mint – green tea – lime’ fragrance, it smells exactly like that.</li>
            <li> It was such an Icy Hot feeling.</li>
            <li> There is a love and hate relationship with cellulite creams because many simply do not work.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin with a tingling feeling a few minutes after using which lasts for awhile but isn&#x27;t bothersome, just sort of fresh and minty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My experience with the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is one I can compare to starting a new potential relationship.</li>
            <li> cellulite cream contains active ingredients combined with Retinol, Caffeine, &amp; Seaweed, along with naturally potent ingredients such as Algae, Kelp, Coconut Oil, Cayenne &amp; Green Tea Extract.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s mostly from the cream or from a combination of other things.</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that everyone has different skin types and it might work for other and some it might not.</li>
            <li> Some actually helped and other just smelled funny.</li>
            <li> No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s helped with my cellulite because I am also using other products as well...</li>
            <li> It gets hot burning hot then cold feels like a ice hot patch</li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t really smell much other than a menthol type scent but keep in mind it is not by any means overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d keep buying it just for the scent, but at my age (42) I can&#x27;t afford to mess around ;)</li>
            <li> So when you are putting this one on be very careful not to hit lady parts that will give you a surprise and a very cooling feeling for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I will tell you what though, use this cream, drink more water, start doing squats, and start dry brushing and you will see SERIOUS improvement with your cellulite.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with cellulite but oddly enough, it did clear up a chronic rash of inflamed hair follicles I had on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> It smells like BenGay to me and I am only 27 years old so going out in public smelling like</li>
            <li> and as a busy mom, it only happens about 2 - 4 times a week TOTAL...</li>
            <li> and I have been using it near my inner thighs twice daily as directed.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting the cellulite cream to have such a weird texture and strong smell.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly with no product residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> looks a little funny</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about trying it at first just because I do not have a problem with Cellulite yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost maybe 4/5 lbs since I started using this cream, not bc of the cream obviously, but it wasn&#x27;t like I had some major weight loss in a month to skew the results.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast, I got it in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I saw results very fast within a few days.</li>
            <li> :  Also be careful if you apply it too high up</li>
            <li> I’ve always been a bit over critical of anti-cellulite lotions and creams, as cellulite is hugely genetic and the only hope I&#x27;ve ever had to getting rid of it has been hard exercise.</li>
            <li> I have recently lost 35 pounds at the age of 57 &amp; was quite dismayed to find too much loose skin on my thighs, along with some residual cellulite on the top outer thigh area &amp; abdomen, so I had to try and find a little extra help to alleviate this unsightly looking loose skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very suprise with the result especially since I have used other oils and creams, some costing over $50.</li>
            <li> I actually am almost done with the jar, unfortunately, so it&#x27;s barely a months supply.  </li>
            <li> Not sure its worth the money.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel that the gel-cream is really permeating my skin and getting down into the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I think I might need to use it a little longer than a month in order to see any positive results.</li>
            <li> Obviously I was skeptical when I first got this product, but I don&#x27;t think many women would turn down the chance at getting those supposed</li>
            <li> and it really tingles a lot, so be careful not to touch your eyes or any other sensitive areas immediately after application.</li>
            <li> Over time, the cooling sensation has become less intense</li>
            <li> Skin feels much firmer and dimples are definitely less noticeable.</li>
            <li> You really can’t go wrong when theres added potent natural and organic ingredients like algae extract, kelp, coconut oil, japanese green tea leaf extract and cayenne involved.</li>
            <li> I am really a pretty lean person but am 55 years old &amp; much of my complaint is skin laxity</li>
            <li> Hmmm... been using this pretty regularly in the mornings for a few weeks</li>
            <li> This cream has not only significantly decreased the appearance of cellulite but my skin is super soft!</li>
            <li> I feel that the first order should last 8 weeks if that is how long the average person would notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I thought I put too much on but that feeling was still there even the next time when I used half the amount.</li>
            <li> The skin is smooth and firm, the crepe skin around the knees and on the buttock area are less visible if not invisible, the appearance of cellulite is fading as well.</li>
            <li> It sokes in quickly so you do not have to wait to put on your clothes, and you feel it working long after it has dried!</li>
            <li> Smells like icy hot or some other muscle pain cream...</li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t think this would work but maybe help a little.</li>
            <li> Some other ingredients include coconut oil, sweet almond oil, vitamin e, organic cayenne, and Japanese green tea leaf extract.</li>
            <li> I apply it on the back of my legs and then really rub it in using circular motions with this little hand held rubber studded massager.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to give a fair rteview for this product as it needs to be used accordingly, and consistently for at least 4-to 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The money back guarantee was a plus for me because I was not expecting it to work (because so many other products I have tried were epic fails)</li>
            <li> After TOO much money spent on other products, I simply typed in &amp;#34;Best Cellulite Cream EVER!&amp;#34; in a search engine and this product popped up.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second round of Body Merry and am going to continue to use this product in hopes that I will finally get my body skin back to normal.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy like other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> A little of this product really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You get a whole bunch and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and like I said before, a little really stretches a long way.</li>
            <li> and like I said before, a little really stretches a long way.</li>
            <li> Body Merry&#x27;s products are reasonably priced, even this one, but this would be a pretty expensive habit.</li>
            <li> the jar came barely full and while I use it twice a day, I use just enough to spread a thin layer on my thighs...</li>
            <li> if you leave it in somewhere where it is hot just simply put in the fridge all day and then apply it as usual and it will give you that freezing effect again!</li>
            <li> i spend my hard working money on the first time and saw no results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super Cold &amp; very Stinky..</li>
            <li> After my family member tried it out for herself she said it really helped with her small cellulite issue she was dealing with.</li>
            <li> I also used Hydra Mar Cellulite Cream in the past and didn&#x27;t see much results with that.</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me though even in just a few days which I still cannot believe!</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell and feels like icy hot when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> not sure it works, its very tingly..</li>
            <li> Not sure if it even really worked</li>
            <li> I have not used it  long enough to say if it works or not, but I like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Not for long lasting purposes</li>
            <li> The cream does leave a tingling sensation after applying but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> Women have long been told that cellulite has to be a simple fact of life &amp; that nothing that we do can change that.</li>
            <li> and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> but it is certainly not as apparent as it was.  </li>
            <li> This did NOT last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because it does have a long burn.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.  </li>
            <li> It did not leave a long lasting smell</li>
            <li> Stays on the skin for a long time and you only need to apply once or twice.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it for long enough, I will use it longer.</li>
            <li> The cream looks thicker in the jar but actually goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> The gel was pretty thick</li>
            <li> I am actually saving it to see if I can tolerate it better during a hot CA summer day because right now it is too cold to put on with the cold winter</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little less expensive but overall good product.</li>
            <li> am always hesitant to try a new product for few reasons.</li>
            <li> :  If like me you find the smell is really bad (some people actually said they liked it</li>
            <li> I have an active life style, I eat the most healthy posible buit i have that horrible cellulite.</li>
            <li> This product along with the dry brushing, I do has truly reduced cellulite that I have on the back of my thighs, and bum.</li>
            <li> While it didn’t completely take away my cellulite or stretch marks, it did make them noticeably less visible.</li>
            <li> I am combining use with squats and other toning exercises that target these areas, so it&#x27;s hard to say how much success I can attribute to the cream, alone.</li>
            <li> So far its easy to apply, icy cold feeling, and smells like a lemon vapor rub (to me anyways).</li>
            <li> :  I have given this product an extra star due to the customer service I felt went above and beyond, thank you for that  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering when I will see results since I have been using the other cream for several weeks which basically has the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But using some other products in the same manner did not yield the same results as with this cream.</li>
            <li> I was not really sure about this gel but ordered it because of its high reviews.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need  alot to go far with it, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I know this is going to sound weird</li>
            <li> I have been using this product at least once a day for about 3 weeks now and have not noticed much if any of a difference.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how long the manufacture says it takes to see results.</li>
            <li> I thought this product should use long time</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s non greasy and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Cant wait for long term results.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> then it does but will try it longer and see if in the end of product that I have, if it made a difference in the long run.</li>
            <li> This product does go a long way</li>
            <li> This Cellulite Defense formula leaves my skin invigorated long after its application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally emptied the bottle after 4 weeks, and there was absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> The bottle of course I am a big fan of pink</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used long so</li>
            <li> I haven’t recommended any beauty products for you since Pregnancy &amp; Newborn Gift Set from Noodle &amp; Boo and that was a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Oh boy, I haven&#x27;t put my Post up yet, but as long as I&#x27;m here.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a strange gel.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And after you apply it and get dressed, the smell stays with you all day long.</li>
            <li> I have not had the product long</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since the skin on my thighs and butt were tightened up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and organic without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Strange smell but does seem to give some results.</li>
            <li> The scent of it is supposed to be a mix of natural mint, green tea, and lime.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced the results or noticed any small changes as most have indicated in these reviews.</li>
            <li> I am dead serious, I have been exercising and putting this cream after my workouts and my legs feel so tight and smooth!</li>
            <li> The product was tightening but only slightly and didn’t have lasting effects, ie I still have visible cellulite.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I believe the people whom have said there is a slight tingling didn&#x27;t actually apply it after showering.  </li>
            <li> I mean really how can a cream get rid of cellulite?</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I have been doing other things to help with my cellulite</li>
            <li> Great product, seems to work well, my only complaint is that my legs feel really cold for a bit after I use it!</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;ve only used it three times and already see results !</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll try other brand.</li>
            <li> only need a little bit to feel the effects, so the tub it comes in will last you awhile.</li>
            <li> But in the morning I woke up and felt very anxious, tremble, headache, and really fast heart bumping.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using it again ONLY due to the smell.</li>
            <li> Apprx two hours after application of upper legs I could feel it spreading to other areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other reviews for this product at the time, were sponsored by the company that made the product.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that say the same thing</li>
            <li> When you put it on there is a slight tingle due to the 100% natural mint.</li>
            <li> I only got a very minimal amount of uses.</li>
            <li> I have a dry patch of skin now.</li>
            <li> and it takes some time to dry.</li>
            <li> Its more of a cold burn that can last upwards of a half an hour.  </li>
            <li> Used this cream and dry brushing and the bumps went away.</li>
            <li> But after that hour, my skin was still dry, it was not moisturizing for me at all</li>
            <li> On day three, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt tighter (</li>
            <li> even when it was sealed and kept in a dry place.</li>
            <li> , it has a minty scent to it and does not take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different cellulite gels and creams and have had mixed results.</li>
            <li> so my input is limited.</li>
            <li> i could just not get rid of even with all the walking i do every single day</li>
            <li> I am unable to actually see a difference right now</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old girl with very little cellulite.</li>
            <li> Due to the fabulous reviews (something I rarely give myself) I decided to try it because I still felt a little desperate to fix the cosmetic ails that torment me!  </li>
            <li> This is another product that is going to stay in my daily rotation, no question.&lt;br /&gt;After showering, I take a little of the Cellulite Defense Cream and rub it on my upper thighs, belly and upper arms while my skin is still a little damp.</li>
            <li> However, the color of the gel differed in all three jars (ivory, white, dark cream).</li>
            <li> Aging is not fun and sometimes the signs show up sooner than later.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to contact this seller directly.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that this product was not nearly as creamy as I had expected.</li>
            <li> It did work, but not very much.  </li>
            <li> So I gave this 5 stars as you have nothing to loose ...</li>
            <li> (I’ve even noticed the skin under my butt isn’t so loose and saggy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my jeans are loose</li>
            <li> I mean I know such effects are visible only after longer usage of a product, &amp; I don&#x27;t think its psychological, &amp;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for the long term results!!</li>
            <li> not sure what the benefits are after using the whole jar except it burns a little bit</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that my jar is already empty, I only have enough cream for about another day or so.  </li>
            <li> Although I do notice a slight difference in the cellulite appearance initially (doesn&#x27;t last-I suspect this is from the caffeiine?)</li>
            <li> Just started using it so no particular results yet.</li>
            <li> I have a small amount of cellutite in the back of my legs, that I&#x27;m targeting with different workouts, diet and this cream.</li>
            <li> cellulite was noticeable less visible, but diet and exercise are also essential to improving appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> The cream leaves a slight tingle sensation but almost the same as if you were to use a peppermint or wintergreen oil on your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half, once daily, with the finulite massager mitt.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to sink in and a tingly feeling lasts long after I&#x27;m finished.  </li>
            <li> but I started seeing results after only using it for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> have been using this for about 2 weeks now, and still have half the jar left.</li>
            <li> Remember to only use small quantities and it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you are left with a warming sensation for about a half hour after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple a months and the cellulite on my thighs is less noticeable and overall smoother.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of product to put on specific areas of concern.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on a journey to tighten and tone my body after some weight loss and have a little loose skin around my butt and thighs and a bit of cellulite to get rid of .</li>
            <li> I only used it for a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> After several days of using the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream I could notice that my skin felt and looked a little</li>
            <li> just a little bit will be just enough to cover a lot.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a little over a week</li>
            <li> Texture is a bit different than what I expected and takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a product that you can&#x27;t find on stores from any other company, that will also have a bigger bottle for longer period of use, and less money.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I am on my second tub of the cellulite defense, using it regularly, and I haven&#x27;t seen hardly any results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also never had much to complain about, but pregnancy does some weird things to your body, and mine left me with dreaded cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday, usually only once a day, for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the cream with a massager for a few days</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but 4 times, so results are minimal but it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few days</li>
            <li> Went through it in about 2-3 weeks &amp; had absolutely no results during that time.</li>
            <li> The results are minimal after 2 months.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working with only a few days use, per my wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this cream for about a month now, I haven&#x27;t used it every day, but I do see minimal results from what I have used.</li>
            <li> The product would work for a few weeks and then either my body just adjusted to it or it was only a temporary fix.  </li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend, who sees me everyday said the same thing.</li>
            <li> After I ordered the product, the Founder &amp; Director reached out to me to provide guidance on how this product should be used and also checked back with me a few weeks after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caffeine, Retinol, different seaweeds, organic cayenne and green tea.</li>
            <li> cream is not really a cream it is a brown gel</li>
            <li> only takes a few minutes per thigh.</li>
            <li> but it can be alarming to some.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40, working out everyday</li>
            <li> I did however notice as others have mentioned, that the cream seems to evaporate some, even if you keep the cap tightly closed.</li>
            <li> and my jar is almost empty now</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and applied the cream religously twice a day (morning and night) until the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected reading all the reviews, I work out out 3 days a week and still didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> The product arrived empty and used.</li>
            <li> and I see absolutely no results....</li>
            <li> I loved the tingly feeling though, but the smell got a bit sickening after a while.</li>
            <li> it does have a vapor/menthol smell to it, but it does fade quickly &amp; its not that bad (at least it doesn&#x27;t stink ; )</li>
            <li> This means a little bit of this gel-cream goes a long way so you will only need a little bit</li>
            <li> Even my co-workers commnented about it and said it was strong and unpleasant (embarrased).  </li>
            <li> A little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have been having major sleep issues lately and couldn&#x27;t understand why I was not sleeping at night, than it dong on me that its probably from the caffeine in this product since you are supposed to put it on at night time as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only thing you need to do is be careful because it is a little slippery, so take little amounts at a time to conserve product and minimize wasting.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So a little bit can go a long ways if you are using it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that a little bit goes a long way, with this product.</li>
            <li> a little bit of product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and a little tingly, the latter of which dissipates after about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The cream made my legs very soft, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make the cellulite on my legs look any better :(</li>
            <li> Today I tried the other one, Cellulite defense gel-cream with retinol, caffeine and seaweed by Body Merry.</li>
            <li> it does have a tingling sensation every time I apply and that&#x27;s something other cellulite products didn&#x27;t have...</li>
            <li> The seaweed \\&quot;helps in firming and toning\\&quot; and the cayenne \\&quot;provides a spicy twist and helps in circulation and reducing the storage of fat.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened this and applied a small amount on my upper thighs.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any long term differences after using this product for a few weeks, but I feel like for a temporary fix</li>
            <li> i love the cold feeling!</li>
            <li> It did not work for me, but maybe it works for other people.</li>
            <li> I do not expect miracles from this or any other cream out there</li>
            <li> I bought it along with a cellulite massage brush because all of the other reviews recommended it.  </li>
            <li> I stand by all the other reviews 10000%.  </li>
            <li> cream contains caffeine ,retinol and seaweed among other ingridents.</li>
            <li> Other than that this cream helps and works, keep in mind</li>
            <li> I also noticed that other customers raved about their customer service and return policy, so I knew that if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days, but I like the feel of it already!  </li>
            <li> any other cream I have ever tried</li>
            <li> and like the seller told me, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously for the past two weeks, morning and evening</li>
            <li> Recently started using the product and I&#x27;m not sure of how well it will work.  </li>
            <li> but I purchased this cream due to the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this hasn&#x27;t worked for other people</li>
            <li> No results other than that.</li>
            <li> I have been using the other product for stretch mark</li>
            <li> you run the risk of feeling over stimulated in other areas.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; feel is stronger than any other product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m still not used to it after a month.  </li>
            <li> After trying other cellulite creams I would have to say this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similiar products</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, there is an overpowering minty scent to this product.  </li>
            <li> I measured around the arm and there was a decrease in size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try this on other areas to see the results I get there.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working yet only had for a week</li>
            <li> The only product I found that worked for me in the past was St. Ives cellulite shield, which seems to have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Perhaps for other people.</li>
            <li> it was extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> I now will have to check what other products</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, I  have been using this now for 2 solid weeks and the cream is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to get rid of cellulite, but with this cream I am willing to put the effort because it eases the effort.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put it on in the morning like you do with other cellulite creams or you will smell like you bathed Bengay.</li>
            <li> Unless it just out does my other products I get from Amazon based on the smell</li>
            <li> cellulite-gel is made with caffeine, three types of seaweed and other ingredients that are proven to help any and all appearances of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> My cellulite is not completely gone, but less defined and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I even had little trouble breathing properly.</li>
            <li> I am no brave enough to post pictures of my results like some other people, but I can definitely tell the difference in the backs of my legs where I used the product!</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes for each thigh and use the dry brushing technique, massaging/stroking upward toward heart (for lymphatic system).</li>
            <li> I am a tiny girl or what you could call Thim Slick (Slim Thick - as used in urban context).</li>
            <li> The smell was a little much, it smelled like vics which isn&#x27;t terrible but can be strong.</li>
            <li> I was super mad when I ran out of the product.</li>
            <li> The only negative about this product is the smell but that wouldn&#x27;t deter me from ordering it again (assuming it works).  </li>
            <li> I was wrong, thanks</li>
            <li> Tbh, maybe it really depends on the person but sadly, it did not work on me as I wished it to.</li>
            <li> Third, all these types of products are very expensive when you consider how much you need to use them ...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a change sadly..</li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a day, if possible, but trying for at least once per day.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, finished one jar and absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> It seems to work, albeit slowly, but I believe that with regular use, it will improve the look of the skin in the cellulite areas.</li>
            <li> If you have grandparents, Bengay smells far worse.</li>
            <li> It has been slow, but there is definite noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, just a little strong.</li>
            <li> Even if it does work it&#x27;s not worth the extreme discomfort to get the results!</li>
            <li> but I was let down.</li>
            <li> and then it will begin to die down.</li>
            <li> so I would just run the tips of my fingers up and down my thighs for awhile.</li>
            <li> The other day it actually caused me to break out in an angry, red rash.</li>
            <li> I mean the very second you rub it into your skin, you can feel the caffeine in it.</li>
            <li> I have always been a big fan of Body Merry, as all their products that I have tried in the past has worked well for me - this cellulite cream is no exception!</li>
            <li> I know crazy right ?</li>
            <li> usually am finishing off my morning or evening routine as I let it dry.</li>
            <li> I started noticing cellulite and really dry skin the past year on my thighs.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money like all the other creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> i dont have a lot of cellulite but the dimples are less noticeable since using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used over half of the container and see no results.</li>
            <li> I have to say, a lot of the cellulite marks have become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Maybe a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I am in the gym 5 to 6 times a week and drink anywhere from a gallon to a gallon and a half a day.</li>
            <li> After about 2.5 weeks I started noticing that my cellulite was much less noticeable</li>
            <li> Worked almost immediately, skin is tighter and smoother with much less dimples.</li>
            <li> girls need to realize that there is no quick fix for cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 and a half weeks</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll follow up in a month or two about if it makes my cellulite less noticeable;0)</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month and the result is not extraordinary.</li>
            <li> in all, I didn&#x27;t see any wonder results, it run out after less than a month of use, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My skin is slightly smoother.</li>
            <li> I noticed after almost 2 months that my skin and problem areas are changing and cellulite is less visible.  </li>
            <li> I typically use it at bed</li>
            <li> and my cellulite was less visible.</li>
            <li> and I’ll admit I typically use once a day after showering.</li>
            <li> I can tell it is working by the tingling and slight warming upon application.</li>
            <li> I have been using is for 2 and a half weeks not and can feel and see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will feel a slight &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
            <li> After 2 and a half weeks I have noticed smoother firmer skin.</li>
            <li> I have less &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; on my thighs from using this.</li>
            <li> but the one downside is that it kinda burns/tingles when I apply it, nothing serious enough to make me stop using it</li>
            <li> I am not in denial as I have said in my other Cellulite Cream reviews that a cream cannot get rid of cellulite, but it CAN make it less noticeable and the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream does just that!</li>
            <li> #34;how lo n g have you been using that lotion stuff &amp;#34; I go &amp;#34;about week and a half maybe w&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It sorta smells like ouzo or black liqorice but stronger with menthol undertones.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight cooling and tingling feeling when you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li> My problem area looks less lumpy than before.</li>
            <li> and I can see a slightly difference.</li>
            <li> The cream is like half cream half gel consistency.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t eat McD&#x27;s everyday and do nothing active with your life and expect a cream to solve all your cellulite problems.</li>
            <li> It came to me in the prettiest little box, and in the box was your typical ‘face-cream’ jar.</li>
            <li> n tight..</li>
            <li> After application I notice that my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or oily and it leaves your skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li> It feels like icy hot which isn&#x27;t a bad thing</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the menthol that was in the cream or that the ingredients listed on the front of the jar where way down on the actual ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> I am a believer that every little bit counts, so I will keep you posted about my progress (and the cream&#x27;s effect).</li>
            <li> However, it did tighten up my legs a little.</li>
            <li> little watery, so u may have to apply two layers so it can absorb through the skin</li>
            <li> I was getting little dimples, I didn&#x27;t like seeing them.</li>
            <li> BUT the amount of it is SO LITTLE</li>
            <li> Exercising a little and drinking plenty of water will help you way faster to achieve your goal.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll keep trying for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little mentholish.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a sassy little thing like her mama</li>
            <li> and I can already notice less cellulite in less than a month!</li>
            <li> Just a little background onme.....</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s gel-like, a little bit goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> After a couple das I noticed my skin was smoother and a little tighter</li>
            <li> not sure if it works as much as other people say but need to give it time to see if i see a change</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I read that it tightens the skin.</li>
            <li> It takes a little work to get out of the jar since the texture is a little slimy and doesn&#x27;t want to stay on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit</li>
            <li> I have seen a little bit of difference.</li>
            <li> I have to go into detail on this one because i had a little bit on my one calf</li>
            <li> it tingles for a little while</li>
            <li> Burns a little though.</li>
            <li> so somehow I think we can all manage a little mint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month......</li>
            <li> I thought some cream would get rid of what little cellulite I have</li>
            <li> This gel-cream didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I saw absolutely no difference after using the entire jar.</li>
            <li> While I have not had dramatic results, I am starting to notice a slight difference.</li>
            <li> WASTE MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, every day, with a cellulite massager, and nothing has ever worked like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be adding this to my everyday beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks...</li>
            <li> you apply Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream to your skin if you give it a few minutes</li>
            <li> It could firm the skin and hide any patches one may have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This product it to help firm the problem areas.</li>
            <li> Keep this in mind when trying this product; don&#x27;t give up if you cannot see results after a few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> When using, I take a few minutes to use the Premier Cellulite Massager Brush with it....</li>
            <li> I will post pics after a few weeks to update my review.</li>
            <li> Ive been using cellulite creme for a few weeks</li>
            <li> These ingridents help firm, tighten your skin and make it feel smoother.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money, would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I will say that the few days I did, I seen a reduction in the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money..</li>
            <li> hope they will replace it to another green tea.</li>
            <li> The cream has helped firm up the problem areas on my thighs, and it seems the longer</li>
            <li> I put this cream on morning and night everyday</li>
            <li> I think it might&#x27;ve actually made my buttocks look worse than how it was before I started using this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ,doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I have being using this product for a few days now with a cellulite brush</li>
            <li> All working together to firm, tone, improve circulation, and improve the appearance of the texture of our skin.</li>
            <li> I have gotten to try a few cellulite creams and this one threw me for a loop.  </li>
            <li> but you can feel it cooling you skin in just a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You will notice changes within a few days.</li>
            <li> but after approximately 2 weeks I started noticing that my skin was not only tighter but smoother.</li>
            <li> My goal was to find a product to firm the skin on my stomach (from having children and aging).</li>
            <li> She has tried it for a few days and has already noticed it working.</li>
            <li> And all I can say is that this product was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Plus they don’t make their product with any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> After a few days I kept watching the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Wait a few days...</li>
            <li> I use it once a day a few times a</li>
            <li> After losing 136 pounds I have a lot of sagging uneven skin.</li>
            <li> like that it has a mint, green tea and lime fragrance.</li>
            <li> been using twice a day everyday and have saw no change</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few week now &amp;amp; I wish I had taken a picture of my thighs and butt, not that anyone would want to see me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my dry/cracked feet a few times</li>
            <li> (Gone in a few weeks)</li>
            <li> Used for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I thought the product worked well except it seemed to disappear in the jar everyday ( evaporate)</li>
            <li> There is also no oily or greasy feeling left behind after applying this.</li>
            <li> There is also no oily or greasy feeling left behind after applying this.</li>
            <li> it even seems improved from the previous cream ordered!</li>
            <li> so this may work for someone else but be aware that it has a very icy, cooling effect and it will be very uncomfortable if you accidently get in on body parts that you didn&#x27;t mean to get it on.  </li>
            <li> (my first jar I got earlier in the year and a cold winter made this cream uncomfortable, felt like I was getting frost bite)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> after the cooling went away I was left with a slight chilling burn...</li>
            <li> For one, the color is a disturbing beige (the previous one was white; was this intended to give customers a visible sense of the caffeine content?</li>
            <li> Burns when you put on tight clothing after use (Can you say leggings of fire?!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about its long-term affect, but it makes a noticeable difference within a few minutes upon application.</li>
            <li> thighs area for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel-cream for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> Not particularly because it&#x27;s a bad product, rather because I can find the same for A LOT less.</li>
            <li> have recently been out of the gym due to a cold</li>
            <li> have recently been out of the gym due to a cold</li>
            <li> This product did very little for me.</li>
            <li> Not really a deal breaker or even a serious negative, but it isn&#x27;t what I would ever imagine</li>
            <li> I have had bad cellulite for almost 10 years and nothing has ever really worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like using anything that smells badly to me, but this did help firm up the couple of small cellulite spots I had forming on my leg.</li>
            <li> that is not appealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review items on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to get rid of it...</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother and I did notice a small change in the texture of my buttocks and thighs where I was applying the product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to find out if the product worked because the container was so small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure that it is working for me.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a small difference in my cellulite when I used as directed.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works for me.  </li>
            <li> but im not sure if I see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure if this worked or not.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product as I have tried any other brand and failed!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works</li>
            <li> No more lumps and bumps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It may work but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if my cellulite has diminished......</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> No more cellulite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy and leaves absolutely no residue behind -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried firming lotions in the past with no results.</li>
            <li> I was told by my doctor the only fix would be expensive surgery</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month</li>
            <li> I do have to say, however that I have also been taking Metagenics CLA, so I&#x27;m  not sure if that is enhancing the results.  </li>
            <li> if you can get past that then you have to deal with the scent.</li>
            <li> My skin has a smoother appearance and no more lumps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time for these things</li>
            <li> I was unable to use it enough to determine if it worked.</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> I have really really really really bad cellulite I had used these diet pills they helped to loose weight but left lumps in my legs like I had liposuction</li>
            <li> And it may sting a bit for a very few seconds.</li>
            <li> less cellulite! !</li>
            <li> and I can already see a slight difference!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but was definitely pleasantly surprised with the results!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended it for women with bad cellulite and want to see results.</li>
            <li> i mean its like mint and seaweed its really just not that bad.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thin to average build.</li>
            <li> I usually wait for at least 5 minutes before I put on clothes to give it some time to absorb.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my cellulite either :(  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, has a horrible smell and it feels like your putting Icy hot on your thighs.</li>
            <li> and it just creates this weird and unpleasant smell that I just don&#x27;t want to deal with right now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find people/companies who do that nowdays</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with my hard earn money.</li>
            <li> Companies hardly EVER do that, so I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hard on my self as all women are and wanted to start defending against it now.  </li>
            <li> With all that, I still had cellulite and just felt my body wasn&#x27;t showing all the hard work I was putting in.  </li>
            <li> When you put it on feels exactly like ICYHOT patches, very unpleasant for at least 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a wide array of products from drug store to expensive department store creams but this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> , you need to use for at least 4-5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I know that’s common to gel type creams.</li>
            <li> The Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream seems to be sanding away at my skin to at least give it the appearance of smoothing and feeling nicer.</li>
            <li> I became frustrated because that was hundreds of dollars I was spending on something that simply camouflaged the problem until its too late for me to realize that I just wasted money.  </li>
            <li> was told give it at least 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It was so cold that I had to go outside of my home</li>
            <li> I was freezing for at least 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> but I think if it lasted at least two weeks I would have seen a change.</li>
            <li> I do not have anything negative to say about this cream.</li>
            <li> At least I couldn&#x27;t smell it, I hope no one else could.</li>
            <li> I honestly am not fond of the appearance or smell of this.</li>
            <li> and i was perturbed to say the least, anyway when i got it i opened the seal and stuck my nose to it, ever done that to see what stuff smells like?</li>
            <li> It has a cooling sensation when you apply it and warms up some afterwards for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li> cellulite cream is thick and has a beige/cream color and comes in a 4 fl.</li>
            <li> The cream is not sticky or thick.</li>
            <li> So I started using this product and with in the month I noticed they were slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> Slow</li>
            <li> It has a thick type feeling to it.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels like set pudding to me, but doesn&#x27;t apply thick and gooey at all.</li>
            <li> What I do know, is that when you apply this to any part of your body you need to know that your body part will become excruciatingly cold for the next fifteen to thirty minutes, so do not plan on doing anything after applying other than cuddling under a blanket.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Know what I mean?  </li>
            <li> I have NOT noticed any discernable benefit to my abdominal area yet, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I won&#x27;t continue to give it time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because I simply don&#x27;t have enough product to use to see any results....</li>
            <li> It has a menty cool smell to it not nothing outrageous.  </li>
            <li> It has that cold feeling after you put it on so just as the directions said I let it dry.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> i ended up with mild cellulite &amp; it was time i do something about it before it gets worst</li>
            <li> and sometimes that gets a little uncomfortable</li>
            <li> have always been a little skeptical of products like this.</li>
            <li> Not good I did not see difference .</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Product not good.</li>
            <li> I tried a few times, but the smell and texture is so weird.</li>
            <li> It is not too thin and not too thick with sort of pudding consistency.</li>
            <li> it looks like it has potential :(</li>
            <li> It must be working or doing something at least!</li>
            <li> When I first received cream I tried it out and found it smelled terrible.  </li>
            <li> but this cream makes your entire body freezing cold to the point that you feel hypothermic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s freezing cold and stays for about half an hour.</li>
            <li> I used it about half a dozen times but stopped because the menthol in it gives almost a cold burning sensation.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel cold and tight after applying it</li>
            <li> Most cellulite creams have a horrible smell and I did not think this one was bad at all.</li>
            <li> I was shocked because my package arrived before the expected date, which was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I became addicted to this product the minute I pulled it out and opened the jar.  </li>
            <li> however I am by no means thin.  </li>
            <li> For those that it works for I envy you and wish I knew what your secret was.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 5-6 weeks now and the region I am using it for is from knee up to the buttock area.</li>
            <li> and it burrns like crazy for a few minutes after you apply.</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to this brand.</li>
            <li> and i am really not happy...</li>
            <li> That shows me a company that stands behind its product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> have been using the cream, in a thin layer as advised by the company, in conjunction with a massage cellulite brush.  </li>
            <li> The sensation after about 5 minutes is a little uncomfortable, because the cream has a tingling and cooling effect, and I am always freezing after!  </li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed that it is suggested to use it for at least 8 weeks to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the brush - seems like it might work but not sure as it was cold</li>
            <li> and I have achieved dramatic results.</li>
            <li> but I still say dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> however, I did notice my skin looking and feeling tighter almost immediately after the gel dried and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I used it morning and night, and didn&#x27;t notice even a slight change :(</li>
            <li> tell me the results they received for cellulite &amp; sagging wrinkled aging skin, for I cannot use green tea as it agitates the autoimmune disorder ankylosing spondylitis that I have :(</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical and dealt with cellulite for a long time, but I was desperate and decided to give it a try!</li>
            <li> but when I gained weight with my three pregnancies and it&#x27;s have been difficult for me to eliminate this condition.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I have  been waiting to see results</li>
            <li> (I may be weird, but I like the</li>
            <li> Im sad and dissapointed</li>
            <li> I am a skinny girl, but unfortunately i suffer from cellulite around the thighs.</li>
            <li> sadly</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be sad when I run out</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t see any difference in the appearance of cellulite with this cream</li>
            <li> Before I tried this I was really skeptical that it would do anything to help reduce cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any changes as some have claimed it&#x27;s been about two month</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s weird...</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve searched some products for eliminate cellulite too expensive or others didnt work at all, and</li>
            <li> but I was wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> Let me just say I have always been skeptical of cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> It feels weird.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how some ppl can say that it works, sorry</li>
            <li> Sorry to say.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a weird itchy rash.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I like the way that my skin is responding.</li>
            <li> Sounds weird</li>
            <li> wrong thing to do.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you give this a try if you do not like it or feel it does not work for your troubled areas</li>
            <li> I should have taken picture before and after but I unfortunately did not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is a weird gel cream hybrid</li>
            <li> I took before and after pictures to measure my progress, but unfortunately I saw no visible changes in the appearance of my celllulite in my &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photos.  </li>
            <li> Cellulite&#x27;s still here, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> it was uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Some people&#x27;s reviews on here are a bit absurd.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I would need 4 jars of cream to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On the bad side, the cream is very small for the money.</li>
            <li> Never have purchased a cellulite cream and was skeptical but desperate.</li>
            <li> every other cellulite cream smells TERRIBLE</li>
            <li> In fact I have reviewed cellulite creams that  I have hated in the past.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo cold.</li>
            <li> and im unhappy</li>
            <li> This cream has A LOT of menthol in it as it&#x27;s really cold when it goes on for about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> After applying it my skin starts to feel really cold.  </li>
            <li> but it gets cold at night time.</li>
            <li> and it was ice burning cold on my skin for what seemed like an hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a cold sweat feeling.</li>
            <li> If not just a cold feeling.</li>
            <li> And while massaging, it gives off a spicy cold feeling, burning &amp; toning your cellulite whilst the process.</li>
            <li> Once you are  done, the cold sensation is still there, going stronger and stronger for about 20-30 minutes</li>
            <li> and so it is dangerous to keep on with that process.</li>
            <li> I had some lumps and bumps and looking for something to help, because working out isn&#x27;t just cutting it.</li>
            <li> afraid, there is no miracle, in a bottle, for this skin problem.</li>
            <li> makes your body feel cold but goes away in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream  is here to prove that wrong!</li>
            <li> I paid for this product and after using it I am no longer skeptical!  </li>
            <li> I tried to use this product for a week and couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible medicine smell</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin either unfortunately!</li>
            <li> It had a unpleasant medicine odor that lingered.  </li>
            <li> That stuff stinks really bad and goes on sticky and stays sticky.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant  at all.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t unpleasant but a menthol type smell that reminds me of vapor rub in the winter.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical in the beginning</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to describe the consistency of this product, and I feel &amp;#34;gel-cream&amp;#34</li>
            <li> bc cellulite is very difficult to fight.</li>
            <li> VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE MINUTES</li>
            <li> I feel bad b/c</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not like I have  a bad shape</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells really bad</li>
            <li> I have been applying this cream on my bad arm and shoulder and then putting the compression band over it.</li>
            <li> I have a bad case, so</li>
            <li> but  I figure if it smells bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a bad issue with cellulite</li>
            <li> It does not burn but does tingle (not in a bad way)</li>
            <li> they smell like the product for awhile---- which isnt a bad smell by the way, some people are freaking out over the smell--</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> I was so shocked and so appreciative.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I am beyond myself and so shocked.  </li>
            <li> its is so ugly,</li>
            <li> I was shocked but must say I am truly a fan and cant imagine being without</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Not a slightest change disappointed</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t tone at all either. :(</li>
            <li> :(((</li>
            <li> Disappointed.............</li>
            <li> I was disappointed I could not continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is so disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> VERY COLD</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate the menthol smell though, smells like Vic&#x27;s vapor run and feels like ice where ever you put it.</li>
            <li> Hate the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I hate my cellulite</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but all my bumps on my thigh are gone!  </li>
            <li> (that can be very unpleasant).</li>
            <li> The one you want to breathe in when your sick and feel awful, I kept wanting to smell it.</li>
            <li> However, the worst part about this stuff is that it makes you very cold for about 30-45 minutes...</li>
            <li> I have also been doing squats and lunges, hoping to find a way to get rid of the much hated cottage cheese.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> It was very cold!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is AWFUL and it does not ease up with time.</li>
            <li> I hope to almost erradicate this horrible condition.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything at all but smell horrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, not to mention the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> After having a child cellulite just popped up terribly fierce!</li>
            <li> However i had terrible cellulite</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, very disappointed, Ladies please save your money!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my stomach where my Mommyhood stretch marks are the worst.  </li>
            <li> This formula is cram packed with all the goodness you would want in a Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream without all those nasty chemical fillers.</li>
            <li> It looked horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a MUST HAVE! ! I&#x27;ve now been using this for a month with great results. My thighs are more firm n tight.. i have recieved compliments that i look more toned def  less cellulite! ! Within first week or two.I&#x27;m getting another jar!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but this is an excellent product from an even better company. I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday, usually only once a day, for about 6 weeks. My problem areas are mainly my upper thighs and butt. This product has no doubt helped me achieve smoother, tighter skin. I am combining use with squats and other toning exercises that target these areas, so it&#x27;s hard to say how much success I can attribute to the cream, alone. However I am certain that it has helped! My main reason for reviewing is that this is an outstanding company! They check in with you frequently to see how the product is working. Much to my surprise, when I responed to an email, a real-life person got back to me within a couple of minutes! They truly want you to be pleased with the product and want to help. If you aren&#x27;t satisfied- you can get a hassle-free refund, so it&#x27;s risk free!</li>
            <li> I was sent the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream by Body Merry for free to test and give my honest opinion on. I did NOT like this product at all. The product was tightening but only slightly and didn’t have lasting effects, ie I still have visible cellulite. The major problem I have with this product though is the smell. The smell of this product is AWFUL and it does not ease up with time. It smells like BenGay to me and I am only 27 years old so going out in public smelling like that is not appealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this product a 3 out of 10 stars for giving some tightening but the smell ruined any chance I had of wanting to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> awesome product - can feel it working as soon as I put it on. Skin has a warming sensation - hopefully I see some results :)</li>
            <li> Cellulite Defense Gel Cream by Body Merry is not the first cellulite cream I have tried and this may just be my last. I enjoyed using it and will continue to use it. I am a tiny girl or what you could call Thim Slick (Slim Thick - as used in urban context). I do have cellulite and no I do not like it nor do I like to see it. After having my second kid I realized that it is all over my thighs, butt and yes even my tummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cellulite cream contains active ingredients combined with Retinol, Caffeine, &amp; Seaweed, along with naturally potent ingredients such as Algae, Kelp, Coconut Oil, Cayenne &amp; Green Tea Extract. It is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens and sulphates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cellulite cream is thick and has a beige/cream color and comes in a 4 fl. oz jar. Depending on how often and how much you use will determine how long it last and most times a little does go a long way. I have targeted my use to only my thighs, butt and tummy. From before application you will notice it has a strong minty smell which I enjoy because I love the smell of mint and find it to be invigorating. As soon as it is applied you can feel the icy hot sensation working to get rid of the fat under the skin causing the cellulite. It also absorbs into the skin quick enough and does not remain greasy or leave any residue. Daily use would be required to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry believes in their product but also offers 90 day money back guarantee if you do not feel like this product is working for you. 90 days is more than enough time to see results.</li>
            <li> well... I&#x27;d like to say this product works but the jar only came with enough product to use for about a week - two weeks so I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results.  I like how it feels on my skin and my skin feels smooth afterwards.  So far I can&#x27;t tell if it works for cellulite reduction....I&#x27;m very disappointed because I simply don&#x27;t have enough product to use to see any results.... the jar came barely full and while I use it twice a day, I use just enough to spread a thin layer on my thighs...I&#x27;ve only had the jar for about a week and it&#x27;s almost done!  I don&#x27;t use too much of it at all.... it would be nice if the jar was bigger or if they gave more product in the jar....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference. I have a dry patch of skin now.</li>
            <li> Works Great Absorbs Quickly No Sticky Feeling! I Notice A Visible Difference In My Skin Within The First Two Weeks. Great Gift Idea For Anyone Who Struggles With Cellulite.</li>
            <li> First of all, compliments and thanks to the GM of this company.  He responded to my inquiries promptly and professionally.  With the massager, I can see that the cellulites at the back of my thigh disappearing and looking smoother.  I&#x27;ve only used it 3X so far.  For easy use (and not to tired out easily) I find that resting one foot on a bed or dresser and dragging it from back of the knee all the way up to the buttocks works wonders.  Be sure to keep dragging one way UP. Dont drag it back and forth as it is important that the skin is pulled back up where it is supposed to be.  I can wear shorts and short skirts again.</li>
            <li> First use and I am already loving it, I can&#x27;t wait to see final results! Tip: water and work out does really help to get results faster</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Probably need to try more for longer to see some results,but I&#x27;ll save money.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I was VERY skeptical and dealt with cellulite for a long time, but I was desperate and decided to give it a try! I was shocked and so was my husband! I love this stuff! Definitely ordering more! Check out my before and after pics!&lt;br /&gt;FYI- I have also incorporated a lot of squats and leg/butt work outs also to help</li>
            <li> the cooling sensation is intense and lasts quite a while. i was not expecting that but the product itself works ok. i dont have a lot of cellulite but the dimples are less noticeable since using it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 1/2 weeks. Although I do notice a slight difference in the cellulite appearance initially (doesn&#x27;t last-I suspect this is from the caffeiine?) I don&#x27;t see anything in 2 1/2 weeks that I would say is exceptional nor do I expect a miracle in that short amount of time.  I am really a pretty lean person but am 55 years old &amp; much of my complaint is skin laxity therefore i don&#x27;t think this product really addresses that issue. I will probably repurchase this in order to try for a full 2-3 months before making up my mind. I use on my thighs/quads &amp; upper arms &amp; expect one jar will last a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used over half of the container and see no results. There is a tingling effect after using that makes you feel like its working but I have taken before and after pictures and see no difference. However, I understand that certain lotions react differently for certain people so I can&#x27;t say whether the product is a dud or if it just doesn&#x27;t work with me. Depending on the smoothness of the return of the product and the interaction with the sellers I will raise the rating on this product.</li>
            <li> hate it. WASTE MY MONEY. I workout 5 times a week and always and I dont see THIS GEL-CREAM works at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely works! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, every day, with a cellulite massager, and nothing has ever worked like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell and tingly feeling takes a little getting used to, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not knowing what to expect.  I used it the minute I received it.  I have noticed a big difference in my cellulite.  I will most definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement and smells like Bengay. Sorry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review items on Amazon but this is worth it. I&#x27;ve used a wide array of products from drug store to expensive department store creams but this one takes the cake. I saw a difference within 2 weeks (while maintaining a healthy diet and exercising). I will be adding this to my everyday beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Incredible!!! I bought two different creams for better result. The one I used since purchase was like body lotion. Today I tried the other one, Cellulite defense gel-cream with retinol, caffeine and seaweed by Body Merry. Retinol gives cool effect, but it feels like burning))) cool burning. I know it won&#x27;t cool to death my cellulite but I like the feeling it provides, I like post effect. thank you</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this by far has to be the best ,seeing good results in only rwo weeks,love this product reasonable price..definitely ordering more</li>
            <li> excellent product  does as advertises</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks I have noticed a tighter look and feel and reduction in cellulite on back of my legs.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for one week, after my workout at the gym, it has a refreshing tingling sensation immediately after application and I love it. I am a believer that every little bit counts, so I will keep you posted about my progress (and the cream&#x27;s effect).</li>
            <li> It feela like you applied icyhot, it stings&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t use it after the second time.</li>
            <li> this feels really tingly and great after shower. It feels good and I believe it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I recently purshased my second jar because I saw a difference with the first one. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything against cellulite and I feel that with this product I really have a defense against cellulite. I hope to almost erradicate this horrible condition. I excercise frequently and eat healthy but when I gained weight with my three pregnancies and it&#x27;s have been difficult for me to eliminate this condition.  Thanks for helping us in this adventure.</li>
            <li> Not working for me.. I want to try different product now, this just not for me. Any recommendation anybody?</li>
            <li> Used the entire jar. No difference. However, the worst part about this stuff is that it makes you very cold for about 30-45 minutes...feels like you put icy hot on your body...so the area is FREEZING. I made the mistake of putting it on my arms, legs and chest before bed one night and I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep. I was sooooo cold. Smells like icy hot or some other muscle pain cream...so I could never use it in the morning...I didn&#x27;t want to smell like bengay all day. Sorry...the only thing that seemed to help reduce the lines and cellulite for me is lotion with self-tanner...that gradually makes you tan. I am 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; and about 140 lbs...so I&#x27;m thin to average build. I&#x27;m not overweight, but some of us unlucky folks get cellulite. I&#x27;m not sure how to get rid of it...so I use the tanning type lotion and it definitely makes it look better.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have  been waiting to see results but I can say that some other more affordable products had better results.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the tingling feeling but it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  Actually I use it for my neck and face.  And that nice cooling effect has is awesome.  My skin looks better in the&lt;br /&gt;morning.  This is a keeper!!</li>
            <li> You can feel it tingle! No results yet but you can feel it tingle! Seems like it may work!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks... Can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s helped with my cellulite because I am also using other products as well...it does have a tingling sensation every time I apply and that&#x27;s something other cellulite products didn&#x27;t have...it does take up to 8 weeks of consistently applying this product to see results so I will continue to use but so far, I do like this product.</li>
            <li> It did work, but not very much.  I was not happy with the menthol that was in the cream or that the ingredients listed on the front of the jar where way down on the actual ingredient list.  It had a unpleasant medicine odor that lingered.  I will finish using the product but not purchase anymore of it.</li>
            <li> This cream contains natural and organic ingredients including caffeine, retinol, 3 types of seaweed, and organic cayenne. The seaweed \\&quot;helps in firming and toning\\&quot; and the cayenne \\&quot;provides a spicy twist and helps in circulation and reducing the storage of fat.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened this and applied a small amount on my upper thighs. I noticed that this product was not nearly as creamy as I had expected. It absorbs easily which makes it easy to get dressed quickly after applying it. If your anything like me and always in a hurry, this is a big bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product only once a day for about two weeks. I have to say that as far as the appearance of cellulite, this product so far has not made much of a difference. I probably need to continue using this product to see those results. I can however feel my skin is tighter after applying and overall feels softer. I hope to see more results with continued use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product that goes a long way and the fragrance is divine.  Just started using it so no particular results yet.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me. I used it faithfully twice a day and see no difference.</li>
            <li> I Love how this product goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly. I have not used it  long enough to say if it works or not, but I like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and do not see a difference.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting the cellulite cream to have such a weird texture and strong smell. It has a very strong menthol smell to it. The texture is also different because instead of being a regular cream, it is more like a gel/cream mix consistency. It&#x27;s a little strange to be completely honest LOL. However, it did tighten up my legs a little. I only used it for a little over 2 weeks and they say to see real results from any type of serum, cream, oil, etc, you need to use for at least 4-5 weeks. It makes my skin feel cold and tight after applying it so maybe that&#x27;s the feeling of it working LOL!</li>
            <li> First off, I can&#x27;t say this works (yet) - I have only been using it for one week but if you&#x27;re thinking about ordering it and trying it yourself, here&#x27;s the scoop.  You don&#x27;t need  alot to go far with it, a little goes a long way so the 4 oz will probably last me several weeks (less if you are planning to use more on a larger area).  It&#x27;s a jelly-like consistency (&amp;#34;gel-cream&amp;#34;) and it rubs into the skin really well.  As for smell, it does have menthol in it so it smells a bit like icy-hot (it also gives that warm/cold tingling feeling for the first 2 minutes or so).  I usually let it dry well before putting clothing over it to make sure the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  I am definitely going to continue trying this product until it runs out - even if it doesn&#x27;t work in the end, it isn&#x27;t doing any harm.  The only negative about this product is the smell but that wouldn&#x27;t deter me from ordering it again (assuming it works).  And if you are looking for a product to try, I can&#x27;t see any reason early on not to try this one.</li>
            <li> My experience with Body Merry cellulite defense gel-cream has been a unique one. This is my first time ever using a cellulite gel – cream, when I first applied the cream it instantly turned watery. I know that’s common to gel type creams. The smell when you smell it straight out of the container, smells of soft Cologne with a hint of menthol. I found it quite enjoyable, I’m the type of girl who could sniff chest rubs and muscle rubs all day. I find it very soothing and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the gel is very refreshing. I was using the gel on my back upper thighs. The part that you see when you wear shorts. Since having children, this has been my problem area for cellulite. It does seem to smooth out the skin’s surface very well. I am noticing the texture of my legs changing for the good. There is one thing that I would like to mention. As I said before, it does smell of menthol, it does contain menthol so when you apply the gel the area you apply it to will have a cooling sensation. I find the sensation to be much like when you use a muscle rub. I find that after a full day, when my legs are sore using this its like hitting two birds with one stone. After taking a nice warm bath, just apply this and you’ll get the cooling effects like a muscle cream and also fight cellulite at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always Body Merry did an awesome job on the container and label. I always love their packaging they’re easy to read and nice to look at. They’re not at all flimsy. Body Merry products are made in the USA. Their labels always have the container expiration date that I love so much. This container says it will last 24 months. And also with any Body Merry products they are never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has a problem with cellulite. Especially for those who are starting to work out and also have cellulite because the cooling effect that you get from it. I think if you use this after a workout it can be very soothing while also helping to smooth out your cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this review to be helpful&lt;br /&gt;I did receive​ this product free of charge but that in no way effects my honest option. It is mine and yours may differ from my own.it can be very soothing while also helping to smooth out your cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this review to be helpful&lt;br /&gt;I did receive​ this product free of charge but that in no way effects my honest option. It is mine and yours may differ from my own.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have tried the Dior and Clarins.  I have to say this is the best fast acting one I have ever tried.  I was very skeptical but all my bumps on my thigh are gone!  It feels great after work out shower because of minty feel but not for winter, I am sure.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li> I recently started using a cream called Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream and although my cellulite hasn’t disappeared or anything drastic like that I am noticing a huge difference in the look of my skin. It’s starting to soften and smooth out some. The Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream seems to be sanding away at my skin to at least give it the appearance of smoothing and feeling nicer. My cellulite might not completely disappear, but it is much smoother than it has been and I have to say so far I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream because it is making a difference in the look and feel of my skin. I know this is going to sound weird but it smells like gummy colas and I love that! It reminds me of a special friend of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you apply Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream to your skin if you give it a few minutes your skin starts heating up. It feels incredible, as if you are wearing a heating pad on you mid drift or wherever you apply the cream. This would feel amazing on your lower back if you had cellulite there. You can feel the cream working it’s magic. In just a few weeks I have seen a significant difference and I have to say I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I love it !!!I use this product 3 weeks and I can see big changes on my body,I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This did not work at ALL. I purchased twice just to make sure, and no results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks and don&#x27;t see any change at all. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> The jar is so small and the smell is very strong. My clothes smelled like it all day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have cellulite so I can only give my review based on what I thought based on what I read about it. It is a natural/organic product that is cruelty free which I love,  I always go for products that are cruelty free. I disliked the smell, it was a real strong menthol smell. The gel was pretty thick but I assume it&#x27;s normal  looks like it would be great for someone with cellulite. It could firm the skin and hide any patches one may have.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells and feels like Bengay! I have only been using a week, so I will update if I notice a change.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the wonderful reviews. I agree- within 2 days of using the cream my legs look dramatically better. I used it on my arms and they look better too. I love the tingling sensation it leaves for 30-60 minutes afterwards. I will have to try their facial products too if this works so well.</li>
            <li> After only one week, I see a VERY NOTICABLE difference! This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week and I can already see a difference! I have had bad cellulite for almost 10 years and nothing has ever really worked. I was not really sure about this gel but ordered it because of its high reviews. I have to say, a lot of the cellulite marks have become less noticeable. Some of my bigger lumps already appear to be more filled in. I am using it in conjunction with a Cellulite Massager Brush purchased through HealthLand. The smell is a bit strong at first but you get used to it. I massage it on with the massager for about 5 minutes. You can feel it tingling on your skin (which to me is a good sign) and after a few minutes you can no longer smell it anymore. I am excited to see what results I get with continued use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as often as I should, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I have used several different products to reduce the appearance of cellulite.  I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for many of the products. This one really is working.  I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the roller/massager and the two together are tightening up my skin and reducing the amount and size of the cellulite.  The fragrance and the cooling action are a little offsetting at first but, after a day or two of use, I have become quite fond of both.  I use it as recommended - morning and night.  I use it mainly on my thighs, rear, and stomach.  There are no miracle cures and I read up on how to reduce cellulite prior to starting anything.  This is what is working for me: Cellulite Defense Cream by Body Merry along with the massage roller; massaging the cream into desired areas morning and night for a minimum of two to three minutes per body part; increase water intake; and interval cardio exercise designed to burn fat. Good luck.  This is a fantastically priced product that works.</li>
            <li> Just got this about a week ago, so im only giving it 3 stars as I have not given it enough time to decide how it works. I will be back to up-date in 2-3 weeks. That&#x27;s how long the manufacture says it takes to see results. So far here are my thoughts...it does have a vapor/menthol smell to it, but it does fade quickly &amp; its not that bad (at least it doesn&#x27;t stink ; ) The menthol leaves a cooling effect in the applied area for a about 5 minutes. ) It goes on easily &amp; dries quickly, so you can get on with your day. I&#x27;ll be back in a few weeks, hopefully with Happy results!</li>
            <li> I thought this product should use long time then i can see how it works, however, until now i do not see it works.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE &amp; product!</li>
            <li> Cellulite creams don&#x27;t work...this one included</li>
            <li> I loved it, definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it stings stron methanol scent&lt;br /&gt;A little watery, so u may have to apply two layers so it can absorb through the skin and it takes some time to dry. Twice daily use and improvements were seen in 3weeks</li>
            <li> It is below my expectation</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing good results!! I love the &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; feeling! Don&#x27;t worry if it smells too strong when you first apply!! It goes away in about 10-15 min...</li>
            <li> I  haven&#x27;t applied it as often as I should, or as the instructions suggest; but It does work. I apply mostly in my stomach area. After the baby my skin streched and I have a lot of cellulites in that area; my skin is smoother, softer, and my cellulites are diminishing.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, my initial thought was that it&#x27;s definitely lighter (in weight) than I thought it would be. I thought maybe the product was going to be significantly smaller than it actually was/is. The light weight is due to the light consistency of the gel, which I think is pretty awesome. If you&#x27;re not a fan of thick creams because of the length of time it takes the product to soak into the skin, this could be a great option for you in that regard. It is definitely more of a gel than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed first upon removing the cap was the scent. It&#x27;s not a bad scent at all, in my opinion, just very strong. I don&#x27;t have an issue with strong scents. It sort of smells like Icy Hot Cream, if you&#x27;ve ever caught a whiff of that. (I may be weird, but I like the smell.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product only on the top half of my thighs since this is where I think my body has the most jiggle. Haha! I don&#x27;t have obvious cellulite, so my hope for this product was in the area of &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after applying this product, I feel a strong cooling sensation with a slight tingle. Warning: when I say strong, I mean STRONG. I like it, but if you don&#x27;t like that feeling, you will not like the application of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any long term differences after using this product for a few weeks, but I feel like for a temporary fix, it&#x27;s a nice product to have. Come shorts season, I think I will be using this more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DISCLAIMER: I WAS SENT THIS PRODUCT FOR REVIEW FROM BODY MERRY THROUGH TOMOSON.COM. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> I used this product 2 times a day for a month and nothing.  It is too pricey to continue any further with no results to go off of.</li>
            <li> I bought this and kept forgetting to use it at first, but now that I keep it next to the bathroom sink I&#x27;ve finally been remembering and I&#x27;m so glad that I do because this stuff is awesome! Like every other Body Merry product I&#x27;ve purchased, the results have been very noticeable and super fast. So far, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about what I&#x27;ve tried (vitamin C serum, cellulite gel-cream, and stretch mark cream). I just ordered the Vitamin C face &amp; neck moisturizer, which I can&#x27;t wait to try because, judging by the reviews and my experience with Body Merry, I&#x27;m sure it will work great. I am so beyond please and impressed with this company&#x27;s products and customer service. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll soon have one of everything they sell :)</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me.  I have used better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream only for a short time. I have noticed some improvement on my thighs. I especially like how my skin tingles after applying the cream. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Hmmm... been using this pretty regularly in the mornings for a few weeks and I can&#x27;t say I see a big difference. Maybe a slight improvement. I think the act of massaging the cream into my skin may be as effective as the product itself. I will give it some more time. I don&#x27;t really mind the strong menthol scent (kind of cleans out the sinuses) or even the cold butt cheeks afterward. I will say this: If you are sensitive to caffeine, do not use this product in the evening. I made that mistake once and barely slept a wink. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why, until I remembered the cream and had an aha! moment. The skin is a very large and porous organ. What goes on you goes in you.</li>
            <li> This cream did not work. I used it as recommended twice a day. I took before and after pictures and there was no result. I am in the gym 5 to 6 times a week and drink anywhere from a gallon to a gallon and a half a day. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for 2 people due to the caffeine, retinol, &amp; seaweed as taught on the Dr. Oz show for cellulite, that are also key ingredients for the most truly effective wrinkle treatments. My review rating is reflective of those key ingredients &amp; proven actual visible results demonstrated on the Dr. Oz show with a cellulite brush. I will update this review when the 2 I got this for for Christmas tell me the results they received for cellulite &amp; sagging wrinkled aging skin, for I cannot use green tea as it agitates the autoimmune disorder ankylosing spondylitis that I have :( otherwise I&#x27;d be using it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nivea cellulite cream before but this stuff is amazing. After using it for three weeks I can see definite results. Worth every penny! the tingle is also pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I’ve always been a bit over critical of anti-cellulite lotions and creams, as cellulite is hugely genetic and the only hope I&#x27;ve ever had to getting rid of it has been hard exercise. I&#x27;ve also never had much to complain about, but pregnancy does some weird things to your body, and mine left me with dreaded cellulite. I tried a few different options that I picked up from the drugstore upon recommendation from some of my mommy friends, but was never that impressed with the results, so that&#x27;s the mind frame I went into this review with and to my delight - Body Merry did not disappoint with their Cellulite Defense Cream. This is another product that is going to stay in my daily rotation, no question.&lt;br /&gt;After showering, I take a little of the Cellulite Defense Cream and rub it on my upper thighs, belly and upper arms while my skin is still a little damp. The cream feels slightly more like a gel, and glides on really easily. The smell is different - not bad or good, but it does smell slightly of Vicks (which I actually love) which I attribute to the menthol. I would recommend applying it in a well-ventilated area (I cracked the window in our bedroom for a few minutes while I put it on), if you&#x27;re more sensitive to smells. Right away, it feels like it goes to work! My skin feels tight and a little tingly, the latter of which dissipates after about 15 to 20 minutes. After about 2.5 weeks I started noticing that my cellulite was much less noticeable and my skin was much smoother - yay!</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream because if the great reviews. I have used several cellulite creams and this one is the best one I have used. It sokes in quickly so you do not have to wait to put on your clothes, and you feel it working long after it has dried! I have recommend to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free for review. This product it to help firm the problem areas. While applying this cream you can feel an instant tingle letting you know its working. It smell great also.</li>
            <li> I am a mother of two and wasn&#x27;t too sure about this cream since it&#x27;s so unknown but it really works well!! I only use it 3 times a week tops (having two infants lol you forget to apply everyday like need be) and it&#x27;s already doing wonders! Definitely try it out... you won&#x27;t regret this awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible cream. I didnt have much faith when i tried it out but to see how it works on cellulite is amazing. I could see the difference within the first week. It does tingle when you put it on but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and subsides relatively quick (or i sleep off before i realize and wear it at nights) I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> This cream feels and smells amazing and works very well. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in &amp;#34;cellulite&amp;#34; bit then I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long and I suspect it takes a while. I can say that it feels wonderful on a hot day or after a good workout. There&#x27;s a lovely cooling sensation and it does seem to hydrate the skin. I&#x27;d keep it around just for that!</li>
            <li> First thing you notice with this is the overwhelming menthol smell, its like a super cough drop.  Several hours later and I can still smell it.  Secondly, I believe the people whom have said there is a slight tingling didn&#x27;t actually apply it after showering.  Its more of a cold burn that can last upwards of a half an hour.  I wouldn&#x27;t have minded any of this if i felt like the results were worth it, but honestly I&#x27;ve had better.  I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and will definitely not be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I have given this product an extra star due to the customer service I felt went above and beyond, thank you for that  While I have no interest in this product, I would have no problem buying from the seller again.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised and pleased that this cream actually works! I&#x27;ve used it on my upper arm &amp;#34;batwings&amp;#34; for 3 days now and I definitely see a lot of improvement in the appearance of my skin, as well as a nice tightening. Holy Toledo! The cream spreads SO well...I believe it will last a long time, but when I get down to 1/3 jar, I will order more. Kudos to the company for a very effective product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. Received in timely manner. Not a miracle cream but wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be. Love the way it makes skin feel all tingly after using. Was able to notice a difference after using a few times. Exceptional customer service on behalf of company also. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any change at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the cream with a massager for a few days and I can already see a slight difference!! I am impressed to say the least. The cream is not sticky or thick. It goes on smooth and feels great with a massager!! It has a cooling effect, but it feels amazing. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple of weeks, and I have not seen any noticeable changes. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft. It seems to work so far. I need to use it a little more to know how well. So far so good. Like how my legs feel after using it. It has a medication smell to it but the smell doesn&#x27;t last. Bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Item was ok.It will be really great in the summertime when it is super hot outside and you need a cooling eucalyptus feel.</li>
            <li> The gel-cream felt amazing when applying. I love the tingly feeling! My skin was smoother and I did notice a small change in the texture of my buttocks and thighs where I was applying the product. I think my expectations were a little high with all the positive reviews that I had seen. I think if I continued using the product I would see more results.</li>
            <li> This is a review on the delivery and first impression only. The delivery was very fast, I got it in just a few days. The cream smells very nice and after applying and wait for 5-6 min  feels like is tightening the skin. These are the good things. On the bad side, the cream is very small for the money. Is very very liquid and did not have a protective layer on top, so when i opened  spilled all over me. It should be in a tube not in this container. When you put it on feels exactly like ICYHOT patches, very unpleasant for at least 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to review. I noticed on the back of my legs I was getting little dimples, I didn&#x27;t like seeing them. So I started using this product and with in the month I noticed they were slowly fading away. I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Im 30 with 2 kids after birth of my last child i ended up with mild cellulite &amp; it was time i do something about it before it gets worst i started working out eating right but felt it wasnt enough for my cellulite, i read all these great reviews and even googles it saw on blogs and did more research found it on youtube even on instagram people loved it . When i told my friends about it i got 6 of my friends to order we all worked out kept eating right and my friends saw results, unfortunaly i didnt im 5&#x27;1 and160  im curvey i use more product then they do there 5&#x27;9 and 120 so they didnt have to spread out much product i literally recived this about a week ago and i finished it i love the tingly feeling and the smell and even the texture it soaks up quickly i wanted to love this i know most of the girls will order this again and im unhappy i spend my hard working money on the first time and saw no results but i want to love it and give it another try but what if im just wasting my money again . Im sad and dissapointed it looks like it has potential :(</li>
            <li> Honestly, not that impressed by this product. It provided more of an appearance of its effectiveness rather than truly being effective. It has a decent smell and a tingling sensation that makes you assume it is working, but overall it really isn&#x27;t worth the asking price as it stands.</li>
            <li> OMGGGG, I have been using this cream for 3 weeks and its expectational .. I liked it so much i purchased another right away. I am going to be right for the summer. Thank you for such as excellent product..</li>
            <li> Really work, amazing product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me very watery n waste in couple of uses</li>
            <li> Loved it from the first time I put it on. Noticeable results!</li>
            <li> Although this cream didn&#x27;t work with my skin because my own personal problems the customer service of this product is so amazing and they really help you try to find a product that will work for you. They back their product up 100% and it&#x27;s hard to find people/companies who do that nowdays</li>
            <li> This did a great job on the stomach and cheeks- smells bad though ( like Icy Hot)</li>
            <li> So far I like this cream. It works great with the rubber tipped cellulite scrubber that is sold on Amazon as well. It definitely helps the appearance of my legs and it feels good on my skin. I would recommend this product.  Of course it is a temporary fix, but well worth it to do before heading to the beach!</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is Great so far! I haven&#x27;t used it but 4 times, so results are minimal but it seems to work. It feels really neat and refreshing. I use a nubby roller in conjunction with this lotion. The smell is strong if you are sensitive to that!</li>
            <li> I rarely do reviews, but this product is so amazing that I had to share the good news. This really works!! I have been using the Gel-cream for three weeks now (morning and night) and I have achieved dramatic results. I actually started noticing results after week two but with continued use, the lumps keep disappearing and my thighs are looking smoother. After reading the reviews and experiencing this product for myself, I think the amount of time it takes for the gel to work its magic depends on the severity of the cellulite (ie places where my cellulite was less lumpy are completely smooth now, while my more lumpy bumpy areas are smoother but it is taking more applications before it is completely smooth). Keep this in mind when trying this product; don&#x27;t give up if you cannot see results after a few days. The money back guarantee was a plus for me because I was not expecting it to work (because so many other products I have tried were epic fails) so I had nothing to lose. Imagine my excitement to find that it worked and my thighs were getting their sexy back.  Thank you Body Merry for helping me wear shorts again!</li>
            <li> This gel-cream is actually more of a gelatinous product that easily absorbs into skin - just a little goes a long way.  Smells like a light blend of citrus and eucalyptus and peppermint - energizing, invigorating, caffeinated, etc.  I really feel like this product penetrates the skin and firms the tissue underneath.  It helps to massage it in well and get the blood circulating every day as well.  The gelee is smooth and spreads onto the skin really easily and it really tingles a lot, so be careful not to touch your eyes or any other sensitive areas immediately after application.</li>
            <li> I have given this product 5 stars because I really like the way it feels when I massage it into my skin. I like the tingling feeling, it&#x27;s non greasy and it goes a long way.There is a visible look of firmness to my thighs and arms and I apply it immediately after showering. Try it, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great cream. The cooling effect is intenseeee</li>
            <li> Best of the best this is my second purchase it is amazing product</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a month and it is helping make my skin firmer. I also feel more toned and the texture of my back thighs looks better. I will update my review again next month</li>
            <li> nice cooling affect ..But PLEASE DONT FOOL YOURSELF LAND THINK THAT THIS GEL_CREAM IS GOING TO HELP YOUR CELLULITE..I DO CUPPING..AS WELL AS CELLULITE MASSAGES.exercise .And USE THE CREAM..AND i do see RESULTS..BUT NOT WITH THE CREAM ALONE..</li>
            <li> I love it. Smell is strong but i like that !!i love the cold feeling! I have only used a few days and i can see more like feel my skin different. So far i love it. Going through a weight loss process and will continue to use it.  Cant wait for long term results. Also love the consistency of it. A little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Have been using it for 3 weeks and i see changes, not only is my cellulite going away, but my skin is starting to become tighter as well. When beginning to use this product it has a very intense ice n hot feeling (that can be very unpleasant). But I noticed that after a couple of days I didn&#x27;t get that feeling anymore it still felt/feels like ice n hot, but it was a refreshing feeling. Overall good product and good experience. Wish it was a little less expensive but overall good product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Delivered quickly and as described.  Texture is a bit different than what I expected and takes a little getting used to.  It is more of a gel consistency which is great for distributing.  A little goes a long way.  Makes your legs feel amazing and rejuvenated.  Does help the appearance when used daily.</li>
            <li> Not for long lasting purposes but if you temporarily need to look toned for the beach or something, it actually works. I could tell the difference in the first week.</li>
            <li> Worked almost immediately, skin is tighter and smoother with much less dimples. Will continue to use. I like the way it dries fast. Best used after workout since it tingles and has a muscle relieving effect feel.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and wow!!! Even my husband noticed a difference the next day. I saw a noticeable difference, a smoothness I haven&#x27;t seen in years. I did dry brush first then use a premier cellulite massager brush, shower then applied cream. I am very suprise with the result especially since I have used other oils and creams, some costing over $50. Well worth it. Another suprise was the sensation, felt very warm and then cool. But I don&#x27;t mind, it was interesting!</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected. The cream smells good not like other creams I&#x27;ve tried. The cream does leave a tingling sensation after applying but it does not last long. Sort of like icy hot. Overall great!</li>
            <li> Tris is a great product, I started using it few days ago and my skin looks incredible , I recommend it and is very good quality and has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with my hard earn money. Unlike many others who have reviewed the product for free.  This product DOES NOT work. I used it as instructed, twice a day and saw no difference, It does give you a strong tingly sensation which makes you believe it&#x27;s working but it does not.  I finished the product with no results.  I purchased Jergen&#x27;s Skin Tightening cream for under $8, and that gave my legs a better appearance.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about three weeks so far. It does seem to be helping. I ordered two more bottles, as I will continue through summer. It smell great!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast, and price was great! Communication with seller was also top notch. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought three  jars, hoping that it would work. I am a skinny girl, but unfortunately i suffer from cellulite around the thighs. Initially, I used the product once per day and, except for the burning sensation that makes you think it works, it did not do anything. The jar was going pretty quickly, so I bought another two jars after i read that it needs to be used twice per day and results will show in 6-8 weeks. I used as directed and did not see any changes. :( I feel bad b/c I was pretty hopeful that it would work after all the good reviews I read and that burning sensation. It did not work for me, but maybe it works for other people.</li>
            <li> I got this item for review.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this item it did kinda removed my cellulites to making my skin smoother. I don&#x27;t have that much of them but this product is really nice</li>
            <li> Been using  it for about 3 weeks  and can&#x27;t say I see anything? I&#x27;m not heavy  at all I work out about 6 hours  a week and eat good so it&#x27;s not like I have  a bad shape just some imperfections  so so far no signs  that it help it a shame  it feels  like it would</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I have been doing other things to help with my cellulite and it is definitely starting to go away...so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s mostly from the cream or from a combination of other things. I will tell you what though, use this cream, drink more water, start doing squats, and start dry brushing and you will see SERIOUS improvement with your cellulite. I also made a simple coffee scrub I use in the shower. My problem area is the back of my thighs. I&#x27;m 125 lbs and in pretty good shape, I&#x27;ve had cellulite for years. It&#x27;s frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;You girls need to realize that there is no quick fix for cellulite. I had to learn that too.&lt;br /&gt;I am super picky about products and I actually like this one, so that&#x27;s saying something.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the menthol smell (it goes away after 15 min or so). My skin is tighter and firmer on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The company CEO actually follows up with you through email to see how you like the product and to see if you have any complaints. Companies hardly EVER do that, so I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. Use it in conjunction with getting your butt off the couch and doing some squats and you are gonna like what you see.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li> Got this cream out of desperation to try (I have tried so many and spent a lot of money over the years). I&#x27;ve struggled with cellulite on my legs since I was a young teen. First off, I love how light it is. Not heavy or greasy like other creams I&#x27;ve tried. Goes on very smooth and absorbs very quickly! It&#x27;s pretty tingly and it makes me feel good thinking &#x27;maybe it&#x27;s working&#x27; :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been faithfully using it for couple weeks, haven&#x27;t seen big results yet as it says give it about 6 weeks. However, I can tell that my skin texture IS more smooth!! I&#x27;d recommend this product for people to try it!</li>
            <li> They have great customer service!  I have been using the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream for just over three weeks and I really do think it&#x27;s working to firm up my skin.  I love their guarantee and I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> This cream is working for me.  I have used it for 3 and a half weeks and I can see the results.  It is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I bought a massager.  After I put the cream I massage the area for about 2 minutes.  I use it in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my stomach and I am amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> So far I like my results the cream feels good on my body and it works better than I expect. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.Very smooth and not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I should be keep use.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, it&#x27;s had very minimal almost imperceptible results. Could be a psychological placebo effect. However, for the heck of it, I also tried using it on my face (obviously not for cellulite there LOL) and it DID tighten my skin. Strange. But on butt/thighs, nope. The company DID honor the money back guarantee. No argument. No questions. Just refunded. So their integrity with that is impressive.</li>
            <li> This cream is definitely working but yes with proper diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t seen results from this as of yet. I am hopeful that it will diminish the cellulite because reality is it won&#x27;t remove it.</li>
            <li> Great product, speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> This cream does help. It can&#x27;t fix you but it sure does help minimize the appearance and it makes me skin feel so soft. It stays cool for awhile and sometimes that gets a little uncomfortable but it&#x27;s not too bad. I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This cream that I have been using is working good so far not complaints.it tightens(firms) me up. I love the tingling feel,like it is working the minute you put the cream on and then the massager brush just solidifies the whole process. The only thing is just my son &amp; husband  ,doesn&#x27;t like the smell, I love the smell it&#x27;s like sort of a fresh sea breeze scent and my  dimples are becoming less visible, I think..I have never tried others but this one seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> Great product, seems to work well, my only complaint is that my legs feel really cold for a bit after I use it! Using some body oil under the cream seems to help though.  I love the smell, and it is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Tub was only half full of cream when I received it. Went through it in about 2-3 weeks &amp; had absolutely no results during that time. Most likely won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the positive reviews I read.  I have used the entire container and don&#x27;t see any results! I am not overweight and walk 4 to 6 miles a day so I am not out of shape. I will order one more container in hopes there is better results with longer use! Sheila Webster</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It works great.  It works better when I dry brush and use post shower after my workout. It even helped to tone sagging skin on my outer thighs.</li>
            <li> It works! I have been using for 1 week and the results are very good....I am very sure that I am going to buy another cream</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it twice a day as I should, however it feels great!! it has a tingling cooling sensation, I will start using it more often so I can really come back and give a fair review.</li>
            <li> So far its easy to apply, icy cold feeling, and smells like a lemon vapor rub (to me anyways). I feel a tightening affect with this as well. So far so good. I use it on my thighs and my tummy with a waist cincher. I will update my review as I use this.</li>
            <li> this stuff evaporated!!!!! I only got a very minimal amount of uses. Maybe if it lasted longer I would have liked it. But I did not see drastic results and I was using a brush as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 4 weeks now and I have to say it works like magic!&lt;br /&gt;It firms it softens and visibly makes the cellulite disappear!I only use it once a day and work out 5-6 times a week(25minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply non sticky smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very satisfied also their costumer service is outstanding!!</li>
            <li> This product works! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the scent. It&#x27;s a strong minty smell and I&#x27;m just really sensitive to smells. Other than that I&#x27;ve only used it three times and already see results !</li>
            <li> pretty great stuff if used twice a day with a cellulite massager.</li>
            <li> Truly youth in a magic little bottle!!! It took me a little while to get consistent about applying 2x a day, but once I did I saw an amazing difference! Best stuff ever!!</li>
            <li> Used it for a full month and saw no difference. Loved the smell and how the cream felt on, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it due to no results.</li>
            <li> Women have long been told that cellulite has to be a simple fact of life &amp; that nothing that we do can change that. Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream  is here to prove that wrong! They formulated a cream that is intended to help shrink cellulite &amp; keep any further lumps &amp; bumps at bay. I was provided a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry provides the following information about the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream &amp;#34; Combat cellulite with our unique Caffeine + Retinol + Seaweed formula. This gel-cream has a strong caffeine content with the optimum level of retinol (0.4%), as recommended by experts. For good measure, we’ve also added potent natural and organic ingredients such as algae extract, kelp, coconut oil, japanese green tea leaf extract and cayenne. Like all our products, it is free from harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates and phthalates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel-cream consistency is designed to spread over large areas and it absorbs quickly into your skin. The cream is infused with a refreshing 100% natural ‘mint - green tea - lime’ fragrance, that barely leaves a trace once fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, Body Merry’s Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is your ticket to visibly reducing the appearance of unwanted bumps and lumps and getting skin that feels and looks tighter, smoother and younger!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This was a really unique product to try. I found the scent to be very unusual,almost a ginger/cinnamon kind of thing. The color is a light tan color as well which I can only say did seem to fit well with the scent. The lotion did seem to be beneficial after a week or so of continued use. I did feel that my skin was smoother &amp; nicer after a while. I suspect that I will see further benefit by the time my entire jar of cream is gone.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product (March 1st), so it has not had enough time to work its magic.  However, I can say that I love the way that it feels.  I will continue to use it because of how it feels when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll follow up in a month or two about if it makes my cellulite less noticeable;0)</li>
            <li> Its a good product.  I was expecting it to work better then it does but will try it longer and see if in the end of product that I have, if it made a difference in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have been using this light, minty gel since May 17th. Today is May 29th and I am starting to feel the firmness in my thighs and buttocks! What the heck? I&#x27;m loving this so much and very anticipated to see what lies ahead! Definitely ordering again! I&#x27;ve used many creams and gels since I was 15 years old! This IS THE BEST BY A LONG SHOT! I feel so grateful! PLEASE DON&#x27;T DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The menthol odor is just way too much for me to handle. Also, I am trying to get all caffeine out of my system. Maybe I am just too sensitive to frangrances.</li>
            <li> Not a slightest change disappointed</li>
            <li> I have been using this product at least once a day for about 3 weeks now and have not noticed much if any of a difference. I do however love the tingling menthol sensation on my skin and it relieves muscle aches after working out at the gym.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS WITH HOPES FOR SOME RESULTS. USED THE WHOLE THING AND NOTHING IT WAS LIKE APPLYING LOTION. PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> This product came very fast and works so well ! The ingredients are all natural and it has a very pleasant scent. I use it along with a cellulite roller and it makes my skin look and feel so nice ! I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fitness instructor. I workout 6 times per week. I have a small amount of cellutite in the back of my legs, that I&#x27;m targeting with different workouts, diet and this cream. I have seen NO results and I have been using it for two weeks, two times per day, after a shower, massaging the area as recommended. This will be my last purchase since I can&#x27;t buy one every week.</li>
            <li> Strong smell &amp; really saw no difference</li>
            <li> I have only recently used this with a cellulite messager brush so my input is limited. I can say that with the two items it does help with the appearance of cellulite. The smell reminds me of Vic&#x27;s Vapor rub or Goldbond/Bengay product. Not as strong but similar the smell is worth it if it helps with the appearance of hail damage. The skin is left with a nice tingling sensation and soft feel. I will continue to use this product and plan to purchase more once current supply is depleted</li>
            <li> Overall, a good gel-cream that definitely improved the texture of my skin. I&#x27;ve found the following combination has made a huge difference for me: following a low-carb, low-sugar diet, drinking a LOT of water, dry brushing my skin, strength workouts (FitnessBlender.com is my favorite), using this gel-cream twice a day, and a self-tanner. This product isn&#x27;t magic, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.. I didn&#x27;t even get to find out if the product worked because the container was so small. If the area you are needing help with is a big area like the entirety of your thighs.. don&#x27;t bother. Gone in three weeks.</li>
            <li> This product works! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great cream for the price! Very impressed with the customer service from the creator of this product. He contacted me when I first ordered it to let me know that if I  was not completely satisfied I would get my money back. He then contacted me several weeks after using the product to ask for my feedback and gave me a discount on my next purchase. I do not expect miracles from this or any other cream out there but I will definitely being buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Really saw a difference after using. Very friendly and helpful business</li>
            <li> I was surprised I liked this product. I don&#x27;t normally like using anything that smells badly to me, but this did help firm up the couple of small cellulite spots I had forming on my leg. I enjoyed using my cellulite massager with the product as well.</li>
            <li> As someone that love beauty products I was super excited to receive this Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream in the mail to give to a family member to try out. After my family member tried it out for herself she said it really helped with her small cellulite issue she was dealing with. She said after using it for a while it&#x27;s completely gone!! This Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream has high caffeine content and optimum levels of retinol as recommended by experts to help fight away the appearance of cellulite on your body!! It&#x27;s a very lightweight and refreshing gel-cream as the consistency of this gel-cream is designed to glide over large areas. This means a little bit of this gel-cream goes a long way so you will only need a little bit and it will last a long time. This gel-cream also does a great job at quickly absorbing into your skin and it leaves no greasy residue like other gel-cream my family member said she&#x27;s tried before. My family member told me this gel-cream provides an amazing tingling/cooling sensation over your body. This gel-cream is also cruelty free and made with no harsh chemicals. It&#x27;s made of natural and organic ingredients including 3 types if seaweed: algae extract, kelp, Dulse that combines to give it an antioxidant boost, this helps in firming and toning the body. It also includes organic cayenne that provides a spicy twist that helps in circulation and to reduce the storage of fat in the body. Which this Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream you are guaranteed to see results in the appearance of cellulite on your body. My family member and I definitely recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Its Workingg will make another orderr</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT--love the fact that all of the ingredients are natural and you can actually feel it working.  my husband and i are going to order this product for the next 3 months to see the full 90 results.  and love this company--their customer service is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Visible results</li>
            <li> Updated Review (04/2016)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product scent is awesome! I&#x27;m a repeat customer so this really made me love the product even more. This stuffy really works with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works! I was super mad when I ran out of the product. I&#x27;m ordering more. I didn&#x27;t tell anyone I was using this. I had someone tell me they could tell a difference in how I looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll feel a tingle when you apply the product. You should also notice a difference within the first week of using.</li>
            <li> Saw no change.  sadly</li>
            <li> First I must comment on the customer service. My dog decided to get into my cream, I wasn&#x27;t sure if she ate it or not but I panicked. I contacted them immediately asking if they knew whether it was harmful to dogs or not. Got back to me right away. Not only that but checked back up on us a couple days later. I thought that was so nice but then Khushboo took it a step further and since I didn&#x27;t get to really try the cream out, I was able to get a replacement for free. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! I was so shocked and so appreciative.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the cream itself. I didn&#x27;t think to take before and after pics and now I wish I did. I see a huge difference in my thighs and butt area. I&#x27;ve always had cellulite so I really didn&#x27;t think this would work but maybe help a little. But no I definitely see a difference!!! I&#x27;m just so pleased overall. Can&#x27;t wait to continue using and seeing the improvement! Thanks again Khushboo!!!</li>
            <li> This really works at firming the areas you apply it at. Feels great, smells amazing and works wonders!</li>
            <li> I will give this lotion 3 stars for the results I&#x27;ve seen on my neck and chest.  I do notice a firmness to the skin there are I&#x27;m happy with that.  I also give it 3 starts for the ease with which it goes on and how easy it is to get out of the container.  Much better than the kind of lotion that you have to pump out.  That being said, I can&#x27;t say that I see a tremendous or even the slightest bit of difference in my cellulite on my thighs.  Maybe I&#x27;m beyond help but I will use this on my neck/chest area.  It was a good smell and a tingly feeling.  Not greasy at all.  So, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s going to do what I bought it for but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> One jar lasts approx 7-10 days.  Not long enough to see any true results.</li>
            <li> I used this product on myid area between breasts and bikini line. I followed all directions and applied daily.  The results are minimal after 2 months. I do understand that it can take several months of consistent practice to recover adequate results.</li>
            <li> It did  absolutely nothing for me, I&#x27;m starting to think most of these reviews on here are made up by the sellers.</li>
            <li> Great cream. I think it is working</li>
            <li> Loved it and will have to order more. I did not use it consistently but I still say dramatic improvement. I also ate healthy and worked out. I think with continued use my cellulite will be fully gone soon. My thighs look so much better now! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my third jar of the same product. I am happy with the result. However, the color of the gel differed in all three jars (ivory, white, dark cream). Did not understand the inconsistency.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything at all but smell horrible!</li>
            <li> Since having 2 kids, I have seen quite a bit of cellulite pop up. The first time that I tried this product, it had an immediate cooling sensation, almost a burning. That&#x27;s when I knew that this product was unlike any that I had tried before. I could feel it working. I already notice a difference, but I will revise my review once I have a definitive difference to show. Overall though, I&#x27;m thrilled! I am able to wear a regular swim suit this year instead of a swim skirt!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, has a horrible smell and it feels like your putting Icy hot on your thighs.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I&#x27;ve used many many products and I must say that none have given me results like this cream has given me! I highly recommend and have recommend to my family and friends. I&#x27;m always the guinea pig!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. After reading the reviews I thought maybe it would work, but not at all. Plus it smells really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure if I should give it four stars just yet. I just received my order today and used it for the first time. So far I like it much better than SHESSENTIALS Cellulite Cream with Retinol and Caffeine Skin Tightening and Body Firming Treatment. That stuff stinks really bad and goes on sticky and stays sticky. Plus I don&#x27;t think it penetrated the skin to really do its job as I could feel the greasy film wash off my legs when I would take a shower the next day.  This stuff smells so much better and goes on nonsticky. Love the cooling tingly feeling. I also used Hydra Mar Cellulite Cream in the past and didn&#x27;t see much results with that. I wanted something with Retinol this time. Hoping for some results before my trip to the Bahamas in two weeks. I&#x27;m wondering when I will see results since I have been using the other cream for several weeks which basically has the same ingredients.  Will keep you posted... wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working with only a few days use, per my wife.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have tried many products and this is by far the best, I&#x27;m hooked!  As for the customer service, that deserves another 5-star rating.  Detailed, prompt and professional responses to my inquiries as well as follow-up.  Exemplary service.  Period.</li>
            <li> When using, I take a few minutes to use the Premier Cellulite Massager Brush with it....and as a busy mom, it only happens about 2 - 4 times a week TOTAL...and I still saw a difference almost immediately.  It&#x27;s been about a month and, sure, I still have cellulite but it is certainly not as apparent as it was.  It is swim-suit time and I definitely feel more confident about showing my legs after using this product.  If I had time to use it daily, I&#x27;m sure I would see even a greater result.  I noticed many reviews were in exchange of a free product but mine is not...I paid for this item (and I do NOT work out).&lt;br /&gt;The container is about 25% of the way gone so I&#x27;d imagine that someone using it daily (or twice a day, as suggested) would blow through this quickly.</li>
            <li> it does work, if you have light cellulite.</li>
            <li> What a great find this was!!! I am 32, and have struggled with cellulite most of my adult life. This cream definitely feels wonderful, tingly from the menthol. The menthol smell dims to a nice light floral scent. The cream is especially soothing on my legs after a run. I also have very sensitive skin, and I find that this lotion adds the right moisture without irritation. Would recommend this to just about anyone, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a menthol smell for the first hour or so after use!</li>
            <li> Waste of money, finished one jar and absolutely no change. I don&#x27;t believe these things are made for blacks. The people who review with outstanding results are either paid or lying.  This does not work, wish I can get my money back.</li>
            <li> The Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream arrived protectively packaged and&lt;br /&gt;as described on product page.  We purchased in a promotion for&lt;br /&gt;testing and review.  I had purchased the gel/cream for myself, and&lt;br /&gt;my Mom asked if she could try it.  She has been using it for about a&lt;br /&gt;week, and already feels that her thighs look smoother than before.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I will have to purchase more for myself !!</li>
            <li> So far, so good .....I like this product! I use it with a cellulite massage brush but I want to try it with a dermaroller.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working, I don&#x27;t really care for the medicated smell though</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I just started to use it so I don&#x27;t know if it gets rid of cellulite yet. But, I have been dealing with thawing a frozen shoulder and wearing a compression band on my arm during my pilates reformer training sessions and when I go for a bike ride. I have been applying this cream on my bad arm and shoulder and then putting the compression band over it. I don&#x27;t know if it the combination of everything, but my frozen shoulder recovery has made leaps and bounds. I find the cream makes it feel a lot better. I really like this cream and will order more when I am out!</li>
            <li> I had red spots on my legs that cleared up after using this for 2 weeks. It increase circulation to the skin and improves, which is very good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 star rating.  Not because I actually saw any results but I appreciated the impact it had on my mind when I needed it most. I purchased the cream a couple of weeks before I left for an island vacation and used it religiously prior to and while on vacation.  I was also eating healthy, running and weight training.  I don&#x27;t think the cream actually did anything at all but the act of putting it on in the morning and at night, paired with the tingling sensation minutes after application made me feel like something was happening.  So my brain wanted to believe my thigh areas appeared tighter and I had the slightest more confidence when putting on the bathing suit.  The tingling wasn&#x27;t too much to handle and the other reviewers were right about the smell; its something you get used to and almost come to enjoy.  This product does go a long way so I didn&#x27;t feel gipped in any way; its just the truth about cellulite is that you fix it from the inside out, not the outside in.  Diet &amp; exercise is the answer.  I will use the rest of the product in the jar and likely not purchase again.  But the seller was very communicative and the purchase experience was a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this cream for about a month now, I haven&#x27;t used it every day, but I do see minimal results from what I have used. The cream is cool, minty and gives you a likable tingle on the skin. Definitely will be keeping this product in stock at the house :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I should have taken a before and after pic! I Have enough left for one more application but will probably not need anymore in the near future! I used it once daily with the massage applicator also purchased on Amazon.com after my shower. We were going on vacation so I wanted to fix this cellulite issue and it totally worked! I recommend this product! I&#x27;m still so surprised it worked so well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and i have seen some results. So hopefully more cellulite will disappear as i keep using it!!!!😀</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure that it is working for me.Maybe if I use it for a few more months I might see a difference. It feels like icy hot which isn&#x27;t a bad thing just wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel that way. Thought it would be more like a cream. Would I recommend this to others........ here&#x27;s what I will say to that yes, because if you are like me and many others, things work differently for different people. What works for me and someone may not work for you. It&#x27;s a matter of finding that right product. I guess I am still on the search. Good luck to you all and wish me luck.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day and also have used it with wraps saw no difference</li>
            <li> I started using it immediately, can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
            <li> This was my third time purchasing it! I had awesome results. I also bought a hand held massager. I started seeing great results when doing it twice a day. I kinda got off my kick of doing it as often. I&#x27;m getting back in my routine. I love the lotion, you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> As with Body Merry it is basic box with protection seal applied. Box is basic and to the point that what’s inside is valuable to your the person purchasing the Cellulite Cream. After opening the packing you are now greeted with contents, which is creamy, bold and a little strong, but you know that is the caffeine and seaweed along with retinol ready to help with the battle a head that is cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month and the result is not extraordinary. That is true that I don&#x27;t have a very severe cellulite problem.  Maybe that is the reason this product has not worked well for me. However, you can feel how your skin is going smoother. I am not convinced about this product. Next time I&#x27;ll try other brand.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an ok cream. I feel most of the people who left such &amp;#34;wonder product&amp;#34; reviews got free products. In any case, it&#x27;s not a bad cream BUT the amount of it is SO LITTLE, it will run out before even realizing there is a difference or not --what&#x27;s the point? It leaves a great feeling after wearing it, and since it&#x27;s not greasy, you can wear your pants on and go to work almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Yet, it&#x27;s not a product that you can&#x27;t find on stores from any other company, that will also have a bigger bottle for longer period of use, and less money.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I didn&#x27;t see any wonder results, it run out after less than a month of use, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Not particularly because it&#x27;s a bad product, rather because I can find the same for A LOT less.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping, excellent seller (very kind). Product works like a charm. It really does firm up your skin. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love it! I got my product Saturday, July 4th.  I know it&#x27;s pretty soon to write a review but I just had to.  I&#x27;m a mom of two.  The two were back to back, 14 months a part.  So, the stretch marks and cellulite struggle is real!  I used to work part time at a popular beauty store that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; and I tried everything there under their roof for stretch marks and cellulite.  The product would work for a few weeks and then either my body just adjusted to it or it was only a temporary fix.  I became frustrated because that was hundreds of dollars I was spending on something that simply camouflaged the problem until its too late for me to realize that I just wasted money.  Yes, you can always return but the goal is to find something that works so you don&#x27;t have to keep returning it. I became addicted to this product the minute I pulled it out and opened the jar.  The smell is so addicting. I bought it along with a cellulite massage brush because all of the other reviews recommended it.  I will post pics after a few weeks to update my review.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  I just purchased this cream and have been using it only 4 days.  I can see a very visible difference!! I am beyond myself and so shocked.  I have literally tried EVERY cellulite cream out there and this is the ONLY one that has actually worked!! I don&#x27;t know what exactly the ingredients are but I don&#x27;t care- this stuff seriously works like MAGIC!  I was skeptical at first when I ordered it because most of the reviews stated that they received this for free to review.  I paid for this product and after using it I am no longer skeptical!  I stand by all the other reviews 10000%.  I have only used this cream at night (once daily) and apply to my stomach, back, thighs, legs and butt.  The only complaint I have is that my jar is already empty, I only have enough cream for about another day or so.  I could definitely be using too much but because of the substance it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.  I WISH THIS CAME IN A LARGER SIZE!! I have already placed 2 more orders for this.  When I apply this cream on my body I feel like I&#x27;m freezing and I literally get goosebumps all over my body.  It&#x27;s a great and not so great feeling- great because you can literally feel it working and not so great because I am freezing and no matter how many layers I put on I can&#x27;t seem to warm myself up for at least 20 minutes.  Honestly though my only complaint is the size of this product and that it does not come in a larger size! This stuff is literally amazing and if you are second guessing yourself on buying it- don&#x27;t!! I feel like I have been waiting my whole life to find this stuff and it almost seems too good to be true! I am in love and will now forever be a loyal customer.  THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH BODY MERRY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw- I will add that I do have a lot of cellulite!  Especially on my thighs/legs/butt.  I am not extremely overweight however I am by no means thin.  This product really worked for me though even in just a few days which I still cannot believe! Whatever is in this stuff is priceless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently been out of the gym due to a cold however I plan on going back to my regular routine soon and I will continue to use this cream and update my review again later! &#x3D;)priceless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently been out of the gym due to a cold however I plan on going back to my regular routine soon and I will continue to use this cream and update my review again later! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, use it as directed.  For those that it works for I envy you and wish I knew what your secret was.</li>
            <li> Awesome got it shipped super fast. You can definetly feel it working when you put it on. It does take several weeks to start to see results it&#x27;s not an over night cream. If you have the patience it does work!</li>
            <li> Great, it really worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the entire jar and I see no difference at all.  It feels like Ben-Gay on your skin.</li>
            <li> I did see some improvement in my problem area. However, exercise and eating right are also key to its success.</li>
            <li> have not noticed any difference and have been using this cream diligently.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any reduction of cellulite or skin being any firmer after using the entire container.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cream gel. It smells menthol-like, sort of like Ben-Gay, but I love the smell, it&#x27;s invigorating. A few minutes after applying you will feel a cooling sensation that lasts for the better part of an hour. I will follow up with results but I am already preparing to buy my second jar.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I think the best thing for cellulite and better looking legs is hard work - eating right and exercising.  Two days of walking/jogging makes my legs look better than a month of using this product.</li>
            <li> Recieved this faster than I thought I would get ti and with that I started to use it I love the smell and that there&#x27;s organic and kosher items to make thos awesome product.  I know I&#x27;ll be sad when I run out I am thankful I was able to recieve a  discount to review this product with my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.  I gave it 5 stars because the vendor was so great!  They actually reached out to me after about 3 weeks of use to see how I liked the product.  When I told them that it wasn&#x27;t working for me, they offered my refund immediately (I didn&#x27;t even ask ... probably wouldn&#x27;t have even done so).  So I gave this 5 stars as you have nothing to loose ... many users swear this worked wonders for them.  So why not give it a try? GREAT smell and loved the way it felt when applied to the body.</li>
            <li> Ive been using cellulite creme for a few weeks now I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet but I only use it once a day. The smell is nice in my opinion and I like the tingle. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone and I&#x27;ll attempt to do it twice a day I&#x27;ll update my review in a week or two.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, seen a difference after the first week</li>
            <li> So far this cream is working great! I started to use this product right away along with a cellulite brush and after about 9 days I looked in the mirror and noticed a huge difference in how my buttocks and back of my legs looked. I basically wanted to try this to prevent any more cellulite to come and it has taken a lot away from my amazement! It does have a strong menthol smell to it, kinda like arthritis cream does but you can feel the tingling within minutes after applying, but the one thing I will caution with this. I have been having major sleep issues lately and couldn&#x27;t understand why I was not sleeping at night, than it dong on me that its probably from the caffeine in this product since you are supposed to put it on at night time as well. Not that this will happen to you but I just wanted to you all a FYI on the possibility.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is cooling.  I&#x27;m not sure how much tighter I am as a result, but it the ingredients are proven effective and it&#x27;s organic, so I hope over time into my second jar I&#x27;ll see better tightening.</li>
            <li> Never have purchased a cellulite cream and was skeptical but desperate. Had a month before we were headed off on cruise. Had lost weight but cellulite was still hanging around. Used this cream and dry brushing and the bumps went away. Even when i sat with legs crossed, there were no lumps or bumps. I am a believe and have reordered. Will not be without!!!!</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical with this product because it does sound too good to be true, but even after a few days I see my skin feeling and looking tighter and more firm, DEFINITELY recommend!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is starting to work I can see a difference already! Smells good and absorbs very well</li>
            <li> This cream has A LOT of menthol in it as it&#x27;s really cold when it goes on for about 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t see any difference in the appearance of cellulite with this cream and I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually seen a difference with this cream. Just bought my second jar. Love the way you can actually feel it working after applying.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Instant results. I had to get use to the smell.</li>
            <li> it smells funny and feels more like a muscle rub.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I was very skeptical, but was definitely pleasantly surprised with the results!  I highly recommend and have recommended to my family and friends. I&#x27;m always the guinea pig!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for more than a few days but I really love the smell and and it really feels great. To me it looks like it could be helping on my thighs too. I plan to keep using it and will definitely reorder if I continue to see these results!</li>
            <li> Used the entire tub and it did not work for me. I could not stand the feeling it gives when putting it on to keep trying it any longer either. It&#x27;s freezing cold and stays for about half an hour. I contacted the seller and they refunded my money though so that was nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. Tingles when you apply. I have noticed a small difference in my cellulite when I used as directed. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I never weighed myself before using this product because I figured it would not work.  I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but my jeans fit better and I am not overweight.  It has a strong smell but its not a horrible one.  Kinda a mint smell.  I am impressed.  I think if you use it twice daily and stick to that, you should see some results like I did.</li>
            <li> I used it every day morning and night. I have an active life style, I eat the most healthy posible buit i have that horrible cellulite. Based on all the good reviews i saw for this product I had great expectations about it. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> The cream works very well it even seems improved from the previous cream ordered! cellulite was noticeable less visible, but diet and exercise are also essential to improving appearance of cellulite.  Also great customer service.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price!</li>
            <li> This did NOT last me a long time. I finished it in a couple of weeks. Maybe I have fat legs, I don&#x27;t know, but because I finished it so soon I found it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. I loved the tingly feeling though, but the smell got a bit sickening after a while.</li>
            <li> Love it! Just ordered two more jars. I can see the difference after just one week of using the product. I only use on my thighs because that&#x27;s where the most noticeable cellulite are. It&#x27;s not this super magic cream that erases all of your unwanted cellulite but it sure does reduces the appearance.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe in this product !! I ordered it because I saw good reviews and actually I didn&#x27;t believe in it. I was wrong, thanks goodness I ordered it !! After 1 week of using this gel I noticed a big results !!! My legs looks so smooth and the cellulite looks like it&#x27;s going away !!! It really work !! I will&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keep using it forever !! :)))</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product!!! Usually I don&#x60;t do reviews, but this product is so amazing that I had to write about it. This gel-cream really works!! I was VERY skeptical in the beginning but after I read some very good reviews, I thought to give it a try. I was not wrong. I have been using the Gel-cream for three months now twice a day and I have achieved amazing results. Exercising a little and drinking plenty of water will help you way faster to achieve your goal. It&#x60;s worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> love the way it feels and there is no oily residue, the smell is refreshing. The cream leaves a slight tingle sensation but almost the same as if you were to use a peppermint or wintergreen oil on your body. It does not hurt in the slightest and makes you feel like it is even working better. Love the product. Cant wait to see results!</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that everyone has different skin types and it might work for other and some it might not. Also when you use these types of creams you must workout and change your diet. These creams help reduce the appearance along with your new lifestyle. Don&#x27;t expect miracles. But do expect to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream contains caffeine ,retinol and seaweed among other ingridents. These ingridents help firm, tighten your skin and make it feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;The feeling of the cream is cool and refreshing suits me well worth the weather we are having. It is not sticky and well absorbed so it does not bother me in the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like was the smell. I removed a star I know they can perfect it and make the smell much better. Other than that this cream helps and works, keep in mind it&#x27;s not a miracle but I helped diminish the appearance of cellulite but please workout and eat healthy. You can do this along and see good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample ,review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I just received this two days ago, so I will update later after using it for a while. So far I love it. I can feel the firmness after application. It is very easy to apply. A little goes a long way. It is not at all sticky and just sinks right into the skin. Right after application, you begin to feel an instant tingling. This lasted for about 45 min. It was very cold! After the tingling went away, there was still no stickiness and I could not feel the product at all. It is very comfortable ever after putting on pants. I will continue using! Directions are to apply 2X a day, preferably on dry, clean skin. I will continue to follow this to see what happens.</li>
            <li> No results. Waste of money, would not recommend this product. The smell was quite unbearable too. Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> This really worked for me!  Before I tried this I was really skeptical that it would do anything to help reduce cellulite.  I had been doing research to find something that would help with cellulite besides just exercise.  I read several articles that described how retinol can reduce the appearance of cellulite.  Retinol is converted into retinoic acid which stimulates collagen growth and makes skin appear smoother and denser.  I looked at several retinol creams and Body Merry&#x27;s cream had the recommended percent of retinol for the best price. I also noticed that other customers raved about their customer service and return policy, so I knew that if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells like peppermint and spreads really well so a little bit goes a long way.  After applying it my skin starts to feel really cold.  Literally, the first time I tried it I felt like I was sitting on ice.  Over time, the cooling sensation has become less intense (I&#x27;m assuming because my skin is more dense) but it is still prominent.  I think this also depends on how sensitive your skin is (my skin is very sensitive).  My boyfriend put some on just to see what it was like and he really enjoyed the cooling sensation.  I usually wait for at least 5 minutes before I put on clothes to give it some time to absorb.  I don&#x27;t have a cellulite brush or anything like that so I just used my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been really happy with the results.  I must be since I have repurchased it two or three times now. lol  It has left my skin looking smoother, tighter, and reduced the appearance of cellulite.  Its not a miracle cream, but if you use it consistently you will see an improvement in your skins appearance.  At first I used it daily, but now I use it two or three times a week for maintenance.  Best of all, there is no animal testing and its made in the USA, which makes me feel better about my purchase.  After all, true beauty is cruelty free. ;)</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this cream very much!  It has menthol in it which creates a cooling effect shortly after applying it.  I also believe that it has made an improvement in the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days, but I like the feel of it already!  The company also sends you an email with usage​ instructions, very handy!</li>
            <li> Consistant use will give you good results. Definitely improves skin texture and reduces the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;Massage vigorously after and while applying.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any changes as some have claimed it&#x27;s been about two month😕</li>
            <li> I bought this with the brush - seems like it might work but not sure as it was cold and I always seemed to &amp;#34;not have the time&amp;#34; to use it like I should.  Maybe now that it&#x27;s warm, I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
            <li> Cellulite Defense is a good product! I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about 1 month and I can see it&#x27;s gradually working. My skin is slightly smoother. I do like the tingling feeling which implies it&#x27;s working in the areas applied. With continued use I&#x27;m hoping to see the results I&#x27;m seeking.  As a customer the only improvement I would ask for is a stronger concentration to work faster.</li>
            <li> I just started using it last night. It smells good, tingles your skin and makes my skin feel great. After all reviews. I have seen that it gives results, it&#x27;s worth a shot! The stretch mark cream from Body Merry has already made my stretch marks lighter with one use!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product for a week and couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible medicine smell plus I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement!!! Sending it back! Sticking with Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream!</li>
            <li> Packaged well; sealed</li>
            <li> Order came on time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, not to mention the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> I dosn,t see any resulte</li>
            <li> this gel cream went in no time. saw no results</li>
            <li> I was really hoping I could use this cream,due to the great reviews on it.  I couldn&#x27;t use it but I will say that the few days I did, I seen a reduction in the cellulite.  I contacted the company and they were very considerate, and refunded me for the cream.  It&#x27;s worth the try.  I&#x27;m sure if I could I would use this, and highly recommend it to anyone that wants results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been three days and no change yet, but I can feel it tingle in my thighs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am updating my review. I finished my first jar and my cellulite is almost gone! I have not changed my diet or workouts (weight watchers and gym 4 days a week.  I ordered my second jar to get my legs nice and smooth, and I have no doubt this product will do the job!</li>
            <li> This has been an amazing addition to my daily beauty regimen. Within a week of use my skin was softer and more supple on my legs and derriere. :)  I should have looked at the ingredients prior to application as there was menthol listed there. This would have been good information to be aware of as the first time I applied it was right before bed. O_o  The tingle of the menthol kept me up more than half the night! LOL!  I quickly forgave myself for this when within days my husband commented on how smooth he noticed my legs were. I haven&#x27;t generally believed that cellulite cream works but I actually started to see some results with this product. It was great! I don&#x27;t feel that what I received for review and testing purposes was enough to give the product the 6-8 weeks to see optimal results as suggested on the label but I will be looking into getting another jar to continue the treatment! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product and AWESOME customer service!</li>
            <li> U know I tried it and I don&#x27;t mind the smell but not sure if it works for me.  I even do deep massages for my legs when I put it on but im not sure if I see the difference.  I am gonna keep going and see whats up and keep updated.</li>
            <li> this really helped to me to removed my unneeded fats on my legs, this is really good.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 3 weeks in conjunction with cellulite massager brush, cardio and better eating and cellulite has reduced . Product is gel-like and feels like icy hot when applied.</li>
            <li> I had  been using but I didn&#x27;t see any results  yet</li>
            <li> I am already on my second jar of this cream. It really works, I have lost inches off my waist and thighs and I feel great.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me :( , I didn&#x27;t like the cooling effect on my legs.. Literally felt like I was gonna get frost bite on my legs because the cooling/tingling feeling was soooo intense.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my cellulite either :(  Just my honest opinion. Some people may love it though.. I wanted to! I could not stand that cooling sensation though , just way to intense.</li>
            <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I love the way it feels so I&#x27;ll keep trying for a little while longer. I have a bad case, so maybe it works better if there is just a little cellulite.</li>
            <li> Feels like its working! Has a cool enlivening feeling.</li>
            <li> i dont see the result</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot! It increases your blood circulation and skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> Great product! You can feel it working! I saw results very fast within a few days.</li>
            <li> so far it is good, but to new to tell if the product will work or not.  was told give it at least 6-8 weeks.  so we shall see!</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite cellulite cream.  I have used pricier versions but will definitely be purchasing this one from now on.  It smells like menthol but sinks easily into the skin and has an icy cool tingle to it which I enjoy.  My skin is looking smoother, yes I have been exercising and drinking lots of water but I know the cream is really helping improve the appearance of my legs.</li>
            <li> Just finished the container this morning. I&#x27;m honestly not sure if this worked or not. What I do know, is that when you apply this to any part of your body you need to know that your body part will become excruciatingly cold for the next fifteen to thirty minutes, so do not plan on doing anything after applying other than cuddling under a blanket.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but seems like the product evaporates and that&#x27;s weird...</li>
            <li> This stuff does really work. There is a tingle after you apply to your skin so you know that this lotion is working. I ordered two bottles after the first week or so of my use just so I wouldn&#x27;t run out of this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I noticed after almost 2 months that my skin and problem areas are changing and cellulite is less visible.  But I am forever sold with this company because of their customer service support they are always trying  to make your happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I have really really really really bad cellulite I had used these diet pills they helped to loose weight but left lumps in my legs like I had liposuction its is so ugly, So I really didn&#x27;t know if this would work for me because it was fat deposits-to my surprise it did Omg it did. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear dress like the other beautiful girls and I alway admired them and remember the days when that&#x27;s all I use to wear. Now in about a month in another bottle I will be dress ready. Oh yeah one more thing this amazing product also firms and lifts and restructure your butt, if u have a concave butt this is your girl body merry.  Thank u thank u so very much</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I am not sure about its long-term affect, but it makes a noticeable difference within a few minutes upon application. It has a cooling/tingling sensation that is quite significant. I actually have to put on a thick robe to warm up. The biggest difference came when I coupled this with Advanced Clinicals Retinol Advanced Firming Cream (http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00DI9IIEK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3). I use Body Merry every morning after my bath and Advanced Clinicals every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Have been using the cellulite cream for about a week and I can see a difference already. It works great and the fragrance is really nice. You feel refreshed after applying it and there is no stain to the clothes or bedding. Will purchase again. Definitely well recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Works good waiting for results, smoother skin</li>
            <li> Feels like the product works as it tingles but not noticing much difference.. Maybe alittle</li>
            <li> Great tingly feel when you put it on.. only need a little bit to feel the effects, so the tub it comes in will last you awhile. I don&#x27;t think anything will really get rid of cellulite if you don&#x27;t also combine this with eating right and exercising.. but it feels great going on, like you can actually feel your skin tightening. Feels cool for awhile after and skin feels incredibly smooth. Definitely recommend this to get your fight against cellulite started!</li>
            <li> This cream works great and is not oily like others i have tried</li>
            <li> Just received it recently received  it on time. I am putting cream on my thighs/butt area. The scent was intense i am pretty sensitive with smells but tolerate it if it works. I did feel a tingling sensation...i guess that is the cream doing its job. We shall see. I shall keep u informed. So for now i am grading it a 3 until i see results.</li>
            <li> I recevied this to review. I love this cream. My legs are smoother. I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream. I am a young and healthy 20 year old who exercises frequently. I have some cellulite at the top of my thighs I was hoping to mask the appearance of. I have been using this product as directed for 4 weeks and have found no differences. The other day it actually caused me to break out in an angry, red rash. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I did not want to write a review until I used all the product to see for myself. Personally, I saw no difference in my body after using the whole tub. Even my boyfriend, who sees me everyday said the same thing. I feel like I wasted my money.. Tbh, maybe it really depends on the person but sadly, it did not work on me as I wished it to. Currently, I&#x27;m debating if I should buy another one to see if it&#x27;ll work on me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It feels like tiger balm once you apply on your body, gets pretty hot &amp; icy. I personally like that feeling but it gets cold at night time.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.  I workout i.e. walk two miles a day and I have a weight regimen with my legs and all this did was moisturize my thighs.</li>
            <li> Working great. The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because it does have a long burn.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I saw results within 5 days. I am almost out of my existing jar and will be purchasing more this afternoon.</li>
            <li> LOVED this product. Feels great, tightens as promised, and smells delicious. The fantastic customer service was the icing on the cake-- not sure that I&#x27;ve ever had such attentive response to my communication from a vendor!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes after using this for almost a month.  In the past, I have used Niviea Cellulite Be Gone and have received more consistent and successful results. It has a weird smell and feels like icy hot when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months since my first jar. I am now on my second order. I really love this stuff! Now that the weather is getting warmer I don&#x27;t mind putting it on (my first jar I got earlier in the year and a cold winter made this cream uncomfortable, felt like I was getting frost bite) It leaves a cool minty tingling on your skin so it&#x27;s better to use it during Warmer days. Since using this product for about three months now I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of cellulite. I use to have unsightly dimples/lumps all over my glutes but thankfully this product made them disappear about 90% (now mostly noticeable if I flex tight) I&#x27;m still trying to get rid of the orange peel cellulite I have on the back of my thighs. That only improved by about 50% but I&#x27;ll take it. Will be ordering more to last me throughout summer!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with cellulite but oddly enough, it did clear up a chronic rash of inflamed hair follicles I had on the back of my legs. Gave it three stars for that. Smells really strong to use in the morning before work. Burns when you put on tight clothing after use (Can you say leggings of fire?! Yikes!).</li>
            <li> Amazing! Saw results after a handful of uses.</li>
            <li> not sure it works, its very tingly..</li>
            <li> It is helping :)  I like the cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;Though I have the feeling that the product in my jar evaporates with time?&lt;br /&gt;Like it very much!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, not only can I see the cellulite disappear but the smoothness and quality of my aging 56 year old neck and chest has improved by 100%.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for a lot of different reasons.  This one is a jackpot!</li>
            <li> Im seeing some results</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE FAN of Body Merry products, and couldn&#x27;t WAIT to try this cream based upon the reviews.  It was delivered in record time; therefore, its too early to determine if it&#x27;ll work for me at this point, but I will do a follow up {by the way, I haven&#x27;t any doubt that this will work}.  It has a medicinal smell, and once I applied the cream, it immediately began tingling with a cooling effect.  I&#x27;m giving this four stars instead of five because of the smell.  I wish this was offered in an odorless cream because I don&#x27;t want to walk around all day, nor go to bed every evening smelling this way.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. It seems to work, albeit slowly, but I believe that with regular use, it will improve the look of the skin in the cellulite areas. It is easy to apply and very pleasant--it has a cooling effect. I think that for better results, you should massage or brush the areas first and then apply this cream. I will probably reorder it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream particularly on my love handle and thighs area for the past few weeks and I can definitely see the love handle area began to firm! I have not seen much result on my thighs yet but I know it will takes some times. I will definitely continue to use this product as I have tried any other brand and failed!</li>
            <li> This Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is awesome! I seen results in just a week! My skin started to tighten and I could not believe it. I love this cream and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much! After having a child cellulite just popped up terribly fierce! After using this product twice a day I saw results within the first week! However i had terrible cellulite so it is not all gone just yet but I actually know this product will take it all away soon. I just wish there was more in the bottle</li>
            <li> Works great :) all that baby fat skin hanging to almost gone been using for a week since its a small jar will be ordering more</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I used it morning and night, and didn&#x27;t notice even a slight change :(</li>
            <li> Best cream I have tried. I could tell a difference in 1 use.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I add some retina A and works even better. Bought 2 jars in a month. Best cellulite cream I ever used!! I wish they would put on on subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li> I just have this for 3 days, and it&#x27;s a good cream, does not make miracle, but reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I think this really works just make sure you use a little amount because this will give you the burning sensation! I can tell is strong so a little goes looooong way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cellulite creams and this one by far is my favorite I&#x27;ve only been using it for under a week and I can already tell a difference and it smells really good too I will definitely be reordering</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have seen a marked improvement in about 1 month. I am looking forward to continued improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super Cold &amp; very Stinky..No, I don&#x27;t care for it &amp; Not seeing a difference either..Sorry</li>
            <li> Thanks to Tomoson.com, I received a  container of #BodyMerry Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream for free to test out.&lt;br /&gt;I am always hesitant to try a new product for few reasons. They always say they can do the same things, but rarely can, or of they do, the effects are only temporary. They all use so many ingredients thats I don&#x27;t know about and don&#x27;t know if they are more good for your body, or harmful.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other Body Merry products and loved them, so I tried to have an open mind when starting this about a week ago. I would use in the morning, after the shower or bath, and at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I would rub it in, in an upwards and swirling motion. I immediately felt smoother after but as I said, I figured it would only be temporary. The first day, it was. But as I was continuously using it more and more, I definitely noticed that my skin WAS smoother and tighter and held in more moisture for longer. My cellulite is not completely gone, but less defined and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Thought this stuff was made to use on the face as well as the rest of body. Seller informed me that  it is meant for the body, not the face. I could not believe my eyes when applied, after about 10 - 15  minutes, the wavy lines around the sides and lower part of my face disappeared. I&#x27;m still in shock, fascinated by how fast and how good this stuff works (even if it is meant for the body). Will definitely buy again, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. It just tingles and opens the sinuses.</li>
            <li> i like the feeling of coolness after applying the cream but didn&#x27;t see any results after using for over a month.</li>
            <li> So far it appears to work. I know you can&#x27;t simply rely on a cream but have to put in your own work as well..</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve searched some products for eliminate cellulite too expensive or others didnt work at all, and this combinated with the brush really works I&#x27;ve only used it for 10 days and I can see some diference I can wait to see how will it works in a weeks. Besides leave a relax and fresh it after use it.</li>
            <li> I was truly hopeful that this product would help. Unfortunately, I saw absolutely no difference after using the entire jar.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It works very well to make skin look healthier and toned.&lt;br /&gt;I love all orgarnic ingredients in it, beside Japanese green tea:(&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will replace it to another green tea. Healthy people who are awakened avoid Japanese product due to severe radioactive pollution...</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results of this product. There are of course many creams and remedies for cellulite removal. Who knows what really works but I have to say that I like this product. Of course, I use massage and that must have much to do with it. But using some other products in the same manner did not yield the same results as with this cream. And, as I said earlier, I love the fragrance of this product and it nice to go to bed with such a nice aromatic ambiance. It was about two months but it really works. After my first review I said I would need more time with the product...the company sent me a sample. I paid for the first one and I am happy to pay this price for this product...the free followup was just blessing on an already good selection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial Review: Seems to work but more time needed...love the smell and feel. Time will tell and another review will be posted as update. If you do not see one then it means we are happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Helped smooth and tighten my skin better then any other cream I have ever tried and I tried everything on the shelf at cvs for the last 9 years. This cream tightens skin gets rid of cellulite and bumps and even 9 year old scars!!! Didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well. I hate the menthol smell though, smells like Vic&#x27;s vapor run and feels like ice where ever you put it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream for about three weeks now and I love, love, love the results. My cellulite is mostly on the backs of my thighs and bum cheeks, since I&#x27;ve been using the gel (it&#x27;s really more of a gel texture) twice a day my visible cellulite has reduced about 85 to 90 percent. I&#x27;m sure I could perfect the results by doing some leg exercises and I intend on doing that. However I&#x27;m more likely to spread cream all over my buns and thighs than exercise daily - we shall see… Btw I live in Canada and right now I have to order directly from the Body Merry website by contacting the owner and making shipping/payment arrangements - it&#x27;s an easy process -  but ***fingers crossed*** hopefully the Body Merry products will be available on Amazon.ca soon - until then I&#x27;ve already ordered two more jars and will continue to do so. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Immediately feel this cream working! Only have been using it for 1 week and already see results! It smells so refreshing and has an awesome cooling, menthol feel! Buy this today! It came super fast and packaged well. I will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> love the smell and the feel. It seems to be working very well. I just ordered more!</li>
            <li> I just started using this, I&#x27;m actually laying in the bath right now trying to get the gel off of me and to warm up, the tingle feeling was too intense... after the cooling went away I was left with a slight chilling burn... I&#x27;m nervous to try it again... but I will give it a second chance tomorrow, in a much smaller proportion.. however, I did notice my skin looking and feeling tighter almost immediately after the gel dried and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad. Nervous to try it again, but excited bc it seems like it&#x27;s going to work!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing! Be patient, give it time, use exactly as directed, and you will see remarkable results. Definitely worth every penny--money well spent!</li>
            <li> Great product and I can slowly see results.</li>
            <li> Guys YOU HAVE YO BUY THIS!!! It is the best product for your cellulite I am dead serious, I have been exercising and putting this cream after my workouts and my legs feel so tight and smooth! It automatically absorbs to your body and it is an very FREEZING feeling. FYI if you leave it in somewhere where it is hot just simply put in the fridge all day and then apply it as usual and it will give you that freezing effect again! LOVE THIS! I&#x27;m already ordering 2 more bottles, So it can be my daily leg cream and I am now trying it on my stomach!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product with all the good reviews but I was let down. The seller was nice enough to email shortly after receiving the product giving directions to get the best use out of this product. It didn&#x27;t work very well for me though. I did not care for the scent, if was too menthol smelling, like vicks vapo rub. Once applied I could feel the tingling from the menthol, and made my skin feel cool for about an hour afterwards. But after that hour, my skin was still dry, it was not moisturizing for me at all and I either had to re-apply or put a different lotion on to keep the areas moisturized. My skin just doesn&#x27;t care for this product.</li>
            <li> Of course I want to get rid of cellulite!  I put this cream on my upper thighs and it blends in quickly, doesn&#x27;t have a distinct smell and will show results!!  I have added this into my daily routine and am excited for the outcome!</li>
            <li> I been using it for 5 days and the results are amazing!  I love love love it I definitely recommend it . Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Cant believe its been a week and already seeing results.</li>
            <li> I didnt see a difference in it my cellulite using this product at all</li>
            <li> love best best cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> very strong smell. and it feels like its freezing your skin, don&#x27;t like how it feels</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, hopefully it will work, I love the sensation of this cream in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product did very little for me.</li>
            <li> Nice! Slow but it works!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. I&#x27;m using it on my thighs and have noticed a change. It has a pleasant smell. I typically use it at bed time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i did receive this product to test.</li>
            <li> Smells like vaporized vaseline.. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin either unfortunately!</li>
            <li> My initial reaction is that this stings! It smells like a muscle pain reliever gel and really tingles. Hopefully that means it&#x27;s working. Time will tell...</li>
            <li> This made my skin really soft.  Great opportunity to review this product</li>
            <li> This is the second container I ordered. The first was very effective in making my cellulite less noticeable.</li>
            <li> makes the stomach smaller, I love it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even say if this works because I used it once and it was ice burning cold on my skin for what seemed like an hour.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Never would I have thought a product such as this would work but I was wrong it&#x27;s works !!</li>
            <li> since I been using this I have seen a great difference and its been less than a month. It has a refreshing scent with sort of minty-menthol effect. The one you want to breathe in when your sick and feel awful, I kept wanting to smell it. A little of this product really goes a long way. It is not too thin and not too thick with sort of pudding consistency. And it did not leave my skin feeling all slimy and gross. After several days of using the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream I could notice that my skin felt and looked a little different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman we want to look great and feel just as great, we love to present ourselves as that, great impressions mean a lot to me so I want to make sure I look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream absorbs well, moisturizer well, tightens and firms skin. I love that it is also natural and organic, made in USA and it is not tested on animals. I really like the way it feels going on. It&#x27;s warm and tingly, almost like a muscle rub but not quite as intense. I find it is a very relaxing part of my night-time routine. The cream has helped firm up the problem areas on my thighs, and it seems the longer I use it the more pronounced the results become.</li>
            <li> The smell is overwhelming. It&#x27;s like Ben gay my husband was completely offended by it mi didn&#x27;t see any changes what so ever in my skin  Will definitely not purchase again</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft but still have cellulite</li>
            <li> Love the product started feeling it as soon as I put it on. Also fast shipping</li>
            <li> I been using this cream for 2 weeks and I do see a difference. I put this cream on morning and night everyday and I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing with the Bliss FatGirlSlim Lean Machine.  Like AMAZING!!!!  On its own (with that nubby little massager) it didn&#x27;t seem spectacular, but this cream compared to FatGirlSlim and EVELINE COSMETICS SLIM EXTREME and the machine resulted in fabulous results.  Like I didn&#x27;t shriek in horror seeing my butt when it was done.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 5-6 weeks now and the region I am using it for is from knee up to the buttock area. I have a strict work out regime and trainer that kicks my butt weekly but for some reason the cellulite was not disappearing from my legs. Well thank god I found this gem ..... This cream has not only significantly decreased the appearance of cellulite but my skin is super soft! I would recommend using a skin massager with comfortable pressure as I have been told that you need to stimulate the cellulite to drain away, and this coupled with the activating ingredients in this cream its really working!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this product. I used it for one month and noticed smoother skin and my cellulite was less visible. I went through one jar in a month and will be ordering a second jar today. Also, the customer service was excellent! After I ordered the product, the Founder &amp; Director reached out to me to provide guidance on how this product should be used and also checked back with me a few weeks after. Hands down, amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different cellulite gels and creams and have had mixed results. Some actually helped and other just smelled funny. So when I was offered this Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream with Caffeine, Retinol &amp; Seaweed for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I wanted to give it a try. So I ordered it and have been using it for a couple weeks now and have had kind of mixed thoughts. It didn&#x27;t stink but the scent is interesting. I think it could be an aquired one though. In a couple weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is tighter and softer. If you are wating a great gel-cream, you should try this one.</li>
            <li> I noticed results and have not even finished one jar yet! The smell is great and the cooling feeling it gives is really nice. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Saw NO different and used morning and night with an increased exercise regime.</li>
            <li> Finished the forst bottle and I&#x27;m seeing results, interested in seeing what occurs after the 2nd</li>
            <li> Love it only using it for 2 weeks and my cellulite are disappearing getting a next bottle</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I have seen too much of a difference. I&#x27;ll keep at it and update this if/when I do!</li>
            <li> Its a must purchase, its worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Tingling sensation irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> best cream ever so recommended love it</li>
            <li> Using this product twice a day. Moring and at nighy as directed for best results. Well been doing the steps for about two weeks now and can totally see a difference! Bought two more jars. Highly recommended it for women with bad cellulite and want to see results. Also it smells like vapor rub and feels like icy hot when rubbed in and has a tingly feeling for about 20-30 mins. Drys super quick as well.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from Amazon for over a year now and this is my very first review I&#x27;ve ever written on here. I just wanted to say that I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;m a 22 year old mom of 2. I am 5&#x27; 9&amp;#34; and 125lbs. After my second child I started getting mild cellulite on my thighs and this product has helped so much! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half, once daily, with the finulite massager mitt. I love the cool tingle it leaves after applying. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.  Smells  mediciney  but  I figure if it smells bad it&#x27;ll  work just like regular halls Vs cherry 🍒 halls. Ha</li>
            <li> I just received my product.  I was excited like a kid in a candy store. I must I was shocked because my package arrived before the expected date, which was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately opened it. After reading the reviews, I was expecting some strong medicinal aroma.  However, it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant  at all. If you have grandparents, Bengay smells far worse. The cream has a smooth consistency and absorbed fairly easy. The tingling actually  began for me about 10 mins after the application. It isn&#x27;t unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here goes Day 1! See you guys in two weeks!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was very different than others I have tried. It actually works. It has been awhile since I was comfortable wearing shorts.I wish I could have taken picture for before. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is very reminiscent of &amp;#34;Bengay&amp;#34;....but then a sweet under note starts to come through, that make the experience quite pleasant! The gel is very very silky..and like the seller told me, a little goes a long way! Leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth....and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 4 or more weeks, as after just a couple days, it already looks nicer!</li>
            <li> wow . I got this cream just a couple days ago and already see results . I know crazy right ? I typically don&#x27;t see results so fast with a beauty care product but this one is amazing . I&#x27;m currently on a journey to tighten and tone my body after some weight loss and have a little loose skin around my butt and thighs and a bit of cellulite to get rid of . I use this when I get out of the shower and use a light amount and massage in an upward motion as it says on the box . I really like the tingling sensation :) this my whole honest opinion for this review and am glad I could give feedback</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail yesterday and used it last night before bed and this morning before work.  It feels simply amazing on my skin. There&#x27;s a cool, soothing feeling you get after you&#x27;ve applied it.  I haven&#x27;t had enough time to see the effects on cellulite, but I can tell you I&#x27;ve already ordered a second jar to have on hand because I already love this product!  As I&#x27;ve seen others state below, the customer service I received from this company was amazing.  They followed up with a email to give me tips on using the product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have used it faithfully, to no advantage.  Every body is different, so it could possibly help others.  The customer service is fantastic, and followed up to see if I was liking the cream.</li>
            <li> Love how the cream feeling so invigorating after you apply to your skin.  My husband thinks my legs and arms look firmer!  I will order again soon!</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel it working after the first use!! It feels natural and smells really good!!</li>
            <li> This cream is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I do use it twice daily as directed and I have a massager that I also use along with it.  It only takes a few minutes to sink in and a tingly feeling lasts long after I&#x27;m finished.  I have researched some about cellulite and I have read that retinol and seaweed really do help the appearance of cellulite and this product has both!  The price is very fair so what do you have to lose?  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This product along with the dry brushing, I do has truly reduced cellulite that I have on the back of my thighs, and bum. I also enjoy the tingling sensation you will feel when you apply the Gel-cream to you skin.But please remember you should drink lots of water and do some type of exercise  I am happy to have made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, since it had so many great reviews. I have been using it religiously for the past two weeks, morning and evening and I have not seen any results so far regarding my cellulite (the jar is almost gone). The only thing it did to my legs was to moisturize them.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I love the way it tingles. My body really responds well with I natural ingredients.  I recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> REALLY HELPED ME!  Try this!!!!!  Thank you Body Merry - I want to hug you!</li>
            <li> not sure what the benefits are after using the whole jar except it burns a little bit</li>
            <li> Works very well with execersibg and dieting</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all have got to try this cream!  It is a miracle in a jar!!!  I hope they never stop making it.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve tried lots of different ones and this is the only one that has ever actually worked! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and have definitely noticed a difference. Skin feels much firmer and dimples are definitely less noticeable. I paid full price for it and I will definitely be buying more. Happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for 20 days and already notice a difference.  I love that it has a nice smell and the tingling sensative is nice.  I still have a 1/2 jar left, but I am going to order more so I can on hand.  I&#x27;ve also allowed a coupld friends try out and they are sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Great product and works great</li>
            <li> Recently started using the product and I&#x27;m not sure of how well it will work.  The texture of the product is good and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love the cream ,smells good,absorbs very quickly .And the best thing is the cooling sensation,very good for hot summer</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the cream but haven&#x27;t noticed much for results.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations of this product, especially since I&#x27;ve used creams from Body Merry that has worked for me. Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. I still a good amount of product sitting around since I had gone over the return policy because I was hoping to see results, but I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference. I use this mainly on the back of my thighs and my buttocks. I think it might&#x27;ve actually made my buttocks look worse than how it was before I started using this. I&#x27;m very disappointed this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Works Well, But Smells pretty strong, Kind of like bengay But if you don&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ,doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> My skin is seemingly turning back time. This Cellulite Defense formula leaves my skin invigorated long after its application. I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered it.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. First, if used twice a day, I saw results. Second, although I like the smell of menthol, I do not want to go shopping with the smell of having a sports injury. Third, all these types of products are very expensive when you consider how much you need to use them ... Twice a day on large areas. Body Merry&#x27;s products are reasonably priced, even this one, but this would be a pretty expensive habit. I am going to see if once a day is worth the price. At once week of use I am already through 1/2 the jar.</li>
            <li> I applied as directed 2x a day. I&#x27;ve finally emptied the bottle after 4 weeks, and there was absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I was hesitant on buying it because I didn&#x27;t think it would work but I started seeing results after only using it for a week and a half. The customer service team is great, I got an email right away about tips on how to make it more effective and they did a follow up to see how it was working. I will be a long term customer with this company for sure. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the second jar I&#x27;ve ordered; I feel like I do see results with this gel. I also have been working out a lot. I feel it has reduced the appearance of my cellulite. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Feels good! Not sure if it works</li>
            <li> I love the cooling effect of this cream...I am starting to see some results</li>
            <li> Did not see any change at all. Nice smell though</li>
            <li> Not good I did not see difference .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 110 lbs. but I&#x27;ve been fighting cellulite for years.  In conjunction with healthier eating habits and working out, I&#x27;ve been using this cream.  I can see a noticeable difference in my legs.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this to try at a dicount and let me tell you this stuff really works! I mean the very second you rub it into your skin, you can feel the caffeine in it. I&#x27;ve used this about a week and half now and you can tell an amazing difference in my leg and thigh area. If anyone is looking for something like this and you really want to know and feel it working then I totally suggest you buy this!</li>
            <li> Product did not work. I worked out during the time period and eat healthier. Also, I use the whole jar.. waiting for results, but nothing happen... I can&#x27;t explain why. All I can say is that I tried. The gel-cream has a menthol smell and its pretty refreshing when you apply it. Plus+++ Seller was kind enough to send me a full- refund for the item. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Could tell no difference.</li>
            <li> I have being using this product for a few days now with a cellulite brush and i am starting to see difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Best product ever!  If used faithfully, it will reduce the appearance of cellulite...amazing!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after getting out of the shower and with a hand held cellulite massager for a couple weeks, and I can see a difference. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for about this product is that it has some sort of mentholated ingredient in it, and when I first used it, I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the intense icy sensation on my body! It was so cold that I had to go outside of my home where it was warmer ( I had the AC on). I really don&#x27;t like that because the effects take awhile to wear off.</li>
            <li> I was unable to properly test and review this product because of the overwhelming and overpowering smell of menthol.  It is the strongest stuff I&#x27;ve ever smelled and after just one use, it was enough to make me not ever want to get near it again.  I&#x27;m not one of those reviewers who is going to lie because I got a free product.  It&#x27;s just not going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying this product doesn&#x27;t work, hence the 3 stars.  However, in order to be able to use something to thoroughly provide testing, it would require you to be able to use it.  Because of the overpowering scent, I just could not use it.  So, if you can&#x27;t use something because the smell is so heinous, it probably isn&#x27;t going to be very effective no matter how awesome the product.</li>
            <li> There is a love and hate relationship with cellulite creams because many simply do not work. It seems they cant get the format right. They target one aspect or use one key ingredients but not others. Well here is a cellulite cream that got the format right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry&#x27;s Cellulite Gel-Cream is the perfect combination of key ingredients in the right combination to target that stubborn cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine, Retinol, different seaweeds, organic cayenne and green tea. All working together to firm, tone, improve circulation, and improve the appearance of the texture of our skin. No more lumps and bumps. To be honest at first I thought I was losing weight and I thought to myself what am I doing differently but then I realized the only thing different was the cream. My legs looked more tone and more youthful. I was shocked but must say I am truly a fan and cant imagine being without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly with no product residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You got to give this one a try. It is totally different. Once you have tried it you will wonder why you never tried it before.</li>
            <li> Aging is not fun and sometimes the signs show up sooner than later. One of these are the pesky lumps, bumps, and areas that are just not as smooth as when we were in our hey-days. It&#x27;s called cellulite and its not fun even though it isn&#x27;t deadly and most of the time we can cover it up. Body Merry has a product that helps a bit in combating the looks of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now tried Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for a couple of weeks. I simply have not used it daily, but when I have, I have been pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it were not a help as a defense against the appearance of cellulite, it certainly is a pleasant gel cream to use. It seems absolutely therapeutic to me. After applying to those pesky cellulite areas (ladies, you know where), the warmth and feel as it works and the aromatic therapy is, to me, worth using. I like it for this effect in and of itself! Also, I have noticed that the areas to which I applied the gel cream have a smoother appearance. So I can say this is a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend it? Well, I can only suggest you try it to see if it works for you and if provides any benefit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions expressed are solely my own.I was not compensated for this review.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Body Merry’s Cellulite Defense Cream. Let me just say I have always been skeptical of cellulite creams. I mean really how can a cream get rid of cellulite? I have never used cellulite cream before but thought I would give this cream a chance. If nothing else, I love the way it smells. It has a light minty fragrance to it. I’m very self conscious of cellulite on my arms. So I decided that this would be a great spot to try out the cream. I applied the cream to my upper arms. After a few minutes I experienced this cool tingle. It was kind of refreshing. It must be working or doing something at least! After about 2 weeks of use I’m starting to see some results. The directions say to apply twice a day and I’ll admit I typically use once a day after showering. So now I can only imagine the results I’ll see if I actually followed the directions and used twice a day. I have to say overall I’m rather impressed with this cellulite cream and look forward to seeing more results in the future. I would recommend this cellulite cream to a friend who might be trying to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a change sadly.. Not sure if it even really worked</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  However, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> Just started using. Leaves a tingling that I like. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle- if any creams really got rid of cellulite they wouldn&#x27;t be a price most if us can afford or on amazon. Always worth a try for even the smallest improvement. I&#x27;ll try to update after done with the jar. I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I got this to try.  I have gotten to try a few cellulite creams and this one threw me for a loop.  I had no idea it had menthol in it.  So when you are putting this one on be very careful not to hit lady parts that will give you a surprise and a very cooling feeling for quite some time.  Of course hubby thought this was so funny.lol  The bottle of course I am a big fan of pink so I loved it a very simple yet eye catching design.  When I did smell it I could tell right away there was menthol in it.  Guess I should have smelled before using lol.  It did not leave a long lasting smell so no worries you will not smell like icy hot all day .This cream is not really a cream it is a brown gel looks a little funny but you can feel it cooling you skin in just a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I used this one for about 2 weeks.  Besides not being very careful (I learned my lesson quick) lol  I did tell a difference in my thighs I don&#x27;t know if it just cooled all the cellulite away or what but I would definitely use this one again.  Very light gel soaked right in and did not leave the weird sticky feeling.  I have also been using this on my stomach and it has been making a difference but I have to be honest it has a lot of work to do there so I might need another bottle just for that area.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews and thought I&#x27;d try this myself. Although it didnt get rid of my cellulite, the area did start to look better. It has that cold feeling after you put it on so just as the directions said I let it dry. Nice product and I wouldn&#x27;t mind using it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this cellulite cream on her thighs and bum bum for several weeks now and she came over yesterday to show me the results.  I was pretty impressed and I&#x27;m so bummed I gave her this to review for me.  She is in that &amp;#34;young adult&amp;#34; age group and has a dozen besties who she&#x27;s impressed as well.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be purchasing my own Body Merry cellulite cream before it&#x27;s over.&lt;br /&gt;She demonstrated how to apply it and I took photos but I can&#x27;t figure out how to add them on here.  Help anyone?  It&#x27;s so easy to apply and it took her seconds.&lt;br /&gt;One thing she doesn&#x27;t like about the product is the smell.  I didn&#x27;t mind the smell when she was applying it.  It&#x27;s kind of like a eucalyptus smell to me.  Know what I mean?  Maybe a little mentholish.  That has NOT stopped her and her friends from using it.  She said the only time she does not use this is if she is going to an event of any type and only because she went to one and some one asked her what that smell was.  I lol when she told me that.  She&#x27;s a sassy little thing like her mama and I can only imagine what her response was.</li>
            <li> I want to try this natural and organic anti cellulite cream because all the ingredients are amazing: caffeine, retinol and seaweed. I read a lot about the benefits of seaweed to combat cellulite. I like the sweet minty smell. The fragrance barely leaves a trace once fully absorbed. I love it! Is very light and easy to apply. It absorbs really quickly, you can put your clothes and go out.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to add this anti cellulite cream to your beauty routine because it helps minimize cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> This cream feels amazing when you put it on (I use it with an applicator). Soaks in easily and I can already notice less cellulite in less than a month!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me! I noticed no change in my skin</li>
            <li> I did not like this gel. I don&#x27;t have a bad issue with cellulite but I thought it went on in the shower. It feels weird. I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> ZERO difference .. I have used used the cellulite messager in the shower prior and this gel twice a day..I have now used the entire jar with NO difference.  I even run and use weights.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I have only been using this cream for about 2 weeks and I can definitly see a difference in the size and amount of dimples in the back of my thighs.  I haven&#x27;t been religous about using this twice a day, but I think it would improve my results. The cream feels very cold, like icy hot, make sure to rub it in good, I use a cellulite brush. Just a little background onme..... I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4,  119 lbs and I work out every day, eat pretty healthy and drink lots of water.  Im pretty sure thats helping.  I would definitely try it, they have a 90 day guarantee!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream to use on your body. I didn&#x27;t exactly notice the improvement of cellulite but it&#x27;s very moisturizing and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Body Merry&#x27;s ingredient&#x27;s in their Cellulite Gel-Cream will give us the best shot at keeping it under control. That and vigilance. Caffeine is used to reduce the size of the fat cells that cause cellulite, and Retinol thickens and improves circulation in the skin and finally seaweed absorbs fat from under the surface of the skin and diminishes cellulite in that fashion. The cream is lightweight and has light scent as well as being natural. It goes on smooth. The best time to apply the cream is after a shower, reason being is your skin is clean and rid of dirt and dead skin. I use it twice a day morning and night. I experienced no side effects or redness being that I have sensitive skin. I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> So I applied it last night on my stretch marks &amp; cellulite. I applied it quite liberally. Love the fact it has no artificial smell or anything.&lt;br /&gt;Oh boy I can already see the difference, my skin is smoother, &amp; I feel the appearance of cellulite is lighter, I mean I know such effects are visible only after longer usage of a product, &amp; I don&#x27;t think its psychological, &amp; I am not saying that the cellulite is gone, but its a bit lighter now, &amp; my skin feels smooth &amp; firm. SO what happens after using it for a longer time, like a month&#x27;s time &amp; if the cellulite disappears, I can update you later on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is good, simple &amp; practical in a white container. It is however very sturdy, light weight &amp; therefore travel friendly, I can easily slip it into my bag.&lt;br /&gt;The cream gets instantly absorbed in the skin &amp; it feels fresh &amp; a tad cold ( I don&#x27;t know how else to describe that ) &amp; refreshing on application, I liked it so much that I wanted to apply it on my whole body but stopped myself from doing so.&lt;br /&gt;i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how some ppl can say that it works, sorry but it doesn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have too much cellulitis and even when I use it every day it didn&#x27;t do anything, not at all. It sucks that I really believed the ppl that said is good. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product although I&#x27;m not sure which one is more effective: this cream or the cellulite massager that I bought along with this item. I&#x27;ve been only using it for two days but I can already see an improvement in my thighs. It feels smoother now and stretch marks are becoming less visible.</li>
            <li> The jar is practically all gone and did not help at all,i have been using it for 3 weeks and no results.</li>
            <li> I think this is great value for money and that it is working... slowly but surely (which is a hell of a lot better than not at all) I think this is a lot more effective than anything you can get on the market</li>
            <li> with cont. use good..</li>
            <li> It may work but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  So I tried once and that was it.  Sorry to say.  My family asked me if I bought a new perfume or something? They did not like it either.  It it was non fragrant I may have stuck with it.  But too strong not to be noticed.</li>
            <li> I honestly have no idea if this is actually working or not, but it feels awesome. Almost like an intense Icy Hot or something. I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar. I&#x27;m wishing I had taken before and after photos.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to contact this seller directly.  I went on to my orders from Amazon and I don&#x27;t see where I am able to contact the seller.  I really would appreciate a refund on this.  It gave me a weird itchy rash.  I tried it for 3 nights.  Yeah, I guess I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson after the first time lol!!!  I really wanted it to work for me but it didn&#x27;t.  I have fairly sensitive skin so this may work for someone else but be aware that it has a very icy, cooling effect and it will be very uncomfortable if you accidently get in on body parts that you didn&#x27;t mean to get it on.  I was freezing for at least 20 minutes.  I even had to bring out the big winter robe in the middle of summer.</li>
            <li> I got the cellulite defense and started to use the jar, but my daughter asked me if she could try it.&lt;br /&gt;So, of course being a nice dad, I did. She loves it and I got two more for her. She said she saw a big difference in legs so now she is going to start using it on her body...</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly.  Not sure if my cellulite has diminished......</li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams before, NONE of them have worked for me. I workout and do everything that I have to but I still had a problem with cellulite. This has saved my legs! Can&#x27;t wait to go to the beach! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the cream only at night after taking a shower and used the cellulite massager bush from scala beauty. You will notice changes within a few days. of course the deeper the cellulite the longer it takes to see changes!</li>
            <li> My experience with the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is one I can compare to starting a new potential relationship. We are still in the courting phase, but so far so good. I have noticed less cellulite on the front of my thighs, not so much on the back even though I concentrate a little more on the back (mostly because it has been there longer than the cellulite on the front). I am still using this faithfully every day, although I am almost out. I will have to reorder another jar very soon. This unique natural formula has piqued my interest and I do see the potential, therefore, I am willing to court this product a while longer to see if we can have a long lasting relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I understand I have to do my part (exercise more, drink even more water, and cut down on even more sugar....ugh!), and I&#x27;m sure with continued consistent use I will be dimple free with the aid of this product</li>
            <li> this product leaves you feeling very invigorated! It has menthol in it and makes your skin feel tingly. I love it and would recommend for sure!!</li>
            <li> Wife seems to love this product. She says it leaves a pleasant tingling sensation, with a smell that she finds okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she is starting to see results from this, so she is happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> No difference. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I just received the product yesterday and had my cream on my butt and legs. But in the morning I woke up and felt very anxious, tremble, headache, and really fast heart bumping. I even had little trouble breathing properly. I never drink coffee because of caffein. So maybe because of the caffein in the cream made me like this? I am not sure. Would this can happen?</li>
            <li> Was very excited for this product but it ran out in a week so it didn&#x27;t tone at all either. :(</li>
            <li> Love this cream.Very simple and easy to use. The caffeine sure helps keep you adding more to yourself, as it boosts your body. The cream, is not oily at all, and feels great on the skin. Soaks in the skin fast. Stays on the skin for a long time and you only need to apply once or twice. Healthy ingredients as well</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after only a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and I will continue to use it all my problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;The price was just right and it has worked miracles.</li>
            <li> I am a big skeptic when it comes to these things, but this really does work! Has a strong smell like sandlewood insence or something and it burrns like crazy for a few minutes after you apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK!!  I had very high hopes after reading the reviews.  It was a waste of money like all the other creams I have tried.  Very disappointing.  I never write reviews but I purchased this cream due to the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. First time I used it I could feel it working I will most be buying this again</li>
            <li> I have been using for about two months now and i don&#x27;t see a difference. I&#x27;m not saying this hasn&#x27;t worked for other people but it just hasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, very disappointed, Ladies please save your money!</li>
            <li> I like this gel-cream. Just opened my third jar. With the first two I did not use a cellulite massager, because of this did not see too much improvement. So I am hoping the massager makes a difference.</li>
            <li> As a long time Amazon customer, this is first and only product I&#x27;ve ever reviewed. I&#x27;ve purchased several cellulite products over the years, however, this is only product that is working for me. I was searching for a product with caffeine and seaweed (mentioned on Dr Oz) and stumbled onto this one. And, I was very interested in the reviews. Thank you, Body Merry!  In the evening, I apply after shower and massage in with the Finulite Smoothing Massager. Just a few minutes for each thigh and use the dry brushing technique, massaging/stroking upward toward heart (for lymphatic system). only takes a few minutes per thigh. On day three, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt tighter (no way I thought) but after approximately 2 weeks I started noticing that my skin was not only tighter but smoother. I will not question the results. I&#x27;m amazed. No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly. Or produced results...period! I find the menthol quite pleasant and it tingles and dissipates within 30 minutes or so. Just yesterday, I ordered 4 jars and will give 2 to younger family members as Christmas gifts. Will be interesting to see if they experience similar results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see how two younger women respond to this product. BTW - I have not been compensated for this review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably give it 5 stars if I used it twice a day as directed. I don&#x27;t have much time to apply and the tingly feeling bothers me anyways. I&#x27;ve still seen a difference though from once a day over maybe a month now. It also is a good amount given. Since it&#x27;s gel-like, a little bit goes a loooong way. The smell isn&#x27;t.. pleasant. But it&#x27;s okay. The only thing I feel mentioning in the review would be the tingles. It&#x27;s like a cold sweat feeling. If not just a cold feeling. So many reviews say it&#x27;s relaxing but it drives me nuts lol.</li>
            <li> First let me say WOW you can really feel this one work! Body Magic offered me the opportunity to try out their cream about a week ago and I have been using it near my inner thighs twice daily as directed. I wanted to concentrate on just one area so that I could try to use the product for a full month to try to get the full effectiveness of it so im doing my review based on what I know now and what I think about it! For one the first thing I noticed was the scent! its absolutely refreshing! it has a very minty smell to it. which I loved because it makes you feel so fresh and clean lol. It leaves your skin warm and tingly for about 20 minutes I noticed that’s what I meant when I said you can defiantly feel this one working! After a couple das I noticed my skin was smoother and a little tighter so I know its working! this is a amazing product and I cant wait to see the results at the end of the month!</li>
            <li> Used this product twice daily as suggested. It did tingle but that was it. No results other than that. The seller was wonderful tho and promptly refunded my money. Would recommend this seller, if not the product</li>
            <li> Love the tingle factor!</li>
            <li> I have used the cream for six weeks now and have seen the difference on my skin, the elasticity, and the smooth feeling that I had been missing for quite a while are back.  Needless to say, I like the way that my skin is responding. I do realize that these products not only take time but also require commitment, and I am satisfied enough to continue using it, alternating with another cellulite cream, plus massage and exercise and diet. I would definitely recommend. This seems to be a relatively new product, with a diligent customer service, eager to hear from us regarding the effectiveness of the product, which is another plus. A little goes a long way and I feel it more effective after showering and massage. I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot. I think it works. I&#x27;ll re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels when I massage this cream into my skin. There is a pleasant tingling feeling and it&#x27;s non greasy.  A little of this product goes a long way.There is a visible look of firmness to my thighs and arms and I apply it immediately after showering.</li>
            <li> After TOO much money spent on other products, I simply typed in &amp;#34;Best Cellulite Cream EVER!&amp;#34; in a search engine and this product popped up.  Due to the fabulous reviews (something I rarely give myself) I decided to try it because I still felt a little desperate to fix the cosmetic ails that torment me!  I have recently lost 35 pounds at the age of 57 &amp; was quite dismayed to find too much loose skin on my thighs, along with some residual cellulite on the top outer thigh area &amp; abdomen, so I had to try and find a little extra help to alleviate this unsightly looking loose skin.  I bought this product, along with a great cellulite massager, and I can honestly say that it DOES appear to be working after only a week.  My thighs are noticeably tighter, which gives me renewed determination to continue with my healthy eating plan since I have about 7 more pounds to go.  It is not a thick cream, but I like it because it does work well with the massager &amp; absorbs very well.  Yes, it does have a strong menthol smell but I like that too because it makes my skin tingle which makes me feel that it is having a positive interaction with my skin.  I have NOT noticed any discernable benefit to my abdominal area yet, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I won&#x27;t continue to give it time.  I do NOT use it twice a day, only once right after a shower &amp; still see results.  I hope that with my continued health/fitness plan that my skin will continue to look &amp; fee renewed.</li>
            <li> Buy this and a derma roller... No more cellulite</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to this brand. I have been using the other product for stretch mark and I really luv it the best I have ever been used. now this one I have used for 2 weeks and I can see the texture and the appearance of my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered 2 jars of this product and contacted the seller as I did not notice a difference yet however I was contacted immediately and was so impressed with the customer service and advice.  I need to use this 6-8 weeks and will leave more information after that time but so far love the special and so easy to use.  Nicely packaged too.  Hope it works as I really was impressed with the customer service and so hard to find that today buying online.  I will give this 5 stars as product is reasonable, goes on easily, smells great as I love the minty smell and amazing customer service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference in my celluite at all. :(((</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the many great reviews, but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I truly wish it had worked like others have said it does for them, but I really saw no change.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today. I will write a more indepth review if I continue to use this product. All I can say from the initial use is that I feel like I&#x27;m submerged in Icy Hot...not so much in a good way either.</li>
            <li> This product REALLY DOES WORK ... BUT, it smells like another product called BenGay muscle cream! I really don&#x27;t want to smell like an old woman who has muscle pain. I won&#x27;t be using it again ONLY due to the smell. It REALLY works thou.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for five days and I already see results! It is a light gel with a medicinal herbal based scent that warms once it is applied (I happen to like both). My goal was to find a product to firm the skin on my stomach (from having children and aging). Along with healthy diet and exercise, this added touch seems to be doing the trick! I will definitely be re-ordering :) Thank you - Body Merry!</li>
            <li> My wife has dealt with cellulite in her belly since the birth of our second child. She only weighs 114 pounds and all the extra pounds are right in the middle. She was able to try this cream for free and is looking forward to how it works getting rid of the cellulite. She has tried it for a few days and has already noticed it working. She will continue to use it, expecting and hoping for the promised results. If it continues to work this well, the results will be perfect. The best part of this is the product is made of natural ingredients that will not hurt her. She looks forward to more good results and a younger youthful look. What she knows now is the product makes her skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see a change in my upper thighs and butt, plus I love the minty-cool tingle that lets me know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and have already noticed a difference. I can tell it is working by the tingling and slight warming upon application. So many great things about this product where to start.. The smell is amazing, natural organic ingredients, not tested on animals, and best of all I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin where I have been using it. I have tried many cellulite products with no avail but this here is my silver lining to all that.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used long so don&#x27;t know how well it actually works on cellulite, i will update next month, BUT i love how it feels and i love the cooling sensation makes it feel like it may work by getting circulation going? AND best of all.... it doesnt SMELL Bad!!! every other cellulite cream smells TERRIBLE so i can&#x27; t even use it. i love this so far!!!</li>
            <li> Used it as described and did not notice any differnce in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this cream. I used it for several weeks. Apprx two hours after application of upper legs I could feel it spreading to other areas. It definitely absorbs. But if you are using it on your upper legs or butt... you run the risk of feeling over stimulated in other areas. Burning in the privates. Not good. Even when not applied near those areas. I did not like the cream at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other reviews for this product at the time, were sponsored by the company that made the product. My review is truly an unbiased. Product not good.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works!!!! Ive tried many ....MANY other products and this is by far THE BEST out there!!! Ive only been using it for 8 days...8days!!! and Im already seeing and feeling the results....It hasn&#x27;t disappeared completely but pretty soon I&#x27;m sure it will be history!! I do workout 6 times a week...That helps with firming up as well...Ive been searching for this ...something that works with my body to eliminate the cellulites... Im glad I found Body Merry!!! I can&#x27;t wait for the long term results!! I will post a before and after pictures within a couple of weeks!:D</li>
            <li> As I start to get a bit older I seen some signs of cellulite sneaking up on my thighs and the backs of my arms.  I have used two different solutions for cellulite and this one seems to work the best. I have been using is for 2 and a half weeks not and can feel and see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Body Merry has a Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream that works amazingly! When you open the 4oz jar you can smell the menthol. It reminds me of Vicks. It is a cr&amp;egrave;me color that is some what think. You are to rub the cream into your problem areas in circular motions until it is absorbed into your skin. You will feel a slight &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation. It lets me know the cream is working. I happen to like the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After 2 and a half weeks I have noticed smoother firmer skin. My skin looks so much healthier. I feel so much more confident when wearing skirts, shorts and dresses and not to mention tank tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it for maximum results. If you are starting to see signs f cellulite I suggest picking up a bottle of Body Merry Cellulite Defence Gel-Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I have received this product for testing purposes from tomoson and the respective company. With that said any and all opinions mentioned above are of my own and have not been altered in any way, shape or form.</li>
            <li> Product feels good on my skin.... not sure if it works as much as other people say but need to give it time to see if i see a change</li>
            <li> First off, it is a gel cream and like what the company stated it is easier to spread around &amp; massage unlike creams. The only thing you need to do is be careful because it is a little slippery, so take little amounts at a time to conserve product and minimize wasting. A little goes a long way. It is my first time to use a cellulite gel cream so I was fascinated how easy it is to use - just seconds of massaging for it to be absorbed. I noticed that it has a strong minty smell that took me by surprise, after a while though it will vanish. And while massaging, it gives off a spicy cold feeling, burning &amp; toning your cellulite whilst the process. Once you are  done, the cold sensation is still there, going stronger and stronger for about 20-30 minutes I&#x27;d say and then it will begin to die down. Overall, it is very soothing and relaxing to bust out these cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DIY-ed a cellulite scrub before out of leftover coffee granules mixed with olive oil. The rising problem was it clogs up the bathtub and so it is dangerous to keep on with that process. I prefer this any day and its easier and convenient to apply 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is interesting to see the results after a few weeks and I can say, continued use and exercise will speed up results. This is really good for toning so I used it on my arms to see a difference. After attending 2 parties with lots of people telling me I look slimmer (around the belly area &amp; arms), I was convinced that this made a difference for myself. I will just continue using this and see how effective it is even when one forgets about exercising or forget the daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 8 times &amp; have already noticed that my skin looks smoother. I will definitely continue using &amp; purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review: This product is the third cellulite fighting product I have tried in my life time.  I have really enjoyed using products like this because I have seen really good positive results.  Body Merry is also a company who knows their body creams because this product works really good!With my experience, I like the smell, but its so strong that I can only put it on and have it on for about 10-20 minutes away from my husband who doesn&#x27;t like it at all.  I like the pudding like consistency of the gel-cream, its easy to put on and rub into your skin.  The &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; feel is stronger than any other product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m still not used to it after a month.  But I also don&#x27;t like icy/hot, or muscle rub products that do the same thing.  I used this product on my stomach where my Mommyhood stretch marks are the worst.  It is working great on the cellulite, and even smoothing my stretch marked skin too.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Body Merry was nice enough to send me a jar of their Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream last month to try and review. I haven&#x27;t used it exactly like they said so I really can&#x27;t stay if it works for cellulite but I can say the skin does look smoother after using it for the last month. Besides that I loved the warming feeling it left after applying. The smell is not bad either. After trying other cellulite creams I would have to say this is one of my favorites. Most cellulite creams have a horrible smell and I did not think this one was bad at all. I honestly can not say I recommend it but I think it is worth trying and seeing what it does for you.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time trying this product and I&#x27;ve had it now for a couple weeks. I&#x27;ve tried other similiar products so I&#x27;m use to the smell and feel when you put it on. I am unable to actually see a difference right now so I can&#x27;t give a full review. Will update this once I have finished this bottle and determine whether I will buy more.</li>
            <li> It only lasted a week...I don&#x27;t think that is really long enough to see a real difference. I did kind of notice a slight difference but I think if it lasted at least two weeks I would have seen a change. Definitely cant buy a new jar every week that&#x27;s just ridiculous. The smell was a little much, it smelled like vics which isn&#x27;t terrible but can be strong. More or less the jar just needs to be bigger.</li>
            <li> I almost froze to death after putting it on my legs. It makes you feel like you have put on BenGay on your legs. If it wasn&#x27;t for that sensation, I would have kept it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! You will see results within days.</li>
            <li> Obviously I was skeptical when I first got this product, but I don&#x27;t think many women would turn down the chance at getting those supposed results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, there is an overpowering minty scent to this product.  The fragrance didn&#x27;t bother me, but it was something that I could see others having issue with.  As a bonus, I liked to tell myself that it was a great way to clear my sinuses every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to describe the consistency of this product, and I feel &amp;#34;gel-cream&amp;#34; really does it the best.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy and leaves absolutely no residue behind - everything absorbs into your skin almost immediately, leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Then, the magic begins!  I began feeling my leg get goosebumps because of it&#x27;s cooling effects.  Then, without warning, the product began heating up - leaving my thigh tingly all over.  A word of caution - the first time I tried this product, I might have applied it carelessly and gotten it on some more &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; areas.  It BURNS on sensitive skin.  I think anyone who has ever used IcyHot on an more sensitive area knows exactly what I am talking about!  Therefore, be very cautious about where the product is applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks, my skin definitely felt noticeably softer and smoother!  I used the product once per day, on only 1 thigh, and I have about 1/4 of the jar left.  Therefore, I would suspect a jar to last about 1 week of the recommended, twice daily application.  The amazing thing is, Body Merry offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee - if you don&#x27;t like the results you get, just contact them and they will give you all of your money back - you don&#x27;t even need to return the product!  With that kind of customer service, there&#x27;s no reason not to try this for yourself!</li>
            <li> I use the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for 3 weeks. In those 3 weeks I noticed that my skin felt smoother. My cellulite is still visible, and I didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for, but I like that my skin felt smooth. I will continue to use the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream since I like that it did smoothen my skin. I know that there is no miracle cream out there that will eliminate cellulite completely. Diet, and exercise will make a huge difference too. In terms of the cream absorbing into the skin it does quickly. It also has a strong scent that reminds me of Vick&#x27;s VapoRub. The scent goes away after 5 minutes of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for reviewing purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly this cream dries. I have been using it for about 4 weeks and have seen good results. My skin looks firmer and healthier. I hope to see more improvement as I continue to use this product. I would definitely recommend this cream to others.</li>
            <li> This cream is easy to put on. It also works well with TopNotch massager brush. It leaves a warming sensation that disappears quickly. It is nice to see that the president of this company cares enough to follow up with a letter to tell you exactly how to use it to see the most benefit and if not happy how to contact them. I liked the product enough to order it again. It definitely helps to minimize the look of cellulite (though nothing in my experience gets rid of it altogether, or prevent it from occurring again if one is prone to cellulite). I gave it 4 star because it is one of the better creams I have used. 5 star will be for a company that can figure out how to get rid of it for good &amp; prevent it from occurring. &amp;#34;Cellulite Offense&amp;#34; cream perhaps!</li>
            <li> This is great! It really works! I have less &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; on my thighs from using this. It is a must buy!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the ultimate cellulite cream the Defense Gel from Body Merry is a great choice!!&lt;br /&gt;I will say if you don&#x27;t like the strong scents of menthol you might not be a fan of the product. I love the smell of menthol but not like what is in the cellulite cream so I am passing it on to my cousin who LOVES the smell of menthol. I am passing this cream/gel off to my cousin who LOVES the smell of menthol &amp; is looking to have her cellulite go away. I will update my review with her thoughts once she has used the product for a good bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note you won&#x27;t see results overnight but over the course of weeks you will begin to see result.</li>
            <li> I have tried this Cellulite gel for 2 weeks with eating healthy and drinking a lot of water. I had applied the gel in the morning after taking a shower and again at night after showering. And all I can say is that this product was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Body Kerry are good products for the price. I&#x27;ve noticed a very slight difference. Giving the product more time. :) received through elite deals</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a cellulite cream that contained the 3 key ingredients which fight cellulite: caffeine which  is the classic ingredient in cellulite creams because it immediately tightens the skin; retinol which boosts collagen and works even better when combined with caffeine;  and seaweed which literally absorbs fat from under the surface of the skin and diminishes cellulite in that fashion.  Cellulite Defense has all three of these ingredients and more.  I was very excited when I discovered this cellulite cream and even more excited when I used it and it worked!  You can feel it working by the energizing tingling sensation it gives you. Of course, when you eat healthy, exercise and drink plenty of water that will help diminish the cellulite even faster. I love this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I really thought after reading some of the reviews on here that this product would work, but it didn&#x27;t. The cream made my legs very soft, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make the cellulite on my legs look any better :(</li>
            <li> just recently tried it an so far i love how it works</li>
            <li> It actually works!  Just try it, you&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I haven’t recommended any beauty products for you since Pregnancy &amp; Newborn Gift Set from Noodle &amp; Boo and that was a long time ago. But now, I have a great product to suggest.  And, it’s for all those Mama’s who are fighting with cellulite as a result of pregnancy, or just because it’s simply there. I have recently received a great Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream from Body Merry (at no cost) and I have to say I’m impressed. As the name suggests, it’s a gel-like cream that might not look too attractive when you open it and see what it looks like, but don’t be put off because of that. The cream spreads like a dream, so easily! And you don’t need to put a lot on because it’s very efficient and just a little bit will be just enough to cover a lot. Another thing that might not be your favorite, at first, is the scent. Because the cream is infused with a 100% natural ‘mint – green tea – lime’ fragrance, it smells exactly like that. I know not everyone wants to smell like mint, but I was so surprised that after putting the cream on, the scent was not there at all, even though in the box, the scent is pretty strong. That’s obviously good news after all because you will not carry the same strong scent! Another great thing about this cream is how quickly it absorbs! Oftentimes, you find creams sticking to your body forever. They are greasy, sticky, and you have to wait a certain amount of time before you feel comfortable (i.e., dry) enough to put clothes on. With this cream, it’s like magic! You put the cream on, and it takes an instant for it to be completely absorbed. I couldn’t believe when I touched my body. It felt like I never put anything on. On top of all that, the product is all natural, organic, and free from harsh chemicals such as Parabens, Sulfates and Phthalates. That’s what we want to hear, right? I do not have anything negative to say about this cream. It’s for sure one of the best cellulite creams out there (in my opinion)!</li>
            <li> Their cellulite cream contains caffeine, retinol, seaweed, organic cayenne, and more. Plus they don’t make their product with any harsh chemicals. Their products aren’t testing on animals, plus they are made in US Certified FDA labs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most women, I have some “extra baggage” from when I was pregnant. When I had the opportunity to try something that could potentially help my skin issues, I had to take it. While it didn’t completely take away my cellulite or stretch marks, it did make them noticeably less visible. The point of this cream is to firmen up and tighten the skin, and it does just that. (I’ve even noticed the skin under my butt isn’t so loose and saggy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 2 weeks now, and still have half the jar left. So a little bit can go a long ways if you are using it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about their cream was probably the feeling once you applied it. Sounds weird I know. After a shower applying it to clean skin, gave off this amazing cooling feeling to where ever you applied it to. The feeling is even more intensified if your skin is hot from a shower beforehand. Which feels like what I can compare aloe to sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell! I am a sucker for a good cocoa/shea butter smell. If you aren’t this product wont be for you, but I love it, it was just icing on the cake for me! It seemed upon opening it had the cocoa/shea smell, but once it was applied it changed to a menthol smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t notice everything completely go away, after all, people don’t sell miracle in a bottle for THAT wish! But it has done enough to make me say I am impressed with the outcome so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Probably I have to use more to see some results.</li>
            <li> The Cellulite Cream was both for s friend to try as someone else had advised her to use it. I am yet to hear from her. But the friend that advised her to try it can swear by the product that it works.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels tighter when I use this product and my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try this product for free.  Imagine my excitement! I’ve been wanting to try to reduce visible cellulite on my body for some time now….so here’s how it went!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that Body Merry’s Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream is an incredibly unique product. It came to me in the prettiest little box, and in the box was your typical ‘face-cream’ jar. First-I’ve never used a ‘gel-cream’ before. I like that fact that It was easy to rub in like a gel, but like a cream in that it didn’t dry my skin out. The first time I used it, it kind of freaked me out…it felt a lot like ‘icy hot’, but without the hot. Just an intense cool feeling. Upon subsequent applications, I decided that I actually like this feeling. It makes me feel that the gel-cream is really permeating my skin and getting down into the cellulite. It has a fairly intense smell, but this goes away as the product is absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for two weeks now, and while I haven’t seen mind-blowing results in this short time, I have definitely noticed my skin is a bit tighter and more firm. I’m definitely going to keep using this!</li>
            <li> I do like this product. I was a little worried when I read that it tightens the skin. One time I got something that tightened the skin, and it felt like I had a Halloween mask on. Cellulite Cream absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. I get more of a tingle feeling on my skin than a tight feeling. It&#x27;s a little too early for me to be able to tell how it works long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product as a review. I&#x27;m a professional blogger that writes my own opinions.</li>
            <li> Oh boy, I haven&#x27;t put my Post up yet, but as long as I&#x27;m here.  This stuff looks like pudding and feels like pudding, but it sure don&#x27;t act like pudding.  After a few days I kept watching the mirror.  Ladies take it from me... wrong thing to do.  Wait a few days... even a week and then look.  I thought absolutely nothing was happening, and then I waited... and waited... and waited.  Then I looked OH YEAH!!!!  This customer is definitely not disappointed, and by the way I was expecting something stinky, and actually it does smell quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> As an avid blogger, I was able to review this product. I used this Cellulite Defense Gel Cream for a couple of weeks on the back of my thighs and I can say that I did notice some results starting.  The menthol was a recognizable ingredient in the cream which provided a cooling sensation after application (something I really appreciated after taking a run!).  I found that it absorbed really quickly into my skin and did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. The only thing that I did not like was the scent which the company describes as &amp;#34;100% natural mint-green tea-lime&amp;#34;. To me, it smelled medicinal and it was quite strong.  This was, however, not a deal breaker for me since it does seem to work. I simply used it at night, rather than in the morning.</li>
            <li> Body Merry&#x27;s Cellulite Defense Gel Cream is an absolutely amazing product.  I have been using it mainly on my upper legs and have noticed my thighs look a lot smoother and tighter already after only a couple of weeks.  There is a strong smell, but a nice one.  After you apply the gel-cream on the area of your choice, you can actually feel it working (a tingly feeling)!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple more weeks.  Love this product.  I give it 5 stars!  Thank you Body Merry for letting us review this item.</li>
            <li> I recently tried out the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream. I was a little iffy about trying it at first just because I do not have a problem with Cellulite yet. However, I have had these bumps under my thighs for about a year now. I left that area alone and did not shave it for about 2 weeks thinking that was the problem, but it was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied this gel I was in shock. It was such an Icy Hot feeling. I thought I put too much on but that feeling was still there even the next time when I used half the amount. At first, the Icy Hot freaked me out but once I got used to it it did not bother me as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, now it does not bother me at all because I am in love with this product. It does not make my bumps disappear completely but it smooths out my skin and makes the bumps go away for about a week or two. I have found that I personally only have to use this product once a week for my condition, however you may need to use it more often or even daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I have finally found a semi-permanent solution to my problem. It is semi-permanent in the way that as long as I apply this as soon as the bumps reappear then I will have another week free from bumps! I definitely recommend this product especially since it has not only helped my issue but is also not made from any harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> I’m very excited to try out and share with you all my “Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream Review!” Since no body in there right mind would want cellulite to begin with. I defiantly know that I don’t want cellulite making its way on my body &amp; if it does I want a way to fight to win my body back! Plus I just love how this unique formula will help you combat cellulite with caffeine, retinol and seaweed. This formula is cram packed with all the goodness you would want in a Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream without all those nasty chemical fillers. So thank you Body Merry for creating this wonderful product that will actually visibly reduce the appearance of unwanted bumps and lumps. My skin feels and looks tighter, smoother even younger. The quick absorb and fresh 100% natural mint, green tea, lime fragrance is an added bonus too! You really can’t go wrong when theres added potent natural and organic ingredients like algae extract, kelp, coconut oil, japanese green tea leaf extract and cayenne involved.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT! Highly recommend it :) I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product besides all the great ingredients is that this absorbs FAST!!!  A small amount spreads easily and quickly. AND it’s NOT SHINY!! This cellulite ‘cream’ has a consistency more like a jelly than a cream. When you put it on there is a slight tingle due to the 100% natural mint. It’s like you can actually feel it working!! There is also slight lime fragrance that I love. The fragrance fades quickly and can easily be worn anytime, it won’t interfere with your cologne or perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that there are amazing ingredients, a wonderful scent and absorbs quickly are all just added bonuses because this stuff works!! I noticed a difference by the end of the first week. The cellulite on my upper thighs and upper arms looks so much BETTER!!!!!!!! I am extremely pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I really did not expect this to do anything, but it actually reduced the appearance of cellulite. i was really suprised. I did combine with exercise becasue I think that really helps to get rid of cellulite and. With this cream and a little exercise i am on my way to being cellulite free. It does have a very strong Ben Gay/Menthol kind of Smell. Just make sure you don&#x27;t have any open scratches or sores on the area because if you do this will irritate it slighlly.</li>
            <li> The cream is easy to apply and only takes seconds to rub into your skin. It has a thick type feeling to it. It looks and feels like set pudding to me, but doesn&#x27;t apply thick and gooey at all. It leaves your skin with a tingling feeling a few minutes after using which lasts for awhile but isn&#x27;t bothersome, just sort of fresh and minty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for about 2 weeks and noticed a tightening of the skin. I applied it to the underside of my arms and under my chin and both areas seemed more smooth and less flabby looking. I measured around the arm and there was a decrease in size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try this on other areas to see the results I get there. It works externally on any area where cellulite gathers, so you can treat all your problem areas with just one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning, this has a strong smell to it. It isn&#x27;t unpleasant but a menthol type smell that reminds me of vapor rub in the winter. Personally I like the smell, but if you don&#x27;t, you might not want to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample item for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product really really works</li>
            <li> This is a very unique cellulite gel. It has a sand-like color and menthol-like scent. The texture is a strange gel. It takes a little work to get out of the jar since the texture is a little slimy and doesn&#x27;t want to stay on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my shower and apply it after finishing up and drying off.&lt;br /&gt;I usually am finishing off my morning or evening routine as I let it dry. It has a menthol/cooling feel on the skin. I apply this to my thighs, abdomen and arms. That cooling sensation makes me feel so good, as if my fat is melting away. I know it is not melting, but I can imagine :)&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cellulite product that will give you that cooling sensation then I think this might be the one you may want to try out. I have not had any reactions to it and am quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i would suggest, would be a different type of packaging. A tube would make it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Male, 23. 6 years ago during my freshman year of undergrad I lost 75 pounds, however, I lost the weight too fast which in turn caused me to have a lot of excess skin. I&#x27;ve tried firming lotions in the past with no results. I was told by my doctor the only fix would be expensive surgery so I decided to try this product. For the first time in years I have seen some bounce back in my skin. I am on my second round of Body Merry and am going to continue to use this product in hopes that I will finally get my body skin back to normal. I love it!</li>
            <li> Smooth skin. Lingering fragrance of a high class spa! Smells like Vics when rubbing it on, but that quickly resolves. Any remaining odor just smells like you have been at a high class spa!&lt;br /&gt;Dries while I put on my makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much makeup).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, but my skin feels much smoother. Amazingly so. Too soon for visual results.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much change.  Not sure its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream for 5 days now and I can already see some difference with it. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I try a  different one  before  this one and I didn&#x27;t see any results.  This products  really work , I been  use it for a while and I love it.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely Love this Product. I use it on my thighs after shower and after first week I felt my skin firmer. It&#x27;s been about a month and I am due to order more. I wish I would of taken a before and after picture. Also I have used almost every &amp;#34;Firm&amp;#34; cream or treatment there is on the market and haven&#x27;t had nearly the results as this Product!! Thank u so much</li>
            <li> It gets hot burning hot then cold feels like a ice hot patch sheesh i realli hopd it works</li>
            <li> So far I really like it! Not sure if its working yet only had for a week but like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is the best Cellulite Defense Del Cream with Caffeine, to have. It cleans your body&lt;br /&gt;and great to have for hot weather, you get in the summer time.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I can tell a big difference from when I started. I did it for two weeks before I was out of town and got results. I am starting over again today.  I also recommend using a massage mitten, as that is what I&#x27;ve been using. The seller also personally reached out to me to ask how I liked the product which was very nice! I will definitely order this product again when my current jar runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for only about 2 weeks and it has definitely improved the appearance of my thighs. The only product I found that worked for me in the past was St. Ives cellulite shield, which seems to have been discontinued. I have tried a few other creams in the meantime, and none have been effective for me. This one goes on easily and absorbs quickly. It eaves my skin cool and tingling for about 15 minutes, but I can dress immediately. I use it once a day a few times a week-- whenever I shower at home instead of the gym. I am glad that I found this just as we are heading into summer.</li>
            <li> After only 5 days of use I can see an improvement in the dimpling I had on my thighs and upper arms. The odor is strong so I advise you to use this cream where there&#x27;s some ventilation. And it may sting a bit for a very few seconds. Apply with upward strokes as recommended. Wash your hands thoroughly when you&#x27;re done. And then enjoy the beauty of your new, non-dimpled skin.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything for me.  I saw no difference.  Perhaps for other people.</li>
            <li> I really love Body Merry&#x27;s Cellulite Gel-Cream and was able to review it for free. I love the texture and feel. It comes in a nice jar but still would have been nice to be in a pump style bottle. The way it makes my body feel in the areas that are needed for this. Body Merry did a great job and they went all out with this one. Keep up your amazing work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream for about two weeks now. I have tried other products by Body Merry and have been very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on twice a day. First in the morning when I get dressed and again at night after I get out of the shower. It has a texture similar to pudding, and is a cream color. You just rub it on in a circle motion until it is absorbed into your skin. I have been using it mainly on my upper thighs, since that is my biggest problem area.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a little skeptical of products like this. I just never thought that a cream, can help with cellulite. While I have not had dramatic results, I am starting to notice a slight difference. Like I said, it&#x27;s only been two weeks. After application I notice that my skin feels tight. The gel-cream absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the jar, it has kind of a strong describable smell. It isn&#x27;t bad, just a little strong. However, after you apply the gel-cream, the smell isn&#x27;t noticeable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to continue to using it and see how much better the results will be after a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can visit Body Merrys website at: http://www.bodymerry.com/, to read more about the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream and see all of the great products they offer.</li>
            <li> I loved it I finish it all I&#x27;m actually going for my second  bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth it.  It has been slow, but there is definite noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite creams, but I think this one is the most powerful and effective.  You can feel it working, and the results are visible.  I highly recommend this product, and must say, the customer service of this company is also extraordinary.  I look forward to continued use of Body Merry products.</li>
            <li> I love this. I love how my skin feels nice and tingly after I use it. I also noticed a difference in the firmness of my spots that lets just say \\&quot; jiggled\\&quot; LoL I am almost done my bottle but will be buying next time. I did receive this as part of a Tomoson review but I agree that all thoughts are my own and I was not influenced in any way. In fact I have reviewed cellulite creams that  I have hated in the past. This is the best by far. I have to say that the consistently looked weird at first site and I thought \\&quot; wow this will be gross\\&quot; but I WAS WRONG LoL...It was not gross at all. Will continue use and like I said purchase again.</li>
            <li> I real like this cream.  I have a lot of allergies and this one did not make me itch or break out in hives. I love the menthol smell for opening up my sinuses too!</li>
            <li> used it for a month  nothing changed</li>
            <li> Used this three times and see improvements already.  I hope it continues to work.  It makes your skin tingle for the first 5 minutes.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this high quality product. Enhanced the texture and appearance of my skin. Will continue to use!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I used it all and I am not a stong cellulite person an it doesn&#x27;t reduce any cm! Avoid expend any money on this product.</li>
            <li> I love my cellulite defense gel-cream!  I have several beach vacations this summer and wanted to make sure I was beach ready.  I don&#x27;t have tons of cellulite yet as I am only 27 but I&#x27;m hard on my self as all women are and wanted to start defending against it now.  I have noticed that the back of my thighs seem tighter and my husband says he can tell a difference.  This company is also great as they sent a check-up email to see how I liked the product after I had it for a week or so.  It&#x27;s nice to contribute to a company that really cares about their product and their customers.</li>
            <li> Body Merry Cellulite gel cream. I loved so much about this one because I could actually feel it working long after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get quite a tingling sensation while using it so you can actually feel it working. .It is really easy to apply and smells so fantastic its a joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you do is apply it to the area you want to treat and let it do its work. You get a whole bunch and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has in it retinol, caffeine and seaweed . if you Google seaweed for cellulite control you will find that many beauty companies and jumping on that wagon because its very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using seaweed in a cellulite control cream is relatively new but very effective. I really love this one because it can be felt for about 30 to 40 mins after applying and that&#x27;s unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a better price than some with these kinds of ingredients in it because I have looked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it has in it a lot of other ingredients that will work to help you fight the good fight agents that unsightly cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to love the feel and the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> After losing 136 pounds I have a lot of sagging uneven skin. Which I am quite self-conscious about I have been using a cream put my stomach and arms and has been working well but I needed something to help with my butt and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to try Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t wait to try on some of my unsightly skin. I tried it for the first time after my shower and have continued to use after my shower daily. All you need is a little bit and it goes a long way. The jar is a good size so it will last a long time. I love body merry products and this one is great. It leaves a nice cool feeling and rubs in well without the residue some creams do. I have noticed an improvement! It works almost as well as my much more expensive cellulite creams I have used. My butt and thighs look a lot more even and a lot less saggy!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPfaca105137a8b81bed334d3e57becb53&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s actually making a difference in my legs and arms which is a plus but the one downside is that it kinda burns/tingles when I apply it, nothing serious enough to make me stop using it but it can be alarming to some. I apply this directly after showering and I think that helps it but other than that I love it and the smell is great It resembles butterscotch pudding though haha! And it&#x27;s really jiggly in it&#x27;s container. Remember to only use small quantities and it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMfaca105137a8b81bed334d3e57becb53&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am really enjoying this Cellulite Defense Gel Cream that Body Merry sent me to review.  I love putting it on right after I get out of the shower, it just feels so refreshing because the cream is infused with a refreshing 100% natural ‘mint - green tea - lime’ fragrance, LOVE IT!  Plus, I am enjoying the fact that my skin appears to be more smooth in texture after I apply it.  I am not in denial as I have said in my other Cellulite Cream reviews that a cream cannot get rid of cellulite, but it CAN make it less noticeable and the Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream does just that!</li>
            <li> From the first time you apply Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel Cream you feel it. It feels like you just brushed your upper thighs with toothpaste. Very minty and refreshing. It does not burn but does tingle (not in a bad way) a bit and you are left with a warming sensation for about a half hour after application. You just rub it on until it is absorbed into your skin and you&#x27;re all set. It is not greasy or oily and it leaves your skin feeling tight. After applying it for several weeks I have noticed an improvement in skin texture. My thighs appear smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has a mint, green tea and lime fragrance. It also contains caffeine and retinol, three types of seaweed (algae extract, kelp and dulse) to give an antioxidant boost, which helps in firming and toning. It also has organic cayenne to help with circulation and reducing the storage of fat, it is made in the United States, it is cruelty free and contains no harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a bonus Body Merry&#x27;s products are backed with a 90 Day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. I recommend you give this a try if you do not like it or feel it does not work for your troubled areas then you risk nothing.</li>
            <li> So after losing 80 lbs I had some lumps and bumps and looking for something to help, because working out isn&#x27;t just cutting it. I read the reviews and decided why not. Warning the cooling sensation is intense after the first use, but you get used to it after using daily. So to y he b best part getting n g dressed one day my husband goes &amp;#34;how lo n g have you been using that lotion stuff &amp;#34; I go &amp;#34;about week and a half maybe w&amp;#34;. So he says &amp;#34;I can for sure see a different c e, not sure if  this will sound like a compliment, but you don&#x27;t have them dimple thing on your butt and legs&amp;#34;. Well check yeah that&#x27;s a compliment. So I noticed a difference as well, smoother for sure, not sure on the toning aspect. But I love this stuff though..</li>
            <li> Beautiful cream, I can&#x27;t tell you yet if it works.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this product seems to make a difference! I use it 2 times a day, if possible, but trying for at least once per day. I massage the nice smelling gel into my skin and let it dry and then use a massager for 5 or 10 minutes. My cellulite is less noticeable and I for sure am buying more! I have also been doing squats and lunges, hoping to find a way to get rid of the much hated cottage cheese. But this product seems amazing and I am sold!</li>
            <li> Really works! Helps me with my cellulite. Looks much better. Even husband noticed and I had not told him I was using anything. I&#x27;m on my third tub! Cool gel that easily rubs into the skin and has a tingling feeling that lasts, which I like. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Use it daily and can see a difference smells great and a tingling feeling after I know it working !!!! In hooked it&#x27;s a daily regiment for me</li>
            <li> I have to give it some time to work, but the smell is relaxing to me even though it is strong when it&#x27;s first applied to the skin. It&#x27;s also has a cooling sensation. I hope that it works.</li>
            <li> I did not see any positive results. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I think I might need to use it a little longer than a month in order to see any positive results.</li>
            <li> This feels like it starts working as soon as you put it on, I love the refreshing tingle. Does run out pretty fast when using twice daily. I wish it came in a bigger container ! Saw tiny results after using it for 2 weeks with a cellulite hand massager.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month and I just ordered two more! I apply it on the back of my legs and then really rub it in using circular motions with this little hand held rubber studded massager. I definitely feel like my legs are looking better...I wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture! It has a strong menthol smell and an icy cool tingly feeling that took a little getting used to at first, but now I love the way it feels. I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like it. I have seen a little bit of difference. Which is a good thing bc cellulite is very difficult to fight.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a short period of time and didn&#x27;t think it worked,  but  after a while I did notice  my skin felt tighter and smoother.  Its great!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the results yet, but I can tell you it feels great on my skin.  I love this stuff.  However, I&#x27;m not a tiny girl, nor are most woman with a cellulite problem, so the jar doesn&#x27;t last long  I already need to order more.  I&#x27;ll order several jars next time.  I wish they had an economy size!  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell.  I tought it might be too strong and people would wonder about it.  So I&#x27;d use it at night after my bath and then shower in the morning before work.  But then I got used to the scent.  Now I even apply again in the moring.  My co-worker assured me it smells nice.  I like to apply this after a harm or hot bath or shower.  It is very refreshing and causes a cooling sensation which I think feels great, especially in Florida in the summer.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the rusults!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream with Retinol there are so many products to choose from I did not know what would be the best. I started to read the reviews for this product thank you for providing pictures it was extremely helpful. After reading all of the reviews I decided to purchase this product. I am in my mid 40, working out everyday (I am in a good shape) but with age comes cellulite (even for skinny people like me) and crepe skin around the knees and on the buttock area. It was time to take care of those problems when I received the product I did not know what to expect so I follow the direction on the jar. The gel-cream is extremely smooth, when I applied on the skin I got an instant cooling sensation (extremely useful so you do not have to applied another layer), I am sensitive to perfumes this was a concern of mine but I was surprise how light the scent was it did not bothered me. Now lets talk about some of the results I have seen on my legs. The skin is smooth and firm, the crepe skin around the knees and on the buttock area are less visible if not invisible, the appearance of cellulite is fading as well. I have been using this gel-cream for the past few weeks and I can see the difference. I should have taken picture before and after but I unfortunately did not. I am going to continue to use this product I wished the jar would be bigger and it could be available on auto-ship option in order to receive it on the monthly basis without a care in the world. I now will have to check what other products Body Merry has.  If you are looking for a product that works and can complement your beauty regiment than you can add this one to your list. Take care of your body from the inside and out. Thank you Body Merry :)</li>
            <li> Best anti-cellulite gel cream I have ever tried</li>
            <li> Hi, I have been using this product for almost 4 weeks now.  I have noticed a difference in the appearance of cellulite.  Much smoother look to the skin.  I do have to say, however that I have also been taking Metagenics CLA, so I&#x27;m  not sure if that is enhancing the results.  CLA promotes lean muscle, so this may or may not be contributing to the effects of the cream.  I have a petite frame at 5 ft and 105Ibs and work out 4-5 days per week and watch my diet.  With all that, I still had cellulite and just felt my body wasn&#x27;t showing all the hard work I was putting in.  So my nutritionist recommended CLA and also advised that the cream was good, so I started both.  I&#x27;m happy with the results and will keep using the product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a discount to review the item. I have had cellulite on my legs for a while and putting this on it smelled kind of funky but the feeling of it being on was kind of like ice hot and it tingled. I liked the way it felt haven&#x27;t been able to see any long term effects from it though. Hate the way it smells. Besides the smell over been using this for about a week now and I&#x27;ve seen a great impertinent on both of my thighs!! Using this with the Garcina Cambodia has really helped me with my new years resolution to help me take care and do something to improve myself.</li>
            <li> ..... it&#x27;s not enough a jar of cream to see the result but used consistently with diet and exercise should work</li>
            <li> As a product tester I know there are many different products out there, but Body Merry&#x27;s Cellulite Cream is one of the best. When I first tried it was was kind of skeptical because it has a very medicinal smell to it, but after using it several times you get used to the smell. I figured out really quick  that a little bit goes a long way, with this product. When you first put it on it has a tingling/warming effect to it, kind of like a muscle rub but as long as you don&#x27;t put too much on it doesn&#x27;t feel that bad. I did not have any cellulite before using this product but I noticed it instantly firming and toning the area I applied the cream. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> I got this item free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even tell you how this product works on cellulite at this time because I just don&#x27;t want to use the product. I tried a few times, but the smell and texture is so weird. It&#x27;s texture is a weird gel cream hybrid and it goes on cool and then just keeps getting colder. I am actually saving it to see if I can tolerate it better during a hot CA summer day because right now it is too cold to put on with the cold winter air!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can get past that then you have to deal with the scent. Normally I like things with menthol smells, they don&#x27;t bother me at all. However this smells like they are trying to cover up the menthol smell with citrus and it just creates this weird and unpleasant smell that I just don&#x27;t want to deal with right now. If you can get over the initial smell while applying it then the smell will go away after about 10-15 minutes and doesn&#x27;t linger all day. At least I couldn&#x27;t smell it, I hope no one else could. If they could they didn&#x27;t let me know.</li>
            <li> The Cellulite Defense Gel Cream is honestly not pretty to look at, it&#x27;s a little goopy and jiggly, BUT it feels wonderful on your skin. You can feel it both smoothing and tightening problem areas. It contains caffeine, retinol and seaweed. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy and seems to absorb quickly into the skin. Much like their moisturizer, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t attack cellulite. But it&#x27;s an excellent cream.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything and the item arrived damaged in the package.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I have only been using a little over a week and it claims it takes 8 weeks to see improvement. I wish it came in a larger container with 2x a day use it is going fast. I need to order more already.</li>
            <li> When I first received cream I tried it out and found it smelled terrible.  It sorta smells like ouzo or black liqorice but stronger with menthol undertones.  And after you apply it and get dressed, the smell stays with you all day long. Even my co-workers commnented about it and said it was strong and unpleasant (embarrased).  However,  since I paid about $30 for it, I wanted to get my monies worth and find a way to use it.  I continued to use it daily in the mornings only.  I combined this products with a in shower cellulite massage, then applied the cream afterward.  I only used it once a day in the AM because of the odor was too much for my husband at night.  I am happy I stuck with it because I have very very very noticable results.  I actually wish I would have taken a before and after picture because my cellulite is almost 90% gone.  Even despite the odor, I ordrered another jar to see if I can tackle the rest of the dimples on my thighs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 1:  If like me you find the smell is really bad (some people actually said they liked it but I personally think those are free product reviewers), I found it helps to apply it in the morning but wait to put your clothes on for about 30 minutes (this is the time I do my hair and makeup). By the time I put my clothes on, a bulk of the strong odor has dissipated enough that I can&#x27;t smell it all day or annoy my co-workers with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip2:  Also be careful if you apply it too high up your inner thigh, I accidentally got some on my hoo ha and boy did that burn for a while.</li>
            <li> great product. excellent customer service. i loved the way the product felt after applying it feels minty and refreshing. skin felt tighter and firmer. would definitely repurchase. thank you for being so helpful and everything is as advertised. :) forgot to take photo but will do so next time thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really loving this gel. I have only been using it for a week, so no noticeable results yet, but it smells great, you don&#x27;t need to use much at all, so it&#x27;s a great value and I love how my skin feels afterward.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I applied as directed and nothing. It has a mint feeling to make it seem like it is doing something when it isn&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money!Miracle does not exist go to the gym and exercise. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works amazing!! Saw results fast and smells amazing! You feel it working right away! Smells so fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase of the cellulite defense gel-cream from Body Merry. Customer service is excellent, and I feel that they really care about the results  of this product. I have been using the product twice a day for about a month now, and definitely notice a difference!! I am a little disappointed that it is suggested to use it for at least 8 weeks to notice a difference. I feel that the first order should last 8 weeks if that is how long the average person would notice a difference. However, I DO notice a difference and will continue to use the product as recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month. I&#x27;ve seen some results. So far it works.</li>
            <li> I was quite happy with the results after a few weeks of use. There was a noticeable improvement. I did however notice as others have mentioned, that the cream seems to evaporate some, even if you keep the cap tightly closed. Other than that I was pleased with the cream and plan on trying it again.</li>
            <li> This product is not only good for its stated purpose, but also generally firms skin in other areas, like the neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving this product 5 stars because it worked -- I wish it did.  I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because the product owner asked for my feedback and when I gave my honest answer, I was told I was going to get all my money refunded.  She also asked if I wanted to try another jar for free.  So, although it didn&#x27;t work for me, it might work for someone else.  And if it doesn&#x27;t work, you will get your money refunded.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Very unique and well worth it.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks you definitely notice you skin being softer.  I use it along with a massage brush.  They recommend twice a day but I only use once a day, even though the smell is not bad, in fact is kind of refreshing I don&#x27;t like any kind of smells in my clothes specially when I&#x27;m at work</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see much result in reduction of cellulite, but it is a good moisturizing lotion and smells really nice.  Would buy it again for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for several months now. I notice my legs is a lot smoother , all the bumps is slighly dissappear. Im very happy and it seem this is works. I will continue to use it and looking forward for more beautiful legs .</li>
            <li> I love it! I can see the difference when i put it on regularly, i will be ordering some more in the future:) but it&#x27;s not enough in the jar for a month seems like i have to order it biweekly</li>
            <li> Great visible results!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works just yet but it feels nice. It has a slight minty scent to it and makes your skin feel really fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li> been using twice a day everyday and have saw no change and my jar is almost empty now</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple a months and the cellulite on my thighs is less noticeable and overall smoother.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and applied the cream religously twice a day (morning and night) until the bottle was empty.  The product has a pleasant &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; smell and it tingles when applied.  I took before and after pictures to measure my progress, but unfortunately I saw no visible changes in the appearance of my celllulite in my &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photos.  The company did offer to provide another bottle, free of charge, but I opted for the refund which they processed immediately.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this gel. I love it! Im almost into my first month and already seeing results. I use it on my thighs twice a day. Buying my second bottle this week. Cant wait to see more reults. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Great cellulite cream! I can already see my cellulite disappearing! It goes on really nice &amp; is very smooth! Plus I like that its made in USA, cruelty Free, &amp; doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals! That is a biggie for me!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s  working</li>
            <li> Love the way your Gel-cream is working for me. I use it everyday. Thanks for your recommendations for use and how to apply this refreshing cream. I feel confident when telling my sisters and friends that they should buy Cellulite Defense.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Talking about amazing results in just week! Just on time for my vacation to Miami. My skin looks better and toner. My husband even noticed it and asked if I was exercising for our trip.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! I have seen a pretty decent improvement! Suggesting to all my friends.</li>
            <li> VERY COLD ON THIGHS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE MINUTES ITS ON AND AFTER USING IT I NOTICED MINI VERICOSE VEINS EVERY WHERE I HAD APPLIED THIS MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH AGREE THAT THOSE WERE NOT THERE UNTIL I STARTED USING THIS......</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this cream to review on my blog and it is great! I can see a definite difference in the lumps and bumps I used to have. It absorbs quickly and has a pleasant fragrance. It is a definite buy!</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream has a very definite gel-cream texture. I honestly am not fond of the appearance or smell of this. I imagine that if I took jello and mixed it with pudding it would look very much like this cellulite cream. Not really a deal breaker or even a serious negative, but it isn&#x27;t what I would ever imagine a cream would look like. I was expecting more of a creamy texture... like a thick lotion. It smells like menthol and has a distinct &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; smell. Its not especially unpleasant, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell good. The smell does linger in the air for a little while after applying, but (thankfully) the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to stay strong on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get past the appearance and smell, this product is actually really great. It absorbs quickly like a gel, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy/oily. There is a slight cooling and tingling feeling when you&#x27;re applying it. Its almost refreshing and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and while I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in cellulite, my skin is much smoother and firmer. Even if I never notice a reduction in cellulite, this firms and moisturizes better and faster than most skin firming creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and at a lower price than many other brands. I love my skin texture when I use this and I will continue using it just to have that texture. My skin feels soft, smooth, and firm. It makes me feel so soft and feminine, even my husband has noticed!&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up: You&#x27;ll notice a huge improvement in your skin, even after the first time you apply it, I&#x27;m just not sure you&#x27;ll notice any change in cellulite. This is really a 5-star product to me. I only gave it 4-stars because although I love how it makes my skin feel, I&#x27;m not seeing any cellulite reduction and beyond any benefits I might see, it is supposed to be a cellulite cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.ld never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> I have to go into detail on this one because i had a little bit on my one calf i could just not get rid of even with all the walking i do every single day and i was perturbed to say the least, anyway when i got it i opened the seal and stuck my nose to it, ever done that to see what stuff smells like? well it looks like creamy tapioca and smells like menthol, and kind of comes out looking like paste but one that is gone within seconds into your skin i used it after my shower just on my calf that would not work itself out and wala all gone within a day of use and my walking, now i am going to use it on other areas just to make sure i dont get any there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using this on my thighs to prevent celluliute formation. I have also been using it on my arms, as I want it to be more firm. While it doesn&#x27;t work overnight, I have noticed a big improvement - most specially on my arms. I have always been a big fan of Body Merry, as all their products that I have tried in the past has worked well for me - this cellulite cream is no exception! I also commend this company for using all natural ingredients that has worked very well for my sensitive skin. Thank you for always coming up with products that has truly worked for me, Body Merry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, none of us are getting any younger, that&#x27;s why I was thrilled to try the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream from Body Merry. I&#x27;ve noticed as I get older, the back of my thighs tend to show some cellulite issues, and I wanted to find just the right product to help with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I love about this is that it is free from harsh chemicals, making it better for your skin. It&#x27;s important to keep your skin looking good, and this product can help with that. I recommend it for anyone who needs to tone up their skin!</li>
            <li> I got this for free to review from Tomoson. I have never tried cellulite creams. I was surprised at how well this product worked for me. It has a strong mint scent, which you would have to give some time to get used to. It has a tingling factor when it is applied to the problem area. I like the tingling factor, because to me, its a sign that it is working! My problem area looks less lumpy than before. I enjoy this gel-cream very much</li>
            <li> I am loving this cellulite cream. I have used a lot of different one this one feels good when you put it on it tingles for a little while but that makes me feel like it&#x27;s working I like ingredients that Are in it because I know they&#x27;re all good with helping to reduce the look of cellulite and tighten the skin you definitely have to drink a lot of water exersise and watch what you&#x27;re eating . I definetly  reccomend this cream!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week so far so good. It has a menty cool smell to it not nothing outrageous.  I like the smell and the cool feeling on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I have not had the product long but this works very  well.  I have always had cellulite on my legs. I think this is helpful. THANKS Body Merry.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, I  have been using this now for 2 solid weeks and the cream is almost gone.  I also bought the cellulite brush hoping this would do more but,  so far NOTHING.  I work out 6-7 days a week so it isn&#x27;t that I am not active.  I also do a lot of leg exercises and concentrate on squats etc.  I am reading all of the Amazing reviews and am dumbfounded as to why I haven&#x27;t gotten any of what they are all raving about.  So to tell you the truth I will use until the jar is gone.  Disappointed............. and no I didn&#x27;t get a free jar of this for a review.</li>
            <li> I love Body Merry products. They don&#x27;t test on animals and Made in the USA! This gel-cream didn&#x27;t let me down! I love the smell and consistency. I am no brave enough to post pictures of my results like some other people, but I can definitely tell the difference in the backs of my legs where I used the product! My skin has a smoother appearance and no more lumps.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure of Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream at first but I kept using it every day. I wasn&#x27;t sure of the smell either. It&#x27;s been a few week now &amp;amp; I wish I had taken a picture of my thighs and butt, not that anyone would want to see me. I am in my early 60s but!! It has been a long time since the skin on my thighs and butt were tightened up and I feel it has lifted everything! You need to give it time to work. Now I look forward to that fresh smell and cooling tingle feeling as it absorbs into my skin! I love this gel!! I am a size 5-6 and I didn&#x27;t lose weight but my jeans are loose and I need a smaller belt. I want more!!!! Body Merry is the best I ever tried and the only one I will ever use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you Body Merry a devoted customer!&lt;br /&gt;  Sue!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar now. Towards the end of the first jar I finally started to notice results as I did better at remembering to use it twice a day. It is a slow and subtle process, but I already feel much more confident about my exposed legs when I go swimming! I will continue using this product to further my results! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**Almost done with second jar and have used more regularly twice per day. Cellulite no longer visible on back of my right thigh and HIGHLY reduced on the back of my left thigh. It&#x27;s almost gone. It&#x27;s so much improved I am no longer self conscious about the backs of my legs when taking the kiddo to the pool! I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and 105-110lbs, but have cellulite at age 31. I gave birth over 4 years ago and developed cellulite in the last couple years. Nothing I did worked. Exercising helped minimize a little, and tanning helped hide, but nothing was getting rid of the cellulite until this product. :)</li>
            <li> Super excited to see some results! I hate my cellulite but I have heard some great things about this! I may have to update my review soon with results but I only used it once!</li>
            <li> I been using the cellulite buster tool and this cream since March. I think the combination has made an incredible difference in the appearance of my  thighs. I love the feel of the gel-cream when applied, just the sensation alone made me feel like it was going to do some good. Depending on the level of cellulite, you may need more than one jar.</li>
            <li> This cream is very effective</li>
            <li> Received this product at a great discount for the purpose of reviewing it. So far it does seem to be working. It seems to leave the skin leaving a bit firmer while not being to greasy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use morning and night and also wear a sweat belt during the day while at work! Every day I&#x27;m seeing a difference. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Well, Too Be completely honest...I&#x27;ve not seen any results, as of yet...I wanted to wait, &#x27;til I had used half of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Too be fair, I&#x27;m also using a massager,  to help circulate the blood In my skin, and help to tone.( my upper thighs)&lt;br /&gt;So Far, It looks the same. I&#x27;m losing a bit of weight (a pound or two) by eating, small, and healthy meals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid, there is no miracle, in a bottle, for this skin problem. I will still, try! however, I wouldn&#x27;t think, this is going to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I really was hoping it would!</li>
            <li> It is good and asdescribed by the seller.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected reading all the reviews, I work out out 3 days a week and still didn&#x27;t see any change. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Gotta have this cream. Smooths u out, tightens u up, confidence they the roof!</li>
            <li> This cream works great overall. Product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was so excited to get started on this product, however after 3 months of using I didn&#x27;t see drastic results. A friend of mine was using It Works Defining Gel for cellulite and stretchmarks and raved about her results so I decided to give it a try. Although the price is slightly higher (I pay $39) for the product...IT&#x27;S WORTH IT!! I&#x27;ve been using the Defining Gel for only 2 months and not only is my cellulite diminishing but my skin is more firm as well! I use it from my chin to my thighs 1x daily and a little bit of product goes a long way. I think it&#x27;s worth the money - order the Defining Gel from kmstarks.myitworks.com I guarantee you won&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;ve also used it on my dry/cracked feet a few times and I saw a major difference in my feet as well.</li>
            <li> I rarely do reviews, but this stuff actually works! I Will be ordering again, and want to try their stretch mark cream to see if it works as good as this cellulite cream. The smell is a little strong but not overwhelming. One of my best purchases</li>
            <li> My wife love this cream I wi buy another for her</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experience this but this cream makes your entire body freezing cold to the point that you feel hypothermic! I am sitting here shivering and I have three sweaters on and can&#x27;t get warm. I am also 7 months pregnant so if this hurts the baby there will be a huge law suit! This is excruciating! Even if it does work it&#x27;s not worth the extreme discomfort to get the results! I want this stuff off my skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Can I get the full list of ingredients?</li>
            <li> I didnt see results after using this product.</li>
            <li> Great cream! The substance stays fluid for a period of time that allows for a longer and deeper massage. The cream remains cool even after the massage, so you don&#x27;t feel overheated. It is difficult to get rid of cellulite, but with this cream I am willing to put the effort because it eases the effort.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me :(&lt;br /&gt;I was relying on it but it didn&#x27;t work and i am really not happy...&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of the cream tho..</li>
            <li> Wish it would&#x27;ve worked 😯</li>
            <li> I like the strong menthol smell... but, that&#x27;s about it. Cellulite&#x27;s still here, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is my first review. I don&#x27;t usually take the time for these things but I felt this product was good enough it deserved a few minutes of my time. 3 pregnancies in 5 years had done a job on my stomach. It looked horrible! I purchased this hoping it would help my stomach look more toned and firmer. After 1 use I could tell a definite difference, now after 5 days of using twice a day, it has made my stomach a lot firmer and smoother, visually it has done an amazing job. I am thrilled. Not for sure how long term, but as a easy quick fix, this has done great.</li>
            <li> THE BEST! !!!!!!!! I finally have the confidence  to wear shorts and a swim suit! Women DO NOT  HESITATE  WITH THIS! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!! This picture  shows a difference  in 3 weeks! It looks visibly smoother picture in right is with this cream! I also cut off all sugars from sweets  and only consumed sugars from fruits as well as incorporated healthy eating and excersises</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much cellulite and when I use this cream it doesn&#x27;t look like it do anything to me. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it for long enough, I will use it longer.</li>
            <li> Feels very fresh, but have not seen an improvement......love the smell</li>
            <li> I have seen great changes in my legs since I&#x27;m using it.  I have buy two more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several products from the Body Merry skincare line and I have really been pleased with their quality and results. This cellulite cream contains ingredients that are known to be good for skin smoothing and reducing the look of cellulite. You only need a small amount of product to put on specific areas of concern. It&#x27;s natural and organic without harsh chemicals.  Great to add to your spring/summer time skincare regimen. Makes your skin, especially legs, look so much smoother! I&#x27;ve always had issues with my legs/ thighs especially. I started noticing cellulite and really dry skin the past year on my thighs. Not only does this help moisturize, it smooths out the skin on your legs. This will get a lot of use this summer!&lt;br /&gt;I received one of the products mentioned above complimentary for testing purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I am very impressed</li>
            <li> My wife says its working...</li>
            <li> Noticed softer skin immediately.  Love the way it warms up.  You can really feel it working!</li>
            <li> I was quite sceptical as to the effect this cream would have on my cellulite, and I have to say I am quite surprised.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I definitely see a reduction of cellulite on my legs.  Application is easy and the cream has a pleasant aroma and texture.  The sensation after about 5 minutes is a little uncomfortable, because the cream has a tingling and cooling effect, and I am always freezing after!  However, I would recommend this product.  I actually am almost done with the jar, unfortunately, so it&#x27;s barely a months supply.  I may have to purchase another....perhaps a larger size will be offered.  I really am impressed.</li>
            <li> I just received this so I can not attest to how well it works yet. But the smell is way to strong. You can&#x27;t put it on in the morning like you do with other cellulite creams or you will smell like you bathed Bengay. Unless it just out does my other products I get from Amazon based on the smell I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and it seems like it&#x27;s working great so far. Only been using it for 2 weeks.  I will review again once I&#x27;m done with the entire jar.</li>
            <li> I Was Upset That It Came Half Full almost Like it melted. I should Have Received A Full Jar.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far. It seems much more effective that most of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I would highly recommend it! thanks</li>
            <li> At first I thought &amp;#34;Hmm this might actually work&amp;#34; thanks to the feeling it left after applying it on. It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks and I really haven&#x27;t seen any type of change.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use it enough to determine if it worked. It had such a &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; menthol type recation on my skin it was uncomfortable to use. I was disappointed I could not continue using it.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I feel and see my skin improving.  Have only had it a week. Can&#x27;t wait to see what week 2 and 3 show.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Tub went very quick than any other products I&#x27;ve used. (Gone in a few weeks)</li>
            <li> The product arrived empty and used. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times thus far. It has a cooling sensation when you apply it and warms up some afterwards for at least a couple hours. I look fwd to seeing any results I get.</li>
            <li> Again,  should&#x27;ve known better. It&#x27;s gooey and smells funny. Didn&#x27;t see feel any changes. Used for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I feel like I may have seen differences but I remember reading that you would need a few tubs of this before you really start to see change. I considered buying more but since I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results I figure I&#x27;ll wait until I am financially able to buy 2 or more jars &amp; then give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a change that I like on my thighs.  It definitely works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for 2 weeks and I can see a slightly difference. I will continue</li>
            <li> I am on my second tub of the cellulite defense, using it regularly, and I haven&#x27;t seen hardly any results. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, six or seven weeks ago, I received the jar with the red label and white print. I loved everything about this cream, most especially that it dramatically softened my skin right away. So much so, that I would have considered using it in non-cellulite areas as a regular moisturizer. When I finished my first jar, knowing both customers and company indicated it may be weeks before I&#x27;d see a difference in the actual cellulite, I put in a new order for two jars. I then received two different jars (with the new silver band on the front). This formula seems very different to me. For one, the color is a disturbing beige (the previous one was white; was this intended to give customers a visible sense of the caffeine content? LOL). The new cream also seemed to have higher concentrations of whatever menthol-type agent was used, and it did not leave my skin&#x27;s texture as soft as the previous cream. This new cream&#x27;s impact on the cellulite is also different. Rather than changing the cellulite slowly but steadily over time, this new cream changes it more visibly faster but the change also seems to be more temporary. I&#x27;ve decided to finish out my two jars before considering another option.</li>
            <li> I saw a different in about 2 weeks! Really amazing! Burns a little though.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised. I began using this about a month ago. I used it twice a day for about three weeks, then once OR twice a day thereafter.  I definitely felt the mint and the tingle working. I dont have one of those massager things so I would just run the tips of my fingers up and down my thighs for awhile. I also heard that stimulating the cells through smacking helps, lol so id sit there and kind of give my thighs are good smacking to get those fat cells up and moving.  You definitely need to wash your hands afterwards bc they smell like the product for awhile---- which isnt a bad smell by the way, some people are freaking out over the smell-- i mean its like mint and seaweed its really just not that bad. The idea isnt to keep your nose in the container for an hour so somehow I think we can all manage a little mint. I was not bothered by the smell in the slightest. The cream disappears and dries on the skin fairly quickly. Can put on pj pants right after and within a couple minutes youre good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference for sure. I&#x27;ve lost maybe 4/5 lbs since I started using this cream, not bc of the cream obviously, but it wasn&#x27;t like I had some major weight loss in a month to skew the results. I did increase the amount of leg work I did when exercising though, like more squats and other things, so I&#x27;m sure that just naturally helped. Some people&#x27;s reviews on here are a bit absurd. You can&#x27;t eat McD&#x27;s everyday and do nothing active with your life and expect a cream to solve all your cellulite problems. So if you&#x27;re like 40 or more lbs overweight, and live a predominantly sedentary lifestyle with cellulite over most of your thighs and stomach, this cream is not going to be a long lost miracle worker for you. It is for women who are relatively within their appropriate weight or BMI category, and live active lifestyles but just aren&#x27;t body builders and cannot change the low level to medium level cellulite they have. It could certainly be PART of a weight loss routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleasantly surprised to see that this worked. I bought it kind of on a whim after reading review for a couple minutes, threw it in the shopping cart and said &amp;#34;what the heck lets try it.&amp;#34;  I am glad I did. The container lasted about a month, with intermittent use. I dont know how this stuff lasted more than a couple weeks with some people putting it over half their bodies like I read in the reviews. Im happy with it lasting a month with NORMAL use; I think that&#x27;s fair. I can&#x27;t buy more immediately bc its not in the budget this month, but I will definitely be wanting more next month when I have some extra money to throw around. Thumbs up for sure!outine.

            <li> Just started using this product along with a scrub in the shower and it already seems to have helped diminish the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using this on my face, as it seems to help with wrinkles! Yes, can you believe that? I am very happy with it. I use it with a strong Vitamin C serum  [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]], and my skin has just been amazing!</li>
            <li> Good product. Will order again. Strange smell but does seem to give some results.</li>
            <li> makes your body feel cold but goes away in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I thought the product worked well except it seemed to disappear in the jar everyday ( evaporate) even when it was sealed and kept in a dry place.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for reducing, or removing, any and all cellulite. I never thought I would need to use a product like this, but as it turns out, it never hurts to use it anyway. This cellulite gel not only works well, it has a minty scent to it and does not take forever to dry. Let&#x27;s see, I would have to say it takes no longer than 1 minute to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cellulite-gel is made with caffeine, three types of seaweed and other ingredients that are proven to help any and all appearances of cellulite.  I like to use this gel in the morning and evening, but mainly on my legs and arms.  I have been using this now for two weeks and there really is a difference. My legs, and arms, seem to be firmer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for those who will not use any skin product tested on animals, this is the product for you because it is not tested on animals at all. These amazing cellulite-gel is also all natural and organic so there is not a single ingredient that will harm you.</li>
            <li> I am always happy to try out any products that claim to make my body look better. Body Merry&#x27;s Cellulite Defense Gel Cream claims not only to visibly reduce the appearance of cellulite but it also says it will help your skin look and feel smoother, tighter, and younger. Sounds great! The gel cream has a high caffeine content, 0.4% retinol, and three types of seaweed (algae extract, kelp, and dulse). Some other ingredients include coconut oil, sweet almond oil, vitamin e, organic cayenne, and Japanese green tea leaf extract. It also comes in a decent sized 4 ounce jar.&lt;br /&gt;  This gel cream is a natural and organic product. I love the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and phthalates that I need to worry about touching my skin. It&#x27;s also made in the USA at a FDA registered facility as well. And if you are anything like me and think about our furry little friends when shopping for beauty products then you&#x27;ll be happy to know that they are a cruelty free company. Best of all, if you decide to try this stuff out and don&#x27;t like it, Body Merry will refund you 100% for up to 90 days. And guess what? They won&#x27;t even bother you for the rest of the jar back. That shows me a company that stands behind its product.&lt;br /&gt;  Alright so let&#x27;s get on to my thoughts. The cream looks thicker in the jar but actually goes a really long way. The texture really does feel like a gel cream as well. The scent of it is supposed to be a mix of natural mint, green tea, and lime. Honestly I can&#x27;t really smell much other than a menthol type scent but keep in mind it is not by any means overpowering. This doesn&#x27;t smell like strong medicine. I actually really love the scent. I&#x27;ve tried a few similar products and this one smells a lot better than most.&lt;br /&gt;  For the best results, you should massage the cream onto clean and dry skin twice a day (morning and night). I tend to be super busy in the morning with my kids so I&#x27;ve mainly been doing it before bed. After I apply the cream, I can notice a cooling sensation which is most likely from the mint. It&#x27;s not a bad feeling; I kind of enjoy it actually but that&#x27;s me. It absorbs super fast into my skin as well and like I said before, a little really stretches a long way. There is also no oily or greasy feeling left behind after applying this. Simply put, it just feels good to put on. Have I seen any huge results? I have noticed that my skin does indeed feel a lot smoother and on the surface I can definitely begin to see the texture of my skin is looking better. I truly feel like if I continue to use this gel cream then my skin can only keep looking and feeling better.&lt;br /&gt;  So I do think this is worth a try if you are looking for something to improve the texture of your skin. I mainly have been using this on my stomach and thighs. So far so good for me. I received a complimentary jar for testing although my thoughts and opinions are completely my own and always honest.bed.

            <li> I am currently this product but not enough time yet to determine its usefulness</li>
            <li> I been using it for 7 days but I have not seen any difference yet.</li>
            <li> Great. I love it. I think to buy more.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but will continue to use</li>
            <li> I am noticing a difference, but you have to be consistent and give it time for you to notice the effect of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream as instructed for 3 weeks now. I have not experienced the results or noticed any small changes as most have indicated in these reviews. I&#x27;ll repost if things change after using this product 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for the scent alone.  It smells almost exactly like Origins Body Souffle cream which is to-die-for.  I used it religiously as directed and didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skins firmness, texture, or cellulite.  I&#x27;d keep buying it just for the scent, but at my age (42) I can&#x27;t afford to mess around ;) On to the next cellulite cream!</li>
            <li> Just started using the produce, like the gel/cream texture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream and recieved this on February 8 2015 and was so excited. I have used almost the whole jar and I see absolutely no results.... It&#x27;s been a little over a month......</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to give a fair rteview for this product as it needs to be used accordingly, and consistently for at least 4-to 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I am 49 years old, 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; 127lb.  I am an athlete, I am a figure competitor (body bulding) as well and follow a pristine diet.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have not seen any improvement partially because I just do not have enough product to test it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the cream, in a thin layer as advised by the company, in conjunction with a massage cellulite brush.  The jar of cream has only enough product for 7 to 10 days treatments, which is 14 to 20 application. This is the equivalent of 2 teaspoon for each leg.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product almost consistently every day (ONCE A DAY) only two times twice a day. I did skip 2 days in a 10 days cycle.&lt;br /&gt;I have level 2 cellulite, which is mostly noticeble by squeezing the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream seems to have best penetration effects after a shower followed by a rigorous brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The cream did not tighten my skin either.  I would have been happy just with that as well.&lt;br /&gt;Originally I wanted to do a elapse time review, with a camera. Unfortunately I would need 4 jars of cream to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the cream 2 stars because it really did not meet my expectations, although this is not due to the quality of the product but to the fact that I just didn&#x27;t have enough for a review.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I wish it came in a larger size!  Will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> This is so disappointing! It has this minty fresh tingly vicks feeling (which is awesome) BUT IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!! I&#x27;m almost done with it and I see no results. I am an 18 year old girl with very little cellulite. I thought some cream would get rid of what little cellulite I have and it has done nothing for me. I read other reviews that say the same thing so I know I&#x27;m not the only one :/  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> The cream is like half cream half gel consistency. It goes on very easily. I used it about half a dozen times but stopped because the menthol in it gives almost a cold burning sensation. Like you covered your skin with icy hot. I will use it until its gone but have switched to the drug store lotion for firming the skin. This stuff is just too intense for me. The smell isn&#x27;t great either.</li>
