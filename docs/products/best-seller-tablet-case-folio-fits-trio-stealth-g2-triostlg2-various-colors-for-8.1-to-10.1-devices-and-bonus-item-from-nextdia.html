    <ol>
            <li> on time shipping  item as described  thank u!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my Trio Stealth 10.1 as well as I would like. The corner clamps keep sliding off the corners. It is a very nice case and worth the money, just wish it fit as good as the previous review stated!!</li>
            <li> Had looked everywhere for what we needed and this is exactly it!!!! Perfect Fit to protect our Christmas present to each other :)</li>
            <li> Bought these for the kids&#x27; Christmas present. Not too happy with them. The corner holders are constantly slipping off. Doesn&#x27;t feel very stable.</li>
            <li> No hole for the camera.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a perfectly fine case for the money.  It fits well and the tablet is secure.</li>
            <li> I really like this tablet case it fits the trio stealth-10 perfectly, the claws hold the tablet very snugly to the case, there is no room for play that would allow it to fall out. The color is very vibrant and I love the black elastic band that holds the case tightly closed, and the bonus stylus fits perfectly in the ear plug outlet so it will always be available.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, this cover fills the bill for tablet protection and utility. The quality is quite good for the price.</li>
            <li> nice case, great for kids</li>
            <li> the case fits perfect and a great price.my husband love this case its  light and very durable.COMPARED WITH OTHER SITES.</li>
            <li> Fits my tablet perfectly and offers great protection for a valued electronic.</li>
            <li> Its ok but not what I thought it would be. I brought 2 and I&#x27;m not as happy as I could be. That could be my thoughts only. I don&#x27;t dislike the cases. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one. In all the case is good and protects your tablet very well.</li>
            <li> I like the color but my tablet don&#x27;t stay in place when I&#x27;m moving around with it. You can sit it up or down. But it&#x27;s no opening for my camera. Other then that it works.</li>
            <li> The tablet keeps popping ouy of the little brackets. Not good quality at all. Having to buy a new case drom a different company</li>
            <li> Same complaint as most people. The corner tabs don&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my first tablet and was a little hesitant in ordering this product...received it in the mail really fast and was shocked to see that it is very sturdy and holds the tablet without it being lopsided....love this and would recommend it to anyone out there.</li>
            <li> The case fits which is great as the tablet I bouggt is oddly shaped.  The elastic bands on this case makes it good for most tablets.</li>
            <li> You have to remove tablet from cover to take photos.  No lens hole.</li>
            <li> I didnt like it. Very hard to move about Its very flimsey and dont stand to support the tablet.Not good material.I dont use it anymore</li>
            <li> Too floppy won&#x27;t stay braced up</li>
            <li> I use this on my Trio Stealth G2 10.1 tablet. It does fit and but slips frequently. I cut off the tabs and use it only to protect the screen.  I don&#x27;t recommend if you have a 10.1 tablet, however, it works/fits my sister&#x27;s 9 inch tablet and does not slip.</li>
            <li> I bought a Viva Pad 10 inch but this case doesn&#x27;t hold it well. The grips won&#x27;t stay on the corners. They keep sliding off. I&#x27;m not too worried about the tablet falling out but the grips tend to slip onto my volume buttons. I turned the tablet the other way and used the clips to hold the ends instead. That does OK. I do love the color and the fact that the case props up the tablet.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected.  Sooooo inexpensive but good quality and holds my tablet firmly.  thank you.</li>
            <li> not strong enough to hold tablet in place.</li>
            <li> It is ok if you want to go somewhere and bring your tablet.  Otherwise I do not use it at home.  It is too bulky.  I would like to find a case that is a little less heavy so I could use it at home.</li>
            <li> These covers were perfect for my kids. They are a basic cover and very easy for my kids to get the tablets in.</li>
            <li> It fit my tablet just the way I wanted a case to fit. Have no complaints. Would buy again if needed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the little holding elastic bands are hoaky and done always work too good</li>
