    <ol>
            <li>I recieved my bulb about three weeks ago and was imediately impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li>I am quite impressed with the results and will continue the treatments.</li>
            <li>At minimum, this bulb is perfect for making your face feel calmer.</li>
            <li>Its affordable, and I am loving using it!!!</li>
            <li>and it is just perfect.</li>
            <li>great!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!!!</li>
            <li>Overnight, the inflamation is greatly reduced, along with the pain.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!!  </li>
            <li>This is a great company with wonderful customer service and an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Works good, just wish it came with something to hold the bulb.</li>
            <li>A good purchase.</li>
            <li>Love how bright the led&#x27;s are , can&#x27;t wait to use it again !</li>
            <li>This is very important!</li>
            <li>I love my Rubylux bulb!  </li>
            <li>I have been using the bulb and love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>then it is freaking amazing.</li>
            <li>The bulb is mildly warm to the touch if held in place for a while.</li>
            <li>The customer service on this product is really good too, which is very important to me, and I feel confident to continue purchasing this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how wonderful it feels to have clear skin!</li>
            <li>This allows you to place the bulb directly on your skin for the best results.</li>
            <li>This bulb is great - I shine it on my belly button - that way the infrared light gets into the blood stream - fits into any light socket</li>
            <li>The bulb gets slightly warm, but I enjoy this and find it helps draw my cysts to the surface.</li>
            <li>But trying to move my hand in circles for the better part of an hour was just undoable, so I found that I could use the place and hold method for the majority of the treatment time, and then do circles for minute or two at the end.</li>
            <li>I will keep using the product and hope that the results will continue to be better.</li>
            <li>Got the light today !</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the customer service I received.  </li>
            <li>Love love love my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I bought the one Amazon suggested and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and it has started making my scars looks better.</li>
            <li>but this is way cheaper and works better.</li>
            <li>doctor and more.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is not a medicine that stays on her skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for one week, but I&#x27;m already seeing great results!</li>
            <li>but it mostly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to used this today for about 35-ish minutes, but now it wont work again.</li>
            <li>I cover the bulb with plastic wrap just to make sure it stays</li>
            <li>Three weeks of use and noticing an improvement in skin complexion :-)</li>
            <li>The bulb must be used consistently to maintain results, which I realized when I stopped using it for a month, but this is the case with many good beauty products.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and so safe.</li>
            <li>and/or all light therapy would be best to avoid for the reasons I listed above.</li>
            <li>So, there is more light output than your eyes will tell you there is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and she doesn&#x27;t mind doing it.  </li>
            <li>I have had mine about 6 weeks now and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use, and is not too bright on my eyes; I just cup my hand around the bulb, so it doesn&#x27;t shine directly.</li>
            <li>I use a rubber band to help hold the plastic wrap taught and secure around the lip of the bulb.</li>
            <li>My acne scars are healing, my pores are shrinking, and if I have a cyst or inflamed pimple, this light heals it in 2-3 days, verses sometimes 2-3 weeks without the light.</li>
            <li>The perfect spectrum for growing green algae.</li>
            <li>The bulb works great and regular use of 10-20 minutes a day has lessened joint pain.</li>
            <li>But, you should avoid looking at it as the colors are not centered in the visible light spectrum.</li>
            <li>I replaced my desktop light bulb with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;The problem areas do heal faster than if I did not use the light.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Iread that because light travels in straight lines, and the LED&#x27;s are so intense, it&#x27;s best to use a circular motion to assure that you get complete coverage.</li>
            <li>It is quite small, but perfect for the face.</li>
            <li>You also need deep penetration of bright light to fully kill acne bacteria and stimulate collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin.  </li>
            <li>Her skin gets clearer every day, and she is thrilled with the results so far!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for such a good product !</li>
            <li>I have large area of eczema on one hand and more on one leg.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use it because I don&#x27;t have a lamp for it yet, but super excited and hope it will work.</li>
            <li>It comes with full instructions.</li>
            <li>interactions of any kind of light therapy for my current medication use as well as eye color and an existing eye issue; of course I used goggle that helps some but doesn&#x27;t block out all light.</li>
            <li>Also, you can look up this medical information easily, MayoClinic, talk to any Opthomologist and/or any reputable doctor to ensure that I&#x27;m accurate and that what I&#x27;m saying is based in truth/facts....</li>
            <li>This light is safe for skin but damaging to eyes, even if you don&#x27;t look directly at it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li>The seller ships them out quickly and packed well, so no issues in delivery either.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>The light output is not super bright to look at.</li>
            <li>You will get the best results with the bulb as close to your face as possible, as the photons rapidly loose their energy</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing though, and I enjoy sitting under it and think it shows promise.</li>
            <li>The warmth from the light is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>If I was a store I would check all labels on any light therapy products and if there aren&#x27;t proper warnings I would be swift in asking for them to be put on all products or to be on the safe side</li>
            <li>This bulb is best used in conjunction with a solid routine of cleansing and other acne treatment products.</li>
            <li>To be fair, she also started a morning and evening skin routine using an acne wash/cleanser with salicylic acid (with her Clarisonic), a toner (with salicylic acid)  and a gentle moisturizer, and she is making a big effort to be consistent with all of it.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size, right intensity, right everything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early, but we are very pleased with the progress so far and are hoping to see continued improvement.  </li>
            <li>Now, as soon as I feel the tingle of a new cyst, I treat it with this light, and the healing begins immediately.</li>
            <li>Makes my life easier and less stressful because of its good results.</li>
            <li>I like this pretty well.</li>
            <li>I will also be using it on my skin, next as I feel it will surely help there, too.</li>
            <li>I saw improvement after first use but again, it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use my skin felt softer and the lines were smoother.</li>
            <li>They should check to make sure that the bulbs actually work before they send them out.</li>
            <li>After reading the NIH studies on the benefits of LED red and blue light therapy for healing and reducing inflamitory acne, I was excited to try it, but put off by the high prices and cheap quality of the devices available.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little light!</li>
            <li>If you share this bulb with others you will probably want to slip it in a sandwich bag or clear clean plastic wrap before each treatment.</li>
            <li>I really like how you cover the bulb with a fresh piece of plastic wrap each time you use it because it is very sanitary.</li>
            <li>I wish I had more patience to sit under it or that it was a lot bigger so that it covered my whole face at one time because I feel like I don&#x27;t have time to sit under it the way I should for it to really work and show results.</li>
            <li>I bought an E26 Light Bulb Socket for this red/blue light, and she holds the light directly on her skin, moving it slowly in small circles, concentrating on each area of her face for 2-5 minutes per area.</li>
            <li>I do a treatment 6 days a week, only skipping the day after my once a week retinol treatment, as this increases your sensitivity to light for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Spending a couple hours in total to get rid of that rash was a fantastic investment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used red light therapy on it before</li>
            <li>I bought the white IKEA cord set (sold here on Amazon) which another reviewer recommended to attach to the light.</li>
            <li>I lightly file the scab or rough spot and then use the light directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>And this bulb is safe and natural, with the red light actually feeding your skin: the skin cells absorb the photons and use them as virtually free energy, increasing the cells&#x27; activity by 200% for the next 24 hours.</li>
            <li>- just screw it on, lay the lamp down pointing at the belly button and read a book while it&#x27;s shining - cheapest way to heal the gut IMHO  and by far the best option financially in the infrared light world - no special anything to buy -</li>
            <li>I hold the bulb on my skin for 20 seconds and then move it a 1/4 inch over and hold again, making sure to overlap the treatment areas so all the cells get the benefits of both the red and blue lights.</li>
            <li>I would remove the products entirely since they aren&#x27;t truly safe to use at home if you are a person with the reasons listed above.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy from them again, especially if they come out with a larger bulb for a larger treatment area, and also if they make one that is exclusively blue, as that is best for inflammation.</li>
            <li>This has really helped clear up my skin!</li>
            <li>The bulb is kind of small, so I decided to get a few more and that way I can use them all at once</li>
            <li>I learned this the hard way since there aren&#x27;t proper warnings on many light therapy at home products.</li>
            <li>I divide my face into quadrants and place the bulb directly on my skin, pressing gently.</li>
            <li>Anyway, 3 days later my eczema was pretty much cleared up.</li>
            <li>The seller sent me a new one</li>
            <li>And that people should only do light therapy at a doctors office with a doctor present to avoid any complications</li>
            <li>She does this while she watches TV or a movie, being careful not to look directly into the light.</li>
            <li>I definitely have noticed an improvement in my skin, and I find the whole process really soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>It fits in any regular bulb socket, so I put mine in a hand held light and it&#x27;s the same as those pricey machines.</li>
            <li>Be willing to start with a lower dosage and wait a day or two to evaluate your last treatment before increasing dosage incrementally to minimize risk of burns from over dosage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little bulb works for inflammation, is cost efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This bulb or any light therapy product, mask or etc. is not SAFE for people taking certain medications such as: Spirolactone, Anti-depressants, certain Antibotics, Saint Johns Wort and/or any meds.</li>
            <li>It helped from very early on, as I saw far fewer hairs in my comb with each day of use.</li>
            <li>I use my large pair of regular sunglasses that have UVA/UVB protection, and close my eyes when I treat my eye area.</li>
            <li>I have used this bulb a few times a week for about 10 minutes each time on scabs that had not finished healing as quickly as I would like (most likely because I cannot resist picking off anything rough on my skin).</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve done my whole face and neck in this fashion, I go over the entire area again using a tight circular motion, to ensure every cell has recieved both colors of light.</li>
            <li>all the stuff I&#x27;ve tried to get my skin to clear up</li>
            <li>My wife used this to treat soft tissue damage from a fall and felt she benefited from it.</li>
            <li>Next treatment I sectioned the whole area and treated it in a 4 x 3 treatment area grid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I think it may have helped my wife&#x27;s soft tissue damage</li>
            <li>I bought this for pain I have in my shoulder from an old injury</li>
            <li>is pretty long.</li>
            <li>My doctor suggested I try it, so I started using this and within a couple days it cleared up my skin almost completely.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months, particularly for helping thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I have very pale combination skin with some fine lines.</li>
            <li>Using it daily will show a big difference in how fast those pesky zits go</li>
            <li>and it does not dry her out or make her sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>I will update this review in a few months, as it takes at least 6 weeks to see full benefits from the light.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been using this red and blue LED light for one and a half weeks</li>
            <li>Days later I had a clear spot with defined points where LED heads or lenses were situated.</li>
            <li>I got a new one that actually works now from the same seller.</li>
            <li>For the first treatment I placed the bulb head directly on the skin for 5 minutes slowly sliding the bulb across the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe the all red bulb would have workede, but I will have to wait until my next social securitry check to try it.</li>
            <li>Also, light therapy is not SAFE for people over 40 and isn&#x27;t SAFE for blue or light colored eyes, that it can lead to eye damage and at worst age related blindness which is called macular degeneration.</li>
            <li>After much research, I came across this little gem.</li>

            <li> You will get the best results with the bulb as close to your face as possible, as the photons rapidly loose their energy</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing though, and I enjoy sitting under it and think it shows promise.</li>
            <li> The warmth from the light is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> If I was a store I would check all labels on any light therapy products and if there aren&#x27;t proper warnings I would be swift in asking for them to be put on all products or to be on the safe side</li>
            <li> This bulb is best used in conjunction with a solid routine of cleansing and other acne treatment products.</li>
            <li> To be fair, she also started a morning and evening skin routine using an acne wash/cleanser with salicylic acid (with her Clarisonic), a toner (with salicylic acid)  and a gentle moisturizer, and she is making a big effort to be consistent with all of it.  </li>
            <li> It is just the right size, right intensity, right everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early, but we are very pleased with the progress so far and are hoping to see continued improvement.  </li>
            <li> Now, as soon as I feel the tingle of a new cyst, I treat it with this light, and the healing begins immediately.</li>
            <li> Makes my life easier and less stressful because of its good results.</li>
            <li> I like this pretty well.</li>
            <li> I will also be using it on my skin, next as I feel it will surely help there, too.</li>
            <li> I saw improvement after first use but again, it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use my skin felt softer and the lines were smoother.</li>
            <li> They should check to make sure that the bulbs actually work before they send them out.</li>
            <li> After reading the NIH studies on the benefits of LED red and blue light therapy for healing and reducing inflamitory acne, I was excited to try it, but put off by the high prices and cheap quality of the devices available.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little light!</li>
            <li> If you share this bulb with others you will probably want to slip it in a sandwich bag or clear clean plastic wrap before each treatment.</li>
            <li> I really like how you cover the bulb with a fresh piece of plastic wrap each time you use it because it is very sanitary.</li>
            <li> I wish I had more patience to sit under it or that it was a lot bigger so that it covered my whole face at one time because I feel like I don&#x27;t have time to sit under it the way I should for it to really work and show results.</li>
            <li> I bought an E26 Light Bulb Socket for this red/blue light, and she holds the light directly on her skin, moving it slowly in small circles, concentrating on each area of her face for 2-5 minutes per area.</li>
            <li> I do a treatment 6 days a week, only skipping the day after my once a week retinol treatment, as this increases your sensitivity to light for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Spending a couple hours in total to get rid of that rash was a fantastic investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used red light therapy on it before</li>
            <li> I bought the white IKEA cord set (sold here on Amazon) which another reviewer recommended to attach to the light.</li>
            <li> I lightly file the scab or rough spot and then use the light directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> And this bulb is safe and natural, with the red light actually feeding your skin: the skin cells absorb the photons and use them as virtually free energy, increasing the cells&#x27; activity by 200% for the next 24 hours.</li>
            <li> - just screw it on, lay the lamp down pointing at the belly button and read a book while it&#x27;s shining - cheapest way to heal the gut IMHO  and by far the best option financially in the infrared light world - no special anything to buy -</li>
            <li> I hold the bulb on my skin for 20 seconds and then move it a 1/4 inch over and hold again, making sure to overlap the treatment areas so all the cells get the benefits of both the red and blue lights.</li>
            <li> I would remove the products entirely since they aren&#x27;t truly safe to use at home if you are a person with the reasons listed above.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy from them again, especially if they come out with a larger bulb for a larger treatment area, and also if they make one that is exclusively blue, as that is best for inflammation.</li>
            <li> This has really helped clear up my skin!</li>
            <li> The bulb is kind of small, so I decided to get a few more and that way I can use them all at once</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way since there aren&#x27;t proper warnings on many light therapy at home products.</li>
            <li> I divide my face into quadrants and place the bulb directly on my skin, pressing gently.</li>
            <li> Anyway, 3 days later my eczema was pretty much cleared up.</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a new one</li>
            <li> And that people should only do light therapy at a doctors office with a doctor present to avoid any complications</li>
            <li> She does this while she watches TV or a movie, being careful not to look directly into the light.</li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed an improvement in my skin, and I find the whole process really soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> It fits in any regular bulb socket, so I put mine in a hand held light and it&#x27;s the same as those pricey machines.</li>
            <li> Be willing to start with a lower dosage and wait a day or two to evaluate your last treatment before increasing dosage incrementally to minimize risk of burns from over dosage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little bulb works for inflammation, is cost efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This bulb or any light therapy product, mask or etc. is not SAFE for people taking certain medications such as: Spirolactone, Anti-depressants, certain Antibotics, Saint Johns Wort and/or any meds.</li>
            <li> It helped from very early on, as I saw far fewer hairs in my comb with each day of use.</li>
            <li> I use my large pair of regular sunglasses that have UVA/UVB protection, and close my eyes when I treat my eye area.</li>
            <li> I have used this bulb a few times a week for about 10 minutes each time on scabs that had not finished healing as quickly as I would like (most likely because I cannot resist picking off anything rough on my skin).</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve done my whole face and neck in this fashion, I go over the entire area again using a tight circular motion, to ensure every cell has recieved both colors of light.</li>
            <li> all the stuff I&#x27;ve tried to get my skin to clear up</li>
            <li> My wife used this to treat soft tissue damage from a fall and felt she benefited from it.</li>
            <li> Next treatment I sectioned the whole area and treated it in a 4 x 3 treatment area grid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I think it may have helped my wife&#x27;s soft tissue damage</li>
            <li> I bought this for pain I have in my shoulder from an old injury</li>
            <li> is pretty long.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested I try it, so I started using this and within a couple days it cleared up my skin almost completely.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months, particularly for helping thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have very pale combination skin with some fine lines.</li>
            <li> Using it daily will show a big difference in how fast those pesky zits go</li>
            <li> and it does not dry her out or make her sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> I will update this review in a few months, as it takes at least 6 weeks to see full benefits from the light.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this red and blue LED light for one and a half weeks</li>
            <li> Days later I had a clear spot with defined points where LED heads or lenses were situated.</li>
            <li> I got a new one that actually works now from the same seller.</li>
            <li> For the first treatment I placed the bulb head directly on the skin for 5 minutes slowly sliding the bulb across the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe the all red bulb would have workede, but I will have to wait until my next social securitry check to try it.</li>
            <li> Also, light therapy is not SAFE for people over 40 and isn&#x27;t SAFE for blue or light colored eyes, that it can lead to eye damage and at worst age related blindness which is called macular degeneration.</li>
            <li> After much research, I came across this little gem.</li>
            <li> In the past we tried a host of homemade skin remedies and skin products, including sulfur and benzoyl peroxide, which cleared her mild acne but dried her sensitive skin and made her eyes swell up.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I held the bulb stationary near the center of the eczema for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected, not an issue but might want to choose your lamp/light after getting it if you are buying one just for this.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I used expensive light devices that would quickly break and were inconvenient to replace multiple times.</li>
            <li> I have not used it very long, so I can&#x27;t say that it has made a difference or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange.  </li>
            <li> Especially when the machines start at $80 and the other bulbs at $40!</li>
            <li> a few days later I tried 5 minutes stationary.</li>
            <li> It has all, if not more, of the features that the much more expensive devices do, and it cost less than $30 to buy the bulb and fixture!</li>
            <li> This bulb has lasted longer than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> These cysts used to plague me with large red, painful bumps that lasted weeks and scarring after they healed.</li>
            <li> so it takes me less time.</li>
            <li> I will update my review after few months.</li>
            <li> I fell asleep a few times during this, so I would recommend a kitchen timer rather than watching the clock alone.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on that.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble with post acne marks and sebaceous hyperplasia bumps on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I plug mine into a plain IKEA cord that I bought also on amazon so that the bulb can be placed close to my skin.</li>
            <li> I can do my treatment while I watch TV, using a small hand mirror.</li>
            <li> I have been using it 3-4 times per week for the past two weeks</li>
            <li> not sure about this product</li>
            <li> In my clip on desk lamp, it was too small to reach my face.</li>
            <li> Sadly, acne is classified as an incurable, chronic disease, so any treatments must be kept up regularly.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes you&#x27;ll notice that the active or upcoming zits don&#x27;t hurt/throb as bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life and some of it is cystic, which is very painful.</li>
            <li> It cured those stubborn painful cysts around my jawline that nothing else could help.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works good, just wish it came with something to hold the bulb. Everything I found was too deep so you couldn&#x27;t get the bulb close to your skin.</li>
            <li> I love my Rubylux bulb!  After reading the NIH studies on the benefits of LED red and blue light therapy for healing and reducing inflamitory acne, I was excited to try it, but put off by the high prices and cheap quality of the devices available. After much research, I came across this little gem. It has all, if not more, of the features that the much more expensive devices do, and it cost less than $30 to buy the bulb and fixture! I recieved my bulb about three weeks ago and was imediately impressed with the quality. It comes with full instructions. I really like how you cover the bulb with a fresh piece of plastic wrap each time you use it because it is very sanitary. I use a rubber band to help hold the plastic wrap taught and secure around the lip of the bulb. I use my large pair of regular sunglasses that have UVA/UVB protection, and close my eyes when I treat my eye area. This is very important! This light is safe for skin but damaging to eyes, even if you don&#x27;t look directly at it. I wash my face well before every treatment. I divide my face into quadrants and place the bulb directly on my skin, pressing gently. You will get the best results with the bulb as close to your face as possible, as the photons rapidly loose their energy the further they have to travel. You also need deep penetration of bright light to fully kill acne bacteria and stimulate collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin.  I hold the bulb on my skin for 20 seconds and then move it a 1/4 inch over and hold again, making sure to overlap the treatment areas so all the cells get the benefits of both the red and blue lights. The bulb gets slightly warm, but I enjoy this and find it helps draw my cysts to the surface. The warmth also increases blood circulation, which helps in detoxifying and healing the skin. Once I&#x27;ve done my whole face and neck in this fashion, I go over the entire area again using a tight circular motion, to ensure every cell has recieved both colors of light. Iread that because light travels in straight lines, and the LED&#x27;s are so intense, it&#x27;s best to use a circular motion to assure that you get complete coverage. But trying to move my hand in circles for the better part of an hour was just undoable, so I found that I could use the place and hold method for the majority of the treatment time, and then do circles for minute or two at the end. I do a treatment 6 days a week, only skipping the day after my once a week retinol treatment, as this increases your sensitivity to light for 24 hours. It takes about an hour to treat my face and neck. I can do my treatment while I watch TV, using a small hand mirror. The improvements have been noticable. My acne scars are healing, my pores are shrinking, and if I have a cyst or inflamed pimple, this light heals it in 2-3 days, verses sometimes 2-3 weeks without the light. Overnight, the inflamation is greatly reduced, along with the pain. These cysts used to plague me with large red, painful bumps that lasted weeks and scarring after they healed. Now, as soon as I feel the tingle of a new cyst, I treat it with this light, and the healing begins immediately. Sadly, acne is classified as an incurable, chronic disease, so any treatments must be kept up regularly. This bulb is best used in conjunction with a solid routine of cleansing and other acne treatment products. I use ARCONA products exclusively, and combined with this bulb, I&#x27;ve gotten a 90% reduction in acne, and a 75% improvement in skin texture and tone. Before the bulb, my acne was reduced by about 65%, and the texture improved by 50% with ARCONA products only, so I know this bulb has made a difference. It cured those stubborn painful cysts around my jawline that nothing else could help. I can&#x27;t express how wonderful it feels to have clear skin! And this bulb is safe and natural, with the red light actually feeding your skin: the skin cells absorb the photons and use them as virtually free energy, increasing the cells&#x27; activity by 200% for the next 24 hours. I will update this review in a few months, as it takes at least 6 weeks to see full benefits from the light. I am so grateful to Bambi at Rubylux for providing a quality, affordable way to use LED therapy at home. This is a great company with wonderful customer service and an outstanding product. Ten stars!</li>
            <li> I have not used it very long, so I can&#x27;t say that it has made a difference or not. It is comfortable to use, and is not too bright on my eyes; I just cup my hand around the bulb, so it doesn&#x27;t shine directly. I will have to wait to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I think that the skin got tighter and the lines got smoother. I will keep using the product and hope that the results will continue to be better.</li>
            <li> I like this pretty well. I wish I had more patience to sit under it or that it was a lot bigger so that it covered my whole face at one time because I feel like I don&#x27;t have time to sit under it the way I should for it to really work and show results. It is very relaxing though, and I enjoy sitting under it and think it shows promise.</li>
            <li> Got the light today ! Love how bright the led&#x27;s are , can&#x27;t wait to use it again ! Thanks for such a good product !</li>
            <li> This bulb is great - I shine it on my belly button - that way the infrared light gets into the blood stream - fits into any light socket - just screw it on, lay the lamp down pointing at the belly button and read a book while it&#x27;s shining - cheapest way to heal the gut IMHO  and by far the best option financially in the infrared light world - no special anything to buy -</li>
            <li> I use and recommend these bulbs for the algae scrubbers I sell. The perfect spectrum for growing green algae.</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a new one and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the customer service I received.  I have been using the bulb and love it!  Does not work, won&#x27;t even turn on. Will try to figure out how to return it. Bummed.</li>
            <li> The bulb works great and regular use of 10-20 minutes a day has lessened joint pain.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and so safe. I have been using it for several months, particularly for helping thinning hair. It helped from very early on, as I saw far fewer hairs in my comb with each day of use. I am quite impressed with the results and will continue the treatments. I will also be using it on my skin, next as I feel it will surely help there, too. Love this product! Makes my life easier and less stressful because of its good results. The bulb must be used consistently to maintain results, which I realized when I stopped using it for a month, but this is the case with many good beauty products. The customer service on this product is really good too, which is very important to me, and I feel confident to continue purchasing this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Love love love my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bulb for my eczema, I definitely see improvement, not gone but improved.  I have been using it 3-4 times per week for the past two weeks but i think i should be using it every day. I have large area of eczema on one hand and more on one leg. I saw improvement after first use but again, it&#x27;s still there. I will update my review after few months.</li>
            <li> You will want to buy a socket and cord for this. I bought the one Amazon suggested and I am glad I did. The bulb is 2 inches diameter but the LED lenses only cover a 1.5&amp;#34; diameter circle. there are 10 blue LED&#x27;s in mine and 28 red. The blues were well distributed. I would estimate the bulb to be somewhere around 3 watts. The light output is not super bright to look at. But, you should avoid looking at it as the colors are not centered in the visible light spectrum. So, there is more light output than your eyes will tell you there is. The bulb is mildly warm to the touch if held in place for a while. My wife used this to treat soft tissue damage from a fall and felt she benefited from it. I used this to treat an area of eczema on my abdomen. The area was about 7&amp;#34; diameter. For the first treatment I placed the bulb head directly on the skin for 5 minutes slowly sliding the bulb across the surface of the skin. I did not notice a benefit. A few days later I held the bulb stationary near the center of the eczema for 3 minutes. a day or two later it appeared there was an area with improved skin in that spot that corresponded with the lamp head. a few days later I tried 5 minutes stationary. Days later I had a clear spot with defined points where LED heads or lenses were situated. Next treatment I sectioned the whole area and treated it in a 4 x 3 treatment area grid. That was 12 stationary treatments with a 5 minute per area dosage. I fell asleep a few times during this, so I would recommend a kitchen timer rather than watching the clock alone. Anyway, 3 days later my eczema was pretty much cleared up. I have not treated it or had a flare up in the month since. If you share this bulb with others you will probably want to slip it in a sandwich bag or clear clean plastic wrap before each treatment. I did not have that concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I think it may have helped my wife&#x27;s soft tissue damage and I know it cleared up my eczema. Spending a couple hours in total to get rid of that rash was a fantastic investment. Be willing to start with a lower dosage and wait a day or two to evaluate your last treatment before increasing dosage incrementally to minimize risk of burns from over dosage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it to others? Absolutely!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I wish I had bought the bulb with all blue LED&#x27;s instead? Possibly. If I had ongoing skin rash treatment I would deffinately try the all blue bulb to reduce treatment time by about 70%.</li>
            <li> Product does not work or turn on at all!</li>
            <li> This has really helped clear up my skin!</li>
            <li> At minimum, this bulb is perfect for making your face feel calmer. Now, if you add in the fact that it zaps your zits faster then it is freaking amazing. Within a few minutes you&#x27;ll notice that the active or upcoming zits don&#x27;t hurt/throb as bad. Using it daily will show a big difference in how fast those pesky zits go away.&lt;br /&gt;The red lights also plump up your skin and it has started making my scars looks better. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, especially for the price compared to the others.</li>
            <li> I bought this for pain I have in my shoulder from an old injury and it has helped immensely. I&#x27;ve used red light therapy on it before but this is way cheaper and works better. Definitely recommend for pain.</li>
            <li> This bulb or any light therapy product, mask or etc. is not SAFE for people taking certain medications such as: Spirolactone, Anti-depressants, certain Antibotics, Saint Johns Wort and/or any meds. that cause sun sensitivity; the list of meds. is pretty long. I&#x27;m only listing what I am or was taking at the time that I used this bulb and/or the Illumask Anti-Acne Masks. I learned this the hard way since there aren&#x27;t proper warnings on many light therapy at home products. What happened to me was: permament lesions on both eyes, swollen lids, goo coming out of both eyes and so I went to my eye doctor inmmediately, reg. doctor and more. which I was then told of the neg. interactions of any kind of light therapy for my current medication use as well as eye color and an existing eye issue; of course I used goggle that helps some but doesn&#x27;t block out all light. And that people should only do light therapy at a doctors office with a doctor present to avoid any complications and/or all light therapy would be best to avoid for the reasons I listed above. Also, light therapy is not SAFE for people over 40 and isn&#x27;t SAFE for blue or light colored eyes, that it can lead to eye damage and at worst age related blindness which is called macular degeneration. If I was a store I would check all labels on any light therapy products and if there aren&#x27;t proper warnings I would be swift in asking for them to be put on all products or to be on the safe side I would remove the products entirely since they aren&#x27;t truly safe to use at home if you are a person with the reasons listed above. Also, you can look up this medical information easily, MayoClinic, talk to any Opthomologist and/or any reputable doctor to ensure that I&#x27;m accurate and that what I&#x27;m saying is based in truth/facts....</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this red and blue LED light for one and a half weeks and we are seeing a 50-75% improvement in her skin.  To be fair, she also started a morning and evening skin routine using an acne wash/cleanser with salicylic acid (with her Clarisonic), a toner (with salicylic acid)  and a gentle moisturizer, and she is making a big effort to be consistent with all of it.  She is also exfoliating once a week with the Clarisonic skin polish.  It&#x27;s still early, but we are very pleased with the progress so far and are hoping to see continued improvement.  In the past we tried a host of homemade skin remedies and skin products, including sulfur and benzoyl peroxide, which cleared her mild acne but dried her sensitive skin and made her eyes swell up.  I bought an E26 Light Bulb Socket for this red/blue light, and she holds the light directly on her skin, moving it slowly in small circles, concentrating on each area of her face for 2-5 minutes per area. She does this while she watches TV or a movie, being careful not to look directly into the light. It&#x27;s easy and she doesn&#x27;t mind doing it.  Her skin gets clearer every day, and she is thrilled with the results so far!  I love the fact that this is not a medicine that stays on her skin and it does not dry her out or make her sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!  Its affordable, and I am loving using it!!!</li>
            <li> It has done nothing for my psoriasis.  It was advertised to do that. To treat it and nothing has changed.  I wasted my money on that.  Maybe the all red bulb would have workede, but I will have to wait until my next social securitry check to try it.</li>
            <li> not sure about this product</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and just as described. It is quite small, but perfect for the face. I have yet to use it because I don&#x27;t have a lamp for it yet, but super excited and hope it will work. I will repost an update.</li>
            <li> I have very pale combination skin with some fine lines. I&#x27;ve only used this for one week, but I&#x27;m already seeing great results! Even after the first use my skin felt softer and the lines were smoother. I have trouble with post acne marks and sebaceous hyperplasia bumps on my cheeks. The marks now are fading, and the bumps appear to be flatter than before. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I bought the white IKEA cord set (sold here on Amazon) which another reviewer recommended to attach to the light. This allows you to place the bulb directly on your skin for the best results. I am using it 15-20 mins per day at night before bed. The warmth from the light is very relaxing. I am going to buy one for a friend of mine too! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I replaced my desktop light bulb with this and it is just perfect. I bought it to use on my face while or after I do  facial sheet-mask at night. It is just the right size, right intensity, right everything.</li>
            <li> great!!! Easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this bulb for treatment of psoriasis. Prior to this I used expensive light devices that would quickly break and were inconvenient to replace multiple times. Often the warranty would be void. This little bulb works for inflammation, is cost efficient and easy to use. I plug mine into a plain IKEA cord that I bought also on amazon so that the bulb can be placed close to my skin. This bulb has lasted longer than any other I have used. I would definitely buy from them again, especially if they come out with a larger bulb for a larger treatment area, and also if they make one that is exclusively blue, as that is best for inflammation.</li>
            <li> Did not help acne at all. I should send it back.</li>
            <li> I gave this a three because for some reason this thing only sometimes works. I tried it in different lamps and sometimes it turns on but it mostly doesn&#x27;t. I was finally able to used this today for about 35-ish minutes, but now it wont work again. It&#x27;s very strange.  Edit: I got a new one that actually works now from the same seller. Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Either burnt out or never worked. Had to return for refund.</li>
            <li> I have used this bulb a few times a week for about 10 minutes each time on scabs that had not finished healing as quickly as I would like (most likely because I cannot resist picking off anything rough on my skin). I lightly file the scab or rough spot and then use the light directly on the skin. I cover the bulb with plastic wrap just to make sure it stays clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem areas do heal faster than if I did not use the light. It is light weight and convenient to use. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life and some of it is cystic, which is very painful. My doctor suggested I try it, so I started using this and within a couple days it cleared up my skin almost completely. It&#x27;s not totally gone- but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 75% better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day for 15 minutes on the parts of my face that are breaking out. It does take some time, but I&#x27;m so relieved to have semi-normal looking skin that I don&#x27;t even care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the stuff I&#x27;ve tried to get my skin to clear up, this has definitely been the biggest bang for the buck. The bulb is kind of small, so I decided to get a few more and that way I can use them all at once so it takes me less time.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little light! I definitely have noticed an improvement in my skin, and I find the whole process really soothing and relaxing. It fits in any regular bulb socket, so I put mine in a hand held light and it&#x27;s the same as those pricey machines. The seller ships them out quickly and packed well, so no issues in delivery either. I have had mine about 6 weeks now and it is still going strong. For the price and the quality you can&#x27;t beat it! Especially when the machines start at $80 and the other bulbs at $40! It is smaller than I expected, not an issue but might want to choose your lamp/light after getting it if you are buying one just for this. In my clip on desk lamp, it was too small to reach my face.</li>
            <li> Three weeks of use and noticing an improvement in skin complexion :-)</li>
            <li> Received the bulb but it didn&#x27;t work.  They should check to make sure that the bulbs actually work before they send them out.</li>
