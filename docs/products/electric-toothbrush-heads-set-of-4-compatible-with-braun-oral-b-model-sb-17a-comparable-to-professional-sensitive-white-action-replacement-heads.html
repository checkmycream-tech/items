    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the best replacements.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely excellent replacements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value for a great product!</li>
            <li>They work, so therefore they are great for the cost.</li>
            <li>These are a really great value and a great quality product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>These heads are great.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is great.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
            <li>I purchased these based on the good ratings.</li>
            <li>These fit my Oral_B electric toothbrush perfectly and without any difficulties.  </li>
            <li>and he loved them.</li>
            <li>and it was a good product.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, I&#x27;m really very pleased with how they feel.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>They seem to hold up well and clean my molars superbly, which I feel did not get done well with the dual clean heads.</li>
            <li>very cute and easy to take.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and look like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap alternative :)  </li>
            <li>Plus, at this cost, I find myself changing the brush head more often which is beneficial to my dental health.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found these heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I could not be more satisfied with their performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more while I know</li>
            <li>I thought they would be ok, even though they are not name brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work out to be a better value.</li>
            <li>Love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my uncle and this company who really has a great product!</li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave them 2 stars is because they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>The mechanics work fine.</li>
            <li>I just got an unsolicited email from the vendor through Amazon inviting me to review their product, and even provided detailed instructions on how to do so.</li>
            <li>They have good spinning motion and clean the back teeth easily.</li>
            <li>Very cheap imitations of the real thing</li>
            <li>Not an exact fit but filled the bill.</li>
            <li>That might not have been a good play on their part, because my toothbrush head just broke last night!</li>
            <li>They were delivered quickly, but I won&#x27;t consider buying them again.</li>
            <li>exactly which ones I&#x27;m getting!</li>
            <li>He gave a few to me to try and it was honestly great</li>
            <li>As a health care professional, selling these type of products for over 30 years, I am perplexed by the seemingly uselessness of the reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the first head for about three weeks now and no problems yet.</li>
            <li>I snapped it back in, but now the toothbrush head won&#x27;t attach to the motor part any more.</li>
            <li>However, with this one, if you don&#x27;t hit the spring just right when putting the brush on, you don&#x27;t get much vibration/rotation at all.  </li>
            <li>There are some reviews that address this issue, but many \\&quot;peculiar\\&quot; positive reviews that either have a different brush head, or are clueless as to how a toothbrush should be made.    </li>
            <li>This one is a little better because its a little bit smaller and can get really in and clean my teeth wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Even when correctly placed, the action is significantly weaker than the brand name version.</li>
            <li>The bristles were fine, just the internal mechanism that vibrates them broke.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads were much cheaper than their name brand counterparts, and worked just as well.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend as a cheap alternative to the name-brand replacement heads.</li>
            <li>They use it so much i have to keep getting replacements</li>
            <li>Fit properly, works well.</li>
            <li>but if I did I am sure they would say they couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the much more expensive Oral-B brand.  </li>
            <li>Spend a bit more and buy the real thing, your money is totally wasted here.</li>
            <li>The colored toothbrush rings don&#x27;t fit quite as tightly on the bottom of the brush as the Oral-B ones, but its a pretty inconsequential concern for me.  </li>
            <li>: Description in part states “Gentle and Soft Bristles for Sensitive Teeth”</li>
            <li>They look like the real deal but apparently the quality of the vibrating mechanism is lacking, and so I have to now give them 1 star instead of 4 or 5.  </li>
            <li>Ignore the one star haters&lt;br /&gt;Ive enjoyed these Toothbrush and so do my kids, they perfer these than the usual kids ones.</li>
            <li>I bought these brush head replacements as a stocking stuffer for my significant other.</li>
            <li>So far I have used two of these and both broke within 10 days.</li>
            <li>They are really soft as well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush and had purchased some generic dual clean heads a few months ago that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who has a hard time with really cleaning their teeth and want to really scrub and remove the access.</li>
            <li>Two of the brush heads came apart in the first few days.</li>

            <li> So far I have used two of these and both broke within 10 days.</li>

            <li> Two of the brush heads came apart in the first few days.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long enough to justify their lower price.  </li>
            <li> strange taste that overtakes toothpaste flavour makes you wonder ...</li>
            <li> Contrary to the description and package label, these are definitely not sensitive toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> They were big and did not clean my back teeth</li>
            <li> Now, the brand-name toothbrush heads are more expensive, but at this rate, I&#x27;ll go through all four toothbrush heads in a little over a month, so</li>
            <li> Not worth the low price.</li>
            <li> In the first week, 2 of the 4 have already failed with the internal mechanism breaking so the brushes no longer turn.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and if you have sensitive teeth I would recommend you stick with OEM replacements.</li>
            <li> These bristles are on the hard side and not what I&#x27;d consider soft</li>
            <li> I could have sought out a refund, but it&#x27;s not worth my time.  </li>
            <li> I feel like Threw my money directly into the garbage can along with these 4 broken brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Each one lasted a week, or less, before the head stopped rotating.  </li>
            <li> A little piece of plastic fell out of the end where the head attaches to the motor part.</li>
            <li> and you can expect to use all 4 heads within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have never encountered a brush head so stiff, and unusable in all those years.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, they fall apart after 1 use!</li>
            <li> They are in my opinion misrepresented as they are definitely hard and not listed that way.    </li>
            <li> Wow, these toothbrush heads were bad.  </li>
            <li> At least then I&#x27;d know I had bought some karma.  </li>
            <li> ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very hard.</li>
            <li> 19 Jan 2015 update: Two of the 4 brush heads have broken already.  </li>
            <li> They are poor quality, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend the time on a review to save others the aggravation of a poorly executed product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when ordering these toothbrush heads since I&#x27;ve had bad luck with other OEM brushes on the Oral B electric handles.  </li>
            <li> My experience was disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> this is a blatant misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are horrible!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a measly 2-3 uses per brush.  </li>
            <li> break within a week - terrible waste</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the toothbrush heads are worthless.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  </li>

            <li> These only last a week or 2 before they stop working on my oral b toothbrush</li>
            <li> These fit my Oral_B electric toothbrush perfectly and without any difficulties.  I can&#x27;t take a poll of my teeth but if I did I am sure they would say they couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the much more expensive Oral-B brand.  Plus, at this cost, I find myself changing the brush head more often which is beneficial to my dental health.</li>
            <li> Ignore the one star haters&lt;br /&gt;Ive enjoyed these Toothbrush and so do my kids, they perfer these than the usual kids ones. They use it so much i have to keep getting replacements and i personal dont mind</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Fit properly, works well.</li>
            <li> If you have Oral B - just get Oral B. These aren&#x27;t the best replacements. They are really soft as well.</li>
            <li> Not an exact fit but filled the bill.</li>
            <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> They are poor quality, you get what you pay for.  They broke soon after I started using them.  I&#x27;ll never buy them again.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and look like the real thing.  Very cheap alternative :)  Save some money!  Recommended</li>
            <li> Wow, these toothbrush heads were bad.  I bought these because they were much cheaper than the name brand replacements, but even so they were a total waste of money.  Out of 4 brush heads, I got 10 actual uses.  That&#x27;s a measly 2-3 uses per brush.  ridiculous.  I would have been happier dropping the $10 on the sidewalk on my way to work.  At least then I&#x27;d know I had bought some karma.  I feel like Threw my money directly into the garbage can along with these 4 broken brush heads.  Spend a bit more and buy the real thing, your money is totally wasted here.</li>
            <li> very cute and easy to take.</li>
            <li> These use a spring, as do the brand name ones.  However, with this one, if you don&#x27;t hit the spring just right when putting the brush on, you don&#x27;t get much vibration/rotation at all.  Even when correctly placed, the action is significantly weaker than the brand name version.</li>
            <li> Two of the brush heads came apart in the first few days.</li>
            <li> They work fine. No different than the brand name,</li>
            <li> These are a really great value and a great quality product. You get a ton of then for the price, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about using them sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Braun Oral B electric brushes for over 20 years.  I have never encountered a brush head so stiff, and unusable in all those years.  I used to by OEM products in bulk at BJ&#x27;s.  Not finding them there I decided to try these.  They are in my opinion misrepresented as they are definitely hard and not listed that way.    There are some reviews that address this issue, but many \\&quot;peculiar\\&quot; positive reviews that either have a different brush head, or are clueless as to how a toothbrush should be made.    As a health care professional, selling these type of products for over 30 years, I am perplexed by the seemingly uselessness of the reviews of this product.  They steered me wrong for sure, and I&#x27;ll buy OEM next time.    I found 1 remaining OEM and switched back to it and it is night and day softer than this \\&quot;generic\\&quot; brush.  I could have sought out a refund, but it&#x27;s not worth my time.  I&#x27;d rather spend the time on a review to save others the aggravation of a poorly executed product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> did not work as promised. strange taste that overtakes toothpaste flavour makes you wonder ...</li>
            <li> I have an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush and had purchased some generic dual clean heads a few months ago that I had been using.  They were big and did not clean my back teeth well.  I am glad I found these heads.  They seem to hold up well and clean my molars superbly, which I feel did not get done well with the dual clean heads.</li>
            <li> My uncle bought these for his office because he&#x27;s a dentist and he loved them. He gave a few to me to try and it was honestly great I bought something like these awhile back and it was a good product. This one is a little better because its a little bit smaller and can get really in and clean my teeth wonderfully. I recommend this to anyone who has a hard time with really cleaning their teeth and want to really scrub and remove the access. I&#x27;m happy with the results. Thanks to my uncle and this company who really has a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought some of these as a replacement for the originals that came with my toothbrush. These are absolutely excellent replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more satisfied with their performance. Great value for a great product!</li>
            <li> These heads are great. They may be a bit smaller than the name brand heads, but I like that. They have good spinning motion and clean the back teeth easily. I have been using the first head for about three weeks now and no problems yet. I would order again in the future.</li>
            <li> # 1: If you purchase this item you are throwing your money away! Very cheap imitations of the real thing and you can expect to use all 4 heads within a few weeks. JUNK! # 2: Description in part states “Gentle and Soft Bristles for Sensitive Teeth” this is a blatant misrepresentation. The bristles are hard and if you have sensitive teeth I would recommend you stick with OEM replacements.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when ordering these toothbrush heads since I&#x27;ve had bad luck with other OEM brushes on the Oral B electric handles.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, I&#x27;m really very pleased with how they feel.  The colored toothbrush rings don&#x27;t fit quite as tightly on the bottom of the brush as the Oral-B ones, but its a pretty inconsequential concern for me.  The toothbrush itself is great.  I&#x27;m going to order more while I know exactly which ones I&#x27;m getting!</li>
            <li> These work well and are compatible with my system but could be softer. These bristles are on the hard side and not what I&#x27;d consider soft but they do work well.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  Each one lasted a week, or less, before the head stopped rotating.  Not worth the low price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the toothbrush heads are worthless.  In the first week, 2 of the 4 have already failed with the internal mechanism breaking so the brushes no longer turn.  I would award zero stars...</li>
            <li> The bristles are very hard. Contrary to the description and package label, these are definitely not sensitive toothbrush heads. The mechanics work fine.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I bought these brush head replacements as a stocking stuffer for my significant other. I thought they would be ok, even though they are not name brand. Boy was I wrong! The only reason why I gave them 2 stars is because they fit perfectly. Other than that, they are horrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money, they fall apart after 1 use! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just got an unsolicited email from the vendor through Amazon inviting me to review their product, and even provided detailed instructions on how to do so. That might not have been a good play on their part, because my toothbrush head just broke last night! That means it only lasted 10 days. A little piece of plastic fell out of the end where the head attaches to the motor part. I snapped it back in, but now the toothbrush head won&#x27;t attach to the motor part any more. Now, the brand-name toothbrush heads are more expensive, but at this rate, I&#x27;ll go through all four toothbrush heads in a little over a month, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work out to be a better value.</li>
            <li> break within a week - terrible waste</li>
            <li> Love these brush heads.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
