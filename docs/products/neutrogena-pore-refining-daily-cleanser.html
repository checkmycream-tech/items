            <li>nice product... cleans the oily skin...</li>

            <li>This has a very strong scent.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m putting up with it because I don&#x27;t want to lay out more money to buy another kind</li>
            <li>SMELLS REAL CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>Great cleanser, and very gentle on your face.  </li>
            <li>Some of the product from the higher end counters worked great</li>
            <li>better results:&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>Bummer...really wanted smaller pores Lol!</li>
            <li>I suggest better packaging when shipping.</li>
            <li>I really love this face wash.</li>
            <li>When I opened it most of it was spilled because it was opened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>He studied at Oxford, and told me many tricks of the trade that we do not use in the USA.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll need to use it a bit longer to see more of a difference.</li>
            <li>So, I tried the cleanser and love it as well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and works great for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many, MANY \\&quot;Pore Refiner Face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous salicylic acid treatments, but the oxygen in this formula works the best.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely better every week.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell,and the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this, and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with it!  </li>
            <li>I have very very olily skin which is good.</li>
            <li>Okay I have suffered from elephant size pores for years, primarily because of blackheads.</li>
            <li>This product makes the texture of my skin more smooth but for some reason it also gives me pimples.  </li>
            <li>It seems good, time will really tell.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells good, see a little difference in pore size</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used so far, and so much cheaper than Dermalogica or Proactive</li>
            <li>It is more sudsy than I thought it would be, but you feel clean.</li>
            <li>but the smell was too strong</li>
            <li>Luckily since its soap, it cleaned up easily :)</li>
            <li>It cleans fine-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This product foams up well and rinses off easily, as well as having a light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>As a face soap it works fine.  </li>
            <li>You can use a oil free moisturizer to help.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job of cleaning out your pores, which is what allows them to shrink (can&#x27;t very well shrink if there&#x27;s gunk in them).  </li>
            <li>It tightens pores and leaves your face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, pores after weeks are smaller, highly  recommended it works for me.</li>
            <li>I started using this cleanser after first trying out the Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner, which I absolutely LOVE.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, my skin looks years younger - better than it has since I was</li>
            <li>You can actually feel this product tightening your skin, my complication has not look this good in years.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t get the full amount that should have been in the bottle</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not enough aha or bha to do any good</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, reduces pores, cheap as subscribe and save!</li>
            <li>but other than that its a great product so don&#x27;t let packaging deter you.</li>
            <li>Also, after only a couple of uses, I started getting acne all over, which I haven&#x27;t had in many years!</li>
            <li>SATISFIED THUS FAR!.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed hot water works best, because your pores open up better, but also because this lather just feels like it penetrates into your skin, leaving it softer, smoother, more refined, more luminous than it would with cold water.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the absolute best for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and still do, even now while in my late 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite face soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser because my pores stay clean.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh smell and leaves my skin feeling very clean, but not dry at all, used twice daily.  </li>
            <li>natural oils on the skin is good keeps your face soft as you get older.</li>
            <li>Using daily and i love it.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my face feels more evenly toned and brightened.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Pores are smaller, face feels more toned, brightens my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product does warn you about a higher risk of getting sun burn when using the product</li>
            <li>This product came in good time and works after a few wqshes.</li>
            <li>I suffer large pores thanks to heritage and got seduced into a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>your pores are large due to blackheads if you really want to see good results with this product you need to unclog your pores first, I would recommend using pore strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why pay more when products like this exist and are just as good as the expensive stuff?</li>
            <li>It also helps with my very oily skin; it cleanses better than regular soap and seems to prevent pimple breakouts.</li>
            <li>My husband who  had one large pore on his chin and was using this to get rid of it now has more large open pores all over his face</li>
            <li>He tends to have large pores that invite germs</li>
            <li>I have always had large pores on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>I have large pores which cannot take any type of cleansers without being clogged.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels to much smoother than before.  </li>
            <li>This face wash also works very well with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Until this one, much of the product I tried was too drying, made my pinkish skin redder, and even broke me out.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>, it replenished mucho skin a lot, i have freakles and it looks so much clearer,</li>
            <li>I feel my face much hidrates, and defenitley pore very reduced.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser that does the trick.</li>
            <li>but this is a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>If you really want exfoliation in your cleanser try Aqua Glycolic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I need something gentle just like this</li>
            <li>However, I believe it would work very well for someone who has oily skin.</li>
            <li>but I would just use it again some time in the winter when the sun isn&#x27;t out as much.</li>
            <li>Not only are my pores nearly invisible now, my skin looks toned, smooth and glowing!  </li>
            <li>At first, I was skeptical to try, yet another, Neutrogena product, but now, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>I alternate with Cerave for a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li>I love neutrogena products and this one hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li>Im a new one month user, I will really but it again</li>
            <li>This left so many red blotches on my face, I ended up at the dermatologist!</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the smell and the feel, and I could tell it was really starting to work just before it pushed too far.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m going to try and use less and add some more water to the wash after my skin returns to normal.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>ONE BOTTLE TOP HAD POPPED OFF WITH JUST A LITTLE SPILLAGE, AND NO NEED TO RETURN.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for The One Cleanser that makes my face feel clean but not totally stripped bare.</li>
            <li>If you have super dry skin - I would not suggest this, however all the normal to oily skin types this would work well.  </li>
            <li>AND I AM WELL PLEASED WITH THE WAY IT CLEANS, REMOVES OLD DEAD SKIN AND LEAVES FACE WITH A GLOW.  </li>
            <li>But even better, things that I thought were scars, tiny broken blood vessels, even 2 things that looked like small warts, have all either cleared up entirely or greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This 6.7 ounce bottle of goodness has this unique formula that wakes up your face, brightens your skin, and within a week of using it, you start to notice that your pores are appearing smaller and smaller.</li>
            <li>One pump of this \\&quot;blue gold\\&quot; is enough to lather your face in a rich, bubbly lather and wash and wake-up your face.</li>
            <li>In a very short time I don&#x27;t see all those large pores on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old, Puerto Rican with extemely oily skin and it still dries me out...</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to try to get those pores smaller, but this really works.  </li>
            <li>AND THAT (TO ME) HELPS REMOVE THE OLD SKIN.  </li>
            <li>I had a great Dermatology doctor, and he told me in my twenties  to always wash your face with cold water as it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like hot water.</li>
            <li>Not to harsh, but just strong enough to get the job done on my 53 year old still oily skin.</li>
            <li>Due to the strong smell I wonder if during the winter it might dry out my skin, though?</li>
            <li>probably sound like an advertisement, but check out my other reviews and see that I write good and bad assessments.  </li>
            <li>Has corrected skin problems I&#x27;ve had my entire adult life!</li>
            <li>Musky, not due to herbs or natural components-- if this had terrific results it would be worth it, but no special results I can see.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really use this product for too long because it made my cheeks really red</li>
            <li>Still gentle on my skin, but I definitely notice a reduction in blackheads and overall smaller pore size after using this product!</li>
            <li>Finally, I found something at a reasonable price point that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and break the bank.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin</li>
            <li>I use it 2 or 3 times a day and it does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my other Neutrogena cleanser, one which never lets me down -- the fragrance free facial</li>
            <li>Cleansers\\&quot;, but not a single one stands up to Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Daily Cleanser.</li>
            <li>It helped a little, though not as much as I hoped.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really like this cleanser because my pores stay clean.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh smell and leaves my skin feeling very clean, but not dry at all, used twice daily.  </li>
            <li> natural oils on the skin is good keeps your face soft as you get older.</li>
            <li> Using daily and i love it.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my face feels more evenly toned and brightened.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Pores are smaller, face feels more toned, brightens my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does warn you about a higher risk of getting sun burn when using the product</li>
            <li> This product came in good time and works after a few wqshes.</li>
            <li> I suffer large pores thanks to heritage and got seduced into a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> your pores are large due to blackheads if you really want to see good results with this product you need to unclog your pores first, I would recommend using pore strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why pay more when products like this exist and are just as good as the expensive stuff?</li>
            <li> It also helps with my very oily skin; it cleanses better than regular soap and seems to prevent pimple breakouts.</li>
            <li> My husband who  had one large pore on his chin and was using this to get rid of it now has more large open pores all over his face</li>
            <li> He tends to have large pores that invite germs</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I have large pores which cannot take any type of cleansers without being clogged.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels to much smoother than before.  </li>
            <li> This face wash also works very well with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> Until this one, much of the product I tried was too drying, made my pinkish skin redder, and even broke me out.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> , it replenished mucho skin a lot, i have freakles and it looks so much clearer,</li>
            <li> I feel my face much hidrates, and defenitley pore very reduced.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser that does the trick.</li>
            <li> but this is a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> If you really want exfoliation in your cleanser try Aqua Glycolic shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I need something gentle just like this</li>
            <li> However, I believe it would work very well for someone who has oily skin.</li>
            <li> but I would just use it again some time in the winter when the sun isn&#x27;t out as much.</li>
            <li> Not only are my pores nearly invisible now, my skin looks toned, smooth and glowing!  </li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical to try, yet another, Neutrogena product, but now, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> I alternate with Cerave for a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li> I love neutrogena products and this one hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Im a new one month user, I will really but it again</li>
            <li> This left so many red blotches on my face, I ended up at the dermatologist!</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the smell and the feel, and I could tell it was really starting to work just before it pushed too far.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m going to try and use less and add some more water to the wash after my skin returns to normal.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ONE BOTTLE TOP HAD POPPED OFF WITH JUST A LITTLE SPILLAGE, AND NO NEED TO RETURN.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for The One Cleanser that makes my face feel clean but not totally stripped bare.</li>
            <li> If you have super dry skin - I would not suggest this, however all the normal to oily skin types this would work well.  </li>
            <li> AND I AM WELL PLEASED WITH THE WAY IT CLEANS, REMOVES OLD DEAD SKIN AND LEAVES FACE WITH A GLOW.  </li>
            <li> But even better, things that I thought were scars, tiny broken blood vessels, even 2 things that looked like small warts, have all either cleared up entirely or greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This 6.7 ounce bottle of goodness has this unique formula that wakes up your face, brightens your skin, and within a week of using it, you start to notice that your pores are appearing smaller and smaller.</li>
            <li> One pump of this \\&quot;blue gold\\&quot; is enough to lather your face in a rich, bubbly lather and wash and wake-up your face.</li>
            <li> In a very short time I don&#x27;t see all those large pores on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old, Puerto Rican with extemely oily skin and it still dries me out...</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to try to get those pores smaller, but this really works.  </li>
            <li> AND THAT (TO ME) HELPS REMOVE THE OLD SKIN.  </li>
            <li> I had a great Dermatology doctor, and he told me in my twenties  to always wash your face with cold water as it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like hot water.</li>
            <li> Not to harsh, but just strong enough to get the job done on my 53 year old still oily skin.</li>
            <li> Due to the strong smell I wonder if during the winter it might dry out my skin, though?</li>
            <li> probably sound like an advertisement, but check out my other reviews and see that I write good and bad assessments.  </li>
            <li> Has corrected skin problems I&#x27;ve had my entire adult life!</li>
            <li> Musky, not due to herbs or natural components-- if this had terrific results it would be worth it, but no special results I can see.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really use this product for too long because it made my cheeks really red</li>
            <li> Still gentle on my skin, but I definitely notice a reduction in blackheads and overall smaller pore size after using this product!</li>
            <li> Finally, I found something at a reasonable price point that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and break the bank.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin</li>
            <li> I use it 2 or 3 times a day and it does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my other Neutrogena cleanser, one which never lets me down -- the fragrance free facial</li>
            <li> Cleansers\\&quot;, but not a single one stands up to Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Daily Cleanser.</li>
            <li> It helped a little, though not as much as I hoped.</li>
            <li> In response to the overdrying, my skin became extremely oily which led to a major breakout.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few months, only noticeable difference was that my skin felt a little smoother, but large pores on nose look the same.  </li>
            <li> but i prefer not to only every other day.</li>
            <li> I found that this dried my skin a little too much.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena Cleanser bottle was not closed tightly, and it had leaked all over the box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my face so dry before except for maybe with a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Though I have a tendency towards dry skin.</li>
            <li> Left my face a little dry</li>
            <li> and I had a big mess when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I use it a little differently.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t happen overnight, it takes a few weeks to see big results.</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t wearing foundation, only a little blush!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Dont ever try to strip your face of your natural oils, not a good thing to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pore refining facial cleanser for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> When I first come upon this product I was skeptical that a cleanser could make a difference...</li>
            <li> Then I do my usual AM things such as brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, it must work for some people, just not me.</li>
            <li> There have been periods of nice skin, but there have also been period of skin so bad that I felt like the woman in one of those prescription acne medication commercials!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that packaging when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped in cellophane and the pump had been pushed down.</li>
            <li> At half a pump per face wash</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed, considering I&#x27;m a huge Neutrogena user.</li>
            <li> It did have plastic wrap around it, but it had leaked through the plastic making a mess and wasting product.</li>
            <li> I first just wash my face with cold water, and use the pore refiner on those areas.  </li>
            <li> A little drying</li>
            <li> We all have different skin types, and this neutrogena product had a very negative effect on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> BEEN USING IT A FEW DAYS</li>
            <li> I just wanted to let people know that it really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference in my skin after a few days of using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product for me because it dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but I have found that it does actually help reduce my pore size.  </li>
            <li> However, I still break out and I can see enlarged pores, marks and bumps on my face from the past.  </li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong; I&#x27;m not saying this stuff cures the things I&#x27;ve listed here, but it vastly improved what I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> and it cleans my face without drying it out, at least in these spring &amp; summer months.</li>
            <li> It injured the sides of my nose, like a cold might, and it was horribly red and worn where I rest my glasses.</li>
            <li> Yes, I guess I&#x27;m somewhat shallow.  </li>
            <li> and I think my enlarged pores have decreased slightly but not as dramatic as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It was broken and the bottle doesn&#x27;t work properly:(</li>
            <li> Not over drying, but also not great for removing makeup.  </li>
            <li> no thanks :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> too bad.</li>
            <li> Dries my skin out so bad...</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it as it may have gone bad for whatever reason and may be unsafe to use.</li>
            <li> Package was in disgusting condition.</li>
            <li> I broke out terribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product.  It does not dry my skin and I think my pores are smaller.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Package was in disgusting condition. It was broken and the bottle doesn&#x27;t work properly:(</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of how big my pores are. I think this product did a good job at cleaning my face but not at reducing my pore size which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used so far, and so much cheaper than Dermalogica or Proactive</li>
            <li> I have been using this pore refining facial cleanser for the past two years.  Finally, I found something at a reasonable price point that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and break the bank.  In just under two weeks of using this product I noticed an improvement in my skins texture. My skin looks and feels to much smoother than before.  This face wash also works very well with my Clarisonic.  I have purchased a gamut of brands. Some of the product from the higher end counters worked great but I couldn&#x27;t justify the pricing.  Until this one, much of the product I tried was too drying, made my pinkish skin redder, and even broke me out. Combined with my Mia2 this has been a life saver.  For me, the alpha and beta hydroxy does the trick for my aging skin.  I will continue to purchase this product.  At half a pump per face wash this is the most cost effective cleanser I have found.</li>
            <li> Pores are visibly smaller</li>
            <li> Does the trick. Not to harsh, but just strong enough to get the job done on my 53 year old still oily skin. I use it every day, both in the shower and with my ClariSonic. Great value too. Why pay more when products like this exist and are just as good as the expensive stuff?</li>
            <li> I tried using this product in hopes that it would do as it says and help shrink the pores on my face. It helped a little, though not as much as I hoped. Also, after only a couple of uses, I started getting acne all over, which I haven&#x27;t had in many years! Going to have to try a different product next time, I guess...</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after using this product.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Okay I have suffered from elephant size pores for years, primarily because of blackheads. When I first come upon this product I was skeptical that a cleanser could make a difference... well let me tell you after just one use that skepticism vanished. You can actually feel this product tightening your skin, my complication has not look this good in years. I wish I had taken a before and after picture so you could see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For better results:&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me your pores are large due to blackheads if you really want to see good results with this product you need to unclog your pores first, I would recommend using pore strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Instant results&lt;br /&gt;* Works great to reduce the occurrence of blackheads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Drys skin out after continued use for about 3 or 4 days  (However, continue to use and the dryness will go away after a week) You can use a oil free moisturizer to help. I recommend Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel-cream For Normal/Combo Skin if you have oily skin</li>
            <li> This product really works. I love neutrogena products and this one hasn&#x27;t let me down. After one use, I noticed the immediate difference. This will remain on my short list going forward.</li>
            <li> This product works well amongst all Neutrogena&#x27;s options.  If you have super dry skin - I would not suggest this, however all the normal to oily skin types this would work well.  My husband even loves it.  He tends to have large pores that invite germs and I think this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong scent. Musky, not due to herbs or natural components-- if this had terrific results it would be worth it, but no special results I can see. I&#x27;m putting up with it because I don&#x27;t want to lay out more money to buy another kind and it cleans my face without drying it out, at least in these spring &amp; summer months. Due to the strong smell I wonder if during the winter it might dry out my skin, though? I hope to have it used up by then.</li>
            <li> Left my face a little dry</li>
            <li> Great to use.  Works great and I am glad I bought 2 bottles. I would buy this again.  The price was good, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and used it for awhile but the smell was too strong so i had to stop using it. After i stopped then i noticed the pores were way larger than before . I never had a pore issue before using ths product but now the pores on my nose and around the areas of my nose are obviously visible. My husband who  had one large pore on his chin and was using this to get rid of it now has more large open pores all over his face n this all happended after about three weeks of use, This product causes you to be dependent on it ones you start using it you have to keep buying it to to prevent the pores from getting obvious. Now my husband has some craters in his face as a result of this product..</li>
            <li> Nice face wash - seems to work well with my oily / combination skin.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> We all have different skin types, and this neutrogena product had a very negative effect on my complexion.  too bad.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on some of the reviews here at Amazon.  I was a little skeptical, but I have found that it does actually help reduce my pore size.  It also helps with my very oily skin; it cleanses better than regular soap and seems to prevent pimple breakouts.</li>
            <li> Dries my skin out so bad...I broke out terribly. Bummer...really wanted smaller pores Lol! I&#x27;m a 30 year old, Puerto Rican with extemely oily skin and it still dries me out...no thanks :(</li>
            <li> Using daily and i love it. Smells heavenly and is a great product. Does not leave any residue and DOES shrink your pores. My only complaint is that packaging when it arrived. It was wrapped in cellophane and the pump had been pushed down. It had leaked EVERYWHERE so I didn&#x27;t get the full amount that should have been in the bottle and I had a big mess when I opened it. Luckily since its soap, it cleaned up easily :) I suggest better packaging when shipping. but other than that its a great product so don&#x27;t let packaging deter you.</li>
            <li> Reduces pores as it says, and leaves face looking really nice. I have very very olily skin which is good. natural oils on the skin is good keeps your face soft as you get older. Dont ever try to strip your face of your natural oils, not a good thing to do. But this you can use it one day yes one day no. To protect your skin. Enjoy. Well  you can use it every day. but i prefer not to only every other day.</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash. I’ve always had acne-prone skin, but since going off hormonal birth control, my face has been a disaster. There have been periods of nice skin, but there have also been period of skin so bad that I felt like the woman in one of those prescription acne medication commercials! After trying tons of different acne face washes to no avail, I gave up and went back to my regular glycerin soap. I saw a segment on The Today Show about caring for your skin in different decades, and this wash was highlighted. As a last resort, I decided to give it a whirl and I am so happy that I did. My skin has done a 180! My pores are smaller and my face feels more evenly toned and brightened. It also smells delicious and is not too drying. I’ve been recommending it to anyone who will listen!</li>
            <li> I like the product, BUT . . .&lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena Cleanser bottle was not closed tightly, and it had leaked all over the box.  It did have plastic wrap around it, but it had leaked through the plastic making a mess and wasting product.</li>
            <li> This did not shrink my pores as advertised, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> The package was smashed in because it was too big. When I opened it most of it was spilled because it was opened. I did not use it,  because it was opened</li>
            <li> This is a nice face wash, it makes my skin feel great. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve noticed any reduction in the size of my pores. Ehh....</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute best for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and still do, even now while in my late 50&#x27;s. This has been a blessing in that I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles and still get compliments on my skin now and then.  However, I still break out and I can see enlarged pores, marks and bumps on my face from the past.  I just accepted this as part of aging; kind of battle scars in the war against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used Neutrogena products for years and being happy with them, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did - I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it has made!  It does an amazing job of cleaning out your pores, which is what allows them to shrink (can&#x27;t very well shrink if there&#x27;s gunk in them).  But even better, things that I thought were scars, tiny broken blood vessels, even 2 things that looked like small warts, have all either cleared up entirely or greatly improved.  (My dermatologist told me the 2 \\&quot;warts\\&quot; were actually especially enlarged pores, but she didn&#x27;t say anything could be done, so I thought I was stuck with them.)  Now don&#x27;t get me wrong; I&#x27;m not saying this stuff cures the things I&#x27;ve listed here, but it vastly improved what I *thought* were the aforementioned afflictions.  It turns out that these things were actually the result of clogged pores, even though I&#x27;d had some of them for years.  Not only are my pores nearly invisible now, my skin looks toned, smooth and glowing!  And get this; my friend asked me what new foundation I was wearing - she thought it was wonderful.  But I wasn&#x27;t wearing foundation, only a little blush!  Honestly, my skin looks years younger - better than it has since I was a child!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably sound like an advertisement, but check out my other reviews and see that I write good and bad assessments.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this, and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with it!  Yes, I guess I&#x27;m somewhat shallow.  ;-)</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores on my nose and chin. I use it a little differently. I first just wash my face with cold water, and use the pore refiner on those areas.  Then I do my usual AM things such as brushing my teeth. Then I go back and rinse the Pore Refiner off, and follow it up with the RocC discs.  In a very short time I don&#x27;t see all those large pores on my chin and nose. I have tried everything to try to get those pores smaller, but this really works.  I had a great Dermatology doctor, and he told me in my twenties  to always wash your face with cold water as it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like hot water. He studied at Oxford, and told me many tricks of the trade that we do not use in the USA.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good, see a little difference in pore size but I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll need to use it a bit longer to see more of a difference.</li>
            <li> I started using this cleanser after first trying out the Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner, which I absolutely LOVE.  The toner cleared up some blackheads within 2 weeks, using nightly.  So, I tried the cleanser and love it as well. Nice fresh smell and leaves my skin feeling very clean, but not dry at all, used twice daily.  I have very oily skin and works great for me.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING IT A FEW DAYS (BECAUSE I BOUGHT ONE BRFORE SHIPMENT) AND I AM WELL PLEASED WITH THE WAY IT CLEANS, REMOVES OLD DEAD SKIN AND LEAVES FACE WITH A GLOW.  I RINSE MY FACE IN WARM WATER AND THAT (TO ME) HELPS REMOVE THE OLD SKIN.  SMELLS REAL CLEAN.  SATISFIED THUS FAR!.  ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH PKG. ONE BOTTLE TOP HAD POPPED OFF WITH JUST A LITTLE SPILLAGE, AND NO NEED TO RETURN.  HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICE PORE REDUCTION YET, GUESS IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.</li>
            <li> This left so many red blotches on my face, I ended up at the dermatologist!</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed, considering I&#x27;m a huge Neutrogena user. But after a month, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin or pores. I went back to my other Neutrogena cleanser, one which never lets me down -- the fragrance free facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BMI628?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face soap.  The make up counter ladies have stopped commenting on my pore size and asking if I exfoliate!</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few months, only noticeable difference was that my skin felt a little smoother, but large pores on nose look the same.  I use this every night, but I still get lots of white heads.  Now the cleanser is the consistency of water....so I stopped using it as it may have gone bad for whatever reason and may be unsafe to use.</li>
            <li> It cleans fine- in fact, I&#x27;d say it over-cleanses the skin because my face always feels parched afterwards.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my pores.  I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for The One Cleanser that makes my face feel clean but not totally stripped bare.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cleanser because I needed a facial cleanser that I could use in the shower or at the sink. It&#x27;s great and love what it does for my skin! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Nutshell Review: Love! Pores are smaller, face feels more toned, brightens my face!&lt;br /&gt;In-Depth Review: Wow! I&#x27;ve tried many, many, MANY \\&quot;Pore Refiner Face Cleansers\\&quot;, but not a single one stands up to Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Daily Cleanser. At first, I was skeptical to try, yet another, Neutrogena product, but now, I&#x27;m sure glad I did. This 6.7 ounce bottle of goodness has this unique formula that wakes up your face, brightens your skin, and within a week of using it, you start to notice that your pores are appearing smaller and smaller. I&#x27;ve tried numerous salicylic acid treatments, but the oxygen in this formula works the best. One pump of this \\&quot;blue gold\\&quot; is enough to lather your face in a rich, bubbly lather and wash and wake-up your face. I&#x27;ve noticed hot water works best, because your pores open up better, but also because this lather just feels like it penetrates into your skin, leaving it softer, smoother, more refined, more luminous than it would with cold water. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> Im a new one month user, I will really but it again, it replenished mucho skin a lot, i have freakles and it looks so much clearer, I feel my face much hidrates, and defenitley pore very reduced. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this profuct</li>
            <li> I just wanted to let people know that it really dried out my skin. I have an oily nose so that wasn&#x27;t bothered, but my cheeks and sides of my nose were affected. I&#x27;ve never had my face so dry before except for maybe with a sunburn. It injured the sides of my nose, like a cold might, and it was horribly red and worn where I rest my glasses. However, I&#x27;m going to try and use less and add some more water to the wash after my skin returns to normal. I do enjoy the smell and the feel, and I could tell it was really starting to work just before it pushed too far.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, pores after weeks are smaller, highly  recommended it works for me. Get it!</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser that does the trick. I notice a difference in my skin after a few days of using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I alternate with Cerave for a deeper clean.  Still gentle on my skin, but I definitely notice a reduction in blackheads and overall smaller pore size after using this product! The results are similar to that achieved with La Roche-Posay, for 1/4 of the price.</li>
            <li> I do not have this! I have the toner! A little drying but I cut back on the amount I use now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not enough aha or bha to do any good but this is a gentle cleanser.  Not over drying, but also not great for removing makeup.  I called Neutrogena to find out if the percentages of AHA &amp; BHA  but they said they didn&#x27;t know.  Not impressed.  If you really want exfoliation in your cleanser try Aqua Glycolic shampoo.  Makes a great body &amp; face wash.</li>
            <li> This product makes the texture of my skin more smooth but for some reason it also gives me pimples.  I know because I have used it 3-4 times and as soon as I switch back to soap my face clears up.</li>
            <li> It seems good, time will really tell. It is more sudsy than I thought it would be, but you feel clean.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, reduces pores, cheap as subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for my face.  I need something gentle just like this</li>
            <li> Well maybe I should give this 5 stars.  I&#x27;m not sure.  I don&#x27;t like this product for me because it dried out my skin.  However, I believe it would work very well for someone who has oily skin.</li>
            <li> I found that this dried my skin a little too much.  Though I have a tendency towards dry skin.</li>
            <li> nice product... cleans the oily skin... the pores seems tighter</li>
            <li> This is an assist to my Olay products. Very Good!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, and very gentle on your face.  This product foams up well and rinses off easily, as well as having a light fragrance.  It tightens pores and leaves your face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> seems to be working well, in combo with clinique astringent (sp)</li>
            <li> This product came in good time and works after a few wqshes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really use this product for too long because it made my cheeks really red and I noticed some scabs on my face as well. The product does warn you about a higher risk of getting sun burn when using the product but I would just use it again some time in the winter when the sun isn&#x27;t out as much.</li>
            <li> I have large pores which cannot take any type of cleansers without being clogged. I have somewhat oily skin so I have to blot my skin through the day. I really like this cleanser because my pores stay clean.</li>
            <li> Tried every product under the sun. Nothing comes close to this. And for the cheap price, it&#x27;s amazing! I would recommend anyone looking for minimizing pores and clearing skin get this.</li>
            <li> It is definitely better every week.  Using it for 2 weeks now and my larger pores are 50% gone.  Try it...</li>
            <li> This works great to clense and tone my face. I use this in connection with Neutrogena Pore refining toner and it works amazingly well. A little goes a long way. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 or 3 times a day and it does not dry my skin.  I have an oily face, and I did not have any allergic reaction.  I love the smell,and the price.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product stripped it of all oil.  In response to the overdrying, my skin became extremely oily which led to a major breakout.</li>
            <li> Ive used for a couple of weeks and I think my enlarged pores have decreased slightly but not as dramatic as I had hoped. Will continue to use</li>
            <li> Has corrected skin problems I&#x27;ve had my entire adult life! Didn&#x27;t happen overnight, it takes a few weeks to see big results. Leaves skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything different after using this product verses using Aveno face soap.  I&#x27;m just giving it 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do for me what it claimed it would.  As a face soap it works fine.  Based on other reviews, it must work for some people, just not me.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a commercial!  I suffer large pores thanks to heritage and got seduced into a quick fix.  I have not used a skin cleanser this drying in a ling time.  If I wanted something this drying, I would just use a bar of soap.  Will use the rest to wash hands...</li>
