            <li> Long lasting and smells like lilacs!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, long lasting soap, but a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> And it is expensive, but if you are a lilac fragrance lover as I am I dont mind a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> The scent is not very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I intend to try other scents in this brand.</li>
            <li> when its laid in the soap dish, it really sticks down hard to the dish, it  pulls up hard, or did for me at least, as after showering i laid in in the soap holder build into the shower tub wall.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of my grandmothers lilac bush when I was little.  </li>
            <li> I was in the mood to buy a small indulgence</li>
            <li> Only one bad thing</li>
            <li> and I had to try it because I was feeling nostalgic (and maybe a little drunk).</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me start off by saying two things: This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written and I&#x27;m not the type of guy who buys fancy soap, let alone one this pricey. That said, I really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up out in the country and we had a lilac tree out in front of our house. I wasn&#x27;t even looking to buy soap, but the lilac caught my eye and I had to try it because I was feeling nostalgic (and maybe a little drunk). This smells just like that beautiful tree from my childhood. Not fake, cloying lilac perfume. Real lilac. If you&#x27;re worried about the money, the soap seems like it will last for a long time and it doubles as a bathroom air freshener. Just buy it already.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Just love that lilac smell.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely hard milled bar of soap with just the right aroma.  It&#x27;s a perfect lilac.  I&#x27;m not use to paying what the cost of the soap is, but it is a good size bar.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves the whole bath with the scent of lilac, which I love. This soap is pricey, but if you believe in &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; , it applies to Mistral soap. I have tried many brands at specialty stores and online, and Mistral is the best quality.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift and it was well received.  I cannot comment to its quality as a soap, but the fragrance is excellent.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, long lasting soap, but a little bit expensive. If you like lilac smell this smell the closest to the real thing. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I relocated to a part of the country where lilac bushes don&#x27;t grow very&lt;br /&gt;well so I thought I would buy this soap as a reminder of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much that I am not going to use it, just keep it as an air freshener as&lt;br /&gt;it smells exactly like a lilac garden.</li>
            <li> Soap has the fresh lilac spring smell I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap, nice fragrance. Was not quite as long lasting as I would have hoped, but I liked the product.</li>
            <li> The scent is not very pleasing.  The soap itself is OK.</li>
            <li> simply amazing....if you like...essence...and aroma....plus the skin...everything is excellent about this soap.whoever said.something bad..is simply crazy....buy over and over again and again</li>
            <li> very nice... leaves skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> Not the same mistral soap. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love Mistral soap and Lilac, so this combination is wonderful. It actually makes the whole bathroom smell good. You don&#x27;t even need air freshner in the bathroom with these.</li>
            <li> The lilac fragrance was lovely, but lost strength after a couple of days. My great frustration was with the size: the bar is too large to hold onto &amp; use easily in the shower &amp; I often dropped it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is absolutely wonderful! Had to buy one for myself, too; put it in my armoir and get a breath of Spring each time I open the doors!</li>
            <li> Love it.Smell is subtle and wonderful</li>
            <li> This review is from someone who never paid more than $3 for a bar of soap,, but this soap is worth the $8 because the bathroom smells so good .  It&#x27;s a BIG bar of lilacs!</li>
            <li> Long lasting and smells like lilacs!</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of lilacs, you will also love this soap.  It is so creamy on your skin.  No drying or itching feeling like some bar soap. LOVE, love, love this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is creamy and smells exactly like fresh lilacs.  My husband surprised me with it and I am so glad he did.  Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I was in the mood to buy a small indulgence so I tried this. I have never used these soaps before. I was pleasantly surprised by the fragrance and the quality. I like the smell of lilacs and this soap smells very natural. The scent is strong and you can smell it even through the original packaging and on your skin after using it. It is a large bar and seems very dense which means it will last a long time. It lathers nicely. I intend to try other scents in this brand. They also make scents designed with men in mind. This soap is made in France as are many fine soaps. Some people say they just put this soap in there dresser to scent their clothing before they get around to using it, so they buy several bars at a time. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Mistral for your excellent service</li>
            <li> I love this lilac bar of soap, as it smells just like lilac from growing wild. Its sudsy also and does leave my skin moist &amp; silky. Only one bad thing when its laid in the soap dish, it really sticks down hard to the dish, it  pulls up hard, or did for me at least, as after showering i laid in in the soap holder build into the shower tub wall. And it is expensive, but if you are a lilac fragrance lover as I am I dont mind a few dollars more. But if it was cheaper I would buy more, but I use this bar sparingly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling soap.  This reminds me of my grandmothers lilac bush when I was little.  The smell is almost exactly the same.  Brings back good memories.  I&#x27;d bet these bars of soap would be wonderful in a drawer just like a sachet.  Very pleased.  Extremely fast shipping.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells!  Makes my hands super soft.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Always looking for that better soap.  This one is very good and long lasting.  Skin is not dried out once off skin.</li>
