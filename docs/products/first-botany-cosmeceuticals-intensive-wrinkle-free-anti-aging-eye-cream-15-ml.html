            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>so I really appreciate the discount I got for doing this review</li>
            <li>It arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, has left the area around my eyes soft and over time I will be able to assess any improvement in  lines.</li>
            <li>then I ever learned in college, but they are on to something that you will begin to see more of in other brands and products.  </li>

            <li>The cream is lightly scented and is easily applied without a thick or greasy residue.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s highly moisturizing, is unscented</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not that she really need it because she&#x27;s still young 24 years old, so I don&#x27;t really think she need all this anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li>I will gladly be your test subject!  </li>
            <li>Very pale skin who can get a good- great tan only after months of carefully monitoring and moving from high SPF all the way down to an occasional day of sun exposure with just *MauiBabe lotion.</li>
            <li>I am very conscious about  my skin&#x27;s health even though I should have been sooner.</li>
            <li>I received the First botany Intensive Eye wrinkle cream and have tried using it for several days.</li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to say what long term effects might be but it does feel nice and seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Product for review: I like this product to far.</li>
            <li>I am a mom of 2 kids who love to sleep late on vacation.</li>
            <li>im young</li>
            <li>So far she is loving this product specifically for her eye as she has been constantly complaining about her eye bugs that she gets by sleeping late because of work.</li>
            <li>In cosmetic formulations, it acts in multiple levels (fast penetration, instant skin volume, muscular relaxation, cellular detoxification) to impart Botox®-like effect.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>- It contains a high concentration of GLA (Gamma Linolenic Acid), combats inflammation and restores moisture to dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have always had issues with dark circles under my eyes and as I have grown older</li>

            <li> Very pale skin who can get a good- great tan only after months of carefully monitoring and moving from high SPF all the way down to an occasional day of sun exposure with just *MauiBabe lotion.</li>

            <li> I received the First botany Intensive Eye wrinkle cream and have tried using it for several days.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to say what long term effects might be but it does feel nice and seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Product for review: I like this product to far.</li>
            <li> I am a mom of 2 kids who love to sleep late on vacation.</li>
            <li> im young</li>
            <li> So far she is loving this product specifically for her eye as she has been constantly complaining about her eye bugs that she gets by sleeping late because of work.</li>
            <li> In cosmetic formulations, it acts in multiple levels (fast penetration, instant skin volume, muscular relaxation, cellular detoxification) to impart Botox®-like effect.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> - It contains a high concentration of GLA (Gamma Linolenic Acid), combats inflammation and restores moisture to dry skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have always had issues with dark circles under my eyes and as I have grown older</li>
            <li> and she is very pleased--she&#x27;s been using it as directed less than a week and says she notices the difference!</li>
            <li> it is a cold feeling once applied, i love it because that&#x27;s what i need after work.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this product and look foward to seeing the long term effects of usage!</li>
            <li> I did see that tbose dry patches have gone away without making my eyelids greasy.</li>
            <li> a lot, a little o&#x3D;goes a long way, the only issue I have is the consistency</li>
            <li> the highest GLA (Gamma Linolenic Acid) concentration, which helps to increase cell resilience and moistens the fatty layer beneath the skin in this anti wrinkle eye cream Borage Oil, along with other botanicals and ChroNOlineTM delivers a multitude of beauty benefits such as aiding collagen loss, soothing dry, scaly skin and combating the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough not to have a lot of wrinkles yet, however, I do have horrible dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep/too much work!  </li>

            <li> A little goes</li>

            <li> I am 36 years old and have a terrible time getting proper sleep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and your skin immediately drinks it in.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was given this at reduced cost for my unbiased opinion and it seems good. It is a good consistency, smells fine, is easy to apply and is a good sized bottle for long time use. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, has left the area around my eyes soft and over time I will be able to assess any improvement in  lines. It definitely feels like it looks better and I&#x27;m enjoying using it more than one I bought recently by another brand that made me itch, so definite improvement there. Looking forward to seeing results!</li>
            <li> When I was offered this at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion I jumped at the opportunity. I am beginning to show the signs of aging already and will do anything to prevent it. First Botany cream is dispensed in a nice 15 ml bottle with a pump applicator. The cream is lightly scented and is easily applied without a thick or greasy residue. I have sensitive skin and this did not give me any reaction at all. I chose to use it twice a day and can already see some signs of it working with reduced wrinkles, and  puffiness of the eye area. I am a fan of this product and look foward to seeing the long term effects of usage!</li>
            <li> I like the pump bottles better than the jars you keep putting your fingers in. So this First Botany eye cream does have a pump dispenser. Yay! I just started using this cream &amp; you sure don&#x27;t need too much! 1/2 pump if you can manage that. I detected no smell &amp; no tingling or burning. This cream does have some new-to-me ingredients &amp; I like trying something different. I have just used for a few nights so I can&#x27;t claim miracles but just the fact that I am doing something is a plus to me!  My skin under my eyes feels firms to me &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to see if I have other good results. I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
            <li> *Disclaimer - I received these at a promotional price.  Very nice consistency.  Feels great when you put it on and keeps your skin moisturized all day.  I have not had it long enough to say what long term effects might be but it does feel nice and seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to try this to see if it would help with dark circles under my eyes and they did lighten up. I think if I used it more they would have gone away. But I am to lazy to put things on everyday. Plus I used it around my mouth as there is small lines and they did go away. I liked that it does not irritate my skin. Plus it is not greasy. It stays on even when sweating. I would purchase it again and also give it as a gift. Fine Lines and wrinkles do become lighter when used.</li>
            <li> I love First Botany anti-aging eye cream because its very important to me to keep my face looking as youthful as possible. I like to put this cream around my eyes at night to avoid getting crows feet and dark circles. First botany is a product thats cruelty free and made in America which i LOVE! I have been sensitive to some eye creams in the past but this one does not irritate my eyes or have any icky scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great product so far.  It has a lotion texture to it and is very nice under my eyes.  I have noticed some lightening of the dark circles under my eyes already.  I received this at a promotional price because something else that I bought from them arrived broken.  Their customer service is exceptional.  I am 40 years old and just starting to notice the fine line and crapy look by my eyes and I am hoping with extended use this will help to take that away.  It has soften the skin already.  One of my favorite things is soft skin.</li>
            <li> I love It. It works well on my eye fine lines, I cannot avoid stress from work, family, friends but i am sure i can do something about it with the help of First Botany Cosmeceuticals Intensive wrinkle. I received the product on a discount price in exchange of my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing face on warm water, toner, then i use anti aging eye cream of first botany to get rid or at-least eliminate some lines and puffy eyes due to lack of sleep and stress. I am applying it under my make up without any clog pores or an even make up problems. it is a cold feeling once applied, i love it because that&#x27;s what i need after work. at-least to help my eyes relax after huge hours in-front computers, toxic fumes of cars on traffic lights, sunlight when walking for lunch. It works great on my fines and puffy eyes. keeps me going for another day, It doesn&#x27;t have any distinctive nor foul smell and it is opaque white cream. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle that this comes in is pure genius, it makes the application so very easy. This product is light and gets absorbed very quickly. I have been using this for a few days and I do feel that I am seeing a difference in the skin around my eyes. Make sure that you just tap when applying and use your ring finger because that is your weakest finger and will not tap with too much pressure. I love the fact that this is &amp;#34;Made in America&amp;#34; (Yea!!!) Also Cruelty Free and not tested on animals. Go First Botany Cosmeceuticals!!! I have received this product with a very generous discount in order to test and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This product works great on fine lines around the eyes! I got it for my mother to try out and she is very pleased--she&#x27;s been using it as directed less than a week and says she notices the difference!</li>
            <li> I am a male in his 30&#x27;s. Very pale skin who can get a good- great tan only after months of carefully monitoring and moving from high SPF all the way down to an occasional day of sun exposure with just *MauiBabe lotion. I am brown by the end of the summer. I believe most people can generate pigment it just takes the right messages to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, being of that philosophy and putting it to the test having lived in Hawaii and  places with a lot of sun, I have quickly acquired leathery crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various night creams and this is tuff is the only thing that has worked to show noticeable results. No, it does not clear my skin completely or even 50% better. I would make it between 15-25% better which is the most I have seen any product do. I use before I go out in the morning and before bed. I no longer tan. I am very conscious about  my skin&#x27;s health even though I should have been sooner. I would recommend this to anyone ages 27 and up.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this eye cream a week, but have noticed the skin around my eyes looks tighter and firmer. I have used many high priced creams, and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Great product here! I am 36 years old and have a terrible time getting proper sleep so my eyes look horrible almost all the time. I started using this product to help combat that. It has helped some I can tell a difference in the past few days now. I like it and love that it is not tested on animals a big plus for me. My skin tends to break out to everything and has not done so with this product. It feels great going on absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. I was sent this product free to review and gave an honest fair review on it. I would recommend this product to my friends and family anyday!</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in a week with fine lines and crows feet around the eyes and is not irritating at all. I love it!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. My skin feels very smooth and the lines on my face appear finer. My pores appear smaller and my skin just feels tighter. It doesn&#x27;t have an invasive smell. It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. It absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My best friend is loving this product that I gave to her as a birthday gift. She said that she has noticed an immediate difference in the appearance of her fine lines. She doesn&#x27;t know it but I&#x27;m going to purchase this product again for her! 😀</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my First Botany Cosumetic Anti-Aging Eye Cream. It&#x27;s helped my fine lines around my eyes somewhat disappear.  I even enjoyed that the product is not tested on animals and since I&#x27;m trying to watch what I use based on that, this made me even happier about the First Botany products! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and have even ordered my mom one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I received the First botany Intensive Eye wrinkle cream and have tried using it for several days. I like the plumping results it gives the area around my eyes. I enjoy the consistency of the product and the moisture. I liked this eye cream very much. The fragrance is light and did not break my face out like some fragrances can. I am going to continue to use it and hope that I continue to see results.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality eye cream. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and your skin immediately drinks it in. I find it amazing how it plumps up your wrinkles as they simply disappear. I also use it on the wrinkles above my lips and on my lips. It&#x27;s highly moisturizing, is unscented which I really like and the pump works great. I received it at a reduced price to try and test as a consumer for review purposes. As a top reviewer, I&#x27;ve tried many brands of eye cream and gels and this is by far my favorite to date. I know it&#x27;s a bit more pricey than the others but if you purchase it, prepare to be amazed. I love that it&#x27;s made in the USA. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Product for review: I like this product to far. It has helped with the bags under my eyes and the dark circles. I have used this product for about a week. I cannot wait to see what this product will assist with in the weeks to come. I would recommend this product and company if you are looking for an anti-aging cream. This product also does not leave a gross residue on your hands which is also great.</li>
            <li> First Botany Cosmeceuticals INTENSIVE WRINKLE FREE ANTI AGING EYE CREAM with Argireline® , Fiflow® and other potent anti-wrinkle peptides, 15 ml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A SWORN ON PRODUCT BY MY WIFE , SHE LOVES IT AND NO QUESTIONS ASK , I THINK YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THAT !</li>
            <li> Luxury!!  I am in love with the LUXURY that continues to come out of First Botany Cosmeceuticals!!  I spend approximately 45 minutes every evening before bed cleansing my face two times, toners, multiple essences, effectors, wrinkle creams, and 100 other steps that I have adopted when I stumbled upon Korean Beauty.  I have included this into my beauty regime but in the morning.  It really helps to relieve the puffiness in the morning and smooths out the fine line and wrinkles.  If you take care of your skin, use this great product for your wrinkles, you won&#x27;t need makeup to cover up your flaws or Botox to fill your wrinkles. I know more about Botany and Stem Cells then I ever learned in college, but they are on to something that you will begin to see more of in other brands and products.  I am working now on the lines and wrinkles around my mouth to see if I can reduce fine line and wrinkles with this product since it works so well with my eyes.  I will keep you informed!  I will be following First Botany Cosmeceuticals very closely!  Hopefully they can develop a supplement. As for the Anti-Aging Eye Cream, it works like Michaelangelo!  I will gladly be your test subject!  I only need to find the edible list of youthfulness!</li>

            <li> I gave this a gift for a friend since i tried it myself. And we both love this product. I got mine last month and the one i recently pruchase is for a friend and she said that she is out of word the next morning. I love First Botany Product and i will surely buy again soon when i am out of this product. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with dark circles under my eyes and as I have grown older it&#x27;s just become worse with wrinkles also now. After applying this cream .. I instantly see a difference! It tightens and lightens .. I absolutely love it! I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough not to have a lot of wrinkles yet, however, I do have horrible dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep/too much work!  After a week of use, they have diminished significantly.  I&#x27;m sure with continued use, they&#x27;ll be gone entirely.  This product is also cruelty free!  It&#x27;s nice to find excellent quality products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals. :)</li>
            <li> I really like the product has reduced the bags under my eyes and the darkness and made the line 2 more file so I really appreciate the discount I got for doing this review</li>
            <li> I got this product because my eyes are looking very bad I am a mom of 2 kids who love to sleep late on vacation. You can imagine my restless eyes. This cream will help me keep my eyes wrinkle free from those sleepless nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it once I got it. There is no burning, no pain , no itching and does not irritate my eyes at all. I have wore it on the day and at night and even when I sweat no pain on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to see some results along with my drinking water and eating healthy. Will continue to use and sample this product can&#x27;t wait to see the final results.&lt;br /&gt;Also it smells good like a regular cream. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample, review and give you my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> My wife is so glad because I got this in exchanged for a product review. Not that she really need it because she&#x27;s still young 24 years old, so I don&#x27;t really think she need all this anti-aging cream. But you know what most women want to try new products they think that will make them look even better. So far she is loving this product specifically for her eye as she has been constantly complaining about her eye bugs that she gets by sleeping late because of work. I would recommend this for all the women out there.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so awesome. I received it as a free sample to review product,  all thoughts expressed are my own. I used it for the fine lines in the corner of my eyes, and it works like a dream. I love the texture of the cream. I even used it around my mouth to prevent laugh lines. The cream is very delicate on the skin so if you have sensitive skin, you have no worries. I love all of First Botany&#x27;s Creams and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint either. It doesn&#x27;t give directions about your forehead, but I put it on my stress line and I can tell a huge difference in how deep it looks. You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I got this product in review for a exchange. It arrived really fast. I do like this product a lot, a little o&#x3D;goes a long way, the only issue I have is the consistency, it is a little to thick for me when it dries and leaves a yellowish tint under my eyes that I have to wash off before applying makeup. It is great to use for before bed.</li>
            <li> I was able to receive this amazing product through AMZ review trader at an amazing price for an unbiased product review. I have tried another eye serum and it stayed so oily but this product is not like that. It is a cream and it absorbs so not oily feeling on skin at all. I could see a difference shortly after starting to use it. This is the only eye cream you need.</li>
            <li> I really loved this eye cream! Its extremely hydrating on my sentive eye area. The first time i tried it i even said &amp;#34;woah this is a fantastic!&amp;#34; i really makes my eye area extremely smooth, i have this problem where my eyelids get dehydrated and patchy which makes any make up look gross so i have to hydrate with a product containing hyaluronic acid. I did see that tbose dry patches have gone away without making my eyelids greasy. I let my mom try it and she said she noticed a slight tightning difference in her eyes in nusy a few days! Thats great to know. Even tho im young i want ro preserve my body as much as possible and i will continue to use this! Thank you for allowing mento review this product. I love it. These are my hinest opinions</li>
