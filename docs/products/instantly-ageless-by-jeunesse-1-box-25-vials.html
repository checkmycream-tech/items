            <li>/&gt;Thank you Jeunesse I will now be a fan for life :-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I loved it but after about 4 hours it started to wear off and my skin got flaky</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s not working too good.</li>
            <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this product as I thought it would probably be too good to be true, but I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li>but I am so excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t accept and requested a full refund.</li>
            <li>Worked so good i. Ordered a second box</li>
            <li>Looks good at a distance but close up it leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li>I laugh and tell my friends</li>
            <li>product is definitely worth every dime spent, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a more refreshing and brightful</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it quite right</li>
            <li>, this stuff worked exactly the way the video did, I am so happy, first because an actual product like this does indeed work and secondly no surgery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice idea but no real effect.  </li>
            <li>I look so much better especially in photos!</li>
            <li>ordered just two vials first to try before spending so much money on the whole box.  </li>
            <li>product did work , pretty amazing actually, but the white residue is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Amazon was fast also it came</li>
            <li>Then the thirty day guarantee haha</li>
            <li>so there is a very generous amount in each vial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Does not seem to live up to the hype, I &#x27;ve tried using it exactly as and i&#x27;ve looked on line for tips.</li>
            <li>I have been able to make mine last for 5 applications (under eyes only)</li>
            <li>I stay very active and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to every one.  </li>
            <li>My before and after picture looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li>As long as you use it on a clean, dry face.  </li>
            <li>I love looking younger everyday, once again!  </li>
            <li>The key is to not use to much and to stay emotionless until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>You have to use after you cleanse, moisturize and if you wear foundation you put it on after foundation ovation and the flu action has to be dry before applying.</li>

            <li> It dried my skin out</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did not last for the 9 hours mentioned in the video. It lasted maybe an hour</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to this product after seeing the demo video.&lt;br /&gt;The product that came was the consistency of a paste and left a white residue on my skin after it dried.&lt;br /&gt;The product did work , pretty amazing actually, but the white residue is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I requested a refund, got an email offering half the refund plus I would keep the product.  I didn&#x27;t accept and requested a full refund.</li>
            <li> Not as good as advertised.  Turns into a hard paste on skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I loved it but after about 4 hours it started to wear off and my skin got flaky</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff, got it for a girls weekend and had the most fun watching the &#x27;change&#x27; on our baggy eyes. Easy and works just like the videos!</li>
            <li> I thought they would be vials like I ordered before but instead they are paper so if you plan to use one vial more than once -you can&#x27;t. It gets dried out because there is no way to close it up.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s not working too good.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this product is a joke-bordering on a scam.</li>
            <li> Nice idea but no real effect.  Some residue developed maybe due to the fact I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  No real fountain of youth here.  LOL</li>
            <li> I have puffy under eyes and it is a family thing handed down to me, yay, I have tried everything known to mankind as I do not want to have surgery, this stuff worked exactly the way the video did, I am so happy, first because an actual product like this does indeed work and secondly no surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Jeunesse I will now be a fan for life :-)</li>
            <li> I have not purchased from this seller. I have from a distributer of the product and the picture shown here looks nothing like the ones I received from the company. The product I received is absolutley amazing. You have to use after you cleanse, moisturize and if you wear foundation you put it on after foundation ovation and the flu action has to be dry before applying. You only need very little of the product. Your eyes will de puff and lines will disappear before you. I absolutley can not live with out this product it&#x27;s like crack for you puffiness. I also use it on my for head. Love it! Oh you can also buy 50 vials for 75$ through the website.</li>
            <li> Thais stuff is awesome. The key is to not use to much and to stay emotionless until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> This product is great if used exactly as directed. No under eye circles and slight puffiness seems to disappear. I love it.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing!  As long as you use it on a clean, dry face.  Removes even the deepest of wrinkles and crease lines.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought it was going to be. It dried my skin out</li>
            <li> It totally worked just like they say. Worked so good i. Ordered a second box incase its hard to get again. Amazon was fast also it came quicked they i expected it to arrive.</li>
            <li> Works great but you have to let it dry before applying any make up and it must be powder make up only otherwise it will disappear and flake off.</li>
            <li> very disappointed didn&#x27;t do what it said it was going to do ,never again will I purchase from this company</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before I ordered. Same as I expected. Was packaged nice and all in tact. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> You can not wear makeup over this stuff since it is like glue on your face and you appear to be wearing a plastic mask.  USELESS WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have deep creases between my eyes that have always bothered me. I use this product and it fills them in instantly. I also use for puffiness under my eyes and it works just as well. I look so much better especially in photos! I laugh and tell my friends it&#x27;s like photoshop for your face! Love, love , love!</li>
            <li> Completely unhappy with product!!! Despite my skepticism of items like this I watched many videos on this product and purchased anyway just to assure myself to trust my gut instincts!! Then the thirty day guarantee haha they make returning difficult who has the time keep the money...Very Unhappy Customer</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all. Hard paste on face and still puffy.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderfully amazing...I love looking younger everyday, once again!  I&#x27;ve been using Instantly Ageless for two weeks now and I still can&#x27;t believe how it continues to diminish my lines and puffiness under my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product states that one vial will last 2 to 3 times.  I have been able to make mine last for 5 applications (under eyes only) so there is a very generous amount in each vial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth every dime spent, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a more refreshing and brightful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this product as I thought it would probably be too good to be true, but I was so wrong.  It actually works!</li>
            <li> After watching the video on facebook, I decided to try the product.  It does work.  As with any product like this, you have to realize this is not a permanent fix, however it continues tor work all day and I am a personal trainer.  I stay very active and I love it.  Will purchase it again.  thanks</li>
            <li> Does not seem to live up to the hype, I &#x27;ve tried using it exactly as and i&#x27;ve looked on line for tips.</li>
            <li> Sales@InstantlyAgelessukandeu.com</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it quite right so my eyes looked even</li>
            <li> Looks good at a distance but close up it leaves a white residue. Looks like you didn&#x27;t wash the sleep off your eyes n face. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> My before and after picture looked exactly the same. This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all! Hoping for a refund.</li>
            <li> Okay...I know there are a lot of people who are not pleased with this product....HOWEVER, I AM AMAZED AT HOW WELL THIS WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered just two vials first to try before spending so much money on the whole box.  Before I even used for a second day I was ordering the 25 vial (box).  This cream works just like they say it does and the incredible part...IT LAST 8-9 HOURS ON ME!  I know I&#x27;m using caps and exclamation marks but I am so excited about this product.  KUDO&#x27;s to the people who discovered this &amp;#34;Youthful&amp;#34; mixture for those of us who can&#x27;t afford BOTOX and are also too afraid to use BOTOX!  LOL  I highly recommend this to every one.  Oh, I&#x27;m 52 and use it under my eyes, my eye lids and a little around the corners of my eyes.</li>
