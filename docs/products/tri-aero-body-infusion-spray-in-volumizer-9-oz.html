            <li>I like it and does the trick for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Works well for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>was quick!</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair and want more body in it.</li>
            <li>No sticking feeling, no overpowering smell, effective and reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>but I like it so much that I am glad to be able to order this product.</li>
            <li>Did not add volume to my very fine straight hair</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li>But it does the job, and after a little hair spray you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair the right amount of volume and still feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job but unlike other products, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have any product in your hair!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to get too much</li>
            <li>The Aero Body Infusion gives my hair great body -- however this can seems to smell oddly!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dispense in your hand, it sprays directly on your hair as a fine mist.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my naturally curly and fine hair.</li>
            <li>Makes fine hair wispy and soft, does not volumize as described.</li>
            <li>Actually haven&#x27;t used the new one yet, but if it is the original product, I will love what it does for my hair roots.</li>
            <li>I love the Aerogel hairspray however this product falls short.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>this will definitely be your new favorite hair product to use in conjunction with the Tri Aerogel Spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years to &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; my short, fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Styled straight and curly.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very sticky feel to your hair and does not create body, and it made my scalp itch all day.  </li>
            <li>Tri Aero Body Infusion really adds fullness &amp; helps hold style.</li>
            <li>really does put volume in my hair, I use it with every shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is NOT the same product, it does not perform like the original \\&quot;Body</li>
            <li>I have fine, long hair.  </li>
            <li>The items came earlier than I expected and I am very pleased I ordered it,</li>
            <li>Good price, especially for not having to search it down at a salon</li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp gray hair,</li>
            <li>recommend it highly, use it all the time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A little sprayed on the roots before styling gives me more volume.</li>
            <li>IN ALL FAIRNESS HAVE TO SAY I HAVE EXTREMELY FINE HAIR BUT OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>The place where I had been purchasing it, locally, has closed and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li>This volumizer does give me volume and body and my hair seems to hold the style better than usual.</li>
            <li>The only product of this type that I have used since I first discovered it.</li>
            <li>Have used it for several years and still pleased with results compared to other products.</li>
            <li>Recently tried this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>This volumizer works on wet or dry hair to plump it up and make it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I almost  like it better used on dry hair, rather than wet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Could be old, don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>Consequently, you can never see how much you are actually getting, nor can you replicate that amount if it turns out well.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but I have relegated it to the back of the cabinet for now.</li>
            <li>I called the company directly because I used their product \\&quot;Body Infusion\\&quot; and could not locate it anywhere when I ran out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of hair sprays for my fine thin hair and this one hold very well without the dreaded &amp;#34;helmut hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It needs volumizing, but it has to be a light and dry product so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as my hair is very fine and goes limp with the least bit of humidity.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine, thin hair like me...</li>

            <li> This was a waste of my money.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the greatest styling product for baby fine hair.  You will never know that this is in your hair.  It&#x27;s not sticky or tacky, yet your hair will finally have the texture that you can work with and hold your style from morning til night.  I would give this 10 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product and I was so glad I found it on Amazon.  This way I could send it to my daughters as well.  It does a great job but unlike other products, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have any product in your hair!  The price here is good and delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> This is the best ,it give you hold without the weight. You can comb through you hair after spraying and drying.</li>
            <li> great stuff!! My hair loves it! makes it feel and style how ever i do it!  recommend it highly, use it all the time</li>
            <li> I like Tri Aero hair care products.  This spray-in volumizer can be applied on either wet or dry hair and does what it says, adds volume.  Not quite a gel, not quite a mousse and not exactly a hair spray either.  Anyone who struggles with fine hair will appreciate adding it to their hair routine. No sticking feeling, no overpowering smell, effective and reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Works great for volume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as my hair is very fine and goes limp with the least bit of humidity.  It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky.  I just spray it on my wet hair and style as usual.  Everytime I&#x27;ve tried another product, I ended up disappointed and came back to Tri Aero Body Infusion.  I just pray they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> As someone with very fine hair, this product performs magic!  It adds volume, holding power and bounce to otherwise lackluster hair.</li>
            <li> love it - have been looking for aproduct like this.</li>
            <li> Did not add volume to my very fine straight hair</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of hair sprays for my fine thin hair and this one hold very well without the dreaded &amp;#34;helmut hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that is not easy for me to work with.  This volumizer works on wet or dry hair to plump it up and make it more manageable.  I almost  like it better used on dry hair, rather than wet.  I spray it on, style my hair, and it stays styled better than with hair spray.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Aero Body Infusion gives my hair great body -- however this can seems to smell oddly!  Could be old, don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t remember a previous can smelling weird.  But it does the job, and after a little hair spray you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I have used the hairspray for several years and just found this volumizer. I have very fine straight hair and want more body in it. So I am constantly seeking the ideal solution. This volumizer does give me volume and body and my hair seems to hold the style better than usual. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is that it is impossible to tell how much you are using. It doesn&#x27;t dispense in your hand, it sprays directly on your hair as a fine mist. Consequently, you can never see how much you are actually getting, nor can you replicate that amount if it turns out well. So I just spray away and hope for the best. I do like it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great Product to add volume to your hair without drying it out.  This product sprays on which I find to work better to get the product evenly on your hair.</li>
            <li> Creates volume with shine and managability.That is all I can say! Why do you ask for more words! Geez Louise!</li>
            <li> I love their hairspray so I thought this stuff would have to be great too. It does nothing but make my hair sticky and weighed down. I&#x27;ve tried it on wet, damp, and dry hair. Styled straight and curly. No improvement. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money.  It leaves a very sticky feel to your hair and does not create body, and it made my scalp itch all day.  Don&#x27;t order this product!</li>
            <li> I have looked for a product like this for a long time. I have very fine, limp gray hair, Tri Aero Body Infusion really adds fullness &amp; helps hold style.</li>
            <li> Works great--gie sharie lots of volume</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. It does what it says it will do. A bit expensive but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Have used for a couple of years.  I find it helps better than other products although I have not found the perfect Volumizer.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. Get the It&#x27;s a Ten Volumizer. That works, this doesn&#x27;t and they won&#x27;t take it back, so learn from my mistake. Your Welcome.</li>
            <li> This is the best volume producing product I have ever found....and I&#x27;ve tried dozens!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product works great.  Gives my hair the right amount of volume and still feeling clean.  Diane</li>
            <li> Actually haven&#x27;t used the new one yet, but if it is the original product, I will love what it does for my hair roots.</li>
            <li> This product truly lives up to its claims and my expectations.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the at cost my hairdresser gets for me of the same product from her supplier.  I have used this for years and it is still a great product. Plus I have many allergies but am not allergic to this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my naturally curly and fine hair. Leaves it limp and flat. I have relatives who use it and love it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Hard to find these days at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have fine, long hair.  It needs volumizing, but it has to be a light and dry product so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  I bought the Tri Aerogel Hair spray at the same time I bought the volumizer.  I adore the hair spray, it is absolutely amazing for my hair type.  But the volumizer was too heavy for me.  The hair spray works so well, I use it as a volumizer as well as a setting spray.  After I purchased it, I realized my hairdresser used it.  She couldn&#x27;t say enough about the hair spray either.</li>
            <li> DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR SAME REASONS AS THE AEROGEL THEY HAVE... NO VOLUME FOR THIS VOLUMIZER AND MADE HAIR, VERY DULL..  IN ALL FAIRNESS HAVE TO SAY I HAVE EXTREMELY FINE HAIR BUT OTHER PRODUCTS THAT PROMISES VOLUME  WORKED MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> The Aero body Infusion was exactly what I wanted and I am happy with the item.  The items came earlier than I expected and I am very pleased I ordered it,</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this in the salon and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Plus it has a nice smell, not at all like a hairspray!</li>
            <li> Luv this stuff... Good price, especially for not having to search it down at a salon</li>
            <li> Initially would have given this a 5 star. Then after a month of use noticed my hair was falling out. Gave my chemistry &amp; hair coloring the benefit of the doubt as to the cause. Gave the product to my best girlfriend who has thick hair who also loved the product initially loved the product. After 2 months of use. Same things-- abundance of hair loss. No coincidence here.</li>
            <li> I love the Aerogel hairspray however this product falls short.  Makes fine hair wispy and soft, does not volumize as described.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on me, and I always leave the salon feeling like a princess.  Results were not so good when I used it.  It leaves my hair filmy, not soft.  Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but I have relegated it to the back of the cabinet for now.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair.  This product works for me.  A little sprayed on the roots before styling gives me more volume.</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizer that I have ever found for fine hair.  Adds volume and hold but does not weight hair down or make it greasy.  The only product of this type that I have used since I first discovered it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for some time and it has gotten hard to find.  I like it and does the trick for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works well for my fine hair.  Gives it body and lift without making it frizzy.  I use with Tri Aero hair spray.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  The place where I had been purchasing it, locally, has closed and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I have ever used for what it was intended.  I would buy it over and over again.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores but I like it so much that I am glad to be able to order this product.</li>
            <li> really does put volume in my hair, I use it with every shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; my short, fine, straight hair. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found (that&#x27;s still on the market) that works for me. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for fine hair.  Gives lots of body.  The only problem, sometimes the spray nozel gets clogged and it comes out in stream rather than a mist.  It is easy to get too much and then hair gets droopy.  But - if you get the right amount, you hair will look great!</li>
            <li> I called the company directly because I used their product \\&quot;Body Infusion\\&quot; and could not locate it anywhere when I ran out.  The company assured me that this product replaced what I used to use and is the same product only the packaging is different.  It is NOT the same product, it does not perform like the original \\&quot;Body Infusion\\&quot; that I was looking for and I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Best hair volumizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t make you hair heavy, just give lots of body&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for anyone with long or short hair</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve found.  Have used it for several years and still pleased with results compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Recently tried this product for the first time. Love Love Love It!! No more gels or mousses...just this product after washing. If you have fine, thin hair like me...this will definitely be your new favorite hair product to use in conjunction with the Tri Aerogel Spray. Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it. It also comes in a travel size.</li>
