            <li>I would suggest watching the YouTube video for best directions.</li>
            <li>This one is perfect...</li>
            <li>but I find that in order to be perfectly hairless, I have to probably use it every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>And the best part, no 5 o&#x27;clock stubble.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST beauty product I have ever bought.</li>

            <li>Like it says, don&#x27;t use on eyebrows because you will snag your lashes unless you figure some way to keep from doing it, like a patch on the side you&#x27;re working on lol.</li>

            <li>Worked great.  </li>

            <li>I dread using, but it works great.</li>
            <li>The R.E.M Spring worked great.  </li>
            <li>This will work great if you give it a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>

            <li>It worked so great</li>
            <li>The price is great for a product you know works, but a bit dear if it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>If you can get through the pain, it will be a great product for you.  </li>
            <li>Great price and</li>
            <li>I use this all over my face and its great.</li>
            <li>Great for moustache and chin hair - but have been scared to try it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>OMG.. Talk about a great product.   </li>
            <li>So - great product, but NOT painless.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for removing unwanted chin hair.</li>
            <li>is a tad embarrassing, but yes I do get chin hairs &amp; the spring works great on that area</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with mine.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the great reviews, but I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the pain.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it, it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Seemed like a great time saving idea.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so great about it.</li>
            <li>and have been mostly happy with the results.</li>
            <li>If you can tolerate the pain, this is a great tool.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>Thought this was a great idea</li>
            <li>So happy that I decided to get it because waxing was $12 a session</li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t do a great job with it.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with this</li>
            <li>it was great...</li>
            <li>This looked like a great product that didn&#x27;t need continuous maintenance or refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked at all the great reviews for this product</li>
            <li>Oh the joy of aging, but this is a problem at any age</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to use this more than once a week for maintenance, which is awesome!  </li>
            <li>I use this as I&#x27;m watching TV or a movie, so I&#x27;m nice and distracted!  </li>

            <li>Very happy customer :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not recommended for eyebrows, but i did use it successfully on the area between brows.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just awesome :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Removes hair perfectly, doesn&#x27;t hurt much and, the best, it takes a lot of time for the hair to grow again!</li>
            <li>Bought it for the heck of it but turned out to be one of those things that pleasantly surprise you.</li>
            <li>works great and feels very smooth!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing thing I have ever owned!!  </li>
            <li>REM spring is also wonderful because it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use, works great!</li>

            <li>any way i definetly recommend these product worth every penny.look beautiful and flawless</li>
            <li>Really impressed with how easy this is, as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The hair is gone and its so easy to use, you just have to find the best way to roll the spring over your skin.</li>
            <li>This works best on the fine hairs but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great product - easy to use, good price, does the trick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good touch-up product, and works</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>It works good in the mouth and chin region.</li>
            <li>(sigh of happiness).</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of this thing, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I did my homework on this gadget and it seemed to be good.</li>
            <li>Best for light hair removal needs.</li>
            <li>Off I went with my Spring, magnifying mirror, tweezers, and eye glasses to find hairless happiness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel a lot of pain to to be fair</li>
            <li>MY FACE IS VIRTUALLY HAIR FREE AND SMOOTH NOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li>and I loved her honesty</li>
            <li>good product, but stings and u just never use it again for some reason</li>
            <li>I have also researched electrolosis but found out that I wouldn&#x27;t be a good candidate because my hair is light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I just wanted to see good results, and I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I will be buying some for my sisters that tried it and loved the product as well.</li>
            <li>so I had a good idea of how to make it work.</li>
            <li>I bet with practice it would be good but couldn&#x27;t stick with it with the pain it induces</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I read about it in Oprah&#x27;s O Magazine and they loved it.</li>
            <li>It seems to remove finer or medium hairs, and that is good.  </li>
            <li>I do not often leave reviews, but I am so delighted by this product</li>
            <li>but if you have really good tweezers you can get them out.</li>
            <li>but he was impressed by how smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li>Great efficient hair remover made of durable steel with nice metal handles at end.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is good</li>
            <li>Will make a good companion for emergencies.</li>
            <li>The pricing is good for the product.</li>
            <li>Good bye nair which was burning my skin.</li>
            <li>A good tweezers does the job</li>
            <li>It will be a good alternative to paying to be waxed.  </li>
            <li>Good for getting a strand at a time.</li>
            <li>and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>just put some aloe on after and your good...</li>
            <li>it  does a good job of cleaning the unwanted hair from my face.  </li>
            <li>This seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li>Because it is all fair, I&#x27;ve not been a candidate for laser, etc.  and have used tweezers.  </li>
            <li>what good is it if it&#x27;s not going to work for me.</li>
            <li>good thing I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere,</li>
            <li>With chemicals being in the hair remover, I knew over time it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>It does take some practice, but once I got the hang of it, I was good.</li>
            <li>you know I am good to go.</li>
            <li>I think this is a really good product</li>
            <li>, I will jump on amazon and write a good review as soon as I use</li>
            <li>the manual, there is a good comment in there \\&quot;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing this item away after giving it a good try.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>So, i caught this on a good deal and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you waxers out there here is the good news:&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li>It does a good job on the &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of hair, like me, you are never going to find a product that will eliminate all the unwanted hair, but I think with continued practice, I can eliminate a good amount of it with this, and then wax the rest.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this based on the good reviews since I was hoping to find  something that would spare me the expense and hassle of getting to the salon.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product on groupon one day and actually laughed at it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t have good dexterity...</li>
            <li>my face feels so smooth and the best hairless!!!</li>
            <li>This is just so good</li>
            <li>You kind of have to get the hang of it, but once you do, it works great.</li>
            <li>I loved it and wish I had discovered this years ago.</li>
            <li>My favorite gift to sisters, cousins and good friends!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product - definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>This tool is very easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>It is great and really remove hair by the roots without breaking them out , but you have to be accustomed to using  it correctly to get the best result.</li>
            <li>There are still  a couple of spots where I just haven&#x27;t figured out the perfect contour, but overall this item has worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and effective!  </li>

            <li>I immediately wash my face and make sure to pat it with a very warm towel and set to work.</li>

            <li>Dont go by any of these reviews that say it is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This gadget is amazing.</li>
            <li>honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again if I were to lose it or something.</li>
            <li>and that really make me feel happy !!</li>
            <li>I found that if I bent the spring into a gentle shape and rolled both ends toward me, moving the spring up my cheek, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This does do a nice job.  </li>
            <li>and I pluck my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li>and now i&#x27;m nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure it hurts, but how can anyone think that pulling out hair would feel good.</li>
            <li>I have been waxing my own face: chin and \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; for years.</li>
            <li>You can use it in the privacy of your own home, ( I use it while watching television)  5.</li>
            <li>I had watched you tube videos after purchasing to try and get the hang of the motion needed for the spring to be effective.</li>
            <li>Like everyone says it really does take a while to figure out how it works best for you.</li>
            <li>it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>In fact, I am THRILLED</li>
            <li>I have waxed, used nair, and threaded my own face for years.  </li>
            <li>I kind of wish it was a drawstring bag</li>
            <li>I think it is the best invention since button up boots and so much cheaper than waxing.</li>
            <li>It kind of hurts</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of a wuss.</li>
            <li>It does work though which is nice and</li>
            <li>Nice.)  </li>
            <li>and you buy the product, now you have to buy separately, it was nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like threading</li>
            <li>This thing pulls hairs, it really does, any maybe I&#x27;m still trying to perfect the technique</li>
            <li>but thing is, I can feel the spring catching them but not pulling them out.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective tool.</li>
            <li>I noticed on longer hairs around the chin area, not so effective</li>
            <li>its grabbing a lot&amp;#34; kind of way)  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to experiment &amp; see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t honestly believe that this would work, but decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>But let me tell you this product is excellent as it really works.</li>
            <li>It DID remove my chin hair effectively but</li>
            <li>I am loving this sprong.</li>
            <li>Take the spring to that kind of growth and, hell</li>
            <li>I use the calendula and rose hydrosol (with aloe vera, etc.)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have to get my own.</li>
            <li>So to me that was a good sign :)</li>
            <li>I do think for good results just like waxing or tweezing the longer the hair the better to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>It really is the best solution out there for lip hair.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having to buy another one because my grandmother liked mine so well and gave me puppy dog eyes</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not the kind that breaks out</li>
            <li>Honest -- there&#x27;s no discomfort at all now.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a tool of this kind and found over 700 reviews with over 95% raving about it.  </li>
            <li>she liked it too.  </li>
            <li>She is honest and shows the correct way to maneuver the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe thats why I wasn&#x27;t thrilled.</li>
            <li>A nice find.</li>
            <li>To be honest, after reading some of the reviews (take it like this, do it this way, etc.)</li>
            <li>To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t hurt me.  </li>
            <li>It works kind of well, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I really think this is the greatest thing ever created!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it still hurts, but it&#x27;s effective, and let&#x27;s face it, it was gonna hurt either way.  </li>
            <li>i do also like the fact that its made so durable and cheaper than the bellabe kind which has plastic handles or maybe its rubber?</li>
            <li>I am thrilled I have found this tool.  </li>
            <li>u kind of get used to it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s my kind of product.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I did I kind of knew what to expect.</li>
            <li>BUT, honestly, maintenance is like plucking eyebrows but faster.</li>

            <li>, mostly it gets the very fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Except for the chin (corner of mouth to corner of mouth area), most of the hair is gone or very fine.  </li>
            <li>It does remove all hair and i used to do my eyebrows and it removed most of the hair in one go except like one very fine hair and for some reason it couldnt grab that</li>
            <li>It did nothing on my face but the hairs are sparse and very light.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s tricky to use, but for the most part it&#x27;s really great and so much cheaper than waxing!</li>

            <li>This is easy, effective and doesn&#x27;t need time to set up.  </li>
            <li>So easy, so incredibly effective.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s over quickly and does a good job so that you don&#x27;t have to use it all that</li>
            <li>I liked the idea, I think I also easily learned how to make it work</li>
            <li>I get the best results if I use it right after washing my face in hot water before using any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Face is SUPER SMOOTH and I haven&#x27;t experienced redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use and how effective.</li>

            <li>This is for sure a money saver.</li>
            <li>It is  best for upper lip, can work on chin and cheeks too.</li>
            <li>I suppose I knew what to expect, so the pain was more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things over the years- waxing, hair removal creams, electrolosis, lazer hair removal-</li>
            <li>so I took my time to use it in different ways, trying to find the way that works best for me.</li>
            <li>so many at once-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but the Spring Sprong deserves a plug.</li>

            <li>I hear it gets better the more</li>
            <li>Halfway through the car ride I was on my way to removing most of my chin hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to remove all the hairs</li>
            <li>Give it some time to get used to learning how to use it and you will love it to!any dryness.     </li>
            <li>I made sure to wash my skin, exfoliate, tone and moisturize, but I do that every night.  </li>
            <li>I am hopeful, though, that with more practice, I will be able to get into those nooks and crannies as well.</li>
            <li>End of story &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have struggled with it for many years</li>
            <li>But, if you keep up with it, you&#x27;ll never have to remove so many hairs at a time ever again.</li>
            <li>Hey this is the best product to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>hope i helped, cause this thing has givin me a more confident face.</li>
            <li>but it gets better :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26-year-old woman, and I like looking my best for my female partner.  </li>
            <li>She knows how I love my dumps.    </li>
            <li>This spring is one of my favorite purchases I&#x27;ve made in years.  </li>
            <li>I have never been smoother or hair free!</li>
            <li>Sure, there&#x27;s some stinging but nothing to make your eyes water or anything.  </li>
            <li>the more often you use it.  </li>
            <li>The tighter you can make the skin in the area you&#x27;re working on, the better the results.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to be able to see the hair...</li>
            <li>threading is my favorite-</li>
            <li>she is satisfied with this device ...</li>
            <li>It takes more persistence to get the ones under my chin.</li>
            <li>Interesting product.</li>
            <li>Not too sure how hygienic it is as it&#x27;s metal</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Upper lip looks great and the hair pulled out at the root!  </li>
            <li>I still use it but make sure to wipe the spring with alcohol pads before, during and after use.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can use it anytime you want without having to go to the threading studios.</li>
            <li>You will become a hair eradication machine. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The best thing is, no mirrors necessary.    </li>
            <li>I was finally to the point of looking for electrolysis, then I found this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I was relentless and wanted to be hair free in one night, which I would say I was 95% hair free after a good 20 min, maybe more time.  </li>
            <li>I had alot of hair and, y chin was the most stubborn area.  </li>
            <li>Buy this, you will be so glad that you did.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>It does grab all the hairs though and gets them out from the root wich is important!</li>
            <li>and have never been satisfied with results.  </li>
            <li>I will try again and hopefully it will be better.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever worked better for me.</li>
            <li>But now it&#x27;s smooth, I honestly can&#x27;t believe how even the shadow is gone.</li>
            <li>Yes a perfect storm for facial hair.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how many hairs were removed.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using it twice a week to stay on top of the regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this device for about 2 weeks now and just love it.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure to wash, tone, and use a soothing non-comedogenic moisturizer afterward.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the simplest yet most genius hair removal tool out there.</li>
            <li>My eyes watered when I did this section, but it was more the location than the intensity of the pain that caused it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li>I was glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I agree with most of the reiveiws--it does take some practice.  </li>
            <li>I womaned up and decided to give it one more shot</li>
            <li>and I thought they were hilarious.</li>
            <li>I love it; pulled the hair out from the root</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>IF THERE WERE MORE STARS I WOULD GIVE MORE.</li>
            <li>I am able to do it at my pace and my convenience</li>
            <li>I am so impressed that something this simple could work so well.    </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of using it, it really works great.</li>
            <li>I wanted it mostly for my chin area.</li>
            <li>This works better than waxing.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure I&#x27;d break out, but had no problems.</li>
            <li>- Gets faster and more pain-free</li>
            <li>the more you do it.</li>
            <li>Since hair tends to grow in cycles, I&#x27;m doing it once a week or so, just to keep on top of things</li>
            <li>You will be sooo glad you did.    </li>
            <li>Better than tweezing.  </li>
            <li>and I like it much better.</li>
            <li>was OK</li>
            <li>SO the shipping was ok.  </li>
            <li>but once you know how to use you will love it..........</li>
            <li>This is the best way to remove facial hair I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>you may be able to tolerate the pain</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many</li>
            <li>Advantage is that many hairs get pulled at once, rather than one at a time, and you don&#x27;t have to use a mirror.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will &#x27;tweeze&#x27; better than I can see and not take me an hour staring into a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, so I tried the R.e.m. Spring Sprong, and I love it.</li>
            <li>:)   </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this tool.</li>
            <li>rather everyone believe I&#x27;m naturally smooth on my own, not mama gorilla here.</li>
            <li>But geez I love this spring</li>
            <li>Will still be on the look-out for a better tweezer or electrolysis eventually.</li>
            <li>love that I can do this in the convenience of my home.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the most efficient angles, etc.  </li>
            <li>the faster you move this tool, the better.</li>
            <li>You can tell its working by hearing the satisfying pulling of the hair.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t hesitate - I would pay 5 times the amount for how much better I feel about myself.</li>
            <li>It now takes me 10 mins to get rid of any unwanted hair instead of 30 mins or more.</li>
            <li>If you love pain, use this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the handles could be better.</li>
            <li>But, it is a lot better than having to tweeze all of the hairs one at a time.  </li>
            <li>The more you use it, the more you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I really love this product and have been thinking of ways</li>
            <li>I purchased this item with some doubt in my mind, because many hair removal products just don&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>My lip and jaw are hair free!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that my hair management evolution has been interesting.</li>
            <li>and I think does a much better job of getting all the hair.</li>
            <li>However, if you have ever grabbed more than one hair while tweezing then you know this feeling.</li>
            <li>Her face has never felt smoother and I can tell she&#x27;s a lot more confident.</li>
            <li>After I finish, my chin is SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>just received my spring today and after about 20-30 minutes I removed most of the hair that was bothering me.</li>
            <li>Depending on your pain tolerance, I&#x27;m sure the sensation gets better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>hello smooth skin!</li>
            <li>I imagine it will get better over time, but it will take time.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s more my skin&#x27;s fault than the product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>somehow I could get a better grip on them and maybe get it to work.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the way it works.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE the way it works.  </li>
            <li>But it is no worst than waxing.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but it is quite tolerable---give or take ur tolerance for pain !!! :)</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased anything that works so well and is even better than it&#x27;s advertising.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I even stopped wearing make up because it showed the hair even more.</li>
            <li>OK so ive been waxing my face for years and will no longer heat wax again.  </li>
            <li>Results get better by practice.</li>
            <li>This works better than waxing - gets the smallest, finest hair.</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, I&#x27;m sooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i expected this to be some kind of hit and miss sort of thing, but with great reviews, i bought it!</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>But it exceeded my expectation, love this product.</li>
            <li>and i just LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Maybe with more practice it will become easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than chemicals though</li>
            <li>All in all i love mine.</li>
            <li>if you are ok with the pain then this is ok for you.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t even need a mirror to use this device.  </li>
            <li>OK, so  it&#x27;s just a wire-spring thing that you run across your face.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It does an outstanding job, I do it while watching TV or laying in bed.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so hair free!</li>
            <li>Ok, I never write reviews for anything.  </li>
            <li>I started looking at waxing to see if that might be better.</li>
            <li>This is the best method of removing facial hair in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Using this is like plucking, but of course it&#x27;s broader and more hair comes out.</li>
            <li>I am growing more hair in places I never had before (cheeks).</li>
            <li>What I like the most about this device is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like waxing</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair out, and nothing more.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it:</li>
            <li>I love that you can take it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I have bought this couple of times and was quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>so have to use muliple hair clips to make sure I don&#x27;t get that head hair tangled in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m probably not using the item appropriately.</li>
            <li>the waxing method is more preferable to me.</li>
            <li>and it would probably work better.</li>
            <li>I love not using chemicals</li>
            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Omg, the best product I have found for removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Tweezers are way easier to handle and much more efficient.</li>
            <li>I just use it while I watch TV at night and it keeps my face smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li>Better than using nair or those mini shavers.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>Years ago I made the mistake of shaving them off, and now more and more seem to be there every year.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>I think most of the time it cuts the hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off tearing the hairs out one by one.</li>
            <li>It also gets better the more you use it -</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a lot easier than plucking out one hair at a time, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>NO PAIN!! :)</li>
            <li>Better if you have a 5x or 10x mirror.  </li>
            <li>does (and got sooo many more hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>My daughter says she can&#x27;t use it, but I surely can.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It took awhile for me to get the hang of how to pull the most hairs at one time.</li>
            <li>Once i figured out how to use it, it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Today I was able to pull a ton of hair from my chin.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I would take many breaks in between because I am a coward and it hurt.</li>
            <li>This facial spring hair remover is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Certainly much better than chemicals and creams.</li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;T HURT ANY MORE THAN PLUCKING...</li>
            <li>so I could make sure I used the R.E.M. Spring correctly.</li>
            <li>She meticulously presents the product and the process, but more than that</li>
            <li>One more star if cleaning was easier.  </li>
            <li>Within 5 minutes I was able to figure it out and on my way to a smooth face!</li>
            <li>I compare the pain to threading and more tolerable than waxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Voila: you may now elegantly decimate your moustache, or whatever.  </li>
            <li>Much better than I got with burning, toxic bleaches.  </li>
            <li>It is tricksy to describe the technique, but I hope I was able to help someone.  </li>
            <li>Much better than I got with burning, toxic bleaches.  </li>
            <li>It is tricksy to describe the technique, but I hope I was able to help someone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>but it does get better as time goes on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll make more sense then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waxing is faster, but this tool is better.  </li>
            <li>It is better than tweezing, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but took a chance and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>And as I got my face closer to the mirror and realized just how many times I would have to rip hairs out of my face in order to rid them all, I became discouraged and set the device aside to collect dust.</li>
            <li>If you can take tweezing, you should be able to handle this...</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just better than most.</li>
            <li>Anyway, love this product; I&#x27;ll never stop using it.</li>
            <li>Love this tool, all my girlfriends</li>
            <li>It probably feels like it hurts more because you are doing it to yourself</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you are used to waxing, you might be Okay.</li>
            <li>I feel normal and beautiful again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use any more hair removing creams and get wax done on my face any more..</li>
            <li>and I just love Oprah</li>
            <li>You can stop moving your fingers at any moment to stop pulling out hairs if it is hurting more than you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>What I love about it is that you don&#x27;t have to see the hairs to get them out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any shavers, it&#x27;s better than hair removal creams, it&#x27;s better than plucking each one....</li>
            <li>Love it and it should be sold by amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I had this spring for three years and still love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the spring for a month now, and I love it, but it took a while to get in the groove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love love love this.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I order this and took a chance.  </li>
            <li>For my Neck and Chin it was better for me to look up.</li>
            <li>So find whatever position to work the spring better on</li>
            <li>Luck :)</li>
            <li>it seems to hurt a lot more than waxing  </li>
            <li>tweezers are way better</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love it way better than waxing and creams.  </li>
            <li>It feels like using tweezers but faster because it pulls more than one hair at a time.</li>
            <li>An ingenious device.</li>
            <li>This sometimes works and mostly doesnt.  </li>
            <li>I noticed more blackheads after using this too.</li>
            <li>as if I had shaved so I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it!!(hope</li>
            <li>It removed the hair from my top lip with ease.  </li>
            <li>Also as a side note, my skin feels so smooooth and my makeup looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Thank you guys! :))&lt;</li>
            <li>After spending more time &amp; money than I&#x27;d like to remember on 2  seperate</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about this at all....</li>
            <li>This is much better and easier.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it can sting a tad bit....</li>
            <li>so shop catalogs for a better price.</li>
            <li>it felt so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>It is also MUCH better than the cheaper models out there.  </li>
            <li>I love this spring</li>
            <li>Maybe it gets better</li>
            <li>the more you do it,</li>
            <li>And every pimply teen with an iPad has every greatest hits compilation you could ever make.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sure the REM Nose Hair</li>
            <li>I have been waxing for years and this is so much better and portable to boot.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my daughter because I think this is the best way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that with continuance usage, the time in between will lessen.</li>
            <li>I love this thing more than anything in the world.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Seriously my favorite purchase ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to buy 5 more just in case</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>things are a lot better off there too.</li>
            <li>I may have missed it, but most reviews are from women.  </li>
            <li>BTW,  I have not decided if tightening the skin surface is better or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Though, once thinned out, it goes much better - hairs kinda flick around btw, the spring twangs when I use it in dense</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful tool to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for touch ups or for a fast treatment.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>leaves more to be desired for under chin areas.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re able to stand for the end result.</li>
            <li>It works better if you hold it ON the spring...</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s probably the best thing I have found to use to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>I use to put Sally Hansen hair remover on my face and I am so glad I purchased this item.  </li>
            <li>but glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the creams.</li>
            <li>The ends are slippery and would be better if they had a rougher surface texture.  </li>
            <li>Better than tweezing</li>
            <li>Bellabe is better.  </li>
            <li>The concept is great though, and they really work.</li>
            <li>I did seem to get more breakouts when I used it.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than waxing, or hair epilators.</li>
            <li>I have so much more self confidence in</li>
            <li>Sure, somewhat.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product that works!  </li>
            <li>Recommend this product for sure.  </li>
            <li>That could be why I find my results to be better.</li>
            <li>The longer the hair, the more pain.</li>
            <li>Waxing or electrolysis would be a better investment.</li>
            <li>(glad I didn&#x27;t buy that product).</li>
            <li>and I feel confident.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the better you get at it.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial epilator I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve caused myself more discomfort trying to get \\&quot;that</li>
            <li>It does the job but takes time to figure out how it works, it would help to have better instructions.</li>
            <li>Saved many trips to threading place.</li>
            <li>It is the best invention for facial hair remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a so-so remedy, still looking for the something better.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is quicker and more efficient then tweezers.</li>
            <li>MUCH better finish</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>so I think that makes it hurt more).  </li>
            <li>and now I am so much more confident.</li>
            <li>it removed most of it and remaining i tweezed...</li>
            <li>i feel more girly....</li>
            <li>I finally figured out what works best depending on which area I am aiming for.</li>
            <li>We are woman, we can handle the pain :)</li>
            <li>That should speaks volume when someone notices a difference :)</li>
            <li>also use this device on the top of my eyebrows, uni-brow, and sides of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased I cannot even begin to express myself.  </li>
            <li>I am almost satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This did pull hair out, but it sure did hurt.  </li>
            <li>Thank you bubzbeauty! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It only took a couple of minutes to figure out the best angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I think you will like it and kep it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>It works better than a $3 cheapo one that I also got and tried out.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product...</li>
            <li>Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with it for many years</li>
            <li>But, if you keep up with it, you&#x27;ll never have to remove so many hairs at a time ever again.</li>
            <li>Read more</li>
            <li>So simple and so happy!</li>
            <li>I may just need to practice more.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the redness went away by the next day, and I was so happy with the results!</li>
            <li>I love the R.E.M. Spring.</li>
            <li>but if it is more than 2mm, then it is gone.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This hurts a lot more than threading for some reason.</li>
            <li>But, if you can grin and bear it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find this more helpful than waxing and</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It is way better than using tweezers and or paying for threading.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Almost no pain, more like burning sensation.</li>
            <li>and I love this product...</li>
            <li>(I love you REM :))</li>
            <li>I have been using the same spring for more than 8 months and it is still awesome...</li>
            <li>I stalked it on Amazon, even asking pertinent questions of another prominent reviewer of it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t but tell everyone about this awesome product,ve been looking for a product that will remove my facial hair for long,wen</li>
            <li>I saw the number of the reviews on dis product,I had to give it a try too,and oh my God,I love love love it,am so pleased of the result</li>
            <li>no gain\\&quot;,but as u use it more often</li>
            <li>You will not be able to capture as many if you are not angling to spring correctly.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thought of putting a spring to your face and ripping hair off seemed a bit goofy to me, but</li>
            <li>So much better than No</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will soon.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the REM Spring would be able to pull them out.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m so glad I bought it because this is amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this highly enough, it is perfect!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I will say I do love this and choose over waxing any day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting better each time.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to hurt more than when I go</li>
            <li>I was flirting with the idea of getting a NONO but the price (250+) and the  reviews (mostly 1 star on every site it is sold) made me decide to try the R.E.M.</li>
            <li>biggest problem with the REM spring is most of the time instead of pulling out the hairs, it just breaks them off.</li>
            <li>Will work in a pinch, but not a replacement for better methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no breakouts from products, no awful smells, no sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Enjoy...!</li>
            <li>This is one of the better brands of the spring type hair removers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure in time I&#x27;ll get used to it in time but the pain is with it.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, this is not even made in China or India.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial remover ever!!</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad i did</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think we all need it :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE my R.E.M. spring.</li>
            <li>Honestly, most the time I use it without any redness.</li>
            <li>Works best for me when there&#x27;s only about two (maybe 3) inches of spring between my hands.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week over most of my face for about an hour while watching TV.</li>
            <li>Love these things.  </li>
            <li>Have recommended this product to many people.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>All in all this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is so much better than shaving my face and getting razor cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I save the more wiry hairs for the tweezers.</li>
            <li>if u can put up with the stinging, u will love it.</li>
            <li>Oh and yes it does hurt, am sure with continued use as some stated you will get more used to that</li>
            <li>Love the REM.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love that it pulls the hair from the roots.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love this thing,</li>
            <li>and I really love the way it gets rid of the peach fuzz and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Your face will be smooth!  </li>
            <li>Some things that seem too good to be true are true!  </li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that it&#x27;s quick, clean, and very effective.</li>
            <li>Good for grabbing peach fuzz if you can get it to work right.  </li>
            <li>Used this product for the first time yesterday and YEAH !!!</li>
            <li>First of all,  it WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>the real reason for this review is to say, WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW BY BECKY!!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to continue using this cost effective hair removal solution.</li>
            <li>My advice would be to get a really good wax first to remove most of the hair, and use this to maintain.</li>
            <li>The product is great for the price but takes long time and also it pains while using it.so if you have patience its a good product.</li>
            <li>Reading about it and then reading the reviews, I felt pretty sure this would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li>This is so cheap, so easy and so effective.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to use straight out of the box, and I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this thing.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, when the itch to \\&quot;live large\\&quot; needs a scratch, hey, get the band back together and hit the road for another \\&quot;greatest hits\\&quot; tour, supporting another \\&quot;greatest hits\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I loved this the first couple times.</li>
            <li>Hurts at first, then kinda feels good.</li>
            <li>This baby works pretty good.....</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this product.</li>
            <li>So I take my own sweet time while at it.</li>
            <li>I have tried it on my happy- trail and it was more painful/ not as effective as on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise its worth !!</li>
            <li>My hair is thinner which I&#x27;m excited about!</li>
            <li>A unique product!</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$!!</li>
            <li>But, its definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>I tried it right out of the box and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cool!!!</li>
            <li>I love removing hair with this - it&#x27;s so easy and addicting.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I can travel easily with it.  </li>
            <li>Probably because our faces have so many angles but just a word of caution that it isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wipe off any excess oil/moisture from the skin so the spring can roll easily.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to learn and to handle and so much better (and cheaper) than waxing and threading.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t rip hair out from the roots (especially fine hair on sensitive areas of the face) without pain.  </li>
            <li>thing is quick and effective.</li>
            <li>With waxing, your skin gets warm and you can pull the hair out with one quick swipe.</li>
            <li>Also, works best when your skin is completely dry.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, my face is as smooth as a babies butt!  </li>
            <li>This is really nice, as you can do bits at a time really quick.  </li>
            <li>I like best is it is fast, and I am not spending so much time with the tweezers.</li>
            <li>Overall fantastic product, great price!  </li>
            <li>and the most important things are to use it often to reduce the pain and make sure that your face is washed and exfoliated before and after each use.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to say that it works great on me--particularly on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>Maybe more so the fact that I have sensitive skin, but I just hope I can save anyone else the pain that I experienced from using this product.  </li>
            <li>It is so handy and easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is very easy to clean as well.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, I think this is a fine product that does the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Pulls out many fine hairs but not course hairs.</li>
            <li>It can be used anywhere on the face, but won&#x27;t pick up extremely fine baby hairs, as many have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It caught all the fine hairs, and the more course ones as well.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a mild toner afterward and moisturize!  </li>
            <li>did read many of the reviews, and the advice about going clockwise with one end and counter clockwise with the other was excellent advice.  </li>
            <li>Another nice thing is I can throw this in my purse and if I missed a spot, I can easily and quickly take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that for anyone who has had their face waxed before, it&#x27;s definitely not very painful.</li>
            <li>Very cool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important thing to know is that this product works quickly, works effectively and is easily carried around with you.</li>
            <li>Overall the best product I have found and with everything there is always a little drawback and figuring how to use it best for you.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product; once you get the hang of it, it is faster and more efficient than a tweezers.</li>
            <li>But for me this is soooo much more comfortable than waxing, threading or even plucking.</li>
            <li>It works great and my sensitive skin is not complaining.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order a couple of extras to make sure I always have one available.</li>
            <li>I make sure to do a light scrub after as I will break out if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Wow this product is great..........</li>
            <li>light colored hair on my chin, cheeks and ajowls... almost invisible to most people.. but not me.  </li>
            <li>Plucks most of my hair off and keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li>and I have almost no lingering irritation and my face is smooth, which makes my skin look better and makeup smoother.  </li>
            <li>If the hair is not laying in an ideal direction, it may pull the hair, but not actually remove it....</li>
            <li>But it is the best $20 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>but wow it works great</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, I hope this type of product is on the market for the longterm because it is incredible</li>
            <li>AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT</li>
            <li>wow, it works great.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this is the best money (of ANY amount) that I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it was working, but then I was able to figure it out and it was catching hairs.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well and frankly any good hair removal has some pain involved.  </li>
            <li>it kind of hurts, but its worth it</li>
            <li>but it really does a darn good job once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I laughed almost the whole way through.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I have used it as much as I would like, but it is a good buy if looking for another alternative to hair removal.</li>
            <li>It really is a good product and very timely in delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very quick, very easy, inexpensive and no chemicals to burn the skin.</li>
            <li>OK, first thought upon using this--they should use it to extract info from unsavory characters!!</li>
            <li>This cool spring really does a great job getting rid of all the fuzzy, fine hair all over your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that this gadget can remove tiny and fine hairs!</li>
            <li>A very nice product i have seen so far.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine and light colored hair on my jawline, but it&#x27;s longer than most women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Works great and nearly painless for the fine hairs on chin and \\&quot;unibrow\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The Spring Sprong did not hurt any more than threading does, it pulls out the tiny hairs, and it is much more cost effective!</li>
            <li>Pretty ingenious!  </li>
            <li>but then you get familiar with the areas of your face and which sting more than others.  </li>
            <li>SWEET!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this thing!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I am really impressed with this little tool.  </li>
            <li>Actually this is as good as it gets!  </li>
            <li>Hurts a bit at first, longer the hair the more it hurts!</li>
            <li>Try it, and you will not be disappointed--you sometimes have to go over an area more than once, but it does work, and the best part is, you can use it in the dark!</li>
            <li>Glad I got it although I don&#x27;t smile when using it like the lady in the picture!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not painful at all!</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34; we have on our faces and this R.E.M. Spring is better than wax, threading or hair remover</li>

            <li>Obviously it&#x27;s going to hurt - you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your face - but the pain diminishes the more you use it, so just go to your happy place and stick with it.</li>
            <li>It was easy to get the hang of using.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to speed up the process of basic tweezers as it pulls out many hairs at a time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and you will know if you use it correctly (when you feel the hair coming out).</li>
            <li>The spring is flexible and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This grabs onto all my hair (no matter the length), and pulls it out easily.  </li>
            <li>I watched a YouTube video how to use and it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to do once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>which burns easily on waxing and the marks of wax burn takes forever to heal..</li>
            <li>and it is so easy..</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After the first time, it&#x27;s been absolutely wonderful and barely hurts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, take care of and store.</li>
            <li>the instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>(Yes, my hair goes very quickly.)</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, she doesnt need a mirror to try to find each hair, and she can just do it while watching tv or whatever.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it helps me a lot...very easy in use and gives god results .&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sister was looking for a more cost effective hair removal method since she just graduated  college and wants to conserve her cash.</li>
            <li>It works well, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and is surprisingly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li>this product is so easy to use and it pulls out a lot of hair at one time.  </li>
            <li>It saves time and money, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also got acne-prone skin and an aversion to strong chemicals.</li>
            <li>The good news: use it frequently and it is markedly more tolerable.</li>
            <li>Now that the breakout is done and gone, I have to say I still do not regret using the spring, because it DID do a very good job of tweezing out all the long vellus hairs on my face, chin and neck.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and handy... usually use while watching tv LOL.  </li>
            <li>I pulls out your fine hairs and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It truly is amazing how simple, ingenious and effective this thing is.</li>
            <li>These apparently make great inexpensive gifts according to her.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, anyone who is suffering from what I went through SHOULD REALLY PURCHASE THIS!  </li>
            <li>I was quite thrilled when I first used this.</li>
            <li>I just keep doing this until I notice that it is not painful anymore and then begin with more detail.  </li>
            <li>Take a shower first, or wash your face with warm water to soften your hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still just as effective as the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty effective.</li>
            <li>first off i bought this on ebay because honestly i dont like paying for shipping</li>
            <li>It is the best thing I have found yet and extremely affordable!</li>
            <li>Well, to be honest, I&#x27;m remarkably uncoordinated, so I can&#x27;t consistently twist the&amp;#34;right counterclockwise, left clockwise&amp;#34; , but that&#x27;s more me than the device.</li>
            <li>The first time is the hardest because there is the most hair to remove and it hurts the most.</li>
            <li>I think the hairs are too fine for this spring to work there.</li>
            <li>but it seems to get all the fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt the first time, but now I&#x27;m at the time where I&#x27;m happier the more it hurts because it means I&#x27;m getting more hairs out.</li>
            <li>This spring did get the fine baby hairs; that&#x27;s not what I needed.</li>
            <li>so it got all of the fine hairs I could see and some</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and it still works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Mostly it is fine,</li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer it works on fine hair, remember it sort of pulls it out so the thicker the hair, well ouch.  </li>
            <li>You will have to experiment with the spring at first to find the best twisting method, but once you do, this is a waste-free and affordable way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cling to my hairs there - maybe they are too fine?</li>
            <li>think this will work well for people who have uniform hair types/lengths or people who want to pick up longish hairs that are fine to medium thickness.</li>
            <li>It gets both just fine.</li>
            <li>I like it because it could grab my fine hair.</li>
            <li>The spring remover did a fine job.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll hit the sweet spot unexpectedly and regret it, lol.</li>
            <li>It hurts quite a bit the first times, but it gets better the more you use it.</li>
            <li>can imagine this would work well for any fine hairs, like the lip, chin, sideburns, even arm hair  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this could help me when I travel and can&#x27;t see fine hairs as well as when I use my magnifying mirror at home.</li>
            <li>but it grabs all those fine hairs that are missed by tweezers and sometimes even missed by waxing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to get rid of my fine upper-lip hairs (i.e., mustache) as well as the hairs between my eyebrows and on my chinnie-chin-chin.</li>
            <li>I just received my REM Spring in the mail yesterday and I am amazed at how quickly I was able to get it to work.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing it is so quick</li>
            <li>It was quick and better than cream remover which tends to burn your face.  </li>
            <li>Very easy, very fast hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way the ends of the tool twist around easily, and because they are kind of tapered at the end</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to look like Chewbacca nor am I doomed to spending money on batteries, creams, wax that rips everything but your hair, and it&#x27;s relatively fast and easy, and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However the process is much more pleasant than individually plucking the hairs out.</li>
            <li>THIS is the ticket for fine hair, light in color on the face and chin.</li>
            <li>It effectively does the job and can cover large areas while doing so.  </li>
            <li>Good for sideburns where you have room,  not so good in tight spaces.  </li>
            <li>This little product is wonderful!</li>
            <li>This little tool is so awesome, I want to tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li>This little device is awesome.  </li>
            <li>This little spring works great!  </li>
            <li>Take a little while to master the technique but its great!  </li>
            <li>, she is very, very funny!  </li>
            <li>This little torture device is the best thing ever...</li>
            <li>Excellent little tool.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much!!</li>
            <li>Works great on both coarse and fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Great product for removing fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li>The REM Spring is so simple and easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>A consistently clean upper lip for the first time in my life makes this one of my best purchases of all time.</li>
            <li>It a Little bit hurts but it saves my time and money ,and enables me to enjoy the best result ever .</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin that even gentle waxes would make me break out, no to mention the monthly cost</li>
            <li>After professional waxing, home wax strips, creme hair removers, electric tweezers and regular tweezers to remove a lot of facial hair (I am a female by the way), this product is the best, most effective, easy, cheapest and simplest solution of all, excellent product and great idea, simple to use.</li>
            <li>I prefer this than shaving (a HUGE no-no) or waxing.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I purchased this was because I had been using an electric epilator on my face which was causing huge breakouts (again, despite disinfecting it and my face before hand).&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need to use those wax or  those harsh hair removed, this one is perfect...</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great alternative to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>Fast and Effective.</li>
            <li>This is a great solution for unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Very cost effective versus waxing at a salon.</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned, brunette.</li>
            <li>my face is always hair free and smooth now.</li>
            <li>My chin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to look for a cheap product I could use at home.</li>
            <li>My hair is light</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>Really happy that I bought it and like feeling empowered to maintain facial hair removal by myself.</li>
            <li>peach fuzz free.</li>
            <li>Fantastic invention.</li>
            <li>This works well on light to mediums size hairs but thicker hairs still need tweezers.</li>
            <li>Great at removing hair, however causes tiny whiteheads on my chin the day after using.  </li>
            <li>It pulls the hair out at the root and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>One week ago in my quest to find hair relife I stumbled across this product and I am now hair free, and released from the burdon of a razor.  </li>
            <li>I rub my chin all the time amazed at how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>It is not pain free, but no method of hair removal is.  </li>
            <li>It is better than tweezing hair off your face because the REM spring gets it off fast and more pain free than tweezers.</li>
            <li>but this just verified how much facial hair I had lol</li>
            <li>It did not remove the really light \\&quot;baby hairs\\&quot; from my forehead at all.</li>
            <li>I started using a bikini trimmer, but it was never as smooth as I had hoped and had a prickly feel within two days.  </li>
            <li>If you roll the spring back and forth between your forefingers and your thumbs and move your hands instead of trying to roll the spring all over your face it works great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that easy to clean</li>
            <li>Besides that it is handy to travel with and really does work.</li>
            <li>I use the spring every nightjust to catch any strays and keep my face smooth.  </li>
            <li>just make sure that after each usage that you wash your face completely with luke warm water and apply 100% Aloe Vera Gel so that you calm the irritation or make sure you don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this solution because it totally beats anything else</li>
            <li>Product is great at removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li>This is very cost effective too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and this thing works great to remove my unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>My overall comments about this product are that it&#x27;s a great alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic for pulling hair, and you just have to get used to it.</li>
            <li>overall great product.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to twist in and</li>
            <li>My face is finally smooth.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards I&#x27;m amazed how smooth my skin is around my chin and lip, and there is no irritation on my mole or my skin.  </li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known that a metal spring wouldn&#x27;t be pain free, and I guess I did kinda know that.</li>
            <li>Now I can get rid of that baby fuzz that bugs me when light hits it.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is very cost effective is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>FUZZ\\&quot; free.</li>
            <li>Perfectly smooth chin.</li>
            <li>I use the epilator part on my chin and under my chin and it removes every hair in a flash just about pain free.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>Perfectly smooth without any blemishes.</li>
            <li>Trying to keep my face hair free is literally a part time job; I never leave the house without a tweezer, I have one in my purse, car, bedroom, office etc...</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and the answer to my quest.</li>
            <li>hair is gone, skin is smooth and non irritated.</li>
            <li>cause you are pulling the hairs out, but once you start to get the hang of it, it works smoothly.</li>
            <li>and she made it sound like it was working</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t always catch everything, but more fun then tweezing</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not entirely 100% great.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Been moustache free for a month now.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>Within minutes I had a smooth lip.</li>
            <li>I laid on my couch, watched Judge Judy and in no time, I am hair free.  </li>
            <li>but once I got it done, my chin was as smooth as the proverbial babies</li>
            <li>Great product for the upper lip and chin area.</li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t rusted and it is easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>* to do my sideburns so that I could be free of bleach forever.</li>
            <li>I removes the hair and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and check out the off-brands available on Amazon-</li>
            <li>I use this on the weekends and my face stays smooth all week.  </li>
            <li>This hair remover works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>: the discomfort is inconsequential, the results fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I just carry it around in my purse and when I am at a stop light, I can pluck away.  </li>
            <li>Once you find the way to use it, is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great facial hair remover.  </li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it you will have a silky smooth face.</li>
            <li>My face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s after I was finished.  </li>
            <li>I had to kind of play around with the bending of the tool, then I got the hang of it and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Not some cheap plastic gimmick that will fall apart.</li>
            <li>So try it out and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I bought this and a cheap brand.</li>
            <li>This device is great for chin and upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>My face have NEVER felt this smooth before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you have facial hair.</li>
            <li>The benefit is smooth, peerless skin - don&#x27;t forget to use an astringent before and after, and wash the wire.</li>
            <li>Before this product, I would lightly razor the area...</li>
            <li>When I received I followed the directions precisely and it worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I keep mine in my car to use while I&#x27;m stuck at a light.  </li>
            <li>This is important.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>This did great on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Review after review after review spouting nothing but fantastic comments.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap, reusable and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I got the cheap one to have in the car.  </li>
            <li>My face is completely smooth and I wish I had bought this years ago.</li>
            <li>its cheap but does the job.</li>
            <li>Also, it looks like it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>smooth) skin.</li>
            <li>What works best for me- is to actually roll it almost straight-</li>
            <li>I love using it because its so much more fast then tweezing</li>
            <li>I have plucked, waxed, used creams, and this by far is the easiet and most effective way to remove those hairs..   </li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin, and warn you not to use this device if you do as well.  </li>
            <li>really wish the spring worked for my purposes, but it wasn&#x27;t able to pick up the thicker, more visible hairs.</li>
            <li>I definitely made a good decision because I love it</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and it works really good on me</li>
            <li>Very good on fine hair is does not always completely remove the more course hair but does pull it out enough that the tweezers easily finish the task.</li>
            <li>, it takes a bit of experimenting to get the right angles and get the most out of it, but you&#x27;ll figure it out, it&#x27;s not rocket science.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Very effective, and relatively painless.  </li>
            <li>the acne breakouts are very rare.  </li>
            <li>This hair remover is very simple and very effective.</li>
            <li>However -- this product really requires steady hands, great coordination and the ability to apply pressure all simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use, it pulls facial hairs out without catching your skin.</li>
            <li>Using is little tricky, its basically needs roll and twist movement against the hair growth, but there are many U-Tube videos on spring, they have demonstrated beautifully.</li>
            <li>At first, I was not going to review this product because there were already so many truthful, positive reviews; now I know firsthand that those who say the spring works well are correct!</li>
            <li>Ive never been so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, there is no learning curve -</li>
            <li>It was super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love being hair free, my skin looks so much nicer without the fuzz!  </li>
            <li>The product is super easy to use once you figure out which direction to roll it.  </li>
            <li>I watched that it is best to use it a lot to keep the nerves use to it, because if you go a long time without using it then it will really hurt when you use it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>It goes quick and easy once you get the bend-twist-roll technique going.</li>
            <li>It is so quick and easy that I can remove hair in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I like the convenience of having something quick and easy and portable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use this tool to remove it easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so quick and easy to use before doing a makeup.</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; Easy</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, doesn&#x27;t get under your chin very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this on the hair around my mouth was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quick and easy to use..</li>
            <li>quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Best little device ever!  </li>
            <li>so grateful for all the reviews that helped me decide to try this awesome little Spring!</li>
            <li>I have used it on my whole face (which I also love to get an extra smooth face as it greatly reduces my peace fuzz) and</li>
            <li>I clean it after every use with a quick rinse in a very mild soap water mix.  </li>
            <li>This tool is so simple and produces amazing results!  </li>
            <li>I am so excited over this product!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft and smooth, I simply love it!</li>
            <li>The discomfort involved is negligible and the product more than paid for itself during the first week</li>
            <li>Whoever invented this thing deserves to be rich.   </li>
            <li>I love this product does exactly what I need it too.</li>
            <li>But, it was so worth it!  </li>
            <li>I am excited about how portable this tool is to use.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed at all with this product...</li>
            <li>Horray for my first review &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Before ordering the product, I read over 100 reviews about it, and was so excited to give it a try.   </li>
            <li>I was so excited for it to come that I ripped it out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I read the reviews about this product, so when it arrived I was eager to use it immediately.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>, I guess because it is grabbing the most hairs that first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Some of the super fine hairs maybe broke off</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Yes, this does cause temporary discomfort, but the tradeoffs are worth it!  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful, and YES it does hurt a bit, but no more than waxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rewriting my original review which was five stars.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews for this, I was excited, but hesitant.  </li>
            <li>and I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>More so the first time you use</li>
            <li>First time I tried it on my eyebrows, it works its ninja magic and yes, my eyelashes got caught in it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Caused significant irritation, as if I broke out into a severe rash.</li>
            <li>I was willing to take a chance on this product,  I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny (an will now save me $$ as I do not have to pay to get it removed!)</li>
            <li>Hurts at first, but pulls out many hairs</li>
            <li>you forget the pain when you are watching something funny or cute online....</li>
            <li>For a deceptively simple looking device, this works remarkably well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I originally planned to give this 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product and still am somewhat.</li>
            <li>Based on my first use, I love it.</li>
            <li>Up a couple of months ago, I was bleaching, but I could still notice the significant &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34;  I have tried waxing over the years and breakouts were the result.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this but found that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t get all hairs, but reduces tweezing significantly.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to clean the area first with witch hazel so as not to get bumps.</li>
            <li>, all was fine and good until digital media upset the Apple cart.</li>
            <li>I tried it as soon as it arrived, its so fast &amp; easy to use!</li>
            <li>I am certain that it will get quicker with practice and frequency of use, but I am beyond pleased with the results of my first time!!</li>
            <li>I use  it on a clean face and clean the spring w my toner.</li>
            <li>Please note you cannot clean the device with water since it will rust.</li>
            <li>I will keep cleaning it the way I have been and hope it stays clean.</li>
            <li>Please note you cannot clean the device with water since it will rust.</li>
            <li>I will keep cleaning it the way I have been and hope it stays clean.</li>
            <li>For those wondering how to clean it, I found that the ends unscrew</li>
            <li>and I kind of prefer a realistically groomed look to a an overly perfect fake</li>
            <li>Once you figure this stuff out, the spring itself does a great job and is worth 5 stars for how it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it then clean with an alcohol wipe.</li>
            <li>When I try to clean the hair off from the device, the spring gets loosened.</li>
            <li>RIP, clean up</li>
            <li>Now it is easy and fun just twisting and turning.</li>
            <li>followed the directions to clean my face after use and apply moisturizer</li>
            <li>This system does what tweezers cannot - removes lots of hair from the root cleanly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;I will not have to wax</li>
            <li>I do like to follow with an astrigent to clean well where to hairs been plucked and avoid a blemish</li>
            <li>The way I clean this spring is with a damp paper towel and let it air dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hubby, who is admirably supportive with whatever I decide to do with facial hair, said he liked the results.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would clean up some of the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>and it looks clean and</li>
            <li>I followed one review written in the product reviews and washed my face clean and then epilated in the morning after bath.</li>
            <li>I wonder how I can clean it..</li>
            <li>To avoid this, wash the face before or after, and also use a cotton ball of rubbing alcohol on the spring after (or something to clean</li>
            <li>u could only see it in bright light (I hope).</li>
            <li>I did consider going to my local hardware store and buying a spring to make my own, but glad i took the plunge and bought the REM.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>This really does remove from the root, and somehow was more comfortable to use than the epilators that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>And please, clean it with alcohol before EACH use, not just once a month as the unhelpful directions suggest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a matter of keeping your skin really clean.</li>
            <li>It picks a stray hair here and there, but would take forever to use for clean removal.</li>
            <li>It works great on the hair underneath the nose but don&#x27;t have much luck using it on the sides of my face near the chin.</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;m pretty impressed and will certainly keep using it in replacement for threading or waxing.</li>
            <li>long as this tool is used correctly, it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this on Friday, received it on Monday so super fast shipping!!!    </li>
            <li>it works perfectly for my facial hair, sometimes requires to do the same area couple of times before you get rid of all hair, but overall it is just great</li>
            <li>It does work on fine hairs though, so it is slightly useful.</li>
            <li>It does smart a bit, but boy is it better than tweezing.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it on my eyebrows because it would be hard to make them perfect</li>
            <li>It did a great job of removing the fine hairs (which is what make up most of my face fuzz), but I had to use tweezers for the hairs that were really short and the ones that were embedded just barely under my skin and close to surfacing (my stylist calls them pepper spots).</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used this handy little tool today and could not be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, the first time I used it, the sensation was almost too much.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Tip: use at night before going to bed, because your skin WILL be bright red after using it</li>
            <li>This device does a pretty nice job and you dont really need to watch yourself in a mirror to do it.</li>
            <li>Wow, amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, the first time I used it, the sensation was almost too much.</li>
            <li>I had a smooth, hairless face and felt confident, no longer conscious of walking into bright light that illuminates blonde hairs.</li>
            <li>Being able to grow hair fast is a blessing but also a curse in disguise.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing the tiny hairs, the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>In 10 mins I had good hairless upper lip.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel as much of a pinch as others have reported, it feels more like a hair being tweezed out.  </li>
            <li>It does come with a nice soft case to keep the spring in which was a plus.</li>
            <li>So yes I resorted to shaving, it is embarrising but true.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is so much faster than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this isn&#x27;t good enough, so</li>
            <li>Then use some hair growth inhibitor to keep it from growing back and you should be all good.</li>
            <li>: My wife likes it so much that she has now purchased more for her friends.</li>
            <li>(I stumbled upon it on Amazon while looking for a good facial waxing product).  </li>
            <li>I use Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Mist, which is more of a tonique to restore pH balance after I wash my face (and it gently exfoliates) -</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t good for those coarse hairs</li>
            <li>So if you are ordering that make sure they send you cover too, its very convenient to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>It is so much faster and easier than waxing and for me it even works better.</li>
            <li>So many times I would get ready to go somewhere and panic because I didn&#x27;t have time to tweeze or wait for wax to heat up.</li>
            <li>Now it still removes a good amount of hair, but I have to use tweezers to remove the final 20%.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t get all of the hair, and I wound up having to use tweezers in a couple places, but overall, it did a good job.</li>
            <li>I also washed my face really well afterwards - so hopefully my skin will be ok</li>
            <li>its not a painful yank</li>
            <li>this is a really good alternative to threading, especially if you don&#x27;t know how to do it.</li>
            <li>I used to tweeze and it would take me so much time but with this product I get better results in a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li>so much I guess from pulling many hairs at once.</li>
            <li>REM is stronger,  more efficient with heavier duty stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>so it last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt, but it sure didn&#x27;t remove much of anything.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad I bought it because it saves me so much time.</li>
            <li>Took about a full minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful at removing unwanted facial hair and the greatest aspect is that it&#x27;s small enough to even tuck away in your purse or travel kit.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>and I was cool with that because I decided that I could watch TV simultaneously.</li>
            <li>I never have been able to make this work very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more bending than twisting the item; gently separating the coils of the spring, applying it to the roots of the unwanted hair, closing the coils over them, and commencing a pulling and rolling motion.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much, I have given it as a gift as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful on my chin at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful at all</li>
            <li>It works reasonably well to remove most of that hair.</li>
            <li>Its good for removing hair on your upper lip.  </li>
            <li>I now take care of it in the privacy of my own home as frequently as I need to.  </li>
            <li>I love this, so much easier than tweezing.</li>
            <li>But her smooth, hairless face from the use of the R.E.M. Spring is worth it.</li>
            <li>good price for this item since its only a spring</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I heard about this product on bubzbeauty youtube channel and i&#x27;m glad she spoke about it because it makes things so much easier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for the majority of hairs, but I still have to go back over and get the stubborn ones with tweezers.</li>
            <li>Was not painful either.  </li>
            <li>So much better than waxing and no worse than plucking.</li>
            <li>IMHO, it was not painful.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this product but it worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>will say I have developed a routine that for those who breakout like I do after any kind of hair removal has worked with REM Spring.  </li>
            <li>I told my mom and sister about it and they both purchased one and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>My daughter asked me to order a good product for facial hair removal.</li>
            <li>Good for the upper lip, but there is a lot of realstate when you go beyond that.  </li>
            <li>Stainless steel is hypo allergenic, and able to be  cleaned with rubbing alcohol, without worrying the coating is going to come off.</li>
            <li>This had such good ratings, I decided to buy</li>
            <li>The price @ 19.99.. not bad either.</li>
            <li>Small and handy, fits anywhere, good product</li>
            <li>No bad reaction, no bruising nothing with this device.</li>
            <li>I have very fine facial hair and more of it since menopause.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any product or service that would get rid of the very fine blonde fuzz on my face, now I have :).</li>
            <li>I experienced only mild discomfort the first time I used it -</li>
            <li>This device is small, handy, easily stored and effective and inexpensive for what it can do.  </li>
            <li>Now, I love havin&#x27; a good lookin&#x27; mustache every now and then, but the little lady says she prefers clean shaven skin.    </li>
            <li>This little gadget works great it quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than wax, less time consuming than tweezing and is totally awesome.  </li>
            <li>cannot understand why the REM company doesn&#x27;t explain how important it is to twirl your fingers in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy (unless you don&#x27;t read the two step directions first).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;s pretty easy to work with</li>
            <li>but a quick wash with soap and water followed by pulling apart the coils while the water ran full blast</li>
            <li>Well there is better detailed reviews on how to use it but as far as it working it works!</li>
            <li>I rated the Spring 4 stars because, while it does a great job removing most facial hair, it doesn&#x27;t do real well with coarse or very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Try it out, practice a little, get comfortable with it, and I think it&#x27;ll be a great purchase for anyone.</li>
            <li>But, I have finally found the next best thing to true permanent hair removal (which just doesn&#x27;t exist yet).</li>
            <li>And as other reviewers have said, youtube has some great videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other touchup is great too.  </li>
            <li>But, I have finally found the next best thing to true permanent hair removal (which just doesn&#x27;t exist yet).</li>
            <li>Seriously this is the best invention ever.</li>
            <li>Then once the first fine hairs are gone</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a quick pain.</li>
            <li>Make no mistake, there are many, many nerve endings on your upper lip, using this device stings-</li>
            <li>lol not so much in the upper lip but on the peach fuss on my face.</li>
            <li>It nothing more than a spring that could be purchased at most hardware or big Box stores.  </li>
            <li>They help the redness fade quickly...</li>
            <li>Hopefully this product will continue to be enhanced to make it more controllable, i.e. able to hone in on specific hairs to be removed.</li>
            <li>It grasps the hair at the root and with a quick twist pulls them out.</li>
            <li>What I like is that it doesn&#x27;t take out all of the hair (although I&#x27;m sure if you did it enough you could get rid of most of it).  </li>
            <li>I bought this recently and had doubts that it would really work, despite all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and as described.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essentially tweezing many, many hairs at once.  </li>
            <li>Now I can finally look for a job because I got my confidence back and this product is great!</li>
            <li>Quickly done, though, so not too bothersome.  </li>
            <li>This is the cheapest, easiest, most ingenious product for facial hair removal I&#x27;ve seen!  </li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>It happens quick but it happens none the less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>super quick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i just quickly do it at home.</li>
            <li>This works best to remove hair above my upper lip and below my lower lip and chin.  </li>
            <li>The quality is great and it is stainless steel so should last.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is quickly roll it over your hair and it rips it out.</li>
            <li>I can use this spring while I am watching TV or quickly before I apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great price, does what it says and very convenient.  </li>
            <li>With the spring I can just use it quickly and be done.</li>
            <li>It removes the hair fairly quickly without having to go over spots over and over.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so quick</li>
            <li>On my upper lip it&#x27;s better for me to let the spring be more of a frown vs a U.</li>
            <li>but I quickly figured it out-</li>
            <li>Shaving has left scars on my face and this is a cheap yet effective alternative.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and so efficient.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The only difference with my tweezers and REM it pulls out more hair at one time, so I see it more of a convenience of saving time.</li>
            <li>i will be honest it stings a bit more than expected.</li>
            <li>You will quickly figure out how it works and then refine your skills.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t grab some of the most noticeable ones, however--no matter how many different angles I approached them from.</li>
            <li>Like any hair removal product that takes hair out at the root, you will have a bit of redness after you use it, but it clears up quickly, and there&#x27;s no residue from wax, no drying out from creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I keep it in my purse and if I feel any hairs coming in, I can quickly remove them.</li>
            <li>As I got older, my moustache became more noticable.  </li>
            <li>It worked easily, quickly, and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The spring works quick no irritation.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li>All the good reviews are true - this is such a simple product in design, and so effective.</li>
            <li>This at least gets a lot of the hair, but it does seem to work better for the fine baby hairs and not quite as a good for the course ones.</li>
            <li>I bought this device after reading so many positive reviews and very much regretted it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best way to do a little maintenance each week and keep my skin looking smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It does get a little challenging under the chin area, but with practice I was able to figure out a way to do it, by holding the spring all the way on the top, rather than the bottom and getting on the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>This DOES work on very very course hair!</li>
            <li>you suffer from coarse hair and understand there willbe some pain, this is a very worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo3N5WSTO0GJK1Z]]This is a video showing my very first time using the REM spring.</li>
            <li>Pulling Spring is great; but don&#x27;t expect it to bring you back to the magic teen years like listening to \\&quot;Document\\</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this product for many years to come, especially since it&#x27;s of great durable quality.</li>
            <li>If I did it more frequently it probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt as much each time because my skin would be more adapted to using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased a threading tool at the same time and found the REM spring much easier to use and more effective.</li>
            <li>but once I nailed it down I was happy and hairless.  </li>
            <li>Super easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>Sit back and watch your favorite sitcom and tear the hair right out of your face.  :-)</li>
            <li>Okay, so I wasn&#x27;t very sure I should buy this little spring when I saw it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So long as you can handle inflicting the slight bit of pain it causes on yourself (which will improve as you continue to use it, as your hair will grow in more fine/thin), it works great!</li>
            <li>Its cheap, discreet, small, painless and most importantly IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li>and if you have stubble you&#x27;re probably trying to tug at new hair or you have to play more with the angle and the closeness of the spring to the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite new gadgets.</li>
            <li>I live it and my friends love it&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant to try something new, because, more often than not, they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The spring is so easy to use and does the job really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time.  </li>
            <li>but this is the best solution I have come across to keep away unwanted facial hair in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of haris on my chinny, chin, chin, and this product makes removing them fast and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and fast too.</li>
            <li>but once you do, it is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>But it works pretty good in removing facial hair.</li>
            <li>It really works and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even hurt that much and is easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This spring is so fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good solution to unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>It really works well and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to remove the hairs that weren&#x27;t a problem, but in the long run, this spring saves me a ton of time trying to eyeball the ones I want to remove, and I feel confident when I leave the house that no one is seeing any missed hairs.</li>
            <li>This product is really easy to use and is very efficient.</li>
            <li>I think this little spring is my new best friend!!!      </li>
            <li>I bought a second one to be  sure I always have one!  </li>
            <li>do it fast!!  </li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when it worked exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li>I purchased the REM Spring and in the first evening of getting it, I had managed to remove all of the hair that had been bothering me since I was a kid!</li>
            <li>and I felt it pulling out the hair on the first try!</li>
            <li>(At first I thought OMG!</li>
            <li>I actually kinda love this product!</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered this a year ago when I first saw it while researching NoNo!</li>
            <li>Not only is this device so simple, it works remarkably!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Best purchase lately!</li>
            <li>The REM is a great product an will save you so much money in the long run!</li>
            <li>Better than tweezing and waxing by far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to just pull it out, run it across my skin a few times, and be good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Think I maybe will try it a few more times to make sure my technique is good, but I think my main issue will be that it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>And if you have oily skin, you need to use a tissue to clean the skin first.  </li>
            <li>I had some problems with some of the fine hairs breaking, but I was rolling it too fast.  </li>
            <li>but once you do is the fastest most effective way to do it at home without the mess of wax or cream.</li>
            <li>If your skin is very sensitive to pain you might want to consider going to a professional (obviously you will still be in pain, but you aren&#x27;t inflicting it upon yourself), or bleaching might be your best bet.</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of experimenting with the amount of flex and how to turn the handles, but once you get used to it, it works great.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of the little hairs here and there great.</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of a learning curve but keep at it, great tool.</li>
            <li>What a great little investment.</li>
            <li>I use it on the fine, blonde hair on the sides of my face &amp; along my jawline &amp; it gives smooth hair free skin &amp; did not hurt a bit.</li>
            <li>After reading the great review on how to use this hair remover, I tried with little success.  </li>
            <li>if you do it right after a hot shower the pain is lessened significantly.</li>
            <li>I am 60, very fair and have always had a white blonde mustache and lots of stray chin hairs.  </li>
            <li>these little tweaks, I really love how effective this product is; you may have to go over an area a couple times to ensure that the hair is removed, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>More importantly it did an amazing job, this little gadget is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Although they&#x27;re fine hairs, I have too many hairs above and below my lips and they grow RIGHT up to my lips.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all very thorough and detailed.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of facial hair quickly, cheaply, and on their own schedule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for keeping face free from unwanted hair you might have to use almost 2- 3 times a week depends on how much hair you have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and the wife is really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This works amazingly and hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for weeks!</li>
            <li>After several sessions of practicing with this, I have the hang of it, and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>and it hadn&#x27;t really occurred to me that it was going to be a HUGE problem getting it to work for me.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the tool itself is fantastic and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is amazing how i don&#x27;t have to worry about taking time to use my tweezers or wax to get rid of my facial hair.</li>
            <li>this thing is amazing for facial hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth the asking price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still useful for on-</li>
            <li>Then there&#x27;s the fact that it hurts like a bitch in my more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>With all the phenomenal reviews on this product, I expected much more.</li>
            <li>It kind of makes me feel low at times.</li>
            <li>I found the R.E.M. Spring, it seemed like it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d give it a solid \\&quot;OK\\&quot; because it does what it says it will, but it&#x27;s not any kind of miracle product.</li>
            <li>I plan to order another one, so that I have a backup in my car for unexpected emergencies :)</li>
            <li>PLEASE try this if you suffer with the humiliation and hassle of unwanted facial hair, you will be so thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny of the purchase price.</li>
            <li>However, in all fairness my tweezer days may end completely as I become more proficient.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am so pleased it surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I cannot express how nice it is not to worry about my facial hair or 5 o&#x27;clock stubble.</li>
            <li>for 9.99 it seemed worth a shot...</li>
            <li>but it well worth it.</li>
            <li>While there is no product that will remove hair with no discomfort whatsoever, this one is by far the most tolerable I have come across.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with how smooth my upper and lower lips are.  </li>
            <li>Far better than that.</li>
            <li>I had so much fun using it, my husband was laughing at me.</li>
            <li>Worth the try for the price.</li>
            <li>It is more time consuming than waxing (which I can&#x27;t do anymore because it really irritates my skin), but really does remove the hair.  </li>
            <li>and I thought what the heck, it would be worth the try for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Far better then waxing and tweezing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this out for fun, as I read a number of reviews.  </li>
            <li>I would say this product ia by far the most painful&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I was surprised how great it was for the upper lip area.</li>
            <li>yes, it hurts, but its worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the quickest, easiest, most pain free facial hair removal technique I have tried.  </li>
            <li>well so was worth it).  </li>
            <li>My search for an effective facial hair removal technique ends here.  </li>
            <li>This is the most fantastic facial hair removal system I have ever found!</li>
            <li>as ive aged I routinely pay good money for &amp;#34;youth rejuvenation&amp;#34; that does not mix well with waxing.....i.e.</li>
            <li>It was worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>But we can just roll it over a few times a week to keep things nice and smooth and voila!</li>
            <li>If you want to be hairless and not spend a lot than you&#x27;ll tolerate it, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The results are worth it though.</li>
            <li>me, this product wins on all accounts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing to know is that you must approach the hair from opposite the direction of growth.  </li>
            <li>I have bought 3 and keep them handy because for me it is a constant battle.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective way to remove upper lip hair without the expense or pain of waxing and threading.</li>
            <li>It will be the best $17.00 you have ever spent on a facial hair remover product!!</li>
            <li>It is not thinning, but hey its nice to know that its not as noticeable when it does grow back</li>
            <li>It is totally worth every penny....</li>
            <li>It still hurts under the nose and probably always will but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I think for that, the pain was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I assume as I use it more frequently, the pain will decrease.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t give it enough stars.  </li>
            <li>Either way, the pain is worth getting the ROOT out.  </li>
            <li>Ripped out the soft hair on my top lip with no problem, also some hairs on my neck that I could never get to with tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth buying since you save lots of money on threading or waxing.</li>
            <li>I have gotten much better results when placing my fingers directly on the spring, and just rolling it upwards on my face.</li>
            <li>For that alone, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money, I have got my monies worth and them some.</li>
            <li>I am convinced I have the worlds most sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I received it yesterday and found it really useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>but soo worth it</li>
            <li>This product, so far, does not stand out from many others tried.  </li>
            <li>and SO WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>Success.  </li>
            <li>It is not as effective as waxing, but it works well enough that I am bothering to write this review.</li>
            <li>I would say worth the pain.</li>
            <li>It may take some time to get used to it, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this at all useful.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>The first time I twirled this spring around on my face, it&#x27;s true...</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve talked with friends who use it (and love it) and as far as I can tell I&#x27;m using the correct technique</li>
            <li>but its worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>One of the many products I&#x27;ve tried, this one by far is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely give any product just one star.  </li>
            <li>Who would have thought that a spring could be so useful.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice and not cleared all of the hairs yet from my upper lip, but with more practice I&#x27;m sure I will do a better job.</li>
            <li>and I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>the prize was alright its worth it</li>
            <li>I twist and turn and turn and twist and rarely can I get it to do what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>But&#x27;s it bearable and worth it...</li>
            <li>But, well worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes both hands to use, so it wouldn&#x27;t be useful for underarm hair.</li>
            <li>It seems kind of fragile to me...</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Even if you do, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It does take some getting use to (the motions necessary for it to be effective)</li>
            <li>It can hurt but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I recently had my face threaded not for the first time but after a long time, and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>Since it didn&#x27;t, it wasn&#x27;t worth the time or pain to me.</li>
            <li>This is a cool appliance - I like it because you don&#x27;t have to use hot wax and risk damaging your skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not pain free like most reviews stated</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>after reading all the reviews decided it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;overall , for the price maybe worth a try to see if it works for you</li>
            <li>But most of all, IT WORKS!!As far as tips for technique...</li>
            <li>It will hurt but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It will be well worth the the money.</li>
            <li>The first time will hurt, but after that it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Now i&#x27;m hair free on the lip and chin (&amp; have u ever really checked out the area right under the bottom lip?</li>
            <li>It saves me tons of time and is much easier than trying to look in the mirror and catch the right light to pluck each hair one by one.</li>
            <li>and it worked great, even on the stiff wiry hairs.  </li>
            <li>hairs at a single twist is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>so I was worried that like so many other things I have tried this product would work for most girls but not me.</li>
            <li>But it is perfect for any other facial hair.</li>
            <li>I was impressed enough when I used it by the 3rd use I was buying them and shipping directly to my 2 older sisters.</li>
            <li>It hurts much more than threading or waxing and takes significantly longer cuz you have to go over the same spot again and again.</li>
            <li>It does leave some redness, but that goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The best thing is that there is no mess, very little discomfort - and it really cleans up!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure that when you are trying to clean out the hair in the middle, you don&#x27;t stretch out the springs.</li>
            <li>but it is a very quick and easy way to get rid of those unwanted facial hairs.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, got rid of most hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>the end, my face felt smooth (temporarily) but in some areas didn&#x27;t really look it (fair skin, dark hair).</li>
            <li>and now I spend about one minute before bed every other night and have been delighted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying this really useful product!</li>
            <li>Good price too compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool to EVERYONE who wants smooth skin!</li>
            <li>It is better than the battery-operated facial epilators, because those tend to cut the hair and aren&#x27;t strong enough to pull most hair out.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect solution and now I have a little less stress in my life. :-)</li>
            <li>This brilliant spring is so easy to use and it grabs all the little hairs in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I just got it today and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the right product for years.</li>
            <li>or right before I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and you learn, right?</li>
            <li>Right???</li>
            <li>Maybe I just haven&#x27;t gotten the technique quite right yet, so I&#x27;ll keep at it,</li>
            <li>Look for an online video to help show you the right way to hold and turn this.</li>
            <li>- Wash your hands if you have to touch your face, or avoid doing so right after.  </li>
            <li>Also, I washed my face with a cleanser right after using the product and had no breakouts.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>As soon as I got the R.E.M. Spring, I used it right away.  </li>
            <li>this rips the hair right out.</li>
            <li>and I turned the side in my right hand clockwise</li>
            <li>Sister-In-Law tried it and want to order right away too.</li>
            <li>You just need to hold it correctly to use the product in a right manner.</li>
            <li>I used it right away and pulled hair out</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>I believe that is because I am not using it right.  </li>
            <li>Medicinal, right?</li>
            <li>Yeah, it hurt, but I numbed right below my nose with ice, and that helped a lot.  </li>
            <li>I had to turn the right handle clockwise</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>May be that I&#x27;m not using it right???</li>
            <li>Some people complain that it doesn&#x27;t work, but you just need to figure out the right moves.</li>
            <li>AND IT DOES HURT IF NOT DONE RIGHT.</li>
            <li>The spring grabs even the tiniest of hairs--you just might have to experiment to find the right angle to grab them.</li>
            <li>Just got the R.E.M. to day and used it right away.</li>
            <li>and I swear you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s bumped sliced bread right out of its coveted &amp;#34;Best Invention&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was not twirling it the right way and was getting nothing.  </li>
            <li>This will pull out *some* unwanted hairs, but skips right over others even after repeated attempts to remove them.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this hair removal tool out, because I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to remove those fine hairs on my upper lip without lots of irritation.</li>
            <li>I still go to the salon occasionally for brow shaping, but this is a great tool for general upkeep.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s a hundred times faster and more effective at removing the small (and almost unnoticeable) hairs.  </li>
            <li>Great not to constantly have to be paying for a depilatory, which leaves burn marks, and then the potency of the cream fades before you&#x27;ve barely gotten through the tube.  </li>
            <li>a pretty amazing simple product....</li>
            <li>Catches all the fine hairs, and after you let some of the coarse ones grow in longer, you can snag them up rather easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I have used this for quite a while now, and it by far hurts the most the first time you use it</li>
            <li>Honestly though I&#x27;m not sure how the instructions could be written better to explain it.</li>
            <li>Also I have very fair skin and many tiny red bumps appeared and lasted several days after I used the spring sprong.</li>
            <li>The valuable points are that it is very easily portable and you can work with it while you watch TV or wherever you are sitting (in private).  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out.  </li>
            <li>I kept it almost straight, and rolled it up and down, on my face and arms, and it worked great.</li>
            <li>At times, it almost felt rewarding to roll the spring up and down because I was so confident it was working.</li>
            <li>No regrets!  :-)</li>
            <li>This little tool is really handy!  </li>
            <li>yes it does sting a little but the rest just kind of didnt matter once I saw the hairs gone frm my face!</li>
            <li>The other reviewer assured me that after letting the hair grow in for about a week it would do fine, so I hid out in my house and allowed the hairs to reach a suitable length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the product and customer reviews, I was able to catch on quickly and got right to removing the hairs on my upper lip, chin, and cheek areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really only good for facial hair; doesn&#x27;t work well for anything else because the hair is not as fine</li>
            <li>It only seems to be good for fine hairs, not the thicker, coarser, terminal hairs of a beard, as a trans female friend</li>
            <li>so much I want to buy another one, because if I lose it, I won&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li>So excited to have a product that works great at removing the fine upper lip hair that I have had trouble waxing.</li>
            <li>It is safe and does not leave scars like waxing, and the more you do the less hair you will have to pull out and it will get finer.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have purchased a more cheaper one, but non the less, I am SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>With the area numbed, I don&#x27;t feel a thing and am able to quickly and thoroughly remove the hair above my lip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the hair coming back quickly like buzzing it off.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast, very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Often simply rolling it at an angle along the skin will grab hairs, but you&#x27;ll learn quickly how to get the most out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one I had for years stayed clean and smooth the whole time I had it and the new one appears to be holding up as well.</li>
            <li>but I put some moisturizer on and went to bed and woke up with smooth silkly, normal skin.  </li>
            <li>I still feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth with the first use</li>
            <li>The REM Spring is also great because it&#x27;s so small and portable, doesn&#x27;t use electricity, and its stainless-steel body has no disposable parts to damage the environment.</li>
            <li>but I use it for the thicker more apparent hair around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and just recently noticed much more peachy fuzz on my top lip.  </li>
            <li>I also experienced a couple small breakouts after use.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t leave feedback unless I&#x27;m dissatisfied but I felt compelled to tell about how great this product is.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t usually rush to write a review on this site, but for a product that makes me happy (threading cost me $20/visit, this thing cost about $15</li>
            <li>I have spent many a night tweezing that hair for a good 1-2 hours, globbing on morturizer to help ease the pain, and after a year of doing this nonsense, I decided to finally try out this so-called \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; hair remover...</li>
            <li>some of it dark though I am fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and my hair is naturally dark.</li>
            <li>I am really fair, with dark hair.</li>
            <li>WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin with dark hair</li>
            <li>I never have to worry about my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or missed hairs or people noticing the dark hairs and peach fuzz in good lighting</li>
            <li>hair(the long peach fuzz kind,</li>
            <li>Also, for those tight places, such as the sides of the face against the ear... I found that still bending the spring but putting one side of the spring against where you want the hair removed worked the best.</li>
            <li>I have lots of light, fine hair that keeps appearing around my upper lip, chin, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly noticeable (I didn&#x27;t think) except for in direct sunlight and at certain angles.  </li>
            <li>Better results, less pain and more consistent results with waxing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with facial hair and can&#x27;t believe how well this works and how easy it is!  </li>
            <li>but it doesnt seem to work to well on very very very fine hair thats short).</li>
            <li>Originally, I chose this product based on reviews, the price, and also that the particular one I was buying stated &amp;#34;no shipping charge.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The more hair you have to remove, the more you will feel it pull and that stings a little.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, it will hurt like hell at first (especially if you&#x27;re not used to tweezing), but it gets the job done WAY more efficiently and effectively than plucking individual hairs.</li>
            <li>It definitely works better on the more fine hairs that grow in a single direction.  </li>
            <li>I expect this is due to the shape of my face, since the spring seems to work better on a more convex surface and it&#x27;s easier to pooch out your lip than your neck.</li>
            <li>Smart and inexpensive!</li>
            <li>I did not know how to use it correctly at first, so I could not get any hairs up, but I kept trying until I had it right.</li>
            <li>This will save you that large sum of money you&#x27;d spend at the salon!</li>
            <li>(it feels like waxing without the goop), but overall, this is a great product for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li>It comes with attachments for ripping out the hair at the root on your face, body, anywhere really, and also has a shaver if you&#x27;d rather do that on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I found this product works best if I let the hair grow a few days, so I tried it on my upper lip and yea, it works</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, it&#x27;s really good for when you just want it to be over, takes less time than ripping out five or six hairs at once with tweezers.</li>
            <li>(Wax takes a while to dry, and lets be honest-</li>
            <li>This is a great product though, since you don&#x27;t get that obvious red mustache I see when women wax their lips.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, not messy like waxes and does the job on the lip and chin.</li>
            <li>This product is fast and quick.</li>
            <li>Well those few hairs seemed to be more and more often</li>
            <li>The middle area where people tend to get unibrows was an easy area to clean up.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient and quick.</li>
            <li>It is such a simple yet, great idea.  </li>
            <li>Overall - a great tool for your upper lip area.</li>
            <li>just wipe gently with warm water to cleanse and open pores.  </li>
            <li>and if you came really really close to my face you would have noticed them even as i am light skinned and the hair grows in very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that spun fast and you could just get it over with quickly</li>
            <li>I have heard that some companies falsely rate their own products and I can assure you that I am thrilled with this item.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine and the lightest colour of hairs so waxing and laser are not an option for me due to neither being able to pick up the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing or using creams for a long time and this is by far the best facial hair remover</li>
            <li>It hurts at first, but honestly it was more of a mild irritant for me, not too bad, kind of like when you first start plucking your brows.  </li>
            <li>Learning the knack of using the Spring Sprong is pretty easy, but if you want some tips just search YouTube to see the device in action.</li>
            <li>But overall, my chin is now very smooth</li>
            <li>VERY fast,</li>
            <li>I got it very fast</li>
            <li>Results are very much like waxing, without all the hassle that comes with waxing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very, very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>there are plenty of other users who have done a great job with that so far.  </li>
            <li>The Spring is AMAZING for super sensitive skin (waxing only irritates my skin &amp; lips)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Im 50 years old and frankly between the fine hairs and the occassional &amp;#34;whisker&amp;#34; its just too involved to get them all.</li>
            <li>Now no trouble with the fine fuzzies.</li>
            <li>Good alternative to threading and much cheaper on Amazon than other websites.</li>
            <li>All facial hair can be removed easily and fast leaving my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw this little gadget with its good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It was definately a good little investment to me.</li>
            <li>I have had laser hair removal, so I must say I am a little bias, but this is actually a good tool.</li>
            <li>I have had my original REM for about a year and it still works just like new.</li>
            <li>Pretty clever!!</li>
            <li>I can tell that it won&#x27;t hurt very much after this first time if you just do maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine, very light colored hair on my upper lip and a bit on my cheeks next to my hairline.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a smooth face.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s good for the upper lip area, particularly if you don&#x27;t like the idea of having a blade or an electric shaver near your nose, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Use a warm/hot wash cloth on your face first for a couple min.</li>
            <li>It works very well, but it does hurt!  </li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;m better off with a standard tweezer.</li>
            <li>It yanks the hairs out nicely, hurts like a sonuvagun for few seconds, but then I&#x27;m left with nice hairless skin.</li>
            <li>I am blessed with a lot of peachy facial hair and wanted to be able to remove it without using chemicals.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It really does hurt!</li>
            <li>This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking myself to the waxers to remove irksome facial hair for more than a decade now, but I&#x27;ll never go again.</li>
            <li>This device works remarkably well to remove even tiny hairs on the chin, cheek and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>(I love this thing, but not enough to create a demonstration video!</li>
            <li>so glad I took a risk and gave it a try, it is now the only thing I use.</li>
            <li>At first I was scared to use this because I heard it hurts a lot at first.</li>
            <li>It works very well too!</li>
            <li>hair removal itself isn&#x27;t particularly consistent, but if you stick with it you will get results.</li>
            <li>I washed my face before I used it, too, since I knew it would be my first use</li>
            <li>And, this is all accomplished without ANY irritation, redness, or breakouts whatsoever!</li>
            <li>Luckily I have decent eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about those (there is a warning in the package not to use this on the eye area).</li>
            <li>When I followed the directions perfectly, the R.E.M Spring Sprong failed to remove any of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty \\&quot;ouchy\\&quot; on my upper lip, but it does such a good job that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>If you tweeze, wax or use a shaving facial groomer, this is way better.</li>
            <li>it hurt like hell at first.</li>
            <li>This REM spring yanks them out pretty well.</li>
            <li>There is some pain at first</li>
            <li>I think this could just be my skin type, but be aware that it could happen to you.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re going to be able to pick up teeny tiny stubble</li>
            <li>Extremely fast service!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve managed to get this to remove thinner hairs, but I haven&#x27;t been able to grab the thicker hairs, so it hasn&#x27;t replaced regular visits to a threading salon for me.</li>
            <li>Now I must warn it hurts, alot the first time.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have read the reviews before trying to use this - it definitely takes some getting used to</li>
            <li>First of all this is a hair remover</li>
            <li>I recommend watching youtube videos first to get the hang of using it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t visualizing it correctly when I tried it the first time</li>
            <li>;  The second attempt was much better.  </li>
            <li>I was okay with it overall.  </li>
            <li>I got it in the mail today and went straight to the bathroom to use it!</li>
            <li>I think every Woman who wants to remove hair should use it!</li>
            <li>I have alot more hair even though mostly blonde on my face</li>
            <li>and I did love the results, plus my hair takes about 3 weeks to grow back.</li>
            <li>and eventually I had a smooth, soft, and hairless neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it hurts mostly around the upper lip....</li>
            <li>Seriously, we&#x27;re pretty hairy.  </li>
            <li>WHEN I USE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stings a bit when you first use it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because it does work if you practice with it, which only took me like 5 seconds to figure out because I found helpful reviews here.  </li>
            <li>When I went to use it for the first time today, I didn&#x27;t even read the instructions.</li>
            <li>quickly began pulling out the tiny fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>- It may not be as fast, but it&#x27;s far more gentle on the skin vs. waxing.</li>
            <li>- Make sure to exfoliate your skin one to two times a week, especially around the time you use this.</li>
            <li>Think of how much money you save over time!  </li>
            <li>Also, I would only wax areas that made sense with a strip, for many reasons, including cost.  </li>
            <li>It worked from me and now I have a higher self esteem</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not insecure anymore.</li>
            <li>The Spring was turned into a U for most of the time in use, and the ends were twirled in one direction or another or the same while I experimented</li>
            <li>After researching facial hair removal, I took a chance on this and love it.  </li>
            <li>It stings the first time you try it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this facial hair remover.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know any better because the women in my family didn&#x27;t talk openly about being hairy</li>
            <li>in more recent years.      </li>
            <li>I just used the spring sprong for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to waxing or tweezing, so the first time it hurt, but it beat taking the time to go to get it waxed or working with the wax..</li>
            <li>First time I was done in about 20 minutes, and my face is the smoothest it&#x27;s been in 15 years.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The price will make up for waxing after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Hello, I want to say first off that I have hair all over my face (lip, chin, cheeks, lots on my forehead, neck)</li>
            <li>But just the first time, ladies.</li>
            <li>but when it comes to the coarse post menopausal chin hairs, a razor does better.  </li>
            <li>washed my face first and then tried this out, hesitantly.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, however, that it works pretty well</li>
            <li>The first couple of times you use it prepare for some watery eyes.  </li>
            <li>I used it last night while watching a movie without a mirror or even a light on!</li>
            <li>It took me only about 5 minutes to figure out how to use it according to the directions, and I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will go faster next time.</li>
            <li>I was actually searching for the type of thread they use in threading techniques because I love the results of threading and wanted to do it myself at home for convenience...</li>
            <li>and you get the hang of it after the first time (or about 10 minutes of playing with it).</li>
            <li>(which people are bound to do the first time they try something).</li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She claims that after her first pregnancy, her hormones transformed her into a year-round werewolf.  </li>
            <li>Upon its arrival she raced to the bathroom and spent 30 minutes learning how to use it effectively.  </li>
            <li>Not too many but enough!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also advise moving in different directions on your skin to make sure you pull the hair from the angle that it is growing from.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this using the others reviewers suggestion of clockwise and counterclockwise</li>
            <li>First thing is first.</li>
            <li>But the first time I used it, I just started yelling passwords to my bank accounts because I thought someone was torturing me for information.</li>
            <li>I suspect it hurts more when you first start using it, but after multiple uses, I&#x27;m thinking it will hurt</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I had to figure this out for myself, whereas the company could have done a better job of explaining how to use it.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s SO FAST!  </li>
            <li>My cousin told me about the REM hair remover and purchased it as a gift for me, and I used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>im sooo glad I found this product and will definitely be telling my friends and sisters about this product.  </li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>It sat in my make-up kit for the last year,but after so many instances of burning my skin with all types of depilatory creams, I decided to give the R.E.M. spring another try.</li>
            <li>The spring REALLY works!</li>
            <li>You just have to practice to see what works for you, don&#x27;t give up if at first you don&#x27;t succeed.</li>
            <li>i used it on my upper lip/chin and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li>But overall I think it is ok.</li>
            <li>I use it only for my upper lip facial hair and it works great!</li>
            <li>you can prepare yourself but it still won&#x27;t help the first time.</li>
            <li>The first time is the hardest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve saved so much time &amp; money!</li>
            <li>It is fabulous, by far</li>
            <li>my favorite method of facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Similar to tweezing, but faster and easier, and it gets a lot more than I can.</li>
            <li>so much easier!</li>
            <li>And for what it does, I do not think it is worth that much.</li>
            <li>That and, how could something so simple be able to rip the hair</li>
            <li>I find myself constantly plucking, waxing shaving and never feel okay about results and do not want to go to the pros or cant afford to ..</li>
            <li>Okay for occassional use, not recommended for regular use.</li>
            <li>Yes it hurts at first,</li>
            <li>I have tried many different methods from tweezers, shavers, wax etc.  </li>
            <li>I used it when I first purchased Itami thought it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>I happened to look in my makeup bag and found the REM spring and used it and fell back in love.</li>
            <li>When you begin in more detail you can place the spring in multiple directions (not all of the hair &amp;#34;lays&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It pull out most of your facial hair easilly, and not hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>My colleague recommended me this product and I love using this product regularly.</li>
            <li>You will need some practice of holding it correctly when you will first start to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer this to waxing and it does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t work for me, until I read the instructions.</li>
            <li>Natural, reusable, economical, not messy, side effect free!  </li>
            <li>It seems to be able to pull the hair quite a bit, but some of the upper lip tends to look like you shaved...</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen with my first couple uses</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I thought it was another scam.</li>
            <li>I go over an area multiple times until I can&#x27;t feel it pulling any more hair</li>
            <li>Really, it is not difficult at all.</li>
            <li>*blush*)</li>
            <li>My first time using it was today.</li>
            <li>... waxing is really expensive to do consistently, but always gives me the best results.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to all my friends and will continue to send the link to anyone who is interested in a safe way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>The first day wowza</li>
            <li>I love this and use it several times a week to keep the wee hairs away!  </li>
            <li>but after that it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It amazed me how simple it removed so many hairs at one go.</li>
            <li>it works really well!</li>
            <li>in my experience, this product mostly picks up the near-invisible peach fuzz but barely picks up the darker, noticeable hairs that you really want</li>
            <li>It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt much more than plucking your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Today is the first time I have used it</li>
            <li>When holding the spring in a U-shape make sure both hands are place in the same manner (like holding a book), and then roll the ends of the spring towards your palms and then away.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that this one does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>But again, Becky is really really funny -</li>
            <li>I bought the REM Facial Hair Remover, and it took me awhile to get use to it, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this should go without saying, but I was curious to see if it would work on leg hair, so I tried a spot on my calf.  </li>
            <li>Guess what it really works!  </li>
            <li>It really pulls the hairs out!  </li>
            <li>suspect many users&#x27; difficulty lies in following the official directions too closely.  </li>
            <li>However,at first when you use it you will notice that it really \\&quot;smarts\\&quot; when the spring grabs a hair!</li>
            <li>So I was about to spend what I saw as waaaay too much money on the No!</li>
            <li>, so I first purchased the R.E.M Spring.  </li>
            <li>The first day I received it...</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know why I struggled in the first place!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pain only lasts like when you tweeze but pulls out more than one hair at a time.  </li>
            <li>you have to get the hang of it first</li>
            <li>that I love it and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>but after reading the reviews, I wasn&#x27;t feeling confident enough to order it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were many similar products</li>
            <li>still want to try and keep a groomed appearance and what girl doesn&#x27;t want to feel pretty?</li>
            <li>It pays itself off since it costs as much as a salon waxing!</li>
            <li>(got one the first time</li>
            <li>Tweezers definitely work better for me.</li>
            <li>This thing is so weird, but it is the best!!</li>
            <li>I first thought this isn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d mention is that I find it works better if you just twist both ends and roll over area that you want to move hair.  </li>
            <li>Tried to go with the knock off at first....</li>
            <li>This is better than shaving, so I use this and the tweezers now, totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you do have to go over areas more than once</li>
            <li>stung the first time I used it --</li>
            <li>It paid for itself with the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like others who have reviewed this product, I would recommend you first use it on your chin where you might not be as sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought one for a friend and another friend I told I told also bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tool, a real money saver!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it</li>
            <li>Definitely a must if you&#x27;re menopausal :-)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I missed a lot of hairs, but every time after that I got everything.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I am going to save so much money!</li>
            <li>This is still a 5 star product in my book since it clears my upper lip and chin better than anything</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will hurt quite a bit the first time</li>
            <li>but it hurts too much to get to that point!</li>
            <li>Yes, the first time you use it, it hurts.</li>
            <li>I started out with a pretty hairy stash (I let it go a bit knowing this thing was coming in the mail...</li>
            <li>haha!)</li>
            <li>The first time is a</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You need to leave a wide margin near brows when using it, and I hoped the REM spring would be useful to do that area, but it just didn&#x27;t grab the hair and I tried it on all areas of my face, even on my leg, just to give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li>At first I was iffy about buying this product, but decided to try it.</li>
            <li>and I tried it on many different types of hair follicles.....</li>
            <li>The REM spring does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much hair I had on my face until I received this thing!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever attempted to tweeze hair around your mouth and chin, then you know exactly what this contraption feels like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on the chin hairs, as it requires trying different positions to get those hairs if you have many and not just 1 0r 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried many things to get rid of facial hair...  </li>
            <li>Not painless but pretty close.</li>
            <li>Yes the first time hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>I fell in love and will not turn back!</li>
            <li>Removes hairs fast!</li>
            <li>, I just roll it in various directions to make sure I get all the unwanted hair out.  </li>
            <li>Fast and efficient!</li>
            <li>I would describe it as the same concept as threading but was able to do this myself at home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not difficult to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>This does the trick - fast!</li>
            <li>I found it pretty intuitive just through trial and error.</li>
            <li>and it has really changed my life!</li>
            <li>So the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;m aware of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, another rater said she almost gave up on using it because it did not work for her at first.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair remover for the first time.</li>
            <li>Initially  I wasn&#x27;t sure about how to use it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well -</li>
            <li>It got rid of all the prominent hair on my upper lip (side note here</li>
            <li>I suggest a glass or two of wine first, and an aspirin to kill the owies.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this is that you can feel it taking the hair from the root!</li>
            <li>can take out a lot of hairs at the same time leaving your skin smooth!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite way to remove upper lip hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am now that I finally bought it.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I am terrified of them ever discontinuing such a fabulous item!</li>
            <li>I had to go over my face hundreds of times over the course of several days to get it all, but eventually I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>but when you first start using it...</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well--at first.</li>
            <li>This spring didn&#x27;t hurt more than waxing, but it hurts in a different way.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so soft and smooth after using this on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME HURTS</li>
            <li>Within five minutes, I got more hairs close enough for my liking with almost no pain.</li>
            <li>In short I was able to ditch the razor, but not the tweezers.</li>
            <li>It is also practical to use because I actually keep it in my car and use it while stopped at a traffic light or in the parking lot before going into work!</li>
            <li>I was willing to lose $5 if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Hang in there, it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end because it really does work</li>
            <li>You really get your money&#x27;s worth with this product.</li>
            <li>First time I used it it took about an hour...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure this will be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>For it to work follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>So much better than shaving or waxing your facial hair.</li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t wash you face with soap before....</li>
            <li>I have gotten the more dang facial hair I have gotten.</li>
            <li>As for the pain I won&#x27;t lie the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Read the instructions for use by the first &amp;#34;most helpful&amp;#34; reviewer.  </li>
            <li>I have light and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li>Warning: The first time will make your eyes water if you have a lot of hair to remove.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most convenient way of removing facial hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the R.E.M. spring after reading many reviews on just about every facial hair removal spring.</li>
            <li>I use it everywhere on my face, because I&#x27;m pretty hairy.</li>
            <li>This is quicker than tweezers, but also pulling out multiple hairs makes the pain more tolerable.</li>
            <li>so i tried it again when my face was getting better and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>after I wash my face at night (to remove any bacteria off my face first).</li>
            <li>At first, it&#x27;s kinda tricky to use but you will learn how to use it after a while.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use any chemicals to remove unwanted facial hair!</li>
            <li>Glad something so simple like this exist.</li>
            <li>Within minutes I was able to watch tv and use at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products for facial hair:  bleaching, depilatory cream, shaving, wax.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty embarrassing and took about a year to get it to lighten with prescription cream.  </li>
            <li>A good set of tweezers is more effective and time-saving -- which makes this product pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li>Its quick &amp; easy, mess free.</li>
            <li>I had pretty good success on my chin/jawline area, but that was the somewhat  less fantastic of the three areas (upper lip, cheeks, and chin).</li>
            <li>The spring really does work, even if your facial hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>and rolling it briskly back and forth worked perfectly to pull out every last little fine hair that often escapes my imperfect attempt at waxing...</li>
            <li>No more waxing, this is a great and easy way to get rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li>and  really soft skin (thanks to my mom!!!)</li>
            <li>But, due to the abundantly high number of good  reviews I decided to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li>As someone that is growing older (aren&#x27;t we all....) and sprouting more and more little hairs in places where they don&#x27;t belong</li>
            <li>Waxing isn&#x27;t always effective for me, and shaving feels like a waste of time since my hair grows quickly.</li>
            <li>I guess my sking is way more sensitive than many of the other posters.</li>
            <li>I will try to give an update as to how often I have to use this product to maintain my face as it is now-not completely hairless, there are VERY short fine hairs remaining, you know like most normal people!  </li>
            <li>It is not painless BUT it is not painful either a little above the lip but the res of the face is great.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic little tool - hurts like a son-of-a-gun the first time, but gets better after that, since you&#x27;re just maintaining.  </li>
            <li>There is minimal discomfort, and a little bit of finagling in order to find the best hand position at first , but it WORKS.</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of time, but you don&#x27;t really need a mirror and you can do a pretty good job while you watch TV.</li>
            <li>find that it helps to shower, or at least wash my face, in very warm water if I&#x27;m having difficulty.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s more of gentle curve than a proper U-shape, it might catch the hairs better because the space between the spring is smaller.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay if the hair you want to remove is fine and your skin is reasonably firm.</li>
            <li>While it seems to grab and pull out the natural, fine hairs of your face without issue (and really, who needs that?)</li>
            <li>Love that it gets fine, fluffy hair on cheeks and jaw line.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and works as described by other Amazon reviewers.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it is not dark hair, but light colored peach fuzz hair that coats our faces.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised and happy with this little device.</li>
            <li>So, watch the videos so that you are a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than waxing and a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t grab coarse hair so well, and works pretty much only on skin that is fairly smooth/taut, so, because two hands are needed to operate it, it doesn&#x27;t work too well at all for those who would have to pull their skin taut to shave it.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I expected, and honestly did not hurt nearly as much as I had thought, based on reviews.</li>
            <li>I almost gave up and thought about tossing it, but then I decided to experiment since there were other people who liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive though too, and I know that, so I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t more irritated for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive though too, and I know that, so I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t more irritated for longer.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to lay it flat on the face and then twist.  </li>
            <li>I find that when laid completely flat, it removes hair much better than when bent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many of these products prey on those of us who are willing to try just about anything if we believe it will really work, especially for a problem we find embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product only a month ago (it seems like so much longer because I have grown to love and rely on it so much!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and of a simple concept, is fast and effective at hair removal, AND extremely cost effective in the long run.</li>
            <li>If you can stretch your skin to a very tight point and hold it there, this product might be good for you.</li>
            <li>Its not really visible unless in direct bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>After removing the hair, I lightly rinse out the upper lip with warm water and pat it dry.</li>
            <li>but it really does get better even after the second use.</li>
            <li>- Make sure you try it from different angles, and try to turn the device into an upright U-shape if some hairs aren&#x27;t being plucked up, or even somewhat straight.</li>
            <li>Especially when you get to that nice soft skin under your chin.</li>
            <li>Much safer than sugar wax on the face - which can sometimes pull off the top layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still hurts like heck, after several months of use.</li>
            <li>Essentially i spun the spring between my thumb and pointer finger as though I was snapping those two fingers (but more gently) and had no issues with figuring it out.</li>
            <li>more U shaped and hold it with my fingers twisting actually on the spring real close to the U.</li>
            <li>The REM Spring Facial Hair Remover makes it much easier to take care of more area at once.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t use it much as it hurts way more than tweezer plucking or facial threading.</li>
            <li>note that this is good for facial hair only.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this little tool.  </li>
            <li>My face is completely smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and NO pink spots!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I am very pleased with this little device.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and had absolutely no problem using this product right away!!!</li>
            <li>This little gadget is the best facial hair removal method that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I found it really easy to use on my upper lip, got it on my first try.</li>
            <li>I will never trust positive Amazon reviews again.  </li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews on this product, and decided to give it a try as it was inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sister, mom and cousins have had positive experiences with this tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little tool is easy to use, easy to keep with you in your makeup kit</li>
            <li>No more worries about bright sunshine, close-up encounters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the spring for about a month or so now, and wanted to set the record straight since my first review.</li>
            <li>As some of them have mentioned, it takes a little bit to figure out how to best use it, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a little different for everyone.  </li>
            <li>First, let&#x27;s be real.  </li>
            <li>This is actually pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>I decided  to do my normal 1 by 1 tweeze job on as many of the really coarse hairs first</li>
            <li>hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting married in 6 weeks and have been absolutely dreading the upclose outdoor pictures-our venue is a community park and getting pictures at dusk will be unavoidable.  </li>
            <li>Any time I wax, I&#x27;m pretty much guaranteed that within a day or two, I have a handful of pimples in the waxed areas.</li>
            <li>I am just a real hairy person which is pretty embarrassing considering the fact that I am a woman.</li>
            <li>Before long I had built up what looked more like a Q-tip bulb shape on each end.</li>
            <li>The whole point of epliators is to prevent the noticeable stubble in the first place.</li>
            <li>After the first couple times it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>(I really think the hot towel helped).</li>
            <li>I  do recommend this product.. for minor hair issues or even more</li>
            <li>I had absolutely no problem figuring out how to work it: it even works great just rolling it flat</li>
            <li>Strange to say that it does make me feel better about subjecting myself to pain when I watch someone else cringe in pain.  </li>
            <li>Bend it into a U shape and simultaneously twist it using the ends, it gets pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit painful (kind of like tweezing a bunch of hairs at a time on your lip) but the final result is perfect!  </li>
            <li>Read the other reviews and figured the only thing I had to lose was the joy of sitting around with a Santa Claus beard of hair remover.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these one for my friend and one for me, she saw them on tv at first it was her who asked me to order it for her, i didnt want it, but after thining about my peach fuzz (even though i dont have much)</li>
            <li>That works okay, but not nearly as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much, plan to send to family and close friends as gifts, but only those who won&#x27;t be offended by receiving a hair removal product that really works well.</li>
            <li>I experienced a little break out on my chin where I hadn&#x27;t ever removed hairs, but my upper tougher lip was better overall for the wear!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has done well removing fine hairs from the upper lip and slowed their regrowth there, BUT unfortunately not so well on chin hairs.</li>
            <li>but once you get it down, it is effective.</li>
            <li>This causes the spring to move up and down catching the hair.</li>
            <li>(Vellus hairs being the light, fine hairs like peach fuzz while the terminal/androgenic hairs are the coarser dark ones.)</li>
            <li>While branching out like this is an ingenious way to avoid leaving the house (getting prescription refills for your hypertension and high cholesterol is such a pain on tour!</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair, and I&#x27;m super paranoid about the peach fuzz on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I am sooo glad I gave this product a try, and I plan to continue to use it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li>This could be my experience because I don&#x27;t let those more noticeable hairs get very long</li>
            <li>Also, for those who complain about in-grown hairs and red bumps - clean your skin before using and use an astringent right after.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun-to-use tool for removing facial hair and it&#x27;s soooo easy.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use, and it actually works...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, no fuss and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I can even take it on the road quite easily and use as necessary...</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quick I caught on to it.</li>
            <li>Hair grows back after a week for me, but my hair growth is very quick anyway.</li>
            <li>Removes hair easily from cheeks, chin, and upper lip area.</li>
            <li>I like this thing- simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant so my skin is ultra sensitive</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something easy then search not further.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m part Italian, but instead of having skin that tans easily in the summer, I was blessed with hair...</li>
            <li>It looks easy enough but no hair comes off for me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take all that long and my whole face feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li>I can easily &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; them off multiple at the time rather than sit and pluck each one.</li>
            <li>It stings a bit first use but my upper lip is free of hair.</li>
            <li>it was very simple and easy to remove hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like an odd kind of acne and looks to me like an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>The R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover is easy to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li>This was really effective for the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>But now when I would grow the hair out and go get it waxed the wax wasnt strong enough to pull the hair out.</li>
            <li>i think that it works best on medium to thick hair or long</li>
            <li>I am sure that the band members love the product (when you get old, hair comes out of your nose, ears and other unexpected holes)</li>
            <li>What I love is that is gets every single hair, even ones you don&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call this a painless procedure</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d take the word &#x27;painless&#x27; out of their advertising though, because it certainly isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>from 100% Pure, or Avalon Organics&#x27; lemon hand &amp; body lotion.  </li>
            <li>We got this for my mom, who was ready to spend quite a bit on a home laser hair removal system but we saw this and the positive reviews and for the price, thought what the heck?</li>
            <li>and I have to buy a new one!!</li>
            <li>I live in Los Angeles and it can get pretty hot here...</li>
            <li>Life is not perfect but we live with it best</li>
            <li>the instructions are so small that i had to use my own intuition to get it work right.</li>
            <li>For me, it was actually less irritating to my skin than threading, which was great... and ironic since it hurts more!</li>
            <li>Everyone talked about how much it hurt, but honestly, I think it hurts much less than waxing.  </li>
            <li>Such a fast and easy solution.  </li>
            <li>Removing facial hair is easy and fast for me now..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will have to remember to put my hair all up as it will easily grab a stray long hair ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The pain would be worth it if it was quick but going over a spot several times is just not tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s just like a minature slinky with handles, and probably costs $0.01 to manufacture, but compared to the cost of other hair removal systems and the sheer ingenuity and speed of the product, it&#x27;s worth the $13.00 any day!!</li>
            <li>It works as quickly as you can move your fingers, no mess, no smell, no skin rashes.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use by following the simple instructions and now my face and chin are smooth and hairless.  </li>
            <li>This tool is not for fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely works on any hair - even fine hair, but hurts like woe.</li>
            <li>Make sure you dry your Spring thoroughly if you do this!  </li>
            <li>[...] bucks for one time, that you can use without a mirror, sitting in front of the TV, and within a half hour or so be nice and smooth, with no irritated and red skin.</li>
            <li>the hair that does grow back grows back lighter which is even better!</li>
            <li>I use it to remove facial hair and it works really fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine, blonde hair</li>
            <li>Does not work on fine white hairs</li>
            <li>I did get this product to remove all the fine hairs on my upper lip but it took quite a while and a lot of twisting and bending the spring at all angles.</li>
            <li>I get fine fuzz on  my upper lip that I have been either bleaching or waxing since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I have fine blond peach fuzz on my upper lip and jawline</li>
            <li>Been looking for something that works well for fine facial hairs.</li>
            <li>My friend and I have decided we&#x27;re going to do each other next time, after a nice glass of wine!  </li>
            <li>It works fine if you have an hour to spend just getting the hairs on your upper lip!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also misses hairs, both fine and coarse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-very fast to remove large amount of hair as opposed to tweezing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, since I had a large area to remove hair from, my skin was very irritated by the time I was through.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing little product...</li>
            <li>This little thing is so effective.</li>
            <li>But after that first initial hair removal, use every other day and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I thought it would be a little easier than threading my own face</li>
            <li>My first step to a clean upper lip was to try an at home waxing strip.</li>
            <li>It only really works on the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>It works really well on fine, &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; facial hair -- chin, lip, etc.  </li>
            <li>and I have a pretty high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>We are not quite out of the throws of the recession and unemployment rates are still high, the cost of things is higher still.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not buying a No No! as it has not gotten very good reviews, and is expensive - so the REM will have to do the job.</li>
            <li>This is a great little gadget for removing hair on the upper lip, lower lip, and chin area.</li>
            <li>The upper lip was quite easy; the corners of the mouth, not near as easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of threading but the problem is, threading is tough to do on your own.</li>
            <li>I like the tool but the little handles would be far more comfortable if they were rubber covered.  </li>
            <li>I thread well enough for my own purposes, but it hurts a little more than going to a professional lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came before expected, in perfect condition and would recommend to others who need to do a tough up more than once a week on facial hair.</li>
            <li>It does sting a bit, flat out HURTS on the upper lip, but if you continue through the pain it gets better fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I got my R.E.M. Spring in the mail yesterday and WOW my face today is complete free of hair (except, of course, my eye brows and lashes).</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well (especially for the price) on facial hair</li>
            <li>This is great for those light, barely noticeable hairs on the upper lip and sides of the face,but if you have the coarser, darker hair on the chin and neck, it will have to grow to a noticeable stubble before it is long enough for the spring to catch.</li>
            <li>For the hairs that is still visible and left on my face after using the REM, I just grab my tweezers and do a quick clean up, so that my face can be completely smooth and clear of unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>R.E.M., while successfully removing my dark facial hair, would not grasp the white hairs (which are coming in more frequently as I age).  </li>
            <li>This works really, really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this device, however, the description of how to use it is way off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m discontinuing use of the spring as the primary way for hair removal and going back to waxing.</li>
            <li>so I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned brunette who comes from a very hairy family.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I found that this didn&#x27;t really work that well.  </li>
            <li>and it really does the job in seconds.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soooo much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Now, I do have fast regrowth</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it tends to grab the longer, coarser hairs, aka the hair you really want to be gone, and doesn&#x27;t do a \\&quot;clearcut\\&quot; like shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>Thanks god I accidently saw this when i was looking for an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, once you figure it out and get over the \\&quot;first-use\\&quot; pain, it really seems to do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It REALLY does the job.  </li>
            <li>you use it but as much as it hurts I do not think I will use it too often</li>
            <li>have preferred threading to waxing for its gentle, non-chemical approach.  </li>
            <li>This product was much easier for me to use than waxing.</li>
            <li>I did put some oil free moisturizer on my upper lip after to prevent any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This spring works very well</li>
            <li>This product does in 5 minutes what I could never have accomplished with hours of plucking.</li>
            <li>High five to that person!</li>
            <li>5 stars for giving me a smooth hairless upper lip, chin, and sideburns.</li>
            <li>Now she wants me to get rid of my butt hair...  </li>
            <li>Shoot, it&#x27;s cheap enough...</li>
            <li>This tool makes the plucking a much faster process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(so hopefully i won&#x27;t get the acne others were complaining about- thanks for the tip guys) and put this baby to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will stick to waxing, thanks.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>this is much like threading but way easier.</li>
            <li>I had very course hair,</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening to MY story.</li>
            <li>only downside I can name is that it&#x27;s not as precise as threading.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t really bother explaining how to use it...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t ever realize how much hair I had on my face until this--</li>
            <li>The pain is minimal in most areas  3.</li>
            <li>I found that it was much easier to learn how to use it by watching videos than the instructions provided in the box when you purchase the spring.  </li>
            <li>I just twist it while it is straight - like</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much time in my day.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working very well.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think there was much of a learning curve with this thing at all.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really think twice about how to use</li>
            <li>My wife really feels that it is a time saver, because she doesn&#x27;t have to painstakingly take one hair out at a time with tweezers.</li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as plucking because it pulls the hair out fast by the root</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>It was also much gentler on my face than my electric epilator that I use for my body.  </li>
            <li>I use a scrub, sonic brush or enzyme peel (mostly a gentle peel), depending on my mood/circumstances.</li>
            <li>No pain or bumps and the same smooth results.</li>
            <li>This was interfering with my whole life.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really hairy just try what I did and you won&#x27;t regret it.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s too much surface area.</li>
            <li>I tried covering it up with make, like that really helps -_-.</li>
            <li>I cant remember when the last time my face looked &amp; feeled so smooth.</li>
            <li>that I can&#x27;t see very well to tweeze.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and leaves my face really smooth.</li>
            <li>For most people i&#x27;m sure it will last a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Could have saved so much money on waxing at the salons.</li>
            <li>so much I want to tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li>The one downside is that you can really feel it.</li>
            <li>But it has made me very self-conscious for years.  </li>
            <li>and it really hurt.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think about it too much.</li>
            <li>I didnt have to curve it so much .</li>
            <li>In some areas it was almost straight.</li>
            <li>This is soooo much easier and faster than tweezing.</li>
            <li>, long-term product made of stainless steel&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this thing.</li>
            <li>This is so fast.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I use this around my face while watching a movie or something, and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a real hair \\&quot;problem\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Not too much.</li>
            <li>This removed all the hair and was much faster than plucking.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to find something to make removing unwanted chin hairs faster and easier.</li>
            <li>and it does it very well.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it is only as precise as it&#x27;s width (about the circumference of a pencil).</li>
            <li>I came across this product by accident and it intrigued me so much that I just HAD to buy it.</li>
            <li>I spent more time trying to figure out how to grab the hair than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 10th or 12th session, and it really doesn&#x27;t bother me much at all.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no worse than when you pluck an eyebrow hair out.  </li>
            <li>This tool really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no wuss, but I was ready to throw this thing and hide under the covers.  </li>
            <li>This product really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It is very simple to use and my chin was baby smooth after just one use.</li>
            <li>though not as much as when I pluck, go figure.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I was ready to toss the thing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and hair-free, even after only one use!  </li>
            <li>is very paimfull product  </li>
            <li>it goes much easier.</li>
            <li>However it will probably vary from person to person as to how much pain you</li>
            <li>I works really well for chin and lip hair, but aside from that I don&#x27;t see it working for anything else.  </li>
            <li>However, this spring doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the hair from the sides of my face very well.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest washing your face after using, because my face broke out with acne which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>It really really hurts though.</li>
            <li>It takes some figuring out, but with practice it works very well.</li>
            <li>but the YouTube videos were very helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I think the price is well worth it and far cheaper and convenient</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m entering my opinion because I really do know this product works.</li>
            <li>ANYTHING that yanks hair straight out of the follicle is gonna hurt</li>
            <li>for the darker hairs, they are stronger and I think they were pulled out at the root because I cannot see themat all -- no broken off ones at all.  </li>
            <li>can use this when I get out of the shower, and by the time I am ready for makeup, there is nothing to hide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin has started to feel baby smooth but not entirely yet..</li>
            <li>my jaw area neck and chin do not hurt that much</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as tweezing or waxing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I never realized how much hair I had on the side of my face  and cheeks.</li>
            <li>This tool removes the whole hair and roots.</li>
            <li>thanks, Val</li>
            <li>/&gt;Years ago, I had an electric epilady that was much like this spring</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do really like this spring thing.</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;d be amazed at how much hair it</li>
            <li>But it works really well.</li>
            <li>I think there was one cheaper option on Amazon, but I bought this one because it is stainless steel instead of some mystery metal.</li>
            <li>so  it really takes time and fortitude to  do it..</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very portable.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I have quite a lot of them and it&#x27;s really embarrassing.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to pluck one by one, so I was really hopeful when I saw this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wow...it really hurts.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it because it really does work.</li>
            <li>because it got a lot more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Feels like \\&quot;threading\\&quot; but much gentler.  </li>
            <li>a week-- Pulls off hair gently-- follow directions and twist as indicated.  </li>
            <li>should mention too that I have very sensitive/fair skin-</li>
            <li>I tried an epilator before that was designed for the face, but I found that it just broke off the hairs at the skin and didn&#x27;t really pull them out.  </li>
            <li>I tried an epilator before that was designed for the face, but I found that it just broke off the hairs at the skin and didn&#x27;t really pull them out.  </li>
            <li>works incredibly well without damaging skin, even in difficult areas.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very hairy on my face.  </li>
            <li>And thanks.  </li>
            <li>And if you want to see it in action, and laugh your head off, you have GOT to look at the video review by Becky (beckygardens).  </li>
            <li>This product REALLY hurts.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what it was designed for and it does it VERY</li>
            <li>It works really well, but it’s not for weenies.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>, I have never had a smooth upper lip before I tried this product.</li>
            <li>was very painful,cannot use it</li>
            <li>However, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>My upper lip is hair free</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very tiring to use.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to control the amount of pressure you place on the spring, and the direction you want it to go in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheaper than my cheap facial wax person (though she is a pleasure to see.)</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Really, you have GOT to try this.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it really does work.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt me as much as she indicated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>or you have to be really, really, really patient.......</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and there is no telltale sign that I have recently removed any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not so straight areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So really don&#x27;t try that.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much faster than using chemical infused creams and waxing.  </li>
            <li>The spring works very well, yes</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>they are MUCH cheaper and just as well reviewed.</li>
            <li>By the way, I don&#x27;t think it really hurts.</li>
            <li>Light colored facial hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>: The shipping was EXTREMELY  fast</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Plus it is made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>I tried to use a battery operated elpilator, and it really didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Really am going to like this.</li>
            <li>Get ready to save a ton of time and money from not having to wax anymore.</li>
            <li>Very well made product.</li>
            <li>Worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>and then I smeared my face with an antibiotic lotion and let it be that way the whole day.</li>
            <li>I do it in patches and stop when the pain is a bit too much to bear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt much.  </li>
            <li>weeks before ordering the R.E.M. Spring but using the two products together seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why everyone loves it so much.</li>
            <li>hahaha.  </li>
            <li>aside, I don&#x27;t see how anyone could argue against the fact that the thing really works.</li>
            <li>and you really have to work it to pull it out.</li>
            <li>Works really well at removing hair from the roots.  </li>
            <li>Any tips on how to not make it hurt as much??</li>
            <li>people have reasonable directions on use, and suggest reading those.  </li>
            <li>It is neat and very efficient</li>
            <li>This shows nothing and is so fast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it on my lips, it hurts way too much.</li>
            <li>Much quicker than plucking and lasts longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>and he confirmed that the twisting motion torks (muscles moving in opposite directions)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that much to me</li>
            <li>cuz I&#x27;m really used to the threading.</li>
            <li>I have light hair that you can only see up close, but I still prefer to get rid of it so that makeup goes on easier</li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like that this is made of stainless steel</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>She really is a delight and shows you how to use this tool.</li>
            <li>Within 5 minutes my upper lips was hair free - 3 of those minutes were trying to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>and it really hurts.  </li>
            <li>Since the R.E.M. covers a wide area, I figured it would capture many in one swoop.  </li>
            <li>Also with frequency there is ltitle to no pain because there isn&#x27;t as much hair there.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>If you give this product some practice it really works.  </li>
            <li>Very  embarrassing tho</li>
            <li>What I like about it is the control that you have, especially in sensitive area.</li>
            <li>and once you get the hang of it you can do it so fast and in any position-</li>
            <li>face broke out just as much using the R.E.M as it did using the epilator.  </li>
            <li>But it does work and keeps the hair off much longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I twist the ends, no hair is removed from either my lip or chin.  </li>
            <li>It does really work well</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>but I really do think it depends on the area where you are trying to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I can say that much..</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try the No No, but after reading the reviews, decided to look for an alternative solution.</li>
            <li>I really did, but it was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>And, this is all accomplished without ANY irritation,...</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wash my face really well and use a toner before using the spring.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out nearly as much.</li>
            <li>I have never felt such smooth skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>The whole inverted U thing?</li>
            <li>This was at a straight line rather than a U, and I can try places that are supposedly off limits like the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think this would work, but boy it does.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much on this item, bought it for my sister...</li>
            <li>I use it daily (just to keep completely smooth).  </li>
            <li>No worse pain than plucking.</li>
            <li>Why is something that hurts us so much so addicting?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t belive how much hair is on my face that I can&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use, you can use it while watching TV.</li>
            <li>Thanks God for YouTube.</li>
            <li>the first time I used this product it took some practice and second, it took some getting used to the pinching of hair pulling (not like waxing), especially the first time when you have the most dense amount of hair to remove.  </li>
            <li>Then on a cotton ball, gently apply some astringent or clarifier to close pores (will sting a bit).  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this product.  </li>
            <li>This tool is much beter than the alternative waxing or plucking one by one.  </li>
            <li>You really can just use it while watching t.v.</li>
            <li>this really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but when you get the hang of it, this product really works.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>hahaha...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t getting much hair, but I persevered and now I&#x27;ve got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the product but honestly, with the coarser facial hair I have</li>
            <li>Not being able to disinfect it completely you don&#x27;t want to risk the possible infection to another</li>
            <li>Not being able to disinfect it completely you don&#x27;t want to risk the possible infection to another person.     </li>
            <li>Definitely takes some getting used to the pain associated with tearing your hair out of a sensitive area, but the money saved on waxing makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>The sensation is the same pain factor as tweezing and it does not work effectively as it leaves the smaller, finer hairs intact.  </li>
            <li>think the most sensitive spot, for me, was upper lip</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with this product, finally a facial hair remover that actually does what it says it will!</li>
            <li>--this actually results in a more youthful and natural look than methods that remove all the hair, like waxing or shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was kind of a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>As a male, I wanted to be able to remove hair near my ear.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so the first time did hurt (like waxing or threading does), but after the first time it didn&#x27;t hurt so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as pain is concerned, I&#x27;m sure it is all relative and quite subjective.  </li>
            <li>I am a 50 year old woman going through &amp;#34;the change&amp;#34; and we all know that means more facial hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a few minutes to learn to use it effectively ...</li>
            <li>is a simple yet very useful beauty tool.</li>
            <li>I also found it hurt less after a hot shower when my pores were more</li>
            <li>Upper lips get smooth, look clean... and are beet red from the loss of the epidermis and part of the dermis .....</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this device,the price really sold me, but I rolled it all over my face, and each time it only snatched out 1 or 2 hairs.</li>
            <li>but as I got older and approached that big milestone birthday, I wasn&#x27;t loving the fuzz staring back at me in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>As far as cleaning or getting those hairs out of the spring - I found that if I held on to both ends and quickly pulled the spring apart and snapped it back together quickly removed the hair -</li>
            <li>hair re-growth is absolutely normal with what I experienced waxing, I&#x27;ve had it about a month and used it once thoroughly and did a little retouch two weeks later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard, just takes a little practice, but then does a great job of removing all that unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I made sure to wash my face both before and after use.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt but that brief moment of pain is so worth it!  </li>
            <li>GET THIS, YOU WILL FEEL NORMAL!</li>
            <li>Personally, I find it fun!</li>
            <li>I like this one better than the other brand I have</li>
            <li>The other thing I like about this better than waxing is I do it weekly</li>
            <li>and i think i am going to be excited to see what else it does in the future!</li>
            <li>So much better than waxing or crème removers or any other thing that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>If you are familiar with threading then using this product is similar to that.</li>
            <li>I am ordering two more, one for purse and the other for my travel bag.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with many reviewers that this product was a little tricky to figure out at first.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of practice figuring out exactly how to hold and twist it, and different positions work better for different parts of the face.  </li>
            <li>Using the first time over the top lip I would suggest doing little sections as it does ouch.</li>
            <li>I was really excited that this was something I could use to rid my upper lip of the mass quantities of peach fuzz that exist without the use of chemicals and wax.</li>
            <li>Better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I used it The first day and loved the results, until a few hours later when my face broke out.</li>
            <li>The pain is intense for the first few uses but eventually it gets more bearable.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>And I am SO EXCITED about my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>immediately i placed an order i was really excited about these product finally today</li>
            <li>Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day and you&#x27;ll likely be more successful taking your time by spreading it out, a little every day or every other day.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s plucking method better than any other hair removing or bleaching methods for my face.</li>
            <li>Suck it up the first time and you too will fall in love with this little darling.</li>
            <li>You are rubbing a metal surface on your face, it will pick up oil and dirt from other areas, so you may be more prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you twist one end counter-clockwise and the other clockwise.</li>
            <li>Threading on the other hand is more controlled.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had invented this unique tool and was banking the well-deserved money earned.  </li>
            <li>The other reviews are all correct, I was glad I read them because I was just about to spend the $200 on another product.</li>
            <li>As with many of the other reviewers, I will also say that it is not painless.  </li>
            <li>Hurts like heck when trying to get some of those stubborn facial hairs, but worth it!  </li>
            <li>Other areas I was able to continue to use it without taking a break for a breather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Threading was the best of the bunch, but it was expensive and there wasn&#x27;t any place I could get it done near where I live.</li>
            <li>Now, I will say that I am still fairly new at using this thing as I have only used it a couple of times, but i can say that,if you can get through the first session (made my eyes water), it&#x27;s not nearly as bad after that.</li>
            <li>Keep mine in the car and clean that upper lip on my morning drive in to work.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt any more, first few times it does hurt but now it does not.</li>
            <li>It got better as I progressed, as I guess the first few pulls were the longest.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt the first few times the most</li>
            <li>First, minor but true</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had my lip and eyebrows waxed or threaded, but never my chin because I was too embarrassed to let it grow long enough for an effective waxing.</li>
            <li>This thing is effective, and the results last a long time, 3 to 4 weeks for me.</li>
            <li>What a handy little thing!  </li>
            <li>You have to get a little creative with it around the curves of your chin, but other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use on the more flat surfaces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde and have a ton of very fine blonde hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is ok for hair removal on the upper lip, but I just can&#x27;t get it to work on my cheeks or chin at all, so I suppose for light touch ups on the upper lip in between waxing it works, but I can&#x27;t rely on this for my only method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, this product might work well for someone with only a few stray hairs or someone who has light facial hair that isn&#x27;t so noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the sideburn area has much thicker hair (at least for me), and it did hurt a lot the first time.  </li>
            <li>All the products worked well but this spring is quick easy and the results last a long time.</li>
            <li>I generally use it right after my shower, that way I don&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s low tech, easy to use (there&#x27;s only two ways to twist it, so if one way doesn&#x27;t work, try the other way), still looks like new after the three years I&#x27;ve had it, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves only mild redness that is very temporary.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does not hurt as much as waxing does, and the pain passed quickly.  </li>
            <li>what I was amazed and delighted to feel was that half an hour later my chin was virtually hair-free.</li>
            <li>Worth paying a slightly higher price for something high quality that will no doubt last for years and years.</li>
            <li>This little gadget promptly (and easily) removes of face fuzz!</li>
            <li>It is pretty thorough in removing fine hairs, although certain areas always seem more difficult to remove hairs for some reason.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and then otherwise it does not work to it full potential.</li>
            <li>electrologist said that because I tweezed for so many years, each facial follicle now had SEVERAL ROOTS and would take much longer to do than had</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought it and coming from a tom-boy type girl who never really buys this stuff, it is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I found that at first I had to bend the spring in a complete \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape and twist to get the hairs.  </li>
            <li>Most of it being peach fuzz while some hairs being dark and course.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only took one full day to get to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think when excessive cleaning the spring might stretch and not be as effective in pulling hair out.</li>
            <li>I like that its stainless steel so its very durable and will last a long time and durability is a very important thing to me when im spending money for something.</li>
            <li>Okay...... I really have to confess that I was one of the scoffers who really didn&#x27;t think this little gizmo would work at all, but boy am I surprised!!  </li>
            <li>I even did my upper lip and got lots of tiny fine hairs off, too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If the fine people at Epilady decided to once again make the old style spring epilator, I&#x27;d definitely buy another</li>
            <li>Also be sure to turn the handles of the spring clockwise and counterclockwise as you move the spring in an up and down motion.</li>
            <li>Maybe, after more practice I can nail it down.</li>
            <li>Really fine hair is difficult for me (user error?) and has to be longer before the spring is effective.  </li>
            <li>My cheeks aren&#x27;t too hairy but have tiny little peach fuzz that starts fairly close to my sideburns.</li>
            <li>I am a new person!  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has tried everything and needs a new solution for hair removal!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it!</li>
            <li>and I have decided I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly easy to use, much easier than some of the other reviews led me to expect.  </li>
            <li>It works incredibly well, the reslults last much longer than expected or traditional hair removal methods, it&#x27;s small and beyond easy to use.</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;handles\\&quot; were much easier to get a grip on</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for new things that I can use to help me with this problem that is financially reasonable and decently easy/time efficient.  </li>
            <li>and I no longer have those inbetween waxing days where I feel less confident,</li>
            <li>I then watched the video for the device and it more or less is trying to sell it to you and not show you how to use it.</li>
            <li>It takes more time than waxing, but less than tweezing.  </li>
            <li>The pain is less than waxing, and more equivalent to threading or tweezing.  </li>
            <li>THE MORE U DO IT, IT HURTS LESS.</li>
            <li>It takes a sec to get the hang of it, but its easy going after that.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the less it hurts each time.</li>
            <li>I found that it worked better when you slightly bend the device while twisting both ends.</li>
            <li>The quicker I go, the less pain and more hair I take off.</li>
            <li>This works better than bending in half.  </li>
            <li>Besides, it was all over in less than 5 minutes (probably more like 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing found so many small fine hairs, as well as some larger ones that I missed.</li>
            <li>One word of advice: it is extremely easy to lose so be careful where you put it.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the less it seems to hurt.  </li>
            <li>More pain and less irritation sounds paradoxical, but that&#x27;s the case for</li>
            <li>And the fact that they grow back so quickly?</li>
            <li>You have to run over each area many times in several different directions, and even then, I wouldn&#x27;t call the job it does \\&quot;satisfactory.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and it removed my facial hair easily, quickly and didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried different things but ultimately nothing seemed to work better than the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>(I use Mrs. Meyers, but any mild grease fighting soap will do) in a container, submerge the R.E.M. Spring in it, and open and close the R.E.M. spring bungee style while it is submerged.  </li>
            <li>but I watched a quick TUTORIAL ON YOUTUBE and got it instantly.</li>
            <li>and as we&#x27;ve gotten older it seems to be getting THICKER and LONGER...  </li>
            <li>I am deeply considering buying a couple more to throw in my travel bag and to have as a back up!</li>
            <li>It does hurt initially, but the sting goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It hurt the most next to my lip and next to my nose.</li>
            <li>It worked best when going against the hair follicle, slowly and firmly moving the spring across the area.</li>
            <li>The plus side is that this is quick removal only.</li>
            <li>but it made the rest of my face seem hairier; recently I added the having my upper lip done but found I could not get there every week or so and needed to find a more convenient and cheaper solution.</li>
            <li>After just a few months, the Bellabe one started to oxidize, lose its smoothness and shine and get a kind of galvanized look to it, which also made it harder to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>however it seems as I am getting older</li>
            <li>then get a really good magnifying glass and tweeze the few that are left !  </li>
            <li>You will know when you are at a good angle because you can feel it grabbing more hair (not in a painful way, but a &amp;#34;hey</li>
            <li>but after having this my upper lip hair removes quickly and also i can do every week whenever i need.. ...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no worse than plucking and better than harsh hair removers.</li>
            <li>The angles make it more difficult to get the spring to catch so more passes were required.</li>
            <li>I could just feel it starting, so gave a fairly quick go over with the Spring Sprong.  </li>
            <li>Those never did me any good, and the motion was exhausting to repeat as much as I needed to do it.  </li>
            <li>I almost prefer waxing because its only one quick pain.</li>
            <li>the results were quick and obvious.</li>
            <li>I will never know how since my main priority was keeping them out of it, but it happened.</li>
            <li>Its relatively painless, quick and efficient.</li>
            <li>This gadget is so simple and quick.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly to remove hair around my lips.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that you can&#x27;t get the really short hairs, but it&#x27;s a lot better than tweezing.</li>
            <li>I tried a couple times twirling in different ways, and I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li>I will let you know about how quickly the hair comes back as soon as I have used it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The key is to go quickly and keep your skin taut.</li>
            <li>I went over one area dozens of times and it still didn&#x27;t get one particular</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to especially if you&#x27;ve never used one before just because of the stinging sensation, but that seemed to improve quickly.</li>
            <li>the older</li>
            <li>Tweezing was a problem because of the huge amount of hairs that needed plucking and using my Emjoi Gently gold Caress wasn&#x27;t working properly either because both methods produced major issues with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>have very fine blonde hair on my face, but it gets a tad too long for my liking.</li>
            <li>but it removes all those little fine hairs on the chin and upper lip pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The instructions is not clear on how to use it and how to clean it; it&#x27;s more or less figure it out yourself.</li>
            <li>Because I have more and more facial hair as I get older, this product might be more painful for me.  </li>
            <li>so my facial hair grows quickly and doesn&#x27;t respond to waxing like normal</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It recommends being cleaned with high pressured air.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>Considering the alternatives, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend the R.E.M Spring over all of them.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it - don&#x27;t hesitate to order</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it was highly recommended by a family member.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, it works so well.</li>
            <li>I have a few hairs on my chin that are more coarse than the others and tend to grow from different angles; it wasn&#x27;t able to remove those at all.  </li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain and this made my eyes water.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend not trying to remove it all at once.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for face with the exception of eyebrows.</li>
            <li>If there is a You Tube demo of it, I would highly recommend seeing how it works before you ever get discouraged about how to use it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s a must-have.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, and bought this as gifts for my girlfriends.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>rolling the spring over your lip really quickly before getting more precise, you help numb your lips and</li>
            <li>So needless to say, when I learned about this spring thing I was kind of excited.</li>
            <li>Are there other effective ways to remove facial hair?  </li>
            <li>(you know the long occassional hair that wants to surface once you are over 40 :) mostly tweezing and i used facial removal creme for some fluffy hairs before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply make a U shape and then twist your pincher fingers (making sure that your left and right are both going outward or inward at the same time).</li>
            <li>I love that I can do a little every day, so don&#x27;t have to wait for hair growth between waxings.</li>
            <li>Just know do a little at a time if does hurt,but it&#x27;s way better than waxing.</li>
            <li>so it will look a little better but</li>
            <li>A little bit more than a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Turns out there is a little more than just rolling.</li>
            <li>Yes it does hurt a little bit more, but the results are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was spending 30 minutes a day plucking the little hairs that would magically appear over night.  </li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s a tad bit painful at first (but not any more than tweezing), I quickly got used to it, and it&#x27;s so much easier and better than waxing, with no red skin or blemishes afterwards.</li>
            <li>The portion of the upper lip that had a quick sting to it was right below your nose, but it was definitely bearable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with a gorgeous head of THICK hair that runs down my back and unfortunately  a gorgeous face full of hair that goes from my unibrow (even above that I have a pretty fuzzy forehead that I took care of by doing an upside down crescent bend and rolling downward) to underneath my chin, on my neck.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work on brows for some reason (probably due to the curvature of the face), but you can easily get those threaded by someone else anyway.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t hard to use and it quickly removes fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to, but once you get the technique down, it works great.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful, yes it hurts some but not that bad.</li>
            <li>The best part is that there was no shadow on my skin or irritation as bad as I get from using chemicals.</li>
            <li>- I clean mine with anti-bacterial soap and dry it.  </li>
            <li>I considered getting an epilator, but with my sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t imagine that would go very well.</li>
            <li>clean the spring with isopropyl alcohol (and quickly dry it with a towel) after every use.  </li>
            <li>I use a magnified mirror to help see what I&#x27;m doing and in a few short minutes...smooth, smooth, smooth.  </li>
            <li>But nowhere near as much as waxing or plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes with the saying that it can be painful to look beautiful!</li>
            <li>My chin, while some areas were light, just never really responded to the laser treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very self conscious.  </li>
            <li>It would be selfish of me not to write dis review for others out there looking for a great product to remove their hair,I had to join the over 360 customers who wrote the reviews on dis product,if u r still in doubt about if it works,see the numbers of the reviews,and u&#x27;ll believe,numbers not lie.</li>
            <li>for the great price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>but advantage  of not having to even look in the mirror when you use  it and cleaning up all the tiny hairs is prob worth  it.  </li>
            <li>I also used an astringent and my normal moisturizer when I was done.  </li>
            <li>Could be useful for those with only a bit of peach fuzz</li>
            <li>Eventually, your skin and hair will get used to being pulled, that you won&#x27;t even be able to tell it hurts after a few uses.    </li>
            <li>you may just have to adjust or go over a few more times, but it comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its good for small places like your upper lip and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I do like it, though when I first got it it did hurt to much that I didn&#x27;t touch it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d never have a normal life til one day I needed to help myself and get on with my life, make a change.</li>
            <li>Very simple and useful.</li>
            <li>and I could never get every hair because on top of having coarse hair was long ass peach fuzz...</li>
            <li>Ok, I did have a few tears sprout when I got under my nose</li>
            <li>I thought it was normal</li>
            <li>I only bend it to look like a smile, and roll.   </li>
            <li>Certainly fun to play with, especially for those tuffies who think they can take it.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than waxing because it isn&#x27;t messy and with waxing you have to reapply and hope you get it all.</li>
            <li>When I wax, I have a dark pink goatee or beard for a good 6-8 hours after.</li>
            <li>spin the springs end in the same direction and have fun with it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly useful for facial hair</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love it for is my cheeks and sideburns; it just takes too long.</li>
            <li>, so you might want to stay in until the redness subsides to avoid any strange looks in public. :)</li>
            <li>Warning, it will HURT the first time (obviously, if you are doing it on a full area of hair), but after that it is totally bearable</li>
            <li>i normally can tolerate pain</li>
            <li>I winced more than a few times.</li>
            <li>If you are frustrated with the traditional facial hair removal products as I was, you will be very happy to find this simple effective tool.</li>
            <li>A normal threading session at the salon would take about 15 minutes to get all my hair removed.  </li>
            <li>Given that my waxing experiences are pretty much non-existent, I&#x27;ll make this simple.</li>
            <li>Now that the initial treatment is over I can see each subsequent use becoming easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it will likely take you some time to get the hang of using this, but it&#x27;s worth that time.</li>
            <li>If I were able to leave them alone and let them grow long enough</li>
            <li>Oh, and I recommend you use this at night before bed as with waxing, there may be some associated redness (normal) that may take some time to abate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get better, and using every few days keeps the pain to a minimum.</li>
            <li>but I numbed my face with ice first and barely felt a thing(I&#x27;m a wuss).</li>
            <li>I had high hopes based on the glowing reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the accolades.</li>
            <li>For me it worked, when it was in the U shape as shown in the picture, but in other variations as well, slightly bent, at different angles, it even worked flat and straight on some areas-though it worked best in a U or semi-bent</li>
            <li>/&gt;5)Cheaper &amp; Lasts longer (I had my last spring for over a year and a half, and it worked great nearly the entire time!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is fast and easy, but with the long lasting effects of tweezing.</li>
            <li>Most of my hairs get grabbed when I sweep upwards at them from below, but there are a few that grow in an upward direction, or from right to left or left to right, and those weren&#x27;t getting grabbed with the others.  </li>
            <li>Most of my hairs get grabbed when I sweep upwards at them from below, but there are a few that grow in an upward direction, or from right to left or left to right, and those weren&#x27;t getting grabbed with the others.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe a little spring could easily remove the fuzzy hair from my upper lip so quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Be careful near your eyes and eyebrows, you cam easily snag hairs you didn&#x27;t intend to remove...</li>
            <li>It is not as you might imagine as easy as this smiling face makes it look, and especially on the upper lip!  </li>
            <li>I have very dark hair and very fair skin, so any facial hair shows up very clearly, and I&#x27;ve always been extremely self-conscious about people looking closely at my face.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about it that I bought my mother one the same day that I received mine, and I am now her favorite daughter (at least for a couple weeks).</li>
            <li>It hurts, but it pulls out all the little fine hairs really well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to fiddle with it to get it working right, if it pinches or doesn&#x27;t pull out hair, try a different angle and roll!!</li>
            <li>- Grabbed both baby-fine hairs and super-short coarse ones, including on zee chin - though it took some time to sort the right angles on some sections.  </li>
            <li>right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise) -</li>
            <li>upwards, downwards, right to left, left to right, diagonally, etc.  </li>
            <li>Just remember that whatever direction you&#x27;re sweeping, the right hand goes clockwise and the left hand goes</li>
            <li>right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise) -</li>
            <li>upwards, downwards, right to left, left to right, diagonally, etc.  </li>
            <li>Just remember that whatever direction you&#x27;re sweeping, the right hand goes clockwise and the left hand goes counter clockwise.</li>
            <li>I followed the advice of one reviewer to turn clockwise with the right hand and counterclockwise with the left.  </li>
            <li>Comes right back and is stubbly.  </li>
            <li>The next time I did it right.</li>
            <li>The key trick is to rotate the handles or the spring to &#x27;catch&#x27; or &#x27;grab&#x27; hairs right off the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that some of the coarser hairs won&#x27;t come out, but I don&#x27;t mind tweezing a couple of hairs and it beats how dry my skin was getting from the creams and wax.</li>
            <li>Make certain that the hair is pulled out and not simply tugged on by twisting in full movements rather than short and rapid movements.</li>
            <li>ummmm, she maybe has a little bit of peach fuzz that&#x27;s detectable because she&#x27;s got dark hair and fair skin, and it makes her really self-conscious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While, I will likely keep my tweezers nearby for singular strands of thicker facial hair, the REM Spring Sprong got my upper lip super smooth with only 20 minutes of effort the first time around.</li>
            <li>It does hurt when pulling out the really fine hairs especially around the lip and right above the lip, but the key is it does work.</li>
            <li>It might be ok for young people who have really tight skin.</li>
            <li>This spring gets everything quickly with no mess and no cleanup necessary.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it to be hair free for awhile, especially for those of us who have a lot of embarrassing facial hair and don&#x27;t want 5 o&#x27;clock stubble or red wax burn or to take hours in front of a mirror</li>
            <li>this little ingenious tool does it all at home quite easily -- it takes a little while to get the hang of it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plucking with tweezers is fine for obvious hairs, but it won&#x27;t get the smaller ones like the sprong does.</li>
            <li>The money spent is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Thought about laser hair removal but that only works on dark hair and most of this hair is very pale.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I actually was reading over a review I wrote on here in 2010 for a wax hair remover I have used relatively happily for years and have come to prefer for its cost, comfort and general effectiveness over other even professional methods such as laser and electrolysis.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little bit of practice to get the correct curve and twisting motion, but once you &amp;#34;get it&amp;#34;, it really does pull the hair off and leave your skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Keep your tweezers handy in case there are some strays though, it does take a little bit of experimenting to get it to work at different angles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed if your skin gets a little irritated and flaky the first time you use it on a full area of of peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li>The primary reason I purchased this item is because at my age (75), it&#x27;s not that easy to focus and aim directly at a single stiff chin hair with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li>NO mess!!</li>
            <li>you live</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I plugged in my headphones and took off to the bathroom to use my new hair removal tool.</li>
            <li>I used this product for over 4 years now, i had to buy a new one as I gave mine to my niece.</li>
            <li>i cant live w.o</li>
            <li>Just got this recently as I live in a place without anyone who can do threading (can&#x27;t wax or I break out).</li>
            <li>I went ahead and used it because it was new</li>
            <li>or you may have to order a new one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather live my life and returned to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Threading is not something new to me</li>
            <li>I use the REM together with Vaniqua (applied twice daily to slow down hair regrowth) and am very happy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be even better than threading at getting the hairs, without leaving the area raw or prone to acne</li>
            <li>However, if you do not use this product with swift hand movements, I can see how it might not be effective and possibly more painful.</li>
            <li>It is easy and less time consuming.</li>
            <li>Nair left my face too smooth and then the stubble came back in.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing is the turning of the handles, so that the hair is caught in the spring and literally being twisted off.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt much on the cheeks, but really, really, really hurts on the upper and lower lip.</li>
            <li>The spring really does work, even if your facial hair is very fine.uch-ups when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it brought tears to my eyes, but if you use it a few times a week, it&#x27;s not terribly painful</li>
            <li>The product arrived as advertised and I spent a good few minutes going over the instructions</li>
            <li>It left my skin smooth and not red or irritated.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to receive this product prior to the expected shipping date.</li>
            <li>This product really solves the purpose..it removes hair really well but definitely not painless.</li>
            <li>I am one of the fortunate who don&#x27;t have an obvious facial hair issue.</li>
            <li>And then my lip would only be hair free for about a week before I would have to try to hide it again, waiting for it to grow enough to wax.  </li>
            <li>Although it tends to leave behind finer hairs, the R.E.M. spring is great for pesky areas like the chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I usually do it in bed every night before going to sleep as my hair grows pretty fast and this deals with them quick.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my facial hair and it is better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>done properly you can get that upper lip as smooth as silk</li>
            <li>do like the product because I am not putting chemicals on my face or exposing myself to unknown and possibly harmful  radiation (for lack of a better word).  </li>
            <li>You kind of have to go over the same spot a few times</li>
            <li>what worked best for me was to slightly bend the spring, place it below where I want to begin hair removal and then twist the ends back and forth as I slowly moved it up my skin.</li>
            <li>I was even able to rip out a row of mustache hair with little effort!  </li>
            <li>product does come with a holder which I was not aware of and it&#x27;s so small it will fit into any purse and even most clutchs.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was looking for an alternative to bleaches, since I have very sensitive skin, and stumbled upon the R.E.M. Spring.</li>
            <li>very sensitive area...</li>
            <li>The company claims that the spring will not cause irritation, but if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Better alternative,less messy and cheap in the long run than say,waxing for facial hair.</li>
            <li>they are such fine hairs in a such a sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>It gets most hairs on my upper lip, but does not grab the fine thin ones.</li>
            <li>As ridiculous as it may look, puffing your face out really helps in grabbing all obnoxious little buggers, and I&#x27;ve found that creating a tighter &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; helps in pulling out especially fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Not only being fair skinned but also having sensitive skin it is hard to find a product that works at &#x60;removing&#x27; the hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any rusting problems, but I do make sure to dry it thoroughly, and I do live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>A second one for my suitcase to have always at the ready!  </li>
            <li>The first minute I didn&#x27;t feel anything and realized I wasn&#x27;t bending it enough.</li>
            <li>You do not have to be in front of a mirror, or near an outlet!</li>
            <li>Among my friends I do seem to have a higher tolerance for pain, or maybe it&#x27;s just an acceptance of the inevitable.  </li>
            <li>**) is because of what the product actually is.  </li>
            <li>Back to the mirror I went and sure enough with me twisting the ends constantly</li>
            <li>I got it with free shipping with Prime, but the return shipping will be $6, so not worth returning.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The first time it does hurt, but so does any facial hair remover.</li>
            <li>And, it is not messy!  </li>
            <li>I was just considering getting it waxed for the first time until I finally decided to chuck out $15 for this after seeing some girl on Youtube</li>
            <li>The spring was pretty simple to use.   </li>
            <li>But, as others have said, that&#x27;s just at first because it&#x27;s taking out several at once.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Staying indoors and away from the natural sun light outside made me depressed and my self esteem was buried all the way deep into the earth&#x27;s soil!</li>
            <li>At $13, what&#x27;s there to lose??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this for the second time about a week after the first try.  </li>
            <li>- after the first time I used it, I broke out on my chin area and bottom of my cheeks since I had never removed hair there before (not unbearable, and I actually have acne prone skin).</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will find something that will make my life a bit easier in this area since I apparently have very stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>think I might be able to use the same handle building idea with something other than tape</li>
            <li>It did tingle a bit at first, but that was no big surprise from reviews I have read.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised to find that it came with 2 springs!</li>
            <li>At first i was going to give up because i can&#x27;t imagine how this 1 simple spring can take the hairs off.</li>
            <li>and I got pimples on my upper lip the first time</li>
            <li>It pulls hair out by the root on the first or second pass.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I first tried the Spring on my facial hair, it found hair fibers I did not know existed.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Also I found you need to be going in the exact opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and my first application was on my upper lip and OUCH!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I find it so challenging.</li>
            <li>I thought $15 or so for these products would be easier to take than nearly $300 for the No!</li>
            <li>I received my spring about 2 hours ago and just by reading the reviews here, I learned how to use it properly and it really works!  </li>
            <li>So I guess the way to the no pain part is to keep up with the growth and not let it grow back in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I howled when my friend used one for the first time - her facial expressions!</li>
            <li>it hurts, so you need a big pain threshold, but it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This product has completely changed that!</li>
            <li>If you have the same problem the first time, keep trying.</li>
            <li>First let me say this even if it is obvious!  </li>
            <li>The spring is pretty short, yet you have to keep it bent and twist the ends when you use it.</li>
            <li>I love threading, but not many places do it</li>
            <li>Her glowing recommendation gave me hope that this might be the solution to a problem I&#x27;ve struggled with since puberty: a light layer of dark hair all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My problem areas are my &amp;#34;female sideburns&amp;#34; and there was pretty much only one review out of 500</li>
            <li>After trying wax strips for the first time 4 weeks ago, I still have a patch of red skin.</li>
            <li>First let me say I&#x27;ve been suffering with facial hair since a teenager.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>this is more gentle than threading; (which I still do for my eyebrows as this device is not precise enough for shaping brows)</li>
            <li>I even use it on my nose - little tiny blond hairs that show up when the light hits you just right.</li>
            <li>This little spring is so easy to use</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t grab short hairs, and I can&#x27;t figure out how to clean out the inside of the  coil.</li>
            <li>We all know that Michael &amp; co haven&#x27;t particularly been cranking out new material in the last decade or two; but in the good old days, artists could at least fall back on existing album sales for a decent retirement.</li>
            <li>This little tool does exactly what it is supposed to do easily, quickly, efficiently, and with no mess.  </li>
            <li>Not totally pain free, but only really bothersome if you are a total wimp!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t come up much in conversations, but when it does I highly recommend this Spring Facial Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to control facial hair.</li>
            <li>The hair grew back the same thickness and consistency (contrary to popular beliefs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hair around my chin grew back the same speed (give or take 1-2 weeks) as shaving.</li>
            <li>I do still pluck some very thick unruly hairs, but this tool catches those super fine hairs that tweezers can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>originally stumbled on this product when I had a cold sore, and wanted to use something more gentle.  </li>
            <li>After I got the hang of it (which took all of about half a minute) it was smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend twirling your fingers as fast as possible to just yank out the hairs and not slowly plucking them out</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow, but I had to read them over a few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I have dark, coarse hair and it gets most of those.</li>
            <li>About the same as tweezing (which I hate, given the number required for visable results with the pain), but for the same amount of pain, you get many many more hairs.  </li>
            <li>The creams leave my skin pretty sensitive and red, and I am embarrassed to go out of the house for a day.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt a little at first on cheeks &amp; right under nose</li>
            <li>not raw or anything</li>
            <li>I also have pcos and lots of little fine hair on my jawline</li>
            <li>first inkling that this wasn&#x27;t the miracle I was seeking was the fact that it just plain didn&#x27;t work on my normally shaved face, even though before starting I&#x27;d let the hair grow in much more than I&#x27;d ever want to be caught in public with.</li>
            <li>This is not the one tool for every single hair, but it&#x27;s definitely worth owning and using regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only concern (and this is for the future) is that in order to clean it properly you are supposed to gently pull the spring apart to separate the coils.</li>
            <li>Using it hurts very much,it does yank the hair out but not always on the first, second or third try.  </li>
            <li>It left to many hairs that were just slightly coming through the skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, and because I already use an epilator regularly, this was relatively painless in comparison.</li>
            <li>It does hurt a bit, but it&#x27;s a quick pain that only lasts a second.  </li>
            <li>I had been tweezing and shaving, but that was starting to take all day, and the shaved hairs grew back so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was able to quickly get hairs that had otherwise been difficult to get with waxing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive but not super sensitive skin, a mixture of fine and course hair, and so far the spring has done everything it&#x27;s advertised and nothing it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t pluck the coarse dark hair above my upper lip, it becomes a fairly noticeable mustache.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use, much less painful, and much more effective than I expected - and gets easier very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but I have lots of fine hair round my chin</li>
            <li>All the other reviews pretty much nailed it on the head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that this little bugger is a good investment if you can deal with a little pain for she sake of beauty/vanity.</li>
            <li>It does smart especially under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a smart device thank you thank you</li>
            <li>but sometimes it misses certain tiny hairs and like a one star rater</li>
            <li>and it does smart around the upper lip,</li>
            <li>I personally haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs because that is just too large of an area for me to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Does remove hair but peach fuzz and fine light hairs will grow back as very thick hair</li>
            <li>I had little faith in this, but because it was relatively cheap</li>
            <li>I say resist the urge if you can because if you overdo it, you may never pick up the device again, whereas if you do it little by little, you will love the results so much you&#x27;ll stick with it and with each session, the sensation of pain really does go away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, I have to admit that I love the fact that this little gizmo is silent, unlike the epilator I considered buying.</li>
            <li>I presume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s grabbing more little peach fuzz over a larger surface area.</li>
            <li>Could NOT stay on top of it no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, but it&#x27;s hard to keep.</li>
            <li>Much better than plucking them out one by one with a tweezer, but you will still need a tweezer for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>However, it sure does the trick in removing those hard to get hairs from your face.  </li>
            <li>Right away I realized that when you hold it upside down you need to twist the ends left and right continuously in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>I have never written a review for a product, but for this one I decided to make an exception, simply because when used a little differently than instructed, it works amazing for</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase if you&#x27;re looking for something that will pull every single tiny blonde hair right off your face without any compasion whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>But I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, especially if it promises a smoother upper lip.</li>
            <li>I found out the hard way that the only spot it was good for, for me, was my upper lip.</li>
            <li>After a little maneuvering I figured out that holding it in a gentle U shape- not too close to a V!!!-</li>
            <li>Amazing tool, I owned a tweezer and got tired of squeezing the hair shaft was a strain on my fingers, so I threw it away when I got this</li>
            <li>I just rinse after with cold water and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>what 25 year old female wants to look like a man?</li>
            <li>The instructions aren&#x27;t really clear.</li>
            <li>To clean the tool I use a dry white face cloth because I like to see the results.</li>
            <li>Then you blow on it to clear out any hair.</li>
            <li>At age 70, my facial hair was very aging.  </li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>just wow...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a mustache since I was 8 years old..</li>
            <li>so much I bought a second one for my friend.</li>
            <li>I refused to shave as it seemed so masculine:</li>
            <li>It took me until the third try to really pick up the hairs.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for the upper lip, it is fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li>do a couple of passes each night and you keep yourself completely hairless.</li>
            <li>So naturally, I browsed Amazon for the highest rated hair remover, and when I saw this had 4 1/2 stars out of 5, I purchased it within seconds.      </li>
            <li>DO NOT use this REM Spring near your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I can use it while I am watching TV, because you don&#x27;t need a mirror; just touch the area until it feels soft.</li>
            <li>The hair isn&#x27;t completely gone yet, but</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing that really works with a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a thinner more delicate area than my chin.</li>
            <li>I found that it really helps to just use all kinds of different angles on your face and contoring to your chin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and is not irritated.</li>
            <li>and this by far is the one that I thought Got rid of my hair</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and have PCOS</li>
            <li>I use an old toothbrush to scrub at and get in between the coils.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product if you have hair on your whole face that you want to remove.</li>
            <li>but you really get used to it that its second nature.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my short and ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>I will say that initially, it really stung - enough to bring tears!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly surprised that I&#x27;ve never seen this advertised anywhere</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s far exceeded my expectations so far, and then some.</li>
            <li>Come to find out as an adult</li>
            <li>I did as much as I could bear that night, and followed the next night.      </li>
            <li>Im 24 years old</li>
            <li>I give it a 4 star simply because it can not get out really stubbon hairs unless they were longer to pull out.  </li>
            <li>I recommend buying this product - not a waste of money.</li>
            <li>After doing my whole face, it was red</li>
            <li>And thanks to everyone else who left reviews, you made me try this product</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, after doing my whole upper lip...</li>
            <li>I just followed my natural instinct on how to twist the rod .</li>
            <li>I have had problem facial hair my whole life.</li>
            <li>I have had a &#x27;stache since I was 13 years old.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make my skin so red either like waxing.</li>
            <li>I placed the edge of the tape near the thinnest part of the tapered handle and started winding.</li>
            <li>Is this natural?</li>
            <li>Does it feel natural?</li>
            <li>And I still break out in a rash (I have sensitive skin),</li>
            <li>(really well above the lip, but...YOUCH!)</li>
            <li>I have a lot of facial hair, and this product is a real game-changer for me.</li>
            <li>But if you want fast and easy(although not painless) facial hair removal THIS IS IT!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised to find that it caught hairs...</li>
            <li>so far day one..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s completely painless since you are plucking hairs basically, but</li>
            <li>Hold the spring straight and horizontally at the ends and twirl in opposite directions.</li>
            <li>Do this for a couple of times and it really helps in keeping the spring intact for further uses.</li>
            <li>Skin feels baby soft.    </li>
            <li>It is really that simple and will eliminate those unwanted hairs.     </li>
            <li>I use it frequently -</li>
            <li>Went from 30 mins (from application to being completely done) to 5</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really does work and get&#x27;s almost all the hair (I use it only for the hairs on my chin)</li>
            <li>My face has tons of red spots on the sides and I really can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li>For those of you who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin that changes what it can handle then use this product because it works at removing hair, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it after extended use.</li>
            <li>My skin was red afterwards, but no worse than if I had plucked the hairs one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item arrived fast and is incredibly simple in design.  </li>
            <li>As far as pain goes, if you have threaded by yourself for years, you would say what I am saying - \\&quot;It does not hurt - compared to the pain</li>
            <li>I started near the lip and moved up to the nose.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with low expecations of it actually being useful, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>This work Like wow in the beginning</li>
            <li>But so far, 1 star.</li>
            <li>(Please do not get this thing anywhere near your eyebrows,</li>
            <li>I feel like a professional at this already.  </li>
            <li>Has no trouble grabbing those and pulling them out.</li>
            <li>This really works wonders on your entire face.</li>
            <li>What developed after is what I refer to as my \\&quot;scab &#x27;stache\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>next time I used it a few days later, it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, because there weren&#x27;t as many hairs to pull.</li>
            <li>After a month, my hairs must be used to getting pulled out, because it hurts far less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is not messy.</li>
            <li>I also have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and private.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old daughter, after she begged me to get it for her.  </li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, I found that it really does the job on my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have a fair amount of facial hair which always made me very self conscious.  </li>
            <li>Irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesnt completely rip the hair from its roots.  </li>
            <li>No messy wax, and you can do this at home.</li>
            <li>used to pay $32 to have my brows, upper lip and side threaded; $40 for the whole face.  </li>
            <li>and i will keep buying replacements when lost (2 so far).</li>
            <li>I have been using the REM for a month and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 star because it was shipped fast and the product was same as the description</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to waxing my upper lip, thanks.</li>
            <li>This spring actually works really well.</li>
            <li>and now i can see some blemishing near that area.....</li>
            <li>Tried it again and realized that yes this thing really does work, especially on coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I used to pluck, pluck, pluck out every individual hair, taking up so much time every day.  </li>
            <li>It is about the same level of pain as threading, but much faster.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble learning to use it.</li>
            <li>The problem was in the days afterwards, when I developed bumps and whiteheads in the areas this product had been used.</li>
            <li>I bought the R.E.M. Spring for my 90 yr old mother.</li>
            <li>However, she says there is an undeniable &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; factor and the face does sting considerably longer than the enclosed literature suggests.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I did try and use my sensitive face toner after use of spring , but it did not help.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that this worked.</li>
            <li>It does the job really well for my upper lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i completely recommend this product to all the girl like me...</li>
            <li>I almost gave up on an epilator, but I finally found one that works very well, and which does not make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used waxes and creams, but both cause my sensitive skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>I really like the spring facial remover</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough so if you decide you don&#x27;t like it later on, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin there look natural.</li>
            <li>I know how to thread, but I&#x27;m by no means a professional.</li>
            <li>wow..</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I was a natural blond (now I&#x27;m gray)</li>
            <li>have it done professionally.</li>
            <li>The R.E.M. got rid of the peach fuzz and the mustache hairs but was hit and miss on the coarse hairs, but I have to really pull at those with my tweezers sometimes</li>
            <li>While I will continue to have my eyebrows professionally done</li>
            <li>I am a frequent consumer of hair removal products.  </li>
            <li>I only write product reviews if I really has something to say.  </li>
            <li>I prefer not to use it in the most delicate areas like below my nose</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re working on a sensitive area, you have the control to go bit by bit and not rip it all out at once.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well if you do it properly.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>They say its hypoallergenic, but to someone with sensitive skin, its not.</li>
            <li>It does do what it says it will do, but if you are prone to break out or have sensitive skin, might want to stick with thread.</li>
            <li>I would warn anyone with sensitive skin and/or allergies to look for another hair-removal product.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind this is a early review</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a go, but I&#x27;m going to say that if you have coarse hairs that you yourself have issues pulling out via tweezers individually</li>
            <li>Worth the wait and money spent.</li>
            <li>Only used it for a few minutes but it seems to work okay, but hurts when the hairs are being pulled out.</li>
            <li>(I get those rarely and minimally.  </li>
            <li>(I get those rarely and minimally.  </li>
            <li>So worth the $15 I spent on it.</li>
            <li>After a few days, I had cleared the whole area, and I&#x27;m not nearly as afraid to just run the spring over my jawline</li>
            <li>Some chin hairs are more stubborn than others but multiple passes with the spring over the course of a few days</li>
            <li>Nice that you can thin hairs this way, don&#x27;t have to worry about the in-between stages of hair re-growth that waxing has.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it hurts more if you go slow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality, there was nothing wrong when I got it.</li>
            <li>I hate waxing so this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li>not because of major new growth that was visible.  </li>
            <li>The only *really* sensitive area is right above the lip.</li>
            <li>apparently I have way more hair on my upper lip than I previously thought (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy; I usually just run it over my chin and upper lip while I&#x27;m watching television or reading, a real no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>This is the same as the right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise approach, just worded differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If the hair is growing toward the left, roll from the left to the right.  </li>
            <li>right was more difficult, but it seemed to work</li>
            <li>right was more difficult, but it seemed to work</li>
            <li>My method is just to roll between your fingers in a back and forth motion, and sideways, left to right.</li>
            <li>with my thumbs facing each other, the U shape close to touching my face, almost straight up and down!</li>
            <li>It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Neat unique little invention.</li>
            <li>, forget other hair removers and try this one FIRST!  </li>
            <li>I am SO excited about this little guy.  </li>
            <li>another little pain in life that is worth it!  </li>
            <li>It is true that it is a bit hard to control exactly which hairs you want to pluck, but overall if you just want to get rid of hair above the lip it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is easy enough to do once you have it down, you can just sit in front of the TV and space it.</li>
            <li>It was not nearly as painful, I didn&#x27;t even bat an eye-probably because you are pulling much less hair.  </li>
            <li>That may sound silly or like an exaggeration but as a fair skinned young woman who has always had dark hair above my lip</li>
            <li>I work very closely with young students as a reading tutor, and I am aware that little kids don&#x27;t want to be looking at a grandma&#x27;s mustache.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about using this because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I did hope that I wouldn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs from this, but unfortunately my very sensitive skin apparently reacts that way to all hair removal attempts.</li>
            <li>I do have a little trick to keep the spring from not loosening up every time you clean it.</li>
            <li>I was extremely self-conscious and it pretty much ruined my social life.  </li>
            <li>only reason I gave this product four stars is because it did not remove some fine, dark hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, causes less irritation than waxing or chemicals, and there is no goop left on your face!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to figure out and use, I had it working on all of my peach fuzzy upper lip hair and had it removed in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and it actually hurts a lot less than wax and tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the chin and cheeks hurt less than that super sensitive area under the nose</li>
            <li>It does smart the first few times, but so does tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li>must say when I first tried this I thought it was a waste and pure junk</li>
            <li>I must say when I first tried this I thought it was a waste and pure junk</li>
            <li>I am still using the original one I bought a few years ago</li>
            <li>No wax, no bleach, no mess.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially for the ladies who have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s already better than waxing because you don&#x27;t have to worry about letting hairs grow out to ridiculous or embarrassing lengths in between, and no appointments are neccessary.  </li>
            <li>You can try less of a U shape (more like a crescent shape) and also try rolling in different directions because hair grows at all different angles sometimes.  </li>
            <li>It is more subtle and does NOT pull on the skin.</li>
            <li>And yea sure, you need to get used to it (though I&#x27;m not sure if everyone can actually get used to it).</li>
            <li>If you still want to try it, I&#x27;d recommend doing it when your life is pretty low key</li>
            <li>It was a bit uncomfortable the first time I did it because I didn&#x27;t think it would take as many hairs all at once as it did.  </li>
            <li>I whipped it out of the box and started twisting and bending every which way and found that twisting them in the SAME direction upward AND downward both work as long as i put pressure on it, the pain along the jawline wasnt fun</li>
            <li>My friend actually shouted \\&quot;son of a mother!\\&quot; when it first worked on her upper lip.</li>
            <li>When I did the first pass over my upper lip, it felt like my skin was getting ripped up along with the facial hair, so</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my upper lip and for my pesky chin hairs.  </li>
            <li>If you twirl them the opposite way, no hairs get grabbed (this was the main thing I needed to figure out</li>
            <li>First I shaved for quite a few years and it was really hurting my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this spring mainly for my upper lip and chin areas (ouch!)</li>
            <li>mainly use this on my upper lips and cheeks around the mouth area.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly on the upper lip and the chin areas.</li>
            <li>Not only is she extremely helpful, but you will get a belly laugh just watching her video!</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time and it removed the hair from my upper lip in a brief period of &amp;#34;tweaky-ouchy&amp;#34; encounter.</li>
            <li>Seems like, after the first few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>it took me about five minutes to do my entire upper lip as it was the first time i was using the product.</li>
            <li>She said the next morning her upper lip was in a lot of pain after trying it the first time...</li>
            <li>So while your skin may feel smooth, you&#x27;re left with a dark root -  ie a five o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>This worked temporarily, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a long term solution.</li>
            <li>I am a typical post-menopausal woman who is sensitive to hot wax and doesn&#x27;t have time for all the plucking!</li>
            <li>i used to have to go into those little salon&#x27;s at wal-mart and have my lip waxed in full view of everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty expensive when compared to other brands and thus I expect it to be of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this to any woman that has facial hair problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to everyone who, like me, is embarrassed by their facial hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have unwanted facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been dealing with facial hair since Junior High.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this tool would for my upper lip hair, but it was ineffective.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a hair(and</li>
            <li>This is definitely a hormonal issue that I either have to live with or eventually go to someone that can naturally elevate my levels of estrogen without using going through hormone therapy.</li>
            <li>Not only was I paying frequently for the waxing procedure itself, I live quite a ways away from the nearest salon</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth, the hair is gone, all with very little discomfort.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I chose this product over the others because of the way the ends are shaped and because of the quality of the spring, even if it is a little more expensive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually have to bend it; if I just hold it slightly curved and turn it upward, and then come back downward, while twisting in the same direction with both hands, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>As I have been using it once a week over the last few months I am noticing less hair-I&#x27;m pretty sure I am just ripping out the roots on lots of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>of the hairs were very thick and some very fine, so</li>
            <li>:) the first time hurts pretty bad</li>
            <li>an Asian woman with black coarse hair - but my facial hair (and having used a threading tool for over 2 years now) is still very fine.  </li>
            <li>The waxing left my sensitive skin extremely reddened and it would actually take a day or two before my face returned to normal and it was a huge pain to apply the wax next to my hairline and not get any of it in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was really disappointed when I first tried to use the Spring Sprong; it had such great reviews it</li>
            <li>This is a bit painful, but is the best way I&#x27;ve found to remove facial hair above my lip and on my chin.  </li>
            <li>A few weeks later I&#x27;m an old pro, and my face is baby smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li>I ordered a second one immediately and am actually thinking of buying a few more spares.</li>
            <li>I only ordered one for me and one for my sister, who loves it too, and I am going to order a few more for my purse and back up.</li>
            <li>Now, I normally wax my upper and lower lip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried bleaching, hair removal cream &amp; waxing and its been so rough on my skin, its gone from breaking out, to just drying it out so much it hurt!</li>
            <li>I find that using it after softening the hairs with a hot wet towel for 10-15 minutes also helps to minimizes the pain.</li>
            <li>I would normally drive 12 minutes each way, pay 50 cents to a meter, a six dollar waxing fee and two dollar tip for the removal of the same hair.</li>
            <li>The U-bend is wide enough to not fit between the brow or under it, risk of catching eyelashes.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a little bit to get the trick down to use it, but it was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>And it does leave a little redness, but it goes away really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I know...pretty hard to believe, but its true!  </li>
            <li>This little spring coil is quick.</li>
            <li>The spring seems to only grab fine hairs, completely missing the darker, thicker hairs on my chin that I purchased this to address.</li>
            <li>Laser leaves all the fine hairs to shine in the sun.waxing takes off a few layers of my skin,leaving me with open wounds,enough said about that.</li>
            <li>I am a woman who has tried EVERYTHING (tweezing, threading, shaving, waxing, Nad&#x27;s and Nair) to get rid of the fine (but long) dark hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>This did not remove hairs from the roots in certain areas of my face, such as the side burn area, upper cheek, and edge of lips/upper lip area.</li>
            <li>This little REM Spring for facial hair removal is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am sooo glad I gave this product a try, and I plan to continue to use it for a long time to come!t was honestly red for less time than after plucking or waxing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it works on coarse hair, but for those baby fine little hairs that are too small to tweeze, this is a quick and easy way to 86 them.</li>
            <li>i suppose..the more frequently its used, the more you will get used to the pain, so it wont be as shocking as the first time.</li>
            <li>I would just like to recommend that the first time you use it, do it at night so that you&#x27;re not walking around all day with a red face (I would assume most people will turn at least pink when pulling hair out of their skin).  </li>
            <li>I had peach fuzz all over my face that was noticeably longer than most people&#x27;s, but due to my sensitive skin I was not willing to wax (or shave, for obvious reasons).</li>
            <li>That said, a number of years ago, I had most of my facial hair lasered off with reasonable results - my skin was sensitive to shaving, which made it bothersome and results not ideal.  </li>
            <li>The pain is minimal and it removes hair easily, and the price is extremely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it on the corner of my mouth first and after one or two false starts I got my hands coordinated and the hair came right out!  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with a lot of fine, pale facial hair for awhile.</li>
            <li>and it did not hurt at all since the hairs were new, short and not well rooted - no</li>
            <li>Now the only time the gravy train rolls into the station for elderly and burned out artists is a new tour.</li>
            <li>thing I would suggest to the new user - get your facial hair threaded once and watch what the technician does.  </li>
            <li>My cousin told me she was using a new &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; type item instead of tweezers for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Even if that is the case, this product is so affordable it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to buy a new one every year/ two years/ whatever it ends up being.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt anywhere near as much as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>When i got this at first it was pretty painful but removed so much hair and quickly..</li>
            <li>The sleeve it comes in is worth less than a penny.   </li>
            <li>I was not holding out much hope that this product would do the job, but after 10 years of tweezing and bleaching various areas of facial hair, I am a convert to the REM Spring Sprong.</li>
            <li>I lay a towel out, pull the Spring open bungee style again, and alternate between rolling it gently against the towel and shaking/banging it against the towel.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really pull out all the facial hair, even when I go through the same areas over and over.</li>
            <li>No woman I know wants to have extra hair, especially on her face.  </li>
            <li>I could remove this tiny facial hair myself at home the time I want .It doesnt hurt that much and when you get used to it</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I figured for less than $15 it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>did get this primarily for upper lip, but I do have a few hairs on my chin area, so I tried it there too.  </li>
            <li>I did get this primarily for upper lip, but I do have a few hairs on my chin area, so I tried it there too.  </li>
            <li>, my only complaint is that most of the time it wouldn&#x27;t pull the hairs out by the roots.  </li>
            <li>Second thought--who knew I had so much peach-fuzzy facial hair?</li>
            <li>the only spots that truly hurt me are my chin area directly under my lower lip and my sideburn-ish area near my ears</li>
            <li>The BEST, easiest, fastest, &amp; least expensive hair removal product I have tried.</li>
            <li>I make a solution of a few drops of a mild dish soap</li>
            <li>I also noticed the hair grew back more slowly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried bleaching, shaving, tweezing, waxing and asking nicely for the hair to depart from my upper lip, but alas, I remained unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I bent the R.E.M. in a gentle inverted U shape and moved it up and down my skin at the same time rolling the handles in and out (left hand going counter clockwise and the right going clockwise on the out motion and the reverse on the in motion).</li>
            <li>but then again your upper lip area is a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li>My upper lip is very soft and does not have the burn and irritation that I am used to.</li>
            <li>My upper lip is very soft and does not have the burn and irritation that I am used to.</li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it on the \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; area or another very sensitive place.</li>
            <li>I used to go to my local salon for waxing, then I got a skin rash and burns, so I switched to the threading walk-in place at the mall; I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and lots of hair on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li>To recap: more useful for the light hairs that can grow longer without being noticed, not good for the coarse, dark hairs that are noticeable the moment they grow past the epidermis.</li>
            <li>First, I have very fair skin, but thick black hair (it seriously sucks!)</li>
            <li>Pulling the hairs above my lip was quite easy, in fact, it took very little time to make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not extremely hairy like</li>
            <li>Extremely, no, it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, the first time is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fun to use, but it&#x27;s efficient and does the job and is oh so much quicker than tweezers.</li>
            <li>The small purchase was definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>but my upper lip was just too sensitive!</li>
            <li>The upper lip hurt but was completely doable!</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m not going to lie, this product that takes a little getting used to, at first I thought this thing doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>but every time I removed my facial hair with it, I got many small pimples along the jaw line and occasional break outs.</li>
            <li>Too hard to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>And once you get the majority of hair, it is easy to just keep going over the same areas again and again until you get every last little</li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to the twisting motion is kinda weird at first, but so easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it on wet, dry, moist skin, using in fully in U, slightly bent and straight, I&#x27;ve tried twisting the handles all different ways, and I&#x27;ve tried moving it in many directions.</li>
            <li>I have fine but dark hairs that grow on my upper lip, and it&#x27;s kind of painfully tedious to try and pluck the hairs individually.  </li>
            <li>there are some teeny tiny white hairs left, and this is why the final result wins out over waxing to me.</li>
            <li>Even when some hairs do break it is much better to have only a few grow back than having all of them grow back as when shaving.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty thorough, getting every single hair, and it only took about 3 minutes</li>
            <li>right when you get out of the shower, and it hurts less.</li>
            <li>I did what a previous reviewer mentioned and turned my right hand</li>
            <li>Creams are more effective and less painful.</li>
            <li>not really sure how to clean the inside of the spring, but that also doesn&#x27;t affect the usage at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then when I&#x27;ve worked my way in, and its pretty much all numb, I will place the spring over my entire top lip lining and roll up to get the middle hairs.  </li>
            <li>Just as for many reviewers, it took a few tries to figure out how to roll and twist for maximum hair removal - and then those unsightly chin hairs were gone!</li>
            <li>some fine &amp; some thick.</li>
            <li>i.e. from 10 thick hairs per 2mm square area, to 10 fine ones per sq inch.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this is pretty much the same as plucking only with less effort because it gets them all with a twist of the spring.  </li>
            <li>Both calm irritated skin, and aid in healing things like those horrid little whiteheads that sometimes appear after depilatory treatments.  </li>
            <li>It might hurt a little but its worth the hurt ...</li>
            <li>To you Ladies who wrote about not finding success with this little Spring, please be patient and keep trying.    </li>
            <li>takes a little time to figure it out, but worth it..  </li>
            <li>Takes a little practice, but so worth the effort.</li>
            <li>It hurts a little but worth the pain.</li>
            <li>In fact i found it fun each time i felt the little &#x27;pull/pluck&#x27; as i was just learning how to use it.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but at my age (let&#x27;s just say \\&quot;older\\&quot;)I only have a few chin hairs that I have to clean up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously considering buying a back-up since I love using this spring to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine facial hair which makes my face look shady.</li>
            <li>Older women often have a double problem :facial hair under and around the chin and over the lips, and dimming vision that makes tweezing by hand impractical.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but quickly changed my mind after just one use!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned but absolutely hate how furry my face has gotten with age.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of ways to deal with my moustache, from ignoring it (until my new niece pointedly asked why her new aunt had a moustache), to depilatories (which led to chemical burns and owieness), to waxing (which left me red for hours), to threading (which hurts like a sonuvagun but doesn&#x27;t leave me red).  </li>
            <li>It hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for removing upper lip hair as well as facial hair.</li>
            <li>At first I wondered how this could possibly work, but I was tired of fine facial hair, and waxing is</li>
            <li>But then I just grew a pair and really went for it, twisting the tool up and down quickly, and it hurt less that way.</li>
            <li>as on the packing it mentions there is a special pouch that comes along with this packing, it was not there.&lt;br /&gt;Packing was open and the pouch was missing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy use, and as another reviewer mentioned, the secret is going back and forth in several directions, while twisting the device with your hands in opposite directions (maintaining the more or less U shape recommended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing, but huts bad at first</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and bought it with a huge dose of doubt that it could work; however, for such a small price, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I generally use it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it is more appropriate for an adult, or maybe it was just my daughter, but she hated it and ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li>.. hair has to be long enough to grap up in it.. but not that much ..</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t hurt as long as I do it daily.  </li>
            <li>They both seem very durable, and I expect them to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised that the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover worked as well as it did.</li>
            <li>For the finer hairs on my upper lip, it whips those out with no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young woman in my 20&#x27;s and the only years I regret was when I didn&#x27;t have this in my life.</li>
            <li>I wax/epilate on a regular basis so my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>and yes it gets rid of the soft facial hairs</li>
            <li>But this tool is capable of leaving just enough tiny fuzz that it&#x27;s not obvious</li>
            <li>It hurts mostly near the ears and above my lip.</li>
            <li>O.O</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am 70 years old and facial hair has become a bit of a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>Completely cuts the hair at the upper lip area so it feels like shaven, and it doesn&#x27;t take the hair out from root as advertised.</li>
            <li>The lip is a bit sensitive but not a big deal!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is with my skin, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t like the R.E.M anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about some hair above my lip, so I&#x27;ve tried waxing, shaving, bleaching, tweezing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always shaved my chin, and with hormone issues can sport quite the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>And how much it hurts is minimal.</li>
            <li>It took all of five minutes for me to completely de-hair my upper lip.</li>
            <li>; There&#x27;s no getting around pain when you&#x27;re ripping sensitive facial hair out by the roots.</li>
            <li>: The ease of you use was actually much easier  than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have been so self conscious about my excess hair and would fret about it daily.</li>
            <li>The hair comes back every two weeks so far</li>
            <li>I had stubble that I could just barely tweez(one days growth), and</li>
            <li>I had stubble that I could just barely tweez(one days growth), and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something scientific, but it seems like direct tweezing causes hairs to grow back faster stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my eyebrows threaded, so I&#x27;m not going near them, but I have used this on my sideburns and upper lip.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it on my upper lip, cheeks, and even on my toes!</li>
            <li>The tool does rip &amp; pull facial hair, but sometimes it breaks the hair and not pull it out completely from</li>
            <li>You can tell when it&#x27;s taking the complete hair out by feeling it, and also seeing the white tip at the end of the hair.</li>
            <li>The only hairs this got were the near invisible peach fuzz around my face and neck-</li>
            <li>No more long white hairs on my face!! :)</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t careful you will rip out your real hair.</li>
            <li>I am a 59 year old woman and was blonde before I went gray.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to bleach, I dislike waxing, and tweezing the individual hairs is too time consuming.</li>
            <li>and I recommend this to all of you girls who have soft skin and facial hair problem..</li>
            <li>What I felt was a tiny pinch, even directly under my nose.</li>
            <li>product will definitely work, even as I see it very time consuming, but my biggest problem is that if your hair is as short as mine, as I maintain the growth every week, the hairs seemed way to short to be grabbed by the remover.</li>
            <li>The downside to my facial hair is I always developed severe acne in the area where I removed the hair.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face felt the next day when I washed.  </li>
            <li>What it does do is remove enough of it so that I look like a normal human being, not a Sasquatch.  </li>
            <li>It may be more time consuming, but this is worse than even shaving.</li>
            <li>Ok, this hurts worse than my tattoo (in some areas).</li>
            <li>Better than caustic hair removers, bleach, and I would imagine it will weaken the roots.  </li>
            <li>However, not a lot worse than tweezing but also not a lot better than just tweezing.</li>
            <li>You have to play with the angle a little to get it right.</li>
            <li>It take a little time to get it right.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it hurts a little, but less than waxing.</li>
            <li>With my new position in the public eye, its crucial I bring my &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; game everytime in a crowd and am confident this will help those tv and photog moments.</li>
            <li>I am also pale so the dark hairs stand out even more.</li>
            <li>Part of the reason I wanted to try a new product was because the cream remover would sometimes cause redness that could last over a day in the same area.</li>
            <li>I did have to change the angle that I was using it (sometimes running it sideways instead of up and down), and have it bent more or less than I do on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I can quickly use it and be done with it in a few minutes and even use it daily without having to worry about about redness or itchiness.</li>
            <li>(If I do a few quick &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; before starting.  </li>
            <li>It is unlikely I would have ordered a Spring to remove facial hair if I&#x27;d not read what these other ladies had experienced.</li>
            <li>It only takes seconds to use and there is literally no mess.</li>
            <li>Right, Left, Up, Down, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It works great to remove the fine hairs but left me with a hundred tiny bloody scabs on my face!</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to get the right arch angle of the spring, but you can hear and feel it working.  </li>
            <li>This gadget did not remove 1 single hair - do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>First of all, the instructions for this say that you&#x27;ll feel a slight tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>normally I pluck and shave what I can not finish.. and have a dry course</li>
            <li>The product definitely provides for hairless skin, but idk.. it just looks and feels more of a subtle change than the drastic red hairless skin you get from waxing).</li>
            <li>like that I can see the hairs and their roots on the Spring, that it&#x27;s small and lightweight, and that I can use it whenever I need to for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>Because my hair grows rather quickly, I use the spring every 2-3 days and it takes me probably no more than 5 minutes to use.  </li>
            <li>I recently starting becoming self-conscious of the small brown hairs mixed in with the blond one on my upper lip (I just turned</li>
            <li>I have very light colored thin facial hair</li>
            <li>My facial hair is very light and thin.</li>
            <li>My face was a little red after the first few uses (like it would be with waxing) but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>It also helps a lot to apply a gentle, calming lotion or hydrosol to the area first, and throughout, if I&#x27;m removing serious overgrowth.  </li>
            <li>i am kind of use to really have every single hair plucked, this tool have shorten time spent on plucking facial thin hair.</li>
            <li>I do have trouble getting certain hairs above my lip and wonder if a smaller spring like I&#x27;ve seen at local stores could be helpful on certain curves of the face.  </li>
            <li>And it hurt just as much as all the other things (laser, wax, tweeze) in the end pulling hair from you skin, is pulling hair from your skin.  </li>
            <li>It HURTS just as much as any other hair removal method.  </li>
            <li>This works extremely well on those areas we ladies don&#x27;t really talk about, but spend a lot of time grooming.  </li>
            <li>The other reviews of this product were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a little pain to have a hairless upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li>Who cares...it is worth a little pain to get your life back.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to--you need to keep it bent as shown in the picture, keep turning the end pieces, and move in different directions--and it does sting just a bit as the hairs are removed--but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>It took a few minutes (not long) to figure out the right &#x27;twisting&#x27; motion, but after that....</li>
            <li>Not a single pimple with using the spring.</li>
            <li>use it, at first I coiled it up tight and then \\&quot;let go\\&quot;</li>
            <li>is not very nice, either, because the hair grows back quickly.</li>
            <li>- Always use a clean pillowcase the night you use this, and change it at least once a week.  </li>
            <li>the more painful... if you are able to wax and then do this as follow up you will have less pain.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to get to clear, hairless skin with this product</li>
            <li>holy cow, this thing really works.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of visible blonde facial hair that I have always been self conscious about.</li>
            <li>I am old enough now to be getting unwanted facial hair growth.  </li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin, and you don&#x27;t want to go in public red and bumpy, allow yourself some time before going out.  </li>
            <li>I am a 25 yr old African American woman.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well on my cheeks and chin, but I had a harder time removing the hair from the neck area and my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I have tried professional laser hair removal and it only lasted about a year before it started to grow back.</li>
            <li>I am blonde and have a lot of soft facial hair and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d see what it was all about since I wasn&#x27;t about to spring for HUNDREDS of dollars for a &amp;#34;No-No&amp;#34; or some such electric torture device to trim my wild ear hairs and such.  </li>
            <li>Hairs grow at different rates of speed so the key to completely eradicating my problem will be consistency.</li>
            <li>For me, it didn&#x27;t hurt so much on my chin, but the upper lip and the sides/cheeks are a bit rough at the start.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s the only facial hair removal product that works.  </li>
            <li>For one thing, it&#x27;s wide open when it&#x27;s at this position meaning it doesn&#x27;t pull much of anything.</li>
            <li>well personally I think that waxing hurts worse and it is so much better than trying to tweeze each hair one at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive for just a simple spring.  </li>
            <li>Each option more unappealing than the last.    </li>
            <li>Worth the few minutes of pain several times a week.</li>
            <li>The next important thing is to roll slowly so the hair pulls out and does not snap off.  </li>
            <li>The pain is worth it to me because it lasts only a few seconds and does not leave any redness/bumps.</li>
            <li>As a fair skinned brunette I get some dark hair on my upper lip and also a few dark hairs on the upper side of my neck.</li>
            <li>This little unit gets the itsy bitsy hairs right up next to the lip and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash!</li>
            <li>I used it a lot when I first got it because I had a lot of &amp;#34;cleaning up&amp;#34; to do but after that initial week I&#x27;m down to once a week.</li>
            <li>At first I was little hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>With little practice you can master that, be aware it hurts when your hair pull, but as you keep using it you will get use to it.</li>
            <li>It hurts a little the first time, but not like waxing is painless.  </li>
            <li>But now after that first time there&#x27;s just a little &#x27;prickly&#x27; feel.  </li>
            <li>Its a little tricky at first to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it , it does work hurt a little at first</li>
            <li>it takes a little getting used to in order to get the cirrect motion down, but once you do it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li>but I have a good bit on my cheeks, jawline, chin and its fine above my lip, but I have some nasty \\&quot;witch</li>
            <li>And because they all started growing back at the exact same time, I was back to square one, having to either go back to shaving them, or hide out in my house for another week while they got long enough to REM again.</li>
            <li>and I want to tell them about the spring, but that would be too rude, Right?!   </li>
            <li>It takes a little time and isn&#x27;t pain-free (the pain is instantaneous, but enough to make my eyes water, especially on my upper lip) but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>but I got very little success.</li>
            <li>I got my entire chin done in less than two minutes, first try, no mirror.</li>
            <li>Without significant redness, definitely much less than with other methods.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product especially if you have normal hair growth and don&#x27;t have to pluck  everyday.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one of those cheap ones also and it was not good.</li>
            <li>I should add that the hairs I want to grip are not at all unusual (just your average thing).</li>
            <li>When the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover arrived I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to work it because the included instructions were minimal to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I have very course and dark chin hairs</li>
            <li>In at least one area, it felt smooth after I used the REM Sping, but a couple of hours later, I could feel them growing back in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it on other part of my body and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well, but it definitely works on the intended areas.</li>
            <li>I based my decision to buy this spring by reading other reviews and because it was the only one that states it is made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>For bigger longer hairs I can hold the ends and barely bend it.</li>
            <li>also recommend keeping up with it, doing maintenance while the hairs are very short and barely visible.  </li>
            <li>Just \\&quot;man up\\&quot; and get through the first few passes and your skin will desensitize.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have much success, it was just far too uncomfortable and missed a lot.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I got a few post hair removal bumps under the skin as I do after waxing</li>
            <li>-tip for easing the pain: I soak a wash towel in hot water and place it on the area for a few seconds before going over with the spring.</li>
            <li>Many years ago, I used an electric hair removing coil on my legs, so I know the idea is solid, it works, and, I&#x27;m tired of the fuss of waxing (not to mention the red blotching).  </li>
            <li>It did hurt the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just those first few pulls that don&#x27;t feel too good.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>(which is what I have done for the past 2 years...not fun).  </li>
            <li>Received my R.E.M. Spring a few days ago, used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>First few times I used it</li>
            <li>My skin was red for about 20 minutes; I just put a little vitamin E oil on a cotton ball and patted it on my upper lip right after using the spring.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to bend it, it just makes it easier for certain areas as there is less surface area.  </li>
            <li>The one down side is that it really hurts the first few times you do it, but I was expecting that.</li>
            <li>then I realized and it really got the hair down to the root.</li>
            <li>I guess it comes down to how much pain</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair out above your upper lip when it&#x27;s angled right, and when you&#x27;re tensing your upper lip tight against your teeth.</li>
            <li>It takes very fine hairs but difficult under chin and around face corners.</li>
            <li>It sorta hurt at first, but it hurts LESS than tweezing did!</li>
            <li>After one month of use I&#x27;ve noticed the chin hairs have slowed in fully growing, but have turned more like stubble, and covering a larger area... not good!</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product, I was little worried, since this is my first time using such a product.</li>
            <li>A little tricky at first to figure out the proper technique</li>
            <li>We have tiny tiny fuzz all over our face, but waxing for me removes all of that too and makes my upper lip look kind of shiny and weird compared to the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>I had an easier time on the chin hair and went slowly on bits of the upper lip over the coarse of a week before I ignored the watering eyes and then the sneezing attack and just kept going till the upper lip was hair free.  </li>
            <li>Now I will qualify that by saying that because it&#x27;s not painful for me, that doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t be for someone else.</li>
            <li>While I was unable to wax my upper lip due to my sensitive skin, my upper lip is now hair free thanks to the REM Spring!</li>
            <li>Well, the older I get, the harder it is to tweeze those little devils since I can&#x27;t hardly see them any more, dagnabit.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was the most painful but</li>
            <li>It can be painful at first, but this will become tolerable as you use it more.</li>
            <li>REM Spring really helps remove the hair with less pain.</li>
            <li>I bought this for coarse chin hair as well as facial hair in general.</li>
            <li>I referred back to these reviews and one of the first ones recommended that that the spring only be bent slightly while you twist it clockwise and counter clockwise at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I used this last night, and my face barely looked red even five minutes</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t difficult to learn to use, and I had success the first try.  </li>
            <li>If wax didn&#x27;t burn my skin, I&#x27;d rather do that because at least it&#x27;s over quickly.</li>
            <li>At least waxing is quick.</li>
            <li>yes, especially the first few time you use it,</li>
            <li>It also causes pain, especially the first few times it&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes to get the hang of it the first time you use it, after that it&#x27;s a piece of cake.</li>
            <li>My skin &amp; lips are very sensitive, and after waxing my lips for years with no real satisfaction I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Like it a lot, use it mainly on cheeks, ears and various other locations.</li>
            <li>They say that it will tickle or sting slightly when using this device, they fail to mention that if you are using it for the first time and have a good amount of facial hair that it will burn for just a few seconds, but it burns.</li>
            <li>Frequently washing and moisturizing the affected area with natural, high-quality products usually sees me clear in a couple hours.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Frequently washing and moisturizing the affected area with natural, high-quality products usually sees me clear in a couple hours.)  </li>
            <li>The last thing I used that worked was a cream kit but for two days after my upper lip was so swollen and red from the chemicals I could barely talk.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not long enough to pull  </li>
            <li>The first use is a little uncomfortable, but it gets better with use and the results really last.  </li>
            <li>they are not long enough for it to grab them and it breaks them, but I was using it every day too.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s going to take a few days to get all the hair off, but my first round with it went really well.</li>
            <li>The trick is to do it frequently so it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to grow back as thick as the first time.</li>
            <li>I want my face to look natural just less hairy -- and the broken-off fuzz makes it seem like I have the fuzz of a 5-year old.  </li>
            <li>But I got smarter with the next move and twirled it between my fingers fast - and it hurt much less.  </li>
            <li>On top of having pretty bad arthritis to begin with, I have joint replacements in my left hand and my left thumb is fused at the knuckle.</li>
            <li>A bit painful at first (similar to if you ever got your upper lip threaded), but as I continued using it the pain become more tolerable.</li>
            <li>As pretty much everyone else writing reviews about these products, I&#x27;d been fighting facial hair for years - mostly upper lip, and the thin hair on the sides of my face in front of the ears.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fine afterward stings a little for a few minutes but no reaction or anything.  </li>
            <li>Removing hair on the upper lip does smart a little</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not long enough to be noticeable,so no big whup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now that I am older, I have dark hairs growing on my neck and jawline.  </li>
            <li>but if you keep at it every few days to keep the are free of hair, it will hurt less since you are only ripping a little bit of hair at that point verses the whole lip and chin.</li>
            <li>Days after that, I even had a few large ones as well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad, especially if you don&#x27;t go crazy and try to get every last hair right away.     </li>
            <li>This little tool really, really works.</li>
            <li>This little tool gets the job done and fast.</li>
            <li>Yes it hurts, but I found that applying a little bit of Benzocaine at the site of hair removal works really well.</li>
            <li>The spring didn&#x27;t need to be opened that much to get those little hairs.  </li>
            <li>It works really well after a little bit of practice.  </li>
            <li>This really works but hurts a little.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all gone now, thanks to this little spring.  </li>
            <li>As you age, you get fine hair everywhere and some heavy hair in trouble spots.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of dark, fine facial hair and usually go to get it waxed off once a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely takes a little trial and error, but after about 2-3 days you will be an absolute expert.  </li>
            <li>Previously, my main concern was only the dark, coarse hairs on my face and not the peach fuzz, but this baby gets everything, leaving my face smoother and softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt it in my life.</li>

            <li>And since I&#x27;m now in my 50s, these tiny little hairs were appearing on my chin, but I really couldn&#x27;t see them well enough to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>I read countless reviews both good and bad and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with break outs, which was a huge plus, but after a few days just the thought of using this on my lip made me cringe.</li>

            <li> This one is perfect...</li>
            <li> but I find that in order to be perfectly hairless, I have to probably use it every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> And the best part, no 5 o&#x27;clock stubble.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST beauty product I have ever bought.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nad&#x27;s, Nair, and Sally&#x27;s Hansen&#x27;s wax strips, and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ll never buy any of them ever again.</li>

            <li> Like it says, don&#x27;t use on eyebrows because you will snag your lashes unless you figure some way to keep from doing it, like a patch on the side you&#x27;re working on lol.</li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> Worked great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative for waxing.</li>

            <li> and it makes me so happy.  </li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;ve gotten it over with, I&#x27;m happy with the result...</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that is not the case.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I dread using, but it works great.</li>
            <li> The R.E.M Spring worked great.  </li>
            <li> This will work great if you give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I discovered it.  </li>
            <li> Works great without leaving marks on the face.</li>
            <li> It works great....</li>
            <li> This is great.</li>
            <li> It worked so great</li>
            <li> The price is great for a product you know works, but a bit dear if it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> If you can get through the pain, it will be a great product for you.  </li>
            <li> Great price and</li>
            <li> I use this all over my face and its great.</li>
            <li> Great for moustache and chin hair - but have been scared to try it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> OMG.. Talk about a great product.   </li>
            <li> So - great product, but NOT painless.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for removing unwanted chin hair.</li>
            <li> is a tad embarrassing, but yes I do get chin hairs &amp; the spring works great on that area</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews, but I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it, it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great time saving idea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so great about it.</li>
            <li> and have been mostly happy with the results.</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate the pain, this is a great tool.</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a great idea</li>
            <li> So happy that I decided to get it because waxing was $12 a session</li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t do a great job with it.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this</li>
            <li> it was great...</li>
            <li> This looked like a great product that didn&#x27;t need continuous maintenance or refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked at all the great reviews for this product</li>
            <li> Oh the joy of aging, but this is a problem at any age</li>
            <li> I am happy.</li>
            <li> Happy hair removing.</li>
            <li> It did an absolutely great job removing all the hair I could and couldn&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li> LOL....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t mind a tear now and then....</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to waxing and plucking.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job if you get the technique correct.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years now and it still works great</li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> great thing about this spring is that it is SO CONVENIENT.</li>
            <li> The product works great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> but it is a great substitute for shaving my chin every day.</li>
            <li> I found that this worked great for my chin</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> but this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have something that can be used in the privacy of my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was happy with it.</li>
            <li> it works and i had no problem getting the hang of using it;  my skin feels great</li>
            <li> This R.E.M. spring, however, does not cut hair and it does a nice job (almost perfect) of pulling out hairs.  </li>
            <li> it was a GREAT</li>
            <li> Spring works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it now and then.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great too, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, so you can use it every day if you wanted.</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews, yet kept putting off the purchase.  </li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Great price</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> The REM Spring works great on my peach fuzz and</li>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great to do while watching tv.</li>
            <li> but it is great at removing the tougher hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance on something like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absolutely great for removal and control of chin hair growth.  </li>
            <li> yes great product  use it all the time</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not recommended for eyebrows, but i did use it successfully on the area between brows.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just awesome :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Removes hair perfectly, doesn&#x27;t hurt much and, the best, it takes a lot of time for the hair to grow again!</li>
            <li> Bought it for the heck of it but turned out to be one of those things that pleasantly surprise you.</li>
            <li> works great and feels very smooth!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing I have ever owned!!  </li>

            <li> easy to use, works great!</li>

            <li> any way i definetly recommend these product worth every penny.look beautiful and flawless</li>
            <li> Really impressed with how easy this is, as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> The hair is gone and its so easy to use, you just have to find the best way to roll the spring over your skin.</li>
            <li> This works best on the fine hairs but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a great product - easy to use, good price, does the trick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good touch-up product, and works</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> It works good in the mouth and chin region.</li>
            <li> (sigh of happiness).</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of this thing, I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I did my homework on this gadget and it seemed to be good.</li>
            <li> Best for light hair removal needs.</li>
            <li> Off I went with my Spring, magnifying mirror, tweezers, and eye glasses to find hairless happiness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel a lot of pain to to be fair</li>
            <li> MY FACE IS VIRTUALLY HAIR FREE AND SMOOTH NOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li> and I loved her honesty</li>
            <li> good product, but stings and u just never use it again for some reason</li>
            <li> I have also researched electrolosis but found out that I wouldn&#x27;t be a good candidate because my hair is light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to see good results, and I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I will be buying some for my sisters that tried it and loved the product as well.</li>
            <li> so I had a good idea of how to make it work.</li>
            <li> I bet with practice it would be good but couldn&#x27;t stick with it with the pain it induces</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I read about it in Oprah&#x27;s O Magazine and they loved it.</li>
            <li> It seems to remove finer or medium hairs, and that is good.  </li>
            <li> I do not often leave reviews, but I am so delighted by this product</li>
            <li> but if you have really good tweezers you can get them out.</li>
            <li> but he was impressed by how smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li> Great efficient hair remover made of durable steel with nice metal handles at end.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good</li>
            <li> Will make a good companion for emergencies.</li>
            <li> The pricing is good for the product.</li>
            <li> Good bye nair which was burning my skin.</li>
            <li> A good tweezers does the job</li>
            <li> It will be a good alternative to paying to be waxed.  </li>
            <li> Good for getting a strand at a time.</li>
            <li> and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li> The product is good.</li>
            <li> just put some aloe on after and your good...</li>
            <li> it  does a good job of cleaning the unwanted hair from my face.  </li>
            <li> This seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li> Because it is all fair, I&#x27;ve not been a candidate for laser, etc.  and have used tweezers.  </li>
            <li> what good is it if it&#x27;s not going to work for me.</li>
            <li> good thing I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere,</li>
            <li> With chemicals being in the hair remover, I knew over time it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to continue using it.  </li>
            <li> It does take some practice, but once I got the hang of it, I was good.</li>
            <li> you know I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I think this is a really good product</li>
            <li> , I will jump on amazon and write a good review as soon as I use</li>
            <li> the manual, there is a good comment in there \\&quot;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this item away after giving it a good try.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> So, i caught this on a good deal and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you waxers out there here is the good news:&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li> It does a good job on the &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair, like me, you are never going to find a product that will eliminate all the unwanted hair, but I think with continued practice, I can eliminate a good amount of it with this, and then wax the rest.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this based on the good reviews since I was hoping to find  something that would spare me the expense and hassle of getting to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product on groupon one day and actually laughed at it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have good dexterity...</li>
            <li> my face feels so smooth and the best hairless!!!</li>
            <li> This is just so good</li>
            <li> You kind of have to get the hang of it, but once you do, it works great.</li>
            <li> I loved it and wish I had discovered this years ago.</li>
            <li> My favorite gift to sisters, cousins and good friends!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> This tool is very easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and very effective.  </li>

            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it would do me any justice, but yes girls this is a magic wand or should I say spring!</li>

            <li> This is one amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Dont go by any of these reviews that say it is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> This gadget is amazing.</li>
            <li> honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again if I were to lose it or something.</li>
            <li> and that really make me feel happy !!</li>
            <li> I found that if I bent the spring into a gentle shape and rolled both ends toward me, moving the spring up my cheek, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This does do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> and I pluck my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and now i&#x27;m nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure it hurts, but how can anyone think that pulling out hair would feel good.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my own face: chin and \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; for years.</li>
            <li> You can use it in the privacy of your own home, ( I use it while watching television)  5.</li>
            <li> I had watched you tube videos after purchasing to try and get the hang of the motion needed for the spring to be effective.</li>
            <li> Like everyone says it really does take a while to figure out how it works best for you.</li>
            <li> it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> In fact, I am THRILLED</li>
            <li> I have waxed, used nair, and threaded my own face for years.  </li>
            <li> I kind of wish it was a drawstring bag</li>
            <li> I think it is the best invention since button up boots and so much cheaper than waxing.</li>
            <li> It kind of hurts</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of a wuss.</li>
            <li> It does work though which is nice and</li>
            <li> Nice.)  </li>
            <li> and you buy the product, now you have to buy separately, it was nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like threading</li>
            <li> This thing pulls hairs, it really does, any maybe I&#x27;m still trying to perfect the technique</li>
            <li> but thing is, I can feel the spring catching them but not pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> This is an effective tool.</li>
            <li> I noticed on longer hairs around the chin area, not so effective</li>
            <li> its grabbing a lot&amp;#34; kind of way)  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to experiment &amp; see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t honestly believe that this would work, but decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> But let me tell you this product is excellent as it really works.</li>
            <li> It DID remove my chin hair effectively but</li>
            <li> I am loving this sprong.</li>
            <li> Take the spring to that kind of growth and, hell</li>
            <li> I use the calendula and rose hydrosol (with aloe vera, etc.)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have to get my own.</li>
            <li> So to me that was a good sign :)</li>
            <li> I do think for good results just like waxing or tweezing the longer the hair the better to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> It really is the best solution out there for lip hair.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having to buy another one because my grandmother liked mine so well and gave me puppy dog eyes</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not the kind that breaks out</li>
            <li> Honest -- there&#x27;s no discomfort at all now.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tool of this kind and found over 700 reviews with over 95% raving about it.  </li>
            <li> she liked it too.  </li>
            <li> She is honest and shows the correct way to maneuver the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe thats why I wasn&#x27;t thrilled.</li>
            <li> A nice find.</li>
            <li> To be honest, after reading some of the reviews (take it like this, do it this way, etc.)</li>
            <li> To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t hurt me.  </li>
            <li> It works kind of well, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I really think this is the greatest thing ever created!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it still hurts, but it&#x27;s effective, and let&#x27;s face it, it was gonna hurt either way.  </li>
            <li> i do also like the fact that its made so durable and cheaper than the bellabe kind which has plastic handles or maybe its rubber?</li>
            <li> I am thrilled I have found this tool.  </li>
            <li> u kind of get used to it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my kind of product.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I did I kind of knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> BUT, honestly, maintenance is like plucking eyebrows but faster.</li>
            <li> info below is at your own risk and it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You kind of get into a zone with it</li>

            <li> Some have stated to move the ends counter-clockwise of each other - if that works for you, great, but this is what I found is easiest and best results for me.</li>
            <li> Yea sure, it kind of works.</li>
            <li> And, it seems to work much more effectively at removing hairs.  </li>

            <li> This is by far the best!!!</li>

            <li> By far, the best solution you can find, at any price.</li>

            <li> It is good alternative to plucking, saves a lot of time and virtually pain free.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know I had (very fine).</li>
            <li> The very fine peach fuzz isn&#x27;t my concern.  </li>

            <li> Easily 5 stars!</li>
            <li> easy to use and relativly painless!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Unless your beard hair is naturally very fine, I would not bother with this if you are trans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> -- some redness (like a strong blush) that disappeared within 1/2 hour and NO PIMPLES!</li>

            <li> I would strongly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I believe Oprah talked about this product, and I was excited to try it after the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I think the price is very good and the quality of the product is high.</li>
            <li> This tool is much more effective and gets way better results.</li>
            <li> i love this item was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more than happy for choosing the right product..</li>
            <li> All in all, these were both great purchases, do exactly what they claim, and I saved myself about $250 by not purchasing the product I had planned to purchase.were both great purchases, do exactly what they claim, and I saved myself about $250 by not purchasing the product I had planned to purchase.</li>
            <li> If it seems to good to be true...</li>
            <li> It even got the fine hair!</li>
            <li> , mostly it gets the very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Except for the chin (corner of mouth to corner of mouth area), most of the hair is gone or very fine.  </li>
            <li> It does remove all hair and i used to do my eyebrows and it removed most of the hair in one go except like one very fine hair and for some reason it couldnt grab that</li>
            <li> It did nothing on my face but the hairs are sparse and very light.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s tricky to use, but for the most part it&#x27;s really great and so much cheaper than waxing!</li>
            <li> Easy, thorough, and effective.</li>
            <li> This is easy, effective and doesn&#x27;t need time to set up.  </li>
            <li> So easy, so incredibly effective.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s over quickly and does a good job so that you don&#x27;t have to use it all that</li>
            <li> I liked the idea, I think I also easily learned how to make it work</li>
            <li> I get the best results if I use it right after washing my face in hot water before using any moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Face is SUPER SMOOTH and I haven&#x27;t experienced redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use and how effective.</li>
            <li> I am very fair, and have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, extremely sensitive skin and was concerned the R.e.m.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far on facial hair-- so easy to use, very effective!</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the electric epilator I bought.  </li>
            <li> Cleaner and more convenient than waxing.</li>
            <li> This product really works great.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> After using several times, I find it okay, at best.</li>
            <li> This is for sure a money saver.</li>
            <li> It is  best for upper lip, can work on chin and cheeks too.</li>
            <li> I suppose I knew what to expect, so the pain was more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things over the years- waxing, hair removal creams, electrolosis, lazer hair removal-</li>
            <li> so I took my time to use it in different ways, trying to find the way that works best for me.</li>
            <li> so many at once-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but the Spring Sprong deserves a plug.</li>
            <li> Overall truly excellent and</li>
            <li> to rem spring :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that with more use I can figure out an angle to hold it at</li>
            <li> I hear it gets better the more</li>
            <li> Halfway through the car ride I was on my way to removing most of my chin hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to remove all the hairs</li>
            <li> Give it some time to get used to learning how to use it and you will love it to!any dryness.     </li>
            <li> I made sure to wash my skin, exfoliate, tone and moisturize, but I do that every night.  </li>
            <li> I am hopeful, though, that with more practice, I will be able to get into those nooks and crannies as well.</li>
            <li> End of story &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have struggled with it for many years</li>
            <li> But, if you keep up with it, you&#x27;ll never have to remove so many hairs at a time ever again.</li>
            <li> Hey this is the best product to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> hope i helped, cause this thing has givin me a more confident face.</li>
            <li> but it gets better :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26-year-old woman, and I like looking my best for my female partner.  </li>
            <li> She knows how I love my dumps.    </li>
            <li> This spring is one of my favorite purchases I&#x27;ve made in years.  </li>
            <li> I have never been smoother or hair free!</li>
            <li> Sure, there&#x27;s some stinging but nothing to make your eyes water or anything.  </li>
            <li> the more often you use it.  </li>
            <li> The tighter you can make the skin in the area you&#x27;re working on, the better the results.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to be able to see the hair...</li>
            <li> threading is my favorite-</li>
            <li> she is satisfied with this device ...</li>
            <li> It takes more persistence to get the ones under my chin.</li>
            <li> Interesting product.</li>
            <li> Not too sure how hygienic it is as it&#x27;s metal</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Upper lip looks great and the hair pulled out at the root!  </li>
            <li> I still use it but make sure to wipe the spring with alcohol pads before, during and after use.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can use it anytime you want without having to go to the threading studios.</li>
            <li> You will become a hair eradication machine. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The best thing is, no mirrors necessary.    </li>
            <li> I was finally to the point of looking for electrolysis, then I found this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I was relentless and wanted to be hair free in one night, which I would say I was 95% hair free after a good 20 min, maybe more time.  </li>
            <li> I had alot of hair and, y chin was the most stubborn area.  </li>
            <li> Buy this, you will be so glad that you did.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> It does grab all the hairs though and gets them out from the root wich is important!</li>
            <li> and have never been satisfied with results.  </li>
            <li> I will try again and hopefully it will be better.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked better for me.</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s smooth, I honestly can&#x27;t believe how even the shadow is gone.</li>
            <li> Yes a perfect storm for facial hair.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how many hairs were removed.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using it twice a week to stay on top of the regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for about 2 weeks now and just love it.  </li>
            <li> Also, be sure to wash, tone, and use a soothing non-comedogenic moisturizer afterward.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the simplest yet most genius hair removal tool out there.</li>
            <li> My eyes watered when I did this section, but it was more the location than the intensity of the pain that caused it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li> I was glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reiveiws--it does take some practice.  </li>
            <li> I womaned up and decided to give it one more shot</li>
            <li> and I thought they were hilarious.</li>
            <li> I love it; pulled the hair out from the root</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> IF THERE WERE MORE STARS I WOULD GIVE MORE.</li>
            <li> I am able to do it at my pace and my convenience</li>
            <li> I am so impressed that something this simple could work so well.    </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of using it, it really works great.</li>
            <li> I wanted it mostly for my chin area.</li>
            <li> This works better than waxing.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure I&#x27;d break out, but had no problems.</li>
            <li> - Gets faster and more pain-free</li>
            <li> the more you do it.</li>
            <li> Since hair tends to grow in cycles, I&#x27;m doing it once a week or so, just to keep on top of things</li>
            <li> You will be sooo glad you did.    </li>
            <li> Better than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> and I like it much better.</li>
            <li> was OK</li>
            <li> SO the shipping was ok.  </li>
            <li> but once you know how to use you will love it..........</li>
            <li> This is the best way to remove facial hair I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> you may be able to tolerate the pain</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many</li>
            <li> Advantage is that many hairs get pulled at once, rather than one at a time, and you don&#x27;t have to use a mirror.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will &#x27;tweeze&#x27; better than I can see and not take me an hour staring into a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, so I tried the R.e.m. Spring Sprong, and I love it.</li>
            <li> :)   </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this tool.</li>
            <li> rather everyone believe I&#x27;m naturally smooth on my own, not mama gorilla here.</li>
            <li> But geez I love this spring</li>
            <li> Will still be on the look-out for a better tweezer or electrolysis eventually.</li>
            <li> love that I can do this in the convenience of my home.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the most efficient angles, etc.  </li>
            <li> the faster you move this tool, the better.</li>
            <li> You can tell its working by hearing the satisfying pulling of the hair.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t hesitate - I would pay 5 times the amount for how much better I feel about myself.</li>
            <li> It now takes me 10 mins to get rid of any unwanted hair instead of 30 mins or more.</li>
            <li> If you love pain, use this.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the handles could be better.</li>
            <li> But, it is a lot better than having to tweeze all of the hairs one at a time.  </li>
            <li> The more you use it, the more you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I really love this product and have been thinking of ways</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with some doubt in my mind, because many hair removal products just don&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> My lip and jaw are hair free!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that my hair management evolution has been interesting.</li>
            <li> and I think does a much better job of getting all the hair.</li>
            <li> However, if you have ever grabbed more than one hair while tweezing then you know this feeling.</li>
            <li> Her face has never felt smoother and I can tell she&#x27;s a lot more confident.</li>
            <li> After I finish, my chin is SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> just received my spring today and after about 20-30 minutes I removed most of the hair that was bothering me.</li>
            <li> Depending on your pain tolerance, I&#x27;m sure the sensation gets better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> hello smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I imagine it will get better over time, but it will take time.</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s more my skin&#x27;s fault than the product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> somehow I could get a better grip on them and maybe get it to work.</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the way it works.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE the way it works.  </li>
            <li> But it is no worst than waxing.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but it is quite tolerable---give or take ur tolerance for pain !!! :)</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased anything that works so well and is even better than it&#x27;s advertising.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I even stopped wearing make up because it showed the hair even more.</li>
            <li> OK so ive been waxing my face for years and will no longer heat wax again.  </li>
            <li> Results get better by practice.</li>
            <li> This works better than waxing - gets the smallest, finest hair.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, I&#x27;m sooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i expected this to be some kind of hit and miss sort of thing, but with great reviews, i bought it!</li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> But it exceeded my expectation, love this product.</li>
            <li> and i just LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Maybe with more practice it will become easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than chemicals though</li>
            <li> All in all i love mine.</li>
            <li> if you are ok with the pain then this is ok for you.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t even need a mirror to use this device.  </li>
            <li> OK, so  it&#x27;s just a wire-spring thing that you run across your face.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It does an outstanding job, I do it while watching TV or laying in bed.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so hair free!</li>
            <li> Ok, I never write reviews for anything.  </li>
            <li> I started looking at waxing to see if that might be better.</li>
            <li> This is the best method of removing facial hair in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Using this is like plucking, but of course it&#x27;s broader and more hair comes out.</li>
            <li> I am growing more hair in places I never had before (cheeks).</li>
            <li> What I like the most about this device is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like waxing</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out, and nothing more.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it:</li>
            <li> I love that you can take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have bought this couple of times and was quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> so have to use muliple hair clips to make sure I don&#x27;t get that head hair tangled in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m probably not using the item appropriately.</li>
            <li> the waxing method is more preferable to me.</li>
            <li> and it would probably work better.</li>
            <li> I love not using chemicals</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Omg, the best product I have found for removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Tweezers are way easier to handle and much more efficient.</li>
            <li> I just use it while I watch TV at night and it keeps my face smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li> Better than using nair or those mini shavers.  </li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Years ago I made the mistake of shaving them off, and now more and more seem to be there every year.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> I think most of the time it cuts the hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off tearing the hairs out one by one.</li>
            <li> It also gets better the more you use it -</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a lot easier than plucking out one hair at a time, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> NO PAIN!! :)</li>
            <li> Better if you have a 5x or 10x mirror.  </li>
            <li> does (and got sooo many more hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li> My daughter says she can&#x27;t use it, but I surely can.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It took awhile for me to get the hang of how to pull the most hairs at one time.</li>
            <li> Once i figured out how to use it, it works ok.  </li>
            <li> Today I was able to pull a ton of hair from my chin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I would take many breaks in between because I am a coward and it hurt.</li>
            <li> This facial spring hair remover is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Certainly much better than chemicals and creams.</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T HURT ANY MORE THAN PLUCKING...</li>
            <li> so I could make sure I used the R.E.M. Spring correctly.</li>
            <li> She meticulously presents the product and the process, but more than that</li>
            <li> One more star if cleaning was easier.  </li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes I was able to figure it out and on my way to a smooth face!</li>
            <li> I compare the pain to threading and more tolerable than waxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Voila: you may now elegantly decimate your moustache, or whatever.  </li>
            <li> Much better than I got with burning, toxic bleaches.  </li>
            <li> It is tricksy to describe the technique, but I hope I was able to help someone.  </li>
            <li> Much better than I got with burning, toxic bleaches.  </li>
            <li> It is tricksy to describe the technique, but I hope I was able to help someone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> but it does get better as time goes on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll make more sense then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waxing is faster, but this tool is better.  </li>
            <li> It is better than tweezing, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but took a chance and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> And as I got my face closer to the mirror and realized just how many times I would have to rip hairs out of my face in order to rid them all, I became discouraged and set the device aside to collect dust.</li>
            <li> If you can take tweezing, you should be able to handle this...</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just better than most.</li>
            <li> Anyway, love this product; I&#x27;ll never stop using it.</li>
            <li> Love this tool, all my girlfriends</li>
            <li> It probably feels like it hurts more because you are doing it to yourself</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> If you are used to waxing, you might be Okay.</li>
            <li> I feel normal and beautiful again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use any more hair removing creams and get wax done on my face any more..</li>
            <li> and I just love Oprah</li>
            <li> You can stop moving your fingers at any moment to stop pulling out hairs if it is hurting more than you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> What I love about it is that you don&#x27;t have to see the hairs to get them out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any shavers, it&#x27;s better than hair removal creams, it&#x27;s better than plucking each one....</li>
            <li> Love it and it should be sold by amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I had this spring for three years and still love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the spring for a month now, and I love it, but it took a while to get in the groove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love love love this.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I order this and took a chance.  </li>
            <li> For my Neck and Chin it was better for me to look up.</li>
            <li> So find whatever position to work the spring better on</li>
            <li> Luck :)</li>
            <li> it seems to hurt a lot more than waxing  </li>
            <li> tweezers are way better</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love it way better than waxing and creams.  </li>
            <li> It feels like using tweezers but faster because it pulls more than one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> An ingenious device.</li>
            <li> This sometimes works and mostly doesnt.  </li>
            <li> I noticed more blackheads after using this too.</li>
            <li> as if I had shaved so I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!(hope</li>
            <li> It removed the hair from my top lip with ease.  </li>
            <li> Also as a side note, my skin feels so smooooth and my makeup looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Thank you guys! :))&lt;</li>
            <li> After spending more time &amp; money than I&#x27;d like to remember on 2  seperate</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this at all....</li>
            <li> This is much better and easier.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it can sting a tad bit....</li>
            <li> so shop catalogs for a better price.</li>
            <li> it felt so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> It is also MUCH better than the cheaper models out there.  </li>
            <li> I love this spring</li>
            <li> Maybe it gets better</li>
            <li> the more you do it,</li>
            <li> And every pimply teen with an iPad has every greatest hits compilation you could ever make.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sure the REM Nose Hair</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for years and this is so much better and portable to boot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter because I think this is the best way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that with continuance usage, the time in between will lessen.</li>
            <li> I love this thing more than anything in the world.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> Seriously my favorite purchase ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to buy 5 more just in case</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> things are a lot better off there too.</li>
            <li> I may have missed it, but most reviews are from women.  </li>
            <li> BTW,  I have not decided if tightening the skin surface is better or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Though, once thinned out, it goes much better - hairs kinda flick around btw, the spring twangs when I use it in dense</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for touch ups or for a fast treatment.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> leaves more to be desired for under chin areas.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re able to stand for the end result.</li>
            <li> It works better if you hold it ON the spring...</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s probably the best thing I have found to use to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I use to put Sally Hansen hair remover on my face and I am so glad I purchased this item.  </li>
            <li> but glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than the creams.</li>
            <li> The ends are slippery and would be better if they had a rougher surface texture.  </li>
            <li> Better than tweezing</li>
            <li> Bellabe is better.  </li>
            <li> The concept is great though, and they really work.</li>
            <li> I did seem to get more breakouts when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than waxing, or hair epilators.</li>
            <li> I have so much more self confidence in</li>
            <li> Sure, somewhat.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that works!  </li>
            <li> Recommend this product for sure.  </li>
            <li> That could be why I find my results to be better.</li>
            <li> The longer the hair, the more pain.</li>
            <li> Waxing or electrolysis would be a better investment.</li>
            <li> (glad I didn&#x27;t buy that product).</li>
            <li> and I feel confident.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the better you get at it.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial epilator I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve caused myself more discomfort trying to get \\&quot;that</li>
            <li> It does the job but takes time to figure out how it works, it would help to have better instructions.</li>
            <li> Saved many trips to threading place.</li>
            <li> It is the best invention for facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a so-so remedy, still looking for the something better.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is quicker and more efficient then tweezers.</li>
            <li> MUCH better finish</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> so I think that makes it hurt more).  </li>
            <li> and now I am so much more confident.</li>
            <li> it removed most of it and remaining i tweezed...</li>
            <li> i feel more girly....</li>
            <li> I finally figured out what works best depending on which area I am aiming for.</li>
            <li> We are woman, we can handle the pain :)</li>
            <li> That should speaks volume when someone notices a difference :)</li>
            <li> also use this device on the top of my eyebrows, uni-brow, and sides of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased I cannot even begin to express myself.  </li>
            <li> I am almost satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This did pull hair out, but it sure did hurt.  </li>
            <li> Thank you bubzbeauty! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It only took a couple of minutes to figure out the best angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I think you will like it and kep it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> It works better than a $3 cheapo one that I also got and tried out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product...</li>
            <li> Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with it for many years</li>
            <li> But, if you keep up with it, you&#x27;ll never have to remove so many hairs at a time ever again.</li>
            <li> Read more</li>
            <li> So simple and so happy!</li>
            <li> I may just need to practice more.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the redness went away by the next day, and I was so happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I love the R.E.M. Spring.</li>
            <li> but if it is more than 2mm, then it is gone.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This hurts a lot more than threading for some reason.</li>
            <li> But, if you can grin and bear it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find this more helpful than waxing and</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It is way better than using tweezers and or paying for threading.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Almost no pain, more like burning sensation.</li>
            <li> and I love this product...</li>
            <li> (I love you REM :))</li>
            <li> I have been using the same spring for more than 8 months and it is still awesome...</li>
            <li> I stalked it on Amazon, even asking pertinent questions of another prominent reviewer of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t but tell everyone about this awesome product,ve been looking for a product that will remove my facial hair for long,wen</li>
            <li> I saw the number of the reviews on dis product,I had to give it a try too,and oh my God,I love love love it,am so pleased of the result</li>
            <li> no gain\\&quot;,but as u use it more often</li>
            <li> You will not be able to capture as many if you are not angling to spring correctly.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thought of putting a spring to your face and ripping hair off seemed a bit goofy to me, but</li>
            <li> So much better than No</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I will soon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the REM Spring would be able to pull them out.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m so glad I bought it because this is amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this highly enough, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I will say I do love this and choose over waxing any day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting better each time.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to hurt more than when I go</li>
            <li> I was flirting with the idea of getting a NONO but the price (250+) and the  reviews (mostly 1 star on every site it is sold) made me decide to try the R.E.M.</li>
            <li> biggest problem with the REM spring is most of the time instead of pulling out the hairs, it just breaks them off.</li>
            <li> Will work in a pinch, but not a replacement for better methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no breakouts from products, no awful smells, no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Enjoy...!</li>
            <li> This is one of the better brands of the spring type hair removers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure in time I&#x27;ll get used to it in time but the pain is with it.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, this is not even made in China or India.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial remover ever!!</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad i did</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think we all need it :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE my R.E.M. spring.</li>
            <li> Honestly, most the time I use it without any redness.</li>
            <li> Works best for me when there&#x27;s only about two (maybe 3) inches of spring between my hands.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week over most of my face for about an hour while watching TV.</li>
            <li> Love these things.  </li>
            <li> Have recommended this product to many people.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> All in all this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than shaving my face and getting razor cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I save the more wiry hairs for the tweezers.</li>
            <li> if u can put up with the stinging, u will love it.</li>
            <li> Oh and yes it does hurt, am sure with continued use as some stated you will get more used to that</li>
            <li> Love the REM.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love that it pulls the hair from the roots.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love this thing,</li>
            <li> and I really love the way it gets rid of the peach fuzz and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Your face will be smooth!  </li>
            <li> Some things that seem too good to be true are true!  </li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it&#x27;s quick, clean, and very effective.</li>
            <li> Good for grabbing peach fuzz if you can get it to work right.  </li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time yesterday and YEAH !!!</li>
            <li> First of all,  it WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> the real reason for this review is to say, WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW BY BECKY!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to continue using this cost effective hair removal solution.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to get a really good wax first to remove most of the hair, and use this to maintain.</li>
            <li> The product is great for the price but takes long time and also it pains while using it.so if you have patience its a good product.</li>
            <li> Reading about it and then reading the reviews, I felt pretty sure this would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li> This is so cheap, so easy and so effective.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use straight out of the box, and I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this thing.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, when the itch to \\&quot;live large\\&quot; needs a scratch, hey, get the band back together and hit the road for another \\&quot;greatest hits\\&quot; tour, supporting another \\&quot;greatest hits\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I loved this the first couple times.</li>
            <li> Hurts at first, then kinda feels good.</li>
            <li> This baby works pretty good.....</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this product.</li>
            <li> So I take my own sweet time while at it.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on my happy- trail and it was more painful/ not as effective as on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise its worth !!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinner which I&#x27;m excited about!</li>
            <li> A unique product!</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$!!</li>
            <li> But, its definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> I tried it right out of the box and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cool!!!</li>
            <li> I love removing hair with this - it&#x27;s so easy and addicting.  </li>
            <li> and I love that I can travel easily with it.  </li>
            <li> Probably because our faces have so many angles but just a word of caution that it isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wipe off any excess oil/moisture from the skin so the spring can roll easily.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to learn and to handle and so much better (and cheaper) than waxing and threading.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t rip hair out from the roots (especially fine hair on sensitive areas of the face) without pain.  </li>
            <li> thing is quick and effective.</li>
            <li> With waxing, your skin gets warm and you can pull the hair out with one quick swipe.</li>
            <li> Also, works best when your skin is completely dry.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, my face is as smooth as a babies butt!  </li>
            <li> This is really nice, as you can do bits at a time really quick.  </li>
            <li> I like best is it is fast, and I am not spending so much time with the tweezers.</li>
            <li> Overall fantastic product, great price!  </li>
            <li> and the most important things are to use it often to reduce the pain and make sure that your face is washed and exfoliated before and after each use.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to say that it works great on me--particularly on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> Maybe more so the fact that I have sensitive skin, but I just hope I can save anyone else the pain that I experienced from using this product.  </li>
            <li> It is so handy and easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is very easy to clean as well.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, I think this is a fine product that does the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Pulls out many fine hairs but not course hairs.</li>
            <li> It can be used anywhere on the face, but won&#x27;t pick up extremely fine baby hairs, as many have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It caught all the fine hairs, and the more course ones as well.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a mild toner afterward and moisturize!  </li>
            <li> did read many of the reviews, and the advice about going clockwise with one end and counter clockwise with the other was excellent advice.  </li>
            <li> Another nice thing is I can throw this in my purse and if I missed a spot, I can easily and quickly take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that for anyone who has had their face waxed before, it&#x27;s definitely not very painful.</li>
            <li> Very cool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important thing to know is that this product works quickly, works effectively and is easily carried around with you.</li>
            <li> Overall the best product I have found and with everything there is always a little drawback and figuring how to use it best for you.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product; once you get the hang of it, it is faster and more efficient than a tweezers.</li>
            <li> But for me this is soooo much more comfortable than waxing, threading or even plucking.</li>
            <li> It works great and my sensitive skin is not complaining.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order a couple of extras to make sure I always have one available.</li>
            <li> I make sure to do a light scrub after as I will break out if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Wow this product is great..........</li>
            <li> light colored hair on my chin, cheeks and ajowls... almost invisible to most people.. but not me.  </li>
            <li> Plucks most of my hair off and keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li> and I have almost no lingering irritation and my face is smooth, which makes my skin look better and makeup smoother.  </li>
            <li> If the hair is not laying in an ideal direction, it may pull the hair, but not actually remove it....</li>
            <li> But it is the best $20 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> but wow it works great</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, I hope this type of product is on the market for the longterm because it is incredible</li>
            <li> AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT</li>
            <li> wow, it works great.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this is the best money (of ANY amount) that I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it was working, but then I was able to figure it out and it was catching hairs.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well and frankly any good hair removal has some pain involved.  </li>
            <li> it kind of hurts, but its worth it</li>
            <li> but it really does a darn good job once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I laughed almost the whole way through.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I have used it as much as I would like, but it is a good buy if looking for another alternative to hair removal.</li>
            <li> It really is a good product and very timely in delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very quick, very easy, inexpensive and no chemicals to burn the skin.</li>
            <li> OK, first thought upon using this--they should use it to extract info from unsavory characters!!</li>
            <li> This cool spring really does a great job getting rid of all the fuzzy, fine hair all over your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that this gadget can remove tiny and fine hairs!</li>
            <li> A very nice product i have seen so far.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine and light colored hair on my jawline, but it&#x27;s longer than most women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Works great and nearly painless for the fine hairs on chin and \\&quot;unibrow\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The Spring Sprong did not hurt any more than threading does, it pulls out the tiny hairs, and it is much more cost effective!</li>
            <li> Pretty ingenious!  </li>
            <li> but then you get familiar with the areas of your face and which sting more than others.  </li>
            <li> SWEET!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this thing!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I am really impressed with this little tool.  </li>
            <li> Actually this is as good as it gets!  </li>
            <li> Hurts a bit at first, longer the hair the more it hurts!</li>
            <li> Try it, and you will not be disappointed--you sometimes have to go over an area more than once, but it does work, and the best part is, you can use it in the dark!</li>
            <li> Glad I got it although I don&#x27;t smile when using it like the lady in the picture!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not painful at all!</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34; we have on our faces and this R.E.M. Spring is better than wax, threading or hair remover</li>

            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s going to hurt - you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your face - but the pain diminishes the more you use it, so just go to your happy place and stick with it.</li>

            <li> br /&gt;it helps me a lot...very easy in use and gives god results .&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister was looking for a more cost effective hair removal method since she just graduated  college and wants to conserve her cash.</li>
            <li> It works well, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and is surprisingly easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> this product is so easy to use and it pulls out a lot of hair at one time.  </li>
            <li> It saves time and money, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got acne-prone skin and an aversion to strong chemicals.</li>
            <li> The good news: use it frequently and it is markedly more tolerable.</li>
            <li> Now that the breakout is done and gone, I have to say I still do not regret using the spring, because it DID do a very good job of tweezing out all the long vellus hairs on my face, chin and neck.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and handy... usually use while watching tv LOL.  </li>
            <li> I pulls out your fine hairs and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It truly is amazing how simple, ingenious and effective this thing is.</li>
            <li> These apparently make great inexpensive gifts according to her.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, anyone who is suffering from what I went through SHOULD REALLY PURCHASE THIS!  </li>
            <li> I was quite thrilled when I first used this.</li>
            <li> I just keep doing this until I notice that it is not painful anymore and then begin with more detail.  </li>
            <li> Take a shower first, or wash your face with warm water to soften your hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still just as effective as the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still pretty effective.</li>
            <li> first off i bought this on ebay because honestly i dont like paying for shipping</li>
            <li> It is the best thing I have found yet and extremely affordable!</li>
            <li> Well, to be honest, I&#x27;m remarkably uncoordinated, so I can&#x27;t consistently twist the&amp;#34;right counterclockwise, left clockwise&amp;#34; , but that&#x27;s more me than the device.</li>
            <li> The first time is the hardest because there is the most hair to remove and it hurts the most.</li>
            <li> I think the hairs are too fine for this spring to work there.</li>
            <li> but it seems to get all the fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt the first time, but now I&#x27;m at the time where I&#x27;m happier the more it hurts because it means I&#x27;m getting more hairs out.</li>
            <li> This spring did get the fine baby hairs; that&#x27;s not what I needed.</li>
            <li> so it got all of the fine hairs I could see and some</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and it still works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Mostly it is fine,</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer it works on fine hair, remember it sort of pulls it out so the thicker the hair, well ouch.  </li>
            <li> You will have to experiment with the spring at first to find the best twisting method, but once you do, this is a waste-free and affordable way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cling to my hairs there - maybe they are too fine?</li>
            <li> think this will work well for people who have uniform hair types/lengths or people who want to pick up longish hairs that are fine to medium thickness.</li>
            <li> It gets both just fine.</li>
            <li> I like it because it could grab my fine hair.</li>
            <li> The spring remover did a fine job.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll hit the sweet spot unexpectedly and regret it, lol.</li>
            <li> It hurts quite a bit the first times, but it gets better the more you use it.</li>
            <li> can imagine this would work well for any fine hairs, like the lip, chin, sideburns, even arm hair  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this could help me when I travel and can&#x27;t see fine hairs as well as when I use my magnifying mirror at home.</li>
            <li> but it grabs all those fine hairs that are missed by tweezers and sometimes even missed by waxing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to get rid of my fine upper-lip hairs (i.e., mustache) as well as the hairs between my eyebrows and on my chinnie-chin-chin.</li>
            <li> I just received my REM Spring in the mail yesterday and I am amazed at how quickly I was able to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing it is so quick</li>
            <li> It was quick and better than cream remover which tends to burn your face.  </li>
            <li> Very easy, very fast hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way the ends of the tool twist around easily, and because they are kind of tapered at the end</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to look like Chewbacca nor am I doomed to spending money on batteries, creams, wax that rips everything but your hair, and it&#x27;s relatively fast and easy, and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> However the process is much more pleasant than individually plucking the hairs out.</li>
            <li> THIS is the ticket for fine hair, light in color on the face and chin.</li>
            <li> It effectively does the job and can cover large areas while doing so.  </li>
            <li> Good for sideburns where you have room,  not so good in tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> This little product is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This little tool is so awesome, I want to tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li> This little device is awesome.  </li>
            <li> This little spring works great!  </li>
            <li> Take a little while to master the technique but its great!  </li>
            <li> , she is very, very funny!  </li>
            <li> This little torture device is the best thing ever...</li>
            <li> Excellent little tool.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much!!</li>
            <li> Works great on both coarse and fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product for removing fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The REM Spring is so simple and easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> A consistently clean upper lip for the first time in my life makes this one of my best purchases of all time.</li>
            <li> It a Little bit hurts but it saves my time and money ,and enables me to enjoy the best result ever .</li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin that even gentle waxes would make me break out, no to mention the monthly cost</li>
            <li> After professional waxing, home wax strips, creme hair removers, electric tweezers and regular tweezers to remove a lot of facial hair (I am a female by the way), this product is the best, most effective, easy, cheapest and simplest solution of all, excellent product and great idea, simple to use.</li>
            <li> I prefer this than shaving (a HUGE no-no) or waxing.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I purchased this was because I had been using an electric epilator on my face which was causing huge breakouts (again, despite disinfecting it and my face before hand).&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to use those wax or  those harsh hair removed, this one is perfect...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a great alternative to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> Fast and Effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Very cost effective versus waxing at a salon.</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned, brunette.</li>
            <li> my face is always hair free and smooth now.</li>
            <li> My chin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to look for a cheap product I could use at home.</li>
            <li> My hair is light</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> Really happy that I bought it and like feeling empowered to maintain facial hair removal by myself.</li>
            <li> peach fuzz free.</li>
            <li> Fantastic invention.</li>
            <li> This works well on light to mediums size hairs but thicker hairs still need tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great at removing hair, however causes tiny whiteheads on my chin the day after using.  </li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out at the root and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> One week ago in my quest to find hair relife I stumbled across this product and I am now hair free, and released from the burdon of a razor.  </li>
            <li> I rub my chin all the time amazed at how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> It is not pain free, but no method of hair removal is.  </li>
            <li> It is better than tweezing hair off your face because the REM spring gets it off fast and more pain free than tweezers.</li>
            <li> but this just verified how much facial hair I had lol</li>
            <li> It did not remove the really light \\&quot;baby hairs\\&quot; from my forehead at all.</li>
            <li> I started using a bikini trimmer, but it was never as smooth as I had hoped and had a prickly feel within two days.  </li>
            <li> If you roll the spring back and forth between your forefingers and your thumbs and move your hands instead of trying to roll the spring all over your face it works great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that easy to clean</li>
            <li> Besides that it is handy to travel with and really does work.</li>
            <li> I use the spring every nightjust to catch any strays and keep my face smooth.  </li>
            <li> just make sure that after each usage that you wash your face completely with luke warm water and apply 100% Aloe Vera Gel so that you calm the irritation or make sure you don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this solution because it totally beats anything else</li>
            <li> Product is great at removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li> This is very cost effective too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this thing works great to remove my unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> My overall comments about this product are that it&#x27;s a great alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic for pulling hair, and you just have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> overall great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to twist in and</li>
            <li> My face is finally smooth.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards I&#x27;m amazed how smooth my skin is around my chin and lip, and there is no irritation on my mole or my skin.  </li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known that a metal spring wouldn&#x27;t be pain free, and I guess I did kinda know that.</li>
            <li> Now I can get rid of that baby fuzz that bugs me when light hits it.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t always catch everything, but more fun then tweezing</li>

            <li> Before this product, I would lightly razor the area...</li>

            <li> I keep mine in my car to use while I&#x27;m stuck at a light.  </li>

            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> This did great on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Review after review after review spouting nothing but fantastic comments.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap, reusable and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I got the cheap one to have in the car.  </li>
            <li> My face is completely smooth and I wish I had bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> its cheap but does the job.</li>
            <li> Also, it looks like it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> smooth) skin.</li>
            <li> What works best for me- is to actually roll it almost straight-</li>
            <li> I love using it because its so much more fast then tweezing</li>
            <li> I have plucked, waxed, used creams, and this by far is the easiet and most effective way to remove those hairs..   </li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin, and warn you not to use this device if you do as well.  </li>
            <li> really wish the spring worked for my purposes, but it wasn&#x27;t able to pick up the thicker, more visible hairs.</li>
            <li> I definitely made a good decision because I love it</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and it works really good on me</li>
            <li> Very good on fine hair is does not always completely remove the more course hair but does pull it out enough that the tweezers easily finish the task.</li>
            <li> , it takes a bit of experimenting to get the right angles and get the most out of it, but you&#x27;ll figure it out, it&#x27;s not rocket science.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Very effective, and relatively painless.  </li>
            <li> the acne breakouts are very rare.  </li>
            <li> This hair remover is very simple and very effective.</li>
            <li> However -- this product really requires steady hands, great coordination and the ability to apply pressure all simultaneously.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use, it pulls facial hairs out without catching your skin.</li>
            <li> Using is little tricky, its basically needs roll and twist movement against the hair growth, but there are many U-Tube videos on spring, they have demonstrated beautifully.</li>
            <li> At first, I was not going to review this product because there were already so many truthful, positive reviews; now I know firsthand that those who say the spring works well are correct!</li>
            <li> Ive never been so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, there is no learning curve -</li>
            <li> It was super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love being hair free, my skin looks so much nicer without the fuzz!  </li>
            <li> The product is super easy to use once you figure out which direction to roll it.  </li>
            <li> I watched that it is best to use it a lot to keep the nerves use to it, because if you go a long time without using it then it will really hurt when you use it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> It goes quick and easy once you get the bend-twist-roll technique going.</li>
            <li> It is so quick and easy that I can remove hair in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I like the convenience of having something quick and easy and portable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use this tool to remove it easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so quick and easy to use before doing a makeup.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; Easy</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, doesn&#x27;t get under your chin very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this on the hair around my mouth was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quick and easy to use..</li>
            <li> quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Best little device ever!  </li>
            <li> so grateful for all the reviews that helped me decide to try this awesome little Spring!</li>
            <li> I have used it on my whole face (which I also love to get an extra smooth face as it greatly reduces my peace fuzz) and</li>
            <li> I clean it after every use with a quick rinse in a very mild soap water mix.  </li>
            <li> This tool is so simple and produces amazing results!  </li>
            <li> I am so excited over this product!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and smooth, I simply love it!</li>
            <li> The discomfort involved is negligible and the product more than paid for itself during the first week</li>
            <li> Whoever invented this thing deserves to be rich.   </li>
            <li> I love this product does exactly what I need it too.</li>
            <li> But, it was so worth it!  </li>
            <li> I am excited about how portable this tool is to use.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed at all with this product...</li>
            <li> Horray for my first review &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Before ordering the product, I read over 100 reviews about it, and was so excited to give it a try.   </li>
            <li> I was so excited for it to come that I ripped it out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when I read the reviews about this product, so when it arrived I was eager to use it immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> , I guess because it is grabbing the most hairs that first time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Some of the super fine hairs maybe broke off</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Yes, this does cause temporary discomfort, but the tradeoffs are worth it!  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful, and YES it does hurt a bit, but no more than waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rewriting my original review which was five stars.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews for this, I was excited, but hesitant.  </li>
            <li> and I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> More so the first time you use</li>
            <li> First time I tried it on my eyebrows, it works its ninja magic and yes, my eyelashes got caught in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Caused significant irritation, as if I broke out into a severe rash.</li>
            <li> I was willing to take a chance on this product,  I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny (an will now save me $$ as I do not have to pay to get it removed!)</li>
            <li> Hurts at first, but pulls out many hairs</li>
            <li> you forget the pain when you are watching something funny or cute online....</li>
            <li> For a deceptively simple looking device, this works remarkably well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I originally planned to give this 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product and still am somewhat.</li>
            <li> Based on my first use, I love it.</li>
            <li> Up a couple of months ago, I was bleaching, but I could still notice the significant &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34;  I have tried waxing over the years and breakouts were the result.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this but found that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t get all hairs, but reduces tweezing significantly.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to clean the area first with witch hazel so as not to get bumps.</li>
            <li> , all was fine and good until digital media upset the Apple cart.</li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as it arrived, its so fast &amp; easy to use!</li>
            <li> I am certain that it will get quicker with practice and frequency of use, but I am beyond pleased with the results of my first time!!</li>
            <li> I use  it on a clean face and clean the spring w my toner.</li>
            <li> Please note you cannot clean the device with water since it will rust.</li>
            <li> I will keep cleaning it the way I have been and hope it stays clean.</li>
            <li> Please note you cannot clean the device with water since it will rust.</li>
            <li> I will keep cleaning it the way I have been and hope it stays clean.</li>
            <li> For those wondering how to clean it, I found that the ends unscrew</li>
            <li> and I kind of prefer a realistically groomed look to a an overly perfect fake</li>
            <li> Once you figure this stuff out, the spring itself does a great job and is worth 5 stars for how it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it then clean with an alcohol wipe.</li>
            <li> When I try to clean the hair off from the device, the spring gets loosened.</li>
            <li> RIP, clean up</li>
            <li> Now it is easy and fun just twisting and turning.</li>
            <li> followed the directions to clean my face after use and apply moisturizer</li>
            <li> This system does what tweezers cannot - removes lots of hair from the root cleanly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;I will not have to wax</li>
            <li> I do like to follow with an astrigent to clean well where to hairs been plucked and avoid a blemish</li>
            <li> The way I clean this spring is with a damp paper towel and let it air dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hubby, who is admirably supportive with whatever I decide to do with facial hair, said he liked the results.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would clean up some of the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> and it looks clean and</li>
            <li> I followed one review written in the product reviews and washed my face clean and then epilated in the morning after bath.</li>
            <li> I wonder how I can clean it..</li>
            <li> To avoid this, wash the face before or after, and also use a cotton ball of rubbing alcohol on the spring after (or something to clean</li>
            <li> u could only see it in bright light (I hope).</li>
            <li> I did consider going to my local hardware store and buying a spring to make my own, but glad i took the plunge and bought the REM.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> This really does remove from the root, and somehow was more comfortable to use than the epilators that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> And please, clean it with alcohol before EACH use, not just once a month as the unhelpful directions suggest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a matter of keeping your skin really clean.</li>
            <li> It picks a stray hair here and there, but would take forever to use for clean removal.</li>
            <li> It works great on the hair underneath the nose but don&#x27;t have much luck using it on the sides of my face near the chin.</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m pretty impressed and will certainly keep using it in replacement for threading or waxing.</li>
            <li> long as this tool is used correctly, it is very effective.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday, received it on Monday so super fast shipping!!!    </li>
            <li> it works perfectly for my facial hair, sometimes requires to do the same area couple of times before you get rid of all hair, but overall it is just great</li>
            <li> It does work on fine hairs though, so it is slightly useful.</li>
            <li> It does smart a bit, but boy is it better than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it on my eyebrows because it would be hard to make them perfect</li>
            <li> It did a great job of removing the fine hairs (which is what make up most of my face fuzz), but I had to use tweezers for the hairs that were really short and the ones that were embedded just barely under my skin and close to surfacing (my stylist calls them pepper spots).</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used this handy little tool today and could not be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, the first time I used it, the sensation was almost too much.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Tip: use at night before going to bed, because your skin WILL be bright red after using it</li>
            <li> This device does a pretty nice job and you dont really need to watch yourself in a mirror to do it.</li>
            <li> Wow, amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, the first time I used it, the sensation was almost too much.</li>
            <li> I had a smooth, hairless face and felt confident, no longer conscious of walking into bright light that illuminates blonde hairs.</li>
            <li> Being able to grow hair fast is a blessing but also a curse in disguise.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of removing the tiny hairs, the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> In 10 mins I had good hairless upper lip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel as much of a pinch as others have reported, it feels more like a hair being tweezed out.  </li>
            <li> It does come with a nice soft case to keep the spring in which was a plus.</li>
            <li> So yes I resorted to shaving, it is embarrising but true.</li>
            <li> I love it and it is so much faster than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this isn&#x27;t good enough, so</li>
            <li> Then use some hair growth inhibitor to keep it from growing back and you should be all good.</li>
            <li> : My wife likes it so much that she has now purchased more for her friends.</li>
            <li> (I stumbled upon it on Amazon while looking for a good facial waxing product).  </li>
            <li> I use Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Mist, which is more of a tonique to restore pH balance after I wash my face (and it gently exfoliates) -</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t good for those coarse hairs</li>
            <li> So if you are ordering that make sure they send you cover too, its very convenient to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> It is so much faster and easier than waxing and for me it even works better.</li>
            <li> So many times I would get ready to go somewhere and panic because I didn&#x27;t have time to tweeze or wait for wax to heat up.</li>
            <li> Now it still removes a good amount of hair, but I have to use tweezers to remove the final 20%.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t get all of the hair, and I wound up having to use tweezers in a couple places, but overall, it did a good job.</li>
            <li> I also washed my face really well afterwards - so hopefully my skin will be ok</li>
            <li> its not a painful yank</li>
            <li> this is a really good alternative to threading, especially if you don&#x27;t know how to do it.</li>
            <li> I used to tweeze and it would take me so much time but with this product I get better results in a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> so much I guess from pulling many hairs at once.</li>
            <li> REM is stronger,  more efficient with heavier duty stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> so it last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt, but it sure didn&#x27;t remove much of anything.  </li>
            <li> but I am glad I bought it because it saves me so much time.</li>
            <li> Took about a full minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful at removing unwanted facial hair and the greatest aspect is that it&#x27;s small enough to even tuck away in your purse or travel kit.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> and I was cool with that because I decided that I could watch TV simultaneously.</li>
            <li> I never have been able to make this work very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more bending than twisting the item; gently separating the coils of the spring, applying it to the roots of the unwanted hair, closing the coils over them, and commencing a pulling and rolling motion.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much, I have given it as a gift as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful on my chin at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful at all</li>
            <li> It works reasonably well to remove most of that hair.</li>
            <li> Its good for removing hair on your upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I now take care of it in the privacy of my own home as frequently as I need to.  </li>
            <li> I love this, so much easier than tweezing.</li>
            <li> But her smooth, hairless face from the use of the R.E.M. Spring is worth it.</li>
            <li> good price for this item since its only a spring</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> I heard about this product on bubzbeauty youtube channel and i&#x27;m glad she spoke about it because it makes things so much easier.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for the majority of hairs, but I still have to go back over and get the stubborn ones with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Was not painful either.  </li>
            <li> So much better than waxing and no worse than plucking.</li>
            <li> IMHO, it was not painful.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this product but it worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> will say I have developed a routine that for those who breakout like I do after any kind of hair removal has worked with REM Spring.  </li>
            <li> I told my mom and sister about it and they both purchased one and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked me to order a good product for facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> Good for the upper lip, but there is a lot of realstate when you go beyond that.  </li>
            <li> Stainless steel is hypo allergenic, and able to be  cleaned with rubbing alcohol, without worrying the coating is going to come off.</li>
            <li> This had such good ratings, I decided to buy</li>
            <li> The price @ 19.99.. not bad either.</li>
            <li> Small and handy, fits anywhere, good product</li>
            <li> No bad reaction, no bruising nothing with this device.</li>
            <li> I have very fine facial hair and more of it since menopause.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any product or service that would get rid of the very fine blonde fuzz on my face, now I have :).</li>
            <li> I experienced only mild discomfort the first time I used it -</li>
            <li> This device is small, handy, easily stored and effective and inexpensive for what it can do.  </li>
            <li> Now, I love havin&#x27; a good lookin&#x27; mustache every now and then, but the little lady says she prefers clean shaven skin.    </li>
            <li> This little gadget works great it quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than wax, less time consuming than tweezing and is totally awesome.  </li>
            <li> cannot understand why the REM company doesn&#x27;t explain how important it is to twirl your fingers in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy (unless you don&#x27;t read the two step directions first).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s pretty easy to work with</li>
            <li> but a quick wash with soap and water followed by pulling apart the coils while the water ran full blast</li>
            <li> Well there is better detailed reviews on how to use it but as far as it working it works!</li>
            <li> I rated the Spring 4 stars because, while it does a great job removing most facial hair, it doesn&#x27;t do real well with coarse or very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Try it out, practice a little, get comfortable with it, and I think it&#x27;ll be a great purchase for anyone.</li>
            <li> But, I have finally found the next best thing to true permanent hair removal (which just doesn&#x27;t exist yet).</li>
            <li> And as other reviewers have said, youtube has some great videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other touchup is great too.  </li>
            <li> But, I have finally found the next best thing to true permanent hair removal (which just doesn&#x27;t exist yet).</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the best invention ever.</li>
            <li> Then once the first fine hairs are gone</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a quick pain.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, there are many, many nerve endings on your upper lip, using this device stings-</li>
            <li> lol not so much in the upper lip but on the peach fuss on my face.</li>
            <li> It nothing more than a spring that could be purchased at most hardware or big Box stores.  </li>
            <li> They help the redness fade quickly...</li>
            <li> Hopefully this product will continue to be enhanced to make it more controllable, i.e. able to hone in on specific hairs to be removed.</li>
            <li> It grasps the hair at the root and with a quick twist pulls them out.</li>
            <li> What I like is that it doesn&#x27;t take out all of the hair (although I&#x27;m sure if you did it enough you could get rid of most of it).  </li>
            <li> I bought this recently and had doubts that it would really work, despite all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and as described.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially tweezing many, many hairs at once.  </li>
            <li> Now I can finally look for a job because I got my confidence back and this product is great!</li>
            <li> Quickly done, though, so not too bothersome.  </li>
            <li> This is the cheapest, easiest, most ingenious product for facial hair removal I&#x27;ve seen!  </li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> It happens quick but it happens none the less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> super quick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i just quickly do it at home.</li>
            <li> This works best to remove hair above my upper lip and below my lower lip and chin.  </li>
            <li> The quality is great and it is stainless steel so should last.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is quickly roll it over your hair and it rips it out.</li>
            <li> I can use this spring while I am watching TV or quickly before I apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great price, does what it says and very convenient.  </li>
            <li> With the spring I can just use it quickly and be done.</li>
            <li> It removes the hair fairly quickly without having to go over spots over and over.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so quick</li>
            <li> On my upper lip it&#x27;s better for me to let the spring be more of a frown vs a U.</li>
            <li> but I quickly figured it out-</li>
            <li> Shaving has left scars on my face and this is a cheap yet effective alternative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and so efficient.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The only difference with my tweezers and REM it pulls out more hair at one time, so I see it more of a convenience of saving time.</li>
            <li> i will be honest it stings a bit more than expected.</li>
            <li> You will quickly figure out how it works and then refine your skills.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t grab some of the most noticeable ones, however--no matter how many different angles I approached them from.</li>
            <li> Like any hair removal product that takes hair out at the root, you will have a bit of redness after you use it, but it clears up quickly, and there&#x27;s no residue from wax, no drying out from creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I keep it in my purse and if I feel any hairs coming in, I can quickly remove them.</li>
            <li> As I got older, my moustache became more noticable.  </li>
            <li> It worked easily, quickly, and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The spring works quick no irritation.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li> All the good reviews are true - this is such a simple product in design, and so effective.</li>
            <li> This at least gets a lot of the hair, but it does seem to work better for the fine baby hairs and not quite as a good for the course ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this device after reading so many positive reviews and very much regretted it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best way to do a little maintenance each week and keep my skin looking smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It does get a little challenging under the chin area, but with practice I was able to figure out a way to do it, by holding the spring all the way on the top, rather than the bottom and getting on the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> This DOES work on very very course hair!</li>
            <li> you suffer from coarse hair and understand there willbe some pain, this is a very worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3N5WSTO0GJK1Z]]This is a video showing my very first time using the REM spring.</li>
            <li> Pulling Spring is great; but don&#x27;t expect it to bring you back to the magic teen years like listening to \\&quot;Document\\</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this product for many years to come, especially since it&#x27;s of great durable quality.</li>
            <li> If I did it more frequently it probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt as much each time because my skin would be more adapted to using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased a threading tool at the same time and found the REM spring much easier to use and more effective.</li>
            <li> but once I nailed it down I was happy and hairless.  </li>
            <li> Super easy and fast.  </li>
            <li> Sit back and watch your favorite sitcom and tear the hair right out of your face.  :-)</li>
            <li> Okay, so I wasn&#x27;t very sure I should buy this little spring when I saw it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So long as you can handle inflicting the slight bit of pain it causes on yourself (which will improve as you continue to use it, as your hair will grow in more fine/thin), it works great!</li>
            <li> Its cheap, discreet, small, painless and most importantly IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> and if you have stubble you&#x27;re probably trying to tug at new hair or you have to play more with the angle and the closeness of the spring to the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite new gadgets.</li>
            <li> I live it and my friends love it&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try something new, because, more often than not, they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The spring is so easy to use and does the job really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time.  </li>
            <li> but this is the best solution I have come across to keep away unwanted facial hair in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of haris on my chinny, chin, chin, and this product makes removing them fast and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and fast too.</li>
            <li> but once you do, it is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> But it works pretty good in removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> It really works and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even hurt that much and is easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
            <li> This spring is so fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good solution to unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It really works well and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to remove the hairs that weren&#x27;t a problem, but in the long run, this spring saves me a ton of time trying to eyeball the ones I want to remove, and I feel confident when I leave the house that no one is seeing any missed hairs.</li>
            <li> This product is really easy to use and is very efficient.</li>
            <li> I think this little spring is my new best friend!!!      </li>
            <li> I bought a second one to be  sure I always have one!  </li>
            <li> do it fast!!  </li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when it worked exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li> I purchased the REM Spring and in the first evening of getting it, I had managed to remove all of the hair that had been bothering me since I was a kid!</li>
            <li> and I felt it pulling out the hair on the first try!</li>
            <li> (At first I thought OMG!</li>
            <li> I actually kinda love this product!</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered this a year ago when I first saw it while researching NoNo!</li>
            <li> Not only is this device so simple, it works remarkably!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Best purchase lately!</li>
            <li> The REM is a great product an will save you so much money in the long run!</li>
            <li> Better than tweezing and waxing by far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to just pull it out, run it across my skin a few times, and be good to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Think I maybe will try it a few more times to make sure my technique is good, but I think my main issue will be that it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> And if you have oily skin, you need to use a tissue to clean the skin first.  </li>
            <li> I had some problems with some of the fine hairs breaking, but I was rolling it too fast.  </li>
            <li> but once you do is the fastest most effective way to do it at home without the mess of wax or cream.</li>
            <li> If your skin is very sensitive to pain you might want to consider going to a professional (obviously you will still be in pain, but you aren&#x27;t inflicting it upon yourself), or bleaching might be your best bet.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of experimenting with the amount of flex and how to turn the handles, but once you get used to it, it works great.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of the little hairs here and there great.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a learning curve but keep at it, great tool.</li>
            <li> What a great little investment.</li>
            <li> I use it on the fine, blonde hair on the sides of my face &amp; along my jawline &amp; it gives smooth hair free skin &amp; did not hurt a bit.</li>
            <li> After reading the great review on how to use this hair remover, I tried with little success.  </li>
            <li> if you do it right after a hot shower the pain is lessened significantly.</li>
            <li> I am 60, very fair and have always had a white blonde mustache and lots of stray chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> these little tweaks, I really love how effective this product is; you may have to go over an area a couple times to ensure that the hair is removed, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> More importantly it did an amazing job, this little gadget is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Although they&#x27;re fine hairs, I have too many hairs above and below my lips and they grow RIGHT up to my lips.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all very thorough and detailed.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of facial hair quickly, cheaply, and on their own schedule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for keeping face free from unwanted hair you might have to use almost 2- 3 times a week depends on how much hair you have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and the wife is really happy with it.  </li>
            <li> This works amazingly and hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for weeks!</li>
            <li> After several sessions of practicing with this, I have the hang of it, and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> and it hadn&#x27;t really occurred to me that it was going to be a HUGE problem getting it to work for me.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the tool itself is fantastic and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is amazing how i don&#x27;t have to worry about taking time to use my tweezers or wax to get rid of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing for facial hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth the asking price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still useful for on-</li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s the fact that it hurts like a bitch in my more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> With all the phenomenal reviews on this product, I expected much more.</li>
            <li> It kind of makes me feel low at times.</li>
            <li> I found the R.E.M. Spring, it seemed like it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d give it a solid \\&quot;OK\\&quot; because it does what it says it will, but it&#x27;s not any kind of miracle product.</li>
            <li> I plan to order another one, so that I have a backup in my car for unexpected emergencies :)</li>
            <li> PLEASE try this if you suffer with the humiliation and hassle of unwanted facial hair, you will be so thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny of the purchase price.</li>
            <li> However, in all fairness my tweezer days may end completely as I become more proficient.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am so pleased it surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I cannot express how nice it is not to worry about my facial hair or 5 o&#x27;clock stubble.</li>
            <li> for 9.99 it seemed worth a shot...</li>
            <li> but it well worth it.</li>
            <li> While there is no product that will remove hair with no discomfort whatsoever, this one is by far the most tolerable I have come across.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how smooth my upper and lower lips are.  </li>
            <li> Far better than that.</li>
            <li> I had so much fun using it, my husband was laughing at me.</li>
            <li> Worth the try for the price.</li>
            <li> It is more time consuming than waxing (which I can&#x27;t do anymore because it really irritates my skin), but really does remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> and I thought what the heck, it would be worth the try for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Far better then waxing and tweezing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this out for fun, as I read a number of reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would say this product ia by far the most painful&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I was surprised how great it was for the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> yes, it hurts, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the quickest, easiest, most pain free facial hair removal technique I have tried.  </li>
            <li> well so was worth it).  </li>
            <li> My search for an effective facial hair removal technique ends here.  </li>
            <li> This is the most fantastic facial hair removal system I have ever found!</li>
            <li> as ive aged I routinely pay good money for &amp;#34;youth rejuvenation&amp;#34; that does not mix well with waxing.....i.e.</li>
            <li> It was worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> But we can just roll it over a few times a week to keep things nice and smooth and voila!</li>
            <li> If you want to be hairless and not spend a lot than you&#x27;ll tolerate it, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The results are worth it though.</li>
            <li> me, this product wins on all accounts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing to know is that you must approach the hair from opposite the direction of growth.  </li>
            <li> I have bought 3 and keep them handy because for me it is a constant battle.  </li>
            <li> This is an effective way to remove upper lip hair without the expense or pain of waxing and threading.</li>
            <li> It will be the best $17.00 you have ever spent on a facial hair remover product!!</li>
            <li> It is not thinning, but hey its nice to know that its not as noticeable when it does grow back</li>
            <li> It is totally worth every penny....</li>
            <li> It still hurts under the nose and probably always will but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I think for that, the pain was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I assume as I use it more frequently, the pain will decrease.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t give it enough stars.  </li>
            <li> Either way, the pain is worth getting the ROOT out.  </li>
            <li> Ripped out the soft hair on my top lip with no problem, also some hairs on my neck that I could never get to with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth buying since you save lots of money on threading or waxing.</li>
            <li> I have gotten much better results when placing my fingers directly on the spring, and just rolling it upwards on my face.</li>
            <li> For that alone, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money, I have got my monies worth and them some.</li>
            <li> I am convinced I have the worlds most sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and found it really useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> but soo worth it</li>
            <li> This product, so far, does not stand out from many others tried.  </li>
            <li> and SO WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> Success.  </li>
            <li> It is not as effective as waxing, but it works well enough that I am bothering to write this review.</li>
            <li> I would say worth the pain.</li>
            <li> It may take some time to get used to it, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this at all useful.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> The first time I twirled this spring around on my face, it&#x27;s true...</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve talked with friends who use it (and love it) and as far as I can tell I&#x27;m using the correct technique</li>
            <li> but its worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> One of the many products I&#x27;ve tried, this one by far is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I rarely give any product just one star.  </li>
            <li> Who would have thought that a spring could be so useful.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and not cleared all of the hairs yet from my upper lip, but with more practice I&#x27;m sure I will do a better job.</li>
            <li> and I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> the prize was alright its worth it</li>
            <li> I twist and turn and turn and twist and rarely can I get it to do what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> But&#x27;s it bearable and worth it...</li>
            <li> But, well worth it.</li>
            <li> It takes both hands to use, so it wouldn&#x27;t be useful for underarm hair.</li>
            <li> It seems kind of fragile to me...</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Even if you do, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> It does take some getting use to (the motions necessary for it to be effective)</li>
            <li> It can hurt but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I recently had my face threaded not for the first time but after a long time, and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> Since it didn&#x27;t, it wasn&#x27;t worth the time or pain to me.</li>
            <li> This is a cool appliance - I like it because you don&#x27;t have to use hot wax and risk damaging your skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not pain free like most reviews stated</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> after reading all the reviews decided it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;overall , for the price maybe worth a try to see if it works for you</li>
            <li> But most of all, IT WORKS!!As far as tips for technique...</li>
            <li> It will hurt but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It will be well worth the the money.</li>
            <li> The first time will hurt, but after that it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Now i&#x27;m hair free on the lip and chin (&amp; have u ever really checked out the area right under the bottom lip?</li>
            <li> It saves me tons of time and is much easier than trying to look in the mirror and catch the right light to pluck each hair one by one.</li>
            <li> and it worked great, even on the stiff wiry hairs.  </li>
            <li> hairs at a single twist is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> so I was worried that like so many other things I have tried this product would work for most girls but not me.</li>
            <li> But it is perfect for any other facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was impressed enough when I used it by the 3rd use I was buying them and shipping directly to my 2 older sisters.</li>
            <li> It hurts much more than threading or waxing and takes significantly longer cuz you have to go over the same spot again and again.</li>
            <li> It does leave some redness, but that goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The best thing is that there is no mess, very little discomfort - and it really cleans up!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure that when you are trying to clean out the hair in the middle, you don&#x27;t stretch out the springs.</li>
            <li> but it is a very quick and easy way to get rid of those unwanted facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, got rid of most hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> the end, my face felt smooth (temporarily) but in some areas didn&#x27;t really look it (fair skin, dark hair).</li>
            <li> and now I spend about one minute before bed every other night and have been delighted.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying this really useful product!</li>
            <li> Good price too compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool to EVERYONE who wants smooth skin!</li>
            <li> It is better than the battery-operated facial epilators, because those tend to cut the hair and aren&#x27;t strong enough to pull most hair out.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect solution and now I have a little less stress in my life. :-)</li>
            <li> This brilliant spring is so easy to use and it grabs all the little hairs in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the right product for years.</li>
            <li> or right before I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and you learn, right?</li>
            <li> Right???</li>
            <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t gotten the technique quite right yet, so I&#x27;ll keep at it,</li>
            <li> Look for an online video to help show you the right way to hold and turn this.</li>
            <li> - Wash your hands if you have to touch your face, or avoid doing so right after.  </li>
            <li> Also, I washed my face with a cleanser right after using the product and had no breakouts.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the R.E.M. Spring, I used it right away.  </li>
            <li> this rips the hair right out.</li>
            <li> and I turned the side in my right hand clockwise</li>
            <li> Sister-In-Law tried it and want to order right away too.</li>
            <li> You just need to hold it correctly to use the product in a right manner.</li>
            <li> I used it right away and pulled hair out</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> I believe that is because I am not using it right.  </li>
            <li> Medicinal, right?</li>
            <li> Yeah, it hurt, but I numbed right below my nose with ice, and that helped a lot.  </li>
            <li> I had to turn the right handle clockwise</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> May be that I&#x27;m not using it right???</li>
            <li> Some people complain that it doesn&#x27;t work, but you just need to figure out the right moves.</li>
            <li> AND IT DOES HURT IF NOT DONE RIGHT.</li>
            <li> The spring grabs even the tiniest of hairs--you just might have to experiment to find the right angle to grab them.</li>
            <li> Just got the R.E.M. to day and used it right away.</li>
            <li> and I swear you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s bumped sliced bread right out of its coveted &amp;#34;Best Invention&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was not twirling it the right way and was getting nothing.  </li>
            <li> This will pull out *some* unwanted hairs, but skips right over others even after repeated attempts to remove them.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this hair removal tool out, because I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to remove those fine hairs on my upper lip without lots of irritation.</li>
            <li> I still go to the salon occasionally for brow shaping, but this is a great tool for general upkeep.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s a hundred times faster and more effective at removing the small (and almost unnoticeable) hairs.  </li>
            <li> Great not to constantly have to be paying for a depilatory, which leaves burn marks, and then the potency of the cream fades before you&#x27;ve barely gotten through the tube.  </li>
            <li> a pretty amazing simple product....</li>
            <li> Catches all the fine hairs, and after you let some of the coarse ones grow in longer, you can snag them up rather easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I have used this for quite a while now, and it by far hurts the most the first time you use it</li>
            <li> Honestly though I&#x27;m not sure how the instructions could be written better to explain it.</li>
            <li> Also I have very fair skin and many tiny red bumps appeared and lasted several days after I used the spring sprong.</li>
            <li> The valuable points are that it is very easily portable and you can work with it while you watch TV or wherever you are sitting (in private).  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out.  </li>
            <li> I kept it almost straight, and rolled it up and down, on my face and arms, and it worked great.</li>
            <li> At times, it almost felt rewarding to roll the spring up and down because I was so confident it was working.</li>
            <li> No regrets!  :-)</li>
            <li> This little tool is really handy!  </li>
            <li> yes it does sting a little but the rest just kind of didnt matter once I saw the hairs gone frm my face!</li>
            <li> The other reviewer assured me that after letting the hair grow in for about a week it would do fine, so I hid out in my house and allowed the hairs to reach a suitable length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the product and customer reviews, I was able to catch on quickly and got right to removing the hairs on my upper lip, chin, and cheek areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really only good for facial hair; doesn&#x27;t work well for anything else because the hair is not as fine</li>
            <li> It only seems to be good for fine hairs, not the thicker, coarser, terminal hairs of a beard, as a trans female friend</li>
            <li> so much I want to buy another one, because if I lose it, I won&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li> So excited to have a product that works great at removing the fine upper lip hair that I have had trouble waxing.</li>
            <li> It is safe and does not leave scars like waxing, and the more you do the less hair you will have to pull out and it will get finer.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have purchased a more cheaper one, but non the less, I am SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> With the area numbed, I don&#x27;t feel a thing and am able to quickly and thoroughly remove the hair above my lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the hair coming back quickly like buzzing it off.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast, very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Often simply rolling it at an angle along the skin will grab hairs, but you&#x27;ll learn quickly how to get the most out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I had for years stayed clean and smooth the whole time I had it and the new one appears to be holding up as well.</li>
            <li> but I put some moisturizer on and went to bed and woke up with smooth silkly, normal skin.  </li>
            <li> I still feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth with the first use</li>
            <li> The REM Spring is also great because it&#x27;s so small and portable, doesn&#x27;t use electricity, and its stainless-steel body has no disposable parts to damage the environment.</li>
            <li> but I use it for the thicker more apparent hair around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and just recently noticed much more peachy fuzz on my top lip.  </li>
            <li> I also experienced a couple small breakouts after use.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave feedback unless I&#x27;m dissatisfied but I felt compelled to tell about how great this product is.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually rush to write a review on this site, but for a product that makes me happy (threading cost me $20/visit, this thing cost about $15</li>
            <li> I have spent many a night tweezing that hair for a good 1-2 hours, globbing on morturizer to help ease the pain, and after a year of doing this nonsense, I decided to finally try out this so-called \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; hair remover...</li>
            <li> some of it dark though I am fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and my hair is naturally dark.</li>
            <li> I am really fair, with dark hair.</li>
            <li> WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin with dark hair</li>
            <li> I never have to worry about my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or missed hairs or people noticing the dark hairs and peach fuzz in good lighting</li>
            <li> hair(the long peach fuzz kind,</li>
            <li> Also, for those tight places, such as the sides of the face against the ear... I found that still bending the spring but putting one side of the spring against where you want the hair removed worked the best.</li>
            <li> I have lots of light, fine hair that keeps appearing around my upper lip, chin, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly noticeable (I didn&#x27;t think) except for in direct sunlight and at certain angles.  </li>
            <li> Better results, less pain and more consistent results with waxing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with facial hair and can&#x27;t believe how well this works and how easy it is!  </li>
            <li> but it doesnt seem to work to well on very very very fine hair thats short).</li>
            <li> Originally, I chose this product based on reviews, the price, and also that the particular one I was buying stated &amp;#34;no shipping charge.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The more hair you have to remove, the more you will feel it pull and that stings a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, it will hurt like hell at first (especially if you&#x27;re not used to tweezing), but it gets the job done WAY more efficiently and effectively than plucking individual hairs.</li>
            <li> It definitely works better on the more fine hairs that grow in a single direction.  </li>
            <li> I expect this is due to the shape of my face, since the spring seems to work better on a more convex surface and it&#x27;s easier to pooch out your lip than your neck.</li>
            <li> Smart and inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I did not know how to use it correctly at first, so I could not get any hairs up, but I kept trying until I had it right.</li>
            <li> This will save you that large sum of money you&#x27;d spend at the salon!</li>
            <li> (it feels like waxing without the goop), but overall, this is a great product for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> It comes with attachments for ripping out the hair at the root on your face, body, anywhere really, and also has a shaver if you&#x27;d rather do that on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I found this product works best if I let the hair grow a few days, so I tried it on my upper lip and yea, it works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, it&#x27;s really good for when you just want it to be over, takes less time than ripping out five or six hairs at once with tweezers.</li>
            <li> (Wax takes a while to dry, and lets be honest-</li>
            <li> This is a great product though, since you don&#x27;t get that obvious red mustache I see when women wax their lips.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, not messy like waxes and does the job on the lip and chin.</li>
            <li> This product is fast and quick.</li>
            <li> Well those few hairs seemed to be more and more often</li>
            <li> The middle area where people tend to get unibrows was an easy area to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient and quick.</li>
            <li> It is such a simple yet, great idea.  </li>
            <li> Overall - a great tool for your upper lip area.</li>
            <li> just wipe gently with warm water to cleanse and open pores.  </li>
            <li> and if you came really really close to my face you would have noticed them even as i am light skinned and the hair grows in very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that spun fast and you could just get it over with quickly</li>
            <li> I have heard that some companies falsely rate their own products and I can assure you that I am thrilled with this item.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fine and the lightest colour of hairs so waxing and laser are not an option for me due to neither being able to pick up the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing or using creams for a long time and this is by far the best facial hair remover</li>
            <li> It hurts at first, but honestly it was more of a mild irritant for me, not too bad, kind of like when you first start plucking your brows.  </li>
            <li> Learning the knack of using the Spring Sprong is pretty easy, but if you want some tips just search YouTube to see the device in action.</li>
            <li> But overall, my chin is now very smooth</li>
            <li> VERY fast,</li>
            <li> I got it very fast</li>
            <li> Results are very much like waxing, without all the hassle that comes with waxing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> there are plenty of other users who have done a great job with that so far.  </li>
            <li> The Spring is AMAZING for super sensitive skin (waxing only irritates my skin &amp; lips)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Im 50 years old and frankly between the fine hairs and the occassional &amp;#34;whisker&amp;#34; its just too involved to get them all.</li>
            <li> Now no trouble with the fine fuzzies.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to threading and much cheaper on Amazon than other websites.</li>
            <li> All facial hair can be removed easily and fast leaving my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw this little gadget with its good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It was definately a good little investment to me.</li>
            <li> I have had laser hair removal, so I must say I am a little bias, but this is actually a good tool.</li>
            <li> I have had my original REM for about a year and it still works just like new.</li>
            <li> Pretty clever!!</li>
            <li> I can tell that it won&#x27;t hurt very much after this first time if you just do maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine, very light colored hair on my upper lip and a bit on my cheeks next to my hairline.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a smooth face.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s good for the upper lip area, particularly if you don&#x27;t like the idea of having a blade or an electric shaver near your nose, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Use a warm/hot wash cloth on your face first for a couple min.</li>
            <li> It works very well, but it does hurt!  </li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;m better off with a standard tweezer.</li>
            <li> It yanks the hairs out nicely, hurts like a sonuvagun for few seconds, but then I&#x27;m left with nice hairless skin.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with a lot of peachy facial hair and wanted to be able to remove it without using chemicals.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It really does hurt!</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking myself to the waxers to remove irksome facial hair for more than a decade now, but I&#x27;ll never go again.</li>
            <li> This device works remarkably well to remove even tiny hairs on the chin, cheek and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> (I love this thing, but not enough to create a demonstration video!</li>
            <li> so glad I took a risk and gave it a try, it is now the only thing I use.</li>
            <li> At first I was scared to use this because I heard it hurts a lot at first.</li>
            <li> It works very well too!</li>
            <li> hair removal itself isn&#x27;t particularly consistent, but if you stick with it you will get results.</li>
            <li> I washed my face before I used it, too, since I knew it would be my first use</li>
            <li> And, this is all accomplished without ANY irritation, redness, or breakouts whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Luckily I have decent eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about those (there is a warning in the package not to use this on the eye area).</li>
            <li> When I followed the directions perfectly, the R.E.M Spring Sprong failed to remove any of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty \\&quot;ouchy\\&quot; on my upper lip, but it does such a good job that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you tweeze, wax or use a shaving facial groomer, this is way better.</li>
            <li> it hurt like hell at first.</li>
            <li> This REM spring yanks them out pretty well.</li>
            <li> There is some pain at first</li>
            <li> I think this could just be my skin type, but be aware that it could happen to you.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re going to be able to pick up teeny tiny stubble</li>
            <li> Extremely fast service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to get this to remove thinner hairs, but I haven&#x27;t been able to grab the thicker hairs, so it hasn&#x27;t replaced regular visits to a threading salon for me.</li>
            <li> Now I must warn it hurts, alot the first time.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have read the reviews before trying to use this - it definitely takes some getting used to</li>
            <li> First of all this is a hair remover</li>
            <li> I recommend watching youtube videos first to get the hang of using it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t visualizing it correctly when I tried it the first time</li>
            <li> ;  The second attempt was much better.  </li>
            <li> I was okay with it overall.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today and went straight to the bathroom to use it!</li>
            <li> I think every Woman who wants to remove hair should use it!</li>
            <li> I have alot more hair even though mostly blonde on my face</li>
            <li> and I did love the results, plus my hair takes about 3 weeks to grow back.</li>
            <li> and eventually I had a smooth, soft, and hairless neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it hurts mostly around the upper lip....</li>
            <li> Seriously, we&#x27;re pretty hairy.  </li>
            <li> WHEN I USE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stings a bit when you first use it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because it does work if you practice with it, which only took me like 5 seconds to figure out because I found helpful reviews here.  </li>
            <li> When I went to use it for the first time today, I didn&#x27;t even read the instructions.</li>
            <li> quickly began pulling out the tiny fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> - It may not be as fast, but it&#x27;s far more gentle on the skin vs. waxing.</li>
            <li> - Make sure to exfoliate your skin one to two times a week, especially around the time you use this.</li>
            <li> Think of how much money you save over time!  </li>
            <li> Also, I would only wax areas that made sense with a strip, for many reasons, including cost.  </li>
            <li> It worked from me and now I have a higher self esteem</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not insecure anymore.</li>
            <li> The Spring was turned into a U for most of the time in use, and the ends were twirled in one direction or another or the same while I experimented</li>
            <li> After researching facial hair removal, I took a chance on this and love it.  </li>
            <li> It stings the first time you try it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know any better because the women in my family didn&#x27;t talk openly about being hairy</li>
            <li> in more recent years.      </li>
            <li> I just used the spring sprong for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to waxing or tweezing, so the first time it hurt, but it beat taking the time to go to get it waxed or working with the wax..</li>
            <li> First time I was done in about 20 minutes, and my face is the smoothest it&#x27;s been in 15 years.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The price will make up for waxing after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Hello, I want to say first off that I have hair all over my face (lip, chin, cheeks, lots on my forehead, neck)</li>
            <li> But just the first time, ladies.</li>
            <li> but when it comes to the coarse post menopausal chin hairs, a razor does better.  </li>
            <li> washed my face first and then tried this out, hesitantly.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, however, that it works pretty well</li>
            <li> The first couple of times you use it prepare for some watery eyes.  </li>
            <li> I used it last night while watching a movie without a mirror or even a light on!</li>
            <li> It took me only about 5 minutes to figure out how to use it according to the directions, and I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will go faster next time.</li>
            <li> I was actually searching for the type of thread they use in threading techniques because I love the results of threading and wanted to do it myself at home for convenience...</li>
            <li> and you get the hang of it after the first time (or about 10 minutes of playing with it).</li>
            <li> (which people are bound to do the first time they try something).</li>
            <li> pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She claims that after her first pregnancy, her hormones transformed her into a year-round werewolf.  </li>
            <li> Upon its arrival she raced to the bathroom and spent 30 minutes learning how to use it effectively.  </li>
            <li> Not too many but enough!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also advise moving in different directions on your skin to make sure you pull the hair from the angle that it is growing from.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this using the others reviewers suggestion of clockwise and counterclockwise</li>
            <li> First thing is first.</li>
            <li> But the first time I used it, I just started yelling passwords to my bank accounts because I thought someone was torturing me for information.</li>
            <li> I suspect it hurts more when you first start using it, but after multiple uses, I&#x27;m thinking it will hurt</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I had to figure this out for myself, whereas the company could have done a better job of explaining how to use it.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s SO FAST!  </li>
            <li> My cousin told me about the REM hair remover and purchased it as a gift for me, and I used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> im sooo glad I found this product and will definitely be telling my friends and sisters about this product.  </li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> It sat in my make-up kit for the last year,but after so many instances of burning my skin with all types of depilatory creams, I decided to give the R.E.M. spring another try.</li>
            <li> The spring REALLY works!</li>
            <li> You just have to practice to see what works for you, don&#x27;t give up if at first you don&#x27;t succeed.</li>
            <li> i used it on my upper lip/chin and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> But overall I think it is ok.</li>
            <li> I use it only for my upper lip facial hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> you can prepare yourself but it still won&#x27;t help the first time.</li>
            <li> The first time is the hardest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved so much time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> It is fabulous, by far</li>
            <li> my favorite method of facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Similar to tweezing, but faster and easier, and it gets a lot more than I can.</li>
            <li> so much easier!</li>
            <li> And for what it does, I do not think it is worth that much.</li>
            <li> That and, how could something so simple be able to rip the hair</li>
            <li> I find myself constantly plucking, waxing shaving and never feel okay about results and do not want to go to the pros or cant afford to ..</li>
            <li> Okay for occassional use, not recommended for regular use.</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts at first,</li>
            <li> I have tried many different methods from tweezers, shavers, wax etc.  </li>
            <li> I used it when I first purchased Itami thought it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I happened to look in my makeup bag and found the REM spring and used it and fell back in love.</li>
            <li> When you begin in more detail you can place the spring in multiple directions (not all of the hair &amp;#34;lays&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It pull out most of your facial hair easilly, and not hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> My colleague recommended me this product and I love using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> You will need some practice of holding it correctly when you will first start to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer this to waxing and it does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t work for me, until I read the instructions.</li>
            <li> Natural, reusable, economical, not messy, side effect free!  </li>
            <li> It seems to be able to pull the hair quite a bit, but some of the upper lip tends to look like you shaved...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t happen with my first couple uses</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I thought it was another scam.</li>
            <li> I go over an area multiple times until I can&#x27;t feel it pulling any more hair</li>
            <li> Really, it is not difficult at all.</li>
            <li> *blush*)</li>
            <li> My first time using it was today.</li>
            <li> ... waxing is really expensive to do consistently, but always gives me the best results.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to all my friends and will continue to send the link to anyone who is interested in a safe way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> The first day wowza</li>
            <li> I love this and use it several times a week to keep the wee hairs away!  </li>
            <li> but after that it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It amazed me how simple it removed so many hairs at one go.</li>
            <li> it works really well!</li>
            <li> in my experience, this product mostly picks up the near-invisible peach fuzz but barely picks up the darker, noticeable hairs that you really want</li>
            <li> It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt much more than plucking your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Today is the first time I have used it</li>
            <li> When holding the spring in a U-shape make sure both hands are place in the same manner (like holding a book), and then roll the ends of the spring towards your palms and then away.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that this one does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> But again, Becky is really really funny -</li>
            <li> I bought the REM Facial Hair Remover, and it took me awhile to get use to it, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this should go without saying, but I was curious to see if it would work on leg hair, so I tried a spot on my calf.  </li>
            <li> Guess what it really works!  </li>
            <li> It really pulls the hairs out!  </li>
            <li> suspect many users&#x27; difficulty lies in following the official directions too closely.  </li>
            <li> However,at first when you use it you will notice that it really \\&quot;smarts\\&quot; when the spring grabs a hair!</li>
            <li> So I was about to spend what I saw as waaaay too much money on the No!</li>
            <li> , so I first purchased the R.E.M Spring.  </li>
            <li> The first day I received it...</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know why I struggled in the first place!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pain only lasts like when you tweeze but pulls out more than one hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> you have to get the hang of it first</li>
            <li> that I love it and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> but after reading the reviews, I wasn&#x27;t feeling confident enough to order it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were many similar products</li>
            <li> still want to try and keep a groomed appearance and what girl doesn&#x27;t want to feel pretty?</li>
            <li> It pays itself off since it costs as much as a salon waxing!</li>
            <li> (got one the first time</li>
            <li> Tweezers definitely work better for me.</li>
            <li> This thing is so weird, but it is the best!!</li>
            <li> I first thought this isn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d mention is that I find it works better if you just twist both ends and roll over area that you want to move hair.  </li>
            <li> Tried to go with the knock off at first....</li>
            <li> This is better than shaving, so I use this and the tweezers now, totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you do have to go over areas more than once</li>
            <li> stung the first time I used it --</li>
            <li> It paid for itself with the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like others who have reviewed this product, I would recommend you first use it on your chin where you might not be as sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought one for a friend and another friend I told I told also bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tool, a real money saver!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it</li>
            <li> Definitely a must if you&#x27;re menopausal :-)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I missed a lot of hairs, but every time after that I got everything.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I am going to save so much money!</li>
            <li> This is still a 5 star product in my book since it clears my upper lip and chin better than anything</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will hurt quite a bit the first time</li>
            <li> but it hurts too much to get to that point!</li>
            <li> Yes, the first time you use it, it hurts.</li>
            <li> I started out with a pretty hairy stash (I let it go a bit knowing this thing was coming in the mail...</li>
            <li> haha!)</li>
            <li> The first time is a</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You need to leave a wide margin near brows when using it, and I hoped the REM spring would be useful to do that area, but it just didn&#x27;t grab the hair and I tried it on all areas of my face, even on my leg, just to give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> At first I was iffy about buying this product, but decided to try it.</li>
            <li> and I tried it on many different types of hair follicles.....</li>
            <li> The REM spring does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much hair I had on my face until I received this thing!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever attempted to tweeze hair around your mouth and chin, then you know exactly what this contraption feels like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on the chin hairs, as it requires trying different positions to get those hairs if you have many and not just 1 0r 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried many things to get rid of facial hair...  </li>
            <li> Not painless but pretty close.</li>
            <li> Yes the first time hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> I fell in love and will not turn back!</li>
            <li> Removes hairs fast!</li>
            <li> , I just roll it in various directions to make sure I get all the unwanted hair out.  </li>
            <li> Fast and efficient!</li>
            <li> I would describe it as the same concept as threading but was able to do this myself at home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This does the trick - fast!</li>
            <li> I found it pretty intuitive just through trial and error.</li>
            <li> and it has really changed my life!</li>
            <li> So the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;m aware of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, another rater said she almost gave up on using it because it did not work for her at first.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair remover for the first time.</li>
            <li> Initially  I wasn&#x27;t sure about how to use it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well -</li>
            <li> It got rid of all the prominent hair on my upper lip (side note here</li>
            <li> I suggest a glass or two of wine first, and an aspirin to kill the owies.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this is that you can feel it taking the hair from the root!</li>
            <li> can take out a lot of hairs at the same time leaving your skin smooth!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to remove upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am now that I finally bought it.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I am terrified of them ever discontinuing such a fabulous item!</li>
            <li> I had to go over my face hundreds of times over the course of several days to get it all, but eventually I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> but when you first start using it...</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well--at first.</li>
            <li> This spring didn&#x27;t hurt more than waxing, but it hurts in a different way.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so soft and smooth after using this on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME HURTS</li>
            <li> Within five minutes, I got more hairs close enough for my liking with almost no pain.</li>
            <li> In short I was able to ditch the razor, but not the tweezers.</li>
            <li> It is also practical to use because I actually keep it in my car and use it while stopped at a traffic light or in the parking lot before going into work!</li>
            <li> I was willing to lose $5 if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Hang in there, it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end because it really does work</li>
            <li> You really get your money&#x27;s worth with this product.</li>
            <li> First time I used it it took about an hour...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure this will be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> For it to work follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> So much better than shaving or waxing your facial hair.</li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t wash you face with soap before....</li>
            <li> I have gotten the more dang facial hair I have gotten.</li>
            <li> As for the pain I won&#x27;t lie the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Read the instructions for use by the first &amp;#34;most helpful&amp;#34; reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I have light and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li> Warning: The first time will make your eyes water if you have a lot of hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most convenient way of removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the R.E.M. spring after reading many reviews on just about every facial hair removal spring.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere on my face, because I&#x27;m pretty hairy.</li>
            <li> This is quicker than tweezers, but also pulling out multiple hairs makes the pain more tolerable.</li>
            <li> so i tried it again when my face was getting better and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> after I wash my face at night (to remove any bacteria off my face first).</li>
            <li> At first, it&#x27;s kinda tricky to use but you will learn how to use it after a while.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use any chemicals to remove unwanted facial hair!</li>
            <li> Glad something so simple like this exist.</li>
            <li> Within minutes I was able to watch tv and use at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for facial hair:  bleaching, depilatory cream, shaving, wax.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty embarrassing and took about a year to get it to lighten with prescription cream.  </li>
            <li> A good set of tweezers is more effective and time-saving -- which makes this product pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> Its quick &amp; easy, mess free.</li>
            <li> I had pretty good success on my chin/jawline area, but that was the somewhat  less fantastic of the three areas (upper lip, cheeks, and chin).</li>
            <li> The spring really does work, even if your facial hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> and rolling it briskly back and forth worked perfectly to pull out every last little fine hair that often escapes my imperfect attempt at waxing...</li>
            <li> No more waxing, this is a great and easy way to get rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li> and  really soft skin (thanks to my mom!!!)</li>
            <li> But, due to the abundantly high number of good  reviews I decided to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> As someone that is growing older (aren&#x27;t we all....) and sprouting more and more little hairs in places where they don&#x27;t belong</li>
            <li> Waxing isn&#x27;t always effective for me, and shaving feels like a waste of time since my hair grows quickly.</li>
            <li> I guess my sking is way more sensitive than many of the other posters.</li>
            <li> I will try to give an update as to how often I have to use this product to maintain my face as it is now-not completely hairless, there are VERY short fine hairs remaining, you know like most normal people!  </li>
            <li> It is not painless BUT it is not painful either a little above the lip but the res of the face is great.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic little tool - hurts like a son-of-a-gun the first time, but gets better after that, since you&#x27;re just maintaining.  </li>
            <li> There is minimal discomfort, and a little bit of finagling in order to find the best hand position at first , but it WORKS.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of time, but you don&#x27;t really need a mirror and you can do a pretty good job while you watch TV.</li>
            <li> find that it helps to shower, or at least wash my face, in very warm water if I&#x27;m having difficulty.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s more of gentle curve than a proper U-shape, it might catch the hairs better because the space between the spring is smaller.  </li>
            <li> This product is okay if the hair you want to remove is fine and your skin is reasonably firm.</li>
            <li> While it seems to grab and pull out the natural, fine hairs of your face without issue (and really, who needs that?)</li>
            <li> Love that it gets fine, fluffy hair on cheeks and jaw line.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and works as described by other Amazon reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it is not dark hair, but light colored peach fuzz hair that coats our faces.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised and happy with this little device.</li>
            <li> So, watch the videos so that you are a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than waxing and a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grab coarse hair so well, and works pretty much only on skin that is fairly smooth/taut, so, because two hands are needed to operate it, it doesn&#x27;t work too well at all for those who would have to pull their skin taut to shave it.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I expected, and honestly did not hurt nearly as much as I had thought, based on reviews.</li>
            <li> I almost gave up and thought about tossing it, but then I decided to experiment since there were other people who liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive though too, and I know that, so I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t more irritated for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive though too, and I know that, so I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t more irritated for longer.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to lay it flat on the face and then twist.  </li>
            <li> I find that when laid completely flat, it removes hair much better than when bent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many of these products prey on those of us who are willing to try just about anything if we believe it will really work, especially for a problem we find embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product only a month ago (it seems like so much longer because I have grown to love and rely on it so much!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and of a simple concept, is fast and effective at hair removal, AND extremely cost effective in the long run.</li>
            <li> If you can stretch your skin to a very tight point and hold it there, this product might be good for you.</li>
            <li> Its not really visible unless in direct bright sunlight.</li>
            <li> After removing the hair, I lightly rinse out the upper lip with warm water and pat it dry.</li>
            <li> but it really does get better even after the second use.</li>
            <li> - Make sure you try it from different angles, and try to turn the device into an upright U-shape if some hairs aren&#x27;t being plucked up, or even somewhat straight.</li>
            <li> Especially when you get to that nice soft skin under your chin.</li>
            <li> Much safer than sugar wax on the face - which can sometimes pull off the top layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still hurts like heck, after several months of use.</li>
            <li> Essentially i spun the spring between my thumb and pointer finger as though I was snapping those two fingers (but more gently) and had no issues with figuring it out.</li>
            <li> more U shaped and hold it with my fingers twisting actually on the spring real close to the U.</li>
            <li> The REM Spring Facial Hair Remover makes it much easier to take care of more area at once.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t use it much as it hurts way more than tweezer plucking or facial threading.</li>
            <li> note that this is good for facial hair only.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this little tool.  </li>
            <li> My face is completely smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and NO pink spots!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I am very pleased with this little device.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and had absolutely no problem using this product right away!!!</li>
            <li> This little gadget is the best facial hair removal method that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I found it really easy to use on my upper lip, got it on my first try.</li>
            <li> I will never trust positive Amazon reviews again.  </li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews on this product, and decided to give it a try as it was inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister, mom and cousins have had positive experiences with this tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little tool is easy to use, easy to keep with you in your makeup kit</li>
            <li> No more worries about bright sunshine, close-up encounters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the spring for about a month or so now, and wanted to set the record straight since my first review.</li>
            <li> As some of them have mentioned, it takes a little bit to figure out how to best use it, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a little different for everyone.  </li>
            <li> First, let&#x27;s be real.  </li>
            <li> This is actually pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> I decided  to do my normal 1 by 1 tweeze job on as many of the really coarse hairs first</li>
            <li> hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting married in 6 weeks and have been absolutely dreading the upclose outdoor pictures-our venue is a community park and getting pictures at dusk will be unavoidable.  </li>
            <li> Any time I wax, I&#x27;m pretty much guaranteed that within a day or two, I have a handful of pimples in the waxed areas.</li>
            <li> I am just a real hairy person which is pretty embarrassing considering the fact that I am a woman.</li>
            <li> Before long I had built up what looked more like a Q-tip bulb shape on each end.</li>
            <li> The whole point of epliators is to prevent the noticeable stubble in the first place.</li>
            <li> After the first couple times it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> (I really think the hot towel helped).</li>
            <li> I  do recommend this product.. for minor hair issues or even more</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problem figuring out how to work it: it even works great just rolling it flat</li>
            <li> Strange to say that it does make me feel better about subjecting myself to pain when I watch someone else cringe in pain.  </li>
            <li> Bend it into a U shape and simultaneously twist it using the ends, it gets pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful (kind of like tweezing a bunch of hairs at a time on your lip) but the final result is perfect!  </li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and figured the only thing I had to lose was the joy of sitting around with a Santa Claus beard of hair remover.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these one for my friend and one for me, she saw them on tv at first it was her who asked me to order it for her, i didnt want it, but after thining about my peach fuzz (even though i dont have much)</li>
            <li> That works okay, but not nearly as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much, plan to send to family and close friends as gifts, but only those who won&#x27;t be offended by receiving a hair removal product that really works well.</li>
            <li> I experienced a little break out on my chin where I hadn&#x27;t ever removed hairs, but my upper tougher lip was better overall for the wear!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has done well removing fine hairs from the upper lip and slowed their regrowth there, BUT unfortunately not so well on chin hairs.</li>
            <li> but once you get it down, it is effective.</li>
            <li> This causes the spring to move up and down catching the hair.</li>
            <li> (Vellus hairs being the light, fine hairs like peach fuzz while the terminal/androgenic hairs are the coarser dark ones.)</li>
            <li> While branching out like this is an ingenious way to avoid leaving the house (getting prescription refills for your hypertension and high cholesterol is such a pain on tour!</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair, and I&#x27;m super paranoid about the peach fuzz on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I am sooo glad I gave this product a try, and I plan to continue to use it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> This could be my experience because I don&#x27;t let those more noticeable hairs get very long</li>
            <li> Also, for those who complain about in-grown hairs and red bumps - clean your skin before using and use an astringent right after.  </li>
            <li> This is a fun-to-use tool for removing facial hair and it&#x27;s soooo easy.  </li>
            <li> it is easy to use, and it actually works...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, no fuss and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and I can even take it on the road quite easily and use as necessary...</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quick I caught on to it.</li>
            <li> Hair grows back after a week for me, but my hair growth is very quick anyway.</li>
            <li> Removes hair easily from cheeks, chin, and upper lip area.</li>
            <li> I like this thing- simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant so my skin is ultra sensitive</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something easy then search not further.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m part Italian, but instead of having skin that tans easily in the summer, I was blessed with hair...</li>
            <li> It looks easy enough but no hair comes off for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take all that long and my whole face feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li> I can easily &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; them off multiple at the time rather than sit and pluck each one.</li>
            <li> It stings a bit first use but my upper lip is free of hair.</li>
            <li> it was very simple and easy to remove hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an odd kind of acne and looks to me like an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> The R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover is easy to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li> This was really effective for the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> But now when I would grow the hair out and go get it waxed the wax wasnt strong enough to pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> i think that it works best on medium to thick hair or long</li>
            <li> I am sure that the band members love the product (when you get old, hair comes out of your nose, ears and other unexpected holes)</li>
            <li> What I love is that is gets every single hair, even ones you don&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call this a painless procedure</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d take the word &#x27;painless&#x27; out of their advertising though, because it certainly isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> from 100% Pure, or Avalon Organics&#x27; lemon hand &amp; body lotion.  </li>
            <li> We got this for my mom, who was ready to spend quite a bit on a home laser hair removal system but we saw this and the positive reviews and for the price, thought what the heck?</li>
            <li> and I have to buy a new one!!</li>
            <li> I live in Los Angeles and it can get pretty hot here...</li>
            <li> Life is not perfect but we live with it best</li>
            <li> the instructions are so small that i had to use my own intuition to get it work right.</li>
            <li> For me, it was actually less irritating to my skin than threading, which was great... and ironic since it hurts more!</li>
            <li> Everyone talked about how much it hurt, but honestly, I think it hurts much less than waxing.  </li>
            <li> Such a fast and easy solution.  </li>
            <li> Removing facial hair is easy and fast for me now..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will have to remember to put my hair all up as it will easily grab a stray long hair ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The pain would be worth it if it was quick but going over a spot several times is just not tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s just like a minature slinky with handles, and probably costs $0.01 to manufacture, but compared to the cost of other hair removal systems and the sheer ingenuity and speed of the product, it&#x27;s worth the $13.00 any day!!</li>
            <li> It works as quickly as you can move your fingers, no mess, no smell, no skin rashes.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use by following the simple instructions and now my face and chin are smooth and hairless.  </li>
            <li> This tool is not for fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely works on any hair - even fine hair, but hurts like woe.</li>
            <li> Make sure you dry your Spring thoroughly if you do this!  </li>
            <li> [...] bucks for one time, that you can use without a mirror, sitting in front of the TV, and within a half hour or so be nice and smooth, with no irritated and red skin.</li>
            <li> the hair that does grow back grows back lighter which is even better!</li>
            <li> I use it to remove facial hair and it works really fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine, blonde hair</li>
            <li> Does not work on fine white hairs</li>
            <li> I did get this product to remove all the fine hairs on my upper lip but it took quite a while and a lot of twisting and bending the spring at all angles.</li>
            <li> I get fine fuzz on  my upper lip that I have been either bleaching or waxing since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I have fine blond peach fuzz on my upper lip and jawline</li>
            <li> Been looking for something that works well for fine facial hairs.</li>
            <li> My friend and I have decided we&#x27;re going to do each other next time, after a nice glass of wine!  </li>
            <li> It works fine if you have an hour to spend just getting the hairs on your upper lip!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also misses hairs, both fine and coarse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-very fast to remove large amount of hair as opposed to tweezing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, since I had a large area to remove hair from, my skin was very irritated by the time I was through.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little product...</li>
            <li> This little thing is so effective.</li>
            <li> But after that first initial hair removal, use every other day and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I thought it would be a little easier than threading my own face</li>
            <li> My first step to a clean upper lip was to try an at home waxing strip.</li>
            <li> It only really works on the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> It works really well on fine, &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; facial hair -- chin, lip, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I have a pretty high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> We are not quite out of the throws of the recession and unemployment rates are still high, the cost of things is higher still.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not buying a No No! as it has not gotten very good reviews, and is expensive - so the REM will have to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget for removing hair on the upper lip, lower lip, and chin area.</li>
            <li> The upper lip was quite easy; the corners of the mouth, not near as easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of threading but the problem is, threading is tough to do on your own.</li>
            <li> I like the tool but the little handles would be far more comfortable if they were rubber covered.  </li>
            <li> I thread well enough for my own purposes, but it hurts a little more than going to a professional lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came before expected, in perfect condition and would recommend to others who need to do a tough up more than once a week on facial hair.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit, flat out HURTS on the upper lip, but if you continue through the pain it gets better fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got my R.E.M. Spring in the mail yesterday and WOW my face today is complete free of hair (except, of course, my eye brows and lashes).</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well (especially for the price) on facial hair</li>
            <li> This is great for those light, barely noticeable hairs on the upper lip and sides of the face,but if you have the coarser, darker hair on the chin and neck, it will have to grow to a noticeable stubble before it is long enough for the spring to catch.</li>
            <li> For the hairs that is still visible and left on my face after using the REM, I just grab my tweezers and do a quick clean up, so that my face can be completely smooth and clear of unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> R.E.M., while successfully removing my dark facial hair, would not grasp the white hairs (which are coming in more frequently as I age).  </li>
            <li> This works really, really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this device, however, the description of how to use it is way off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m discontinuing use of the spring as the primary way for hair removal and going back to waxing.</li>
            <li> so I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned brunette who comes from a very hairy family.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I found that this didn&#x27;t really work that well.  </li>
            <li> and it really does the job in seconds.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soooo much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Now, I do have fast regrowth</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it tends to grab the longer, coarser hairs, aka the hair you really want to be gone, and doesn&#x27;t do a \\&quot;clearcut\\&quot; like shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> Thanks god I accidently saw this when i was looking for an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, once you figure it out and get over the \\&quot;first-use\\&quot; pain, it really seems to do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It REALLY does the job.  </li>
            <li> you use it but as much as it hurts I do not think I will use it too often</li>
            <li> have preferred threading to waxing for its gentle, non-chemical approach.  </li>
            <li> This product was much easier for me to use than waxing.</li>
            <li> I did put some oil free moisturizer on my upper lip after to prevent any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This spring works very well</li>
            <li> This product does in 5 minutes what I could never have accomplished with hours of plucking.</li>
            <li> High five to that person!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for giving me a smooth hairless upper lip, chin, and sideburns.</li>
            <li> Now she wants me to get rid of my butt hair...  </li>
            <li> Shoot, it&#x27;s cheap enough...</li>
            <li> This tool makes the plucking a much faster process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (so hopefully i won&#x27;t get the acne others were complaining about- thanks for the tip guys) and put this baby to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will stick to waxing, thanks.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> this is much like threading but way easier.</li>
            <li> I had very course hair,</li>
            <li> Thanks for listening to MY story.</li>
            <li> only downside I can name is that it&#x27;s not as precise as threading.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t really bother explaining how to use it...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ever realize how much hair I had on my face until this--</li>
            <li> The pain is minimal in most areas  3.</li>
            <li> I found that it was much easier to learn how to use it by watching videos than the instructions provided in the box when you purchase the spring.  </li>
            <li> I just twist it while it is straight - like</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much time in my day.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working very well.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think there was much of a learning curve with this thing at all.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really think twice about how to use</li>
            <li> My wife really feels that it is a time saver, because she doesn&#x27;t have to painstakingly take one hair out at a time with tweezers.</li>
            <li> This works very well</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as plucking because it pulls the hair out fast by the root</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> It was also much gentler on my face than my electric epilator that I use for my body.  </li>
            <li> I use a scrub, sonic brush or enzyme peel (mostly a gentle peel), depending on my mood/circumstances.</li>
            <li> No pain or bumps and the same smooth results.</li>
            <li> This was interfering with my whole life.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really hairy just try what I did and you won&#x27;t regret it.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s too much surface area.</li>
            <li> I tried covering it up with make, like that really helps -_-.</li>
            <li> I cant remember when the last time my face looked &amp; feeled so smooth.</li>
            <li> that I can&#x27;t see very well to tweeze.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and leaves my face really smooth.</li>
            <li> For most people i&#x27;m sure it will last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Could have saved so much money on waxing at the salons.</li>
            <li> so much I want to tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li> The one downside is that you can really feel it.</li>
            <li> But it has made me very self-conscious for years.  </li>
            <li> and it really hurt.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think about it too much.</li>
            <li> I didnt have to curve it so much .</li>
            <li> In some areas it was almost straight.</li>
            <li> This is soooo much easier and faster than tweezing.</li>
            <li> , long-term product made of stainless steel&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this thing.</li>
            <li> This is so fast.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I use this around my face while watching a movie or something, and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a real hair \\&quot;problem\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Not too much.</li>
            <li> This removed all the hair and was much faster than plucking.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to find something to make removing unwanted chin hairs faster and easier.</li>
            <li> and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it is only as precise as it&#x27;s width (about the circumference of a pencil).</li>
            <li> I came across this product by accident and it intrigued me so much that I just HAD to buy it.</li>
            <li> I spent more time trying to figure out how to grab the hair than anything else.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 10th or 12th session, and it really doesn&#x27;t bother me much at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no worse than when you pluck an eyebrow hair out.  </li>
            <li> This tool really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no wuss, but I was ready to throw this thing and hide under the covers.  </li>
            <li> This product really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It is very simple to use and my chin was baby smooth after just one use.</li>
            <li> though not as much as when I pluck, go figure.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I was ready to toss the thing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and hair-free, even after only one use!  </li>
            <li> is very paimfull product  </li>
            <li> it goes much easier.</li>
            <li> However it will probably vary from person to person as to how much pain you</li>
            <li> I works really well for chin and lip hair, but aside from that I don&#x27;t see it working for anything else.  </li>
            <li> However, this spring doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the hair from the sides of my face very well.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest washing your face after using, because my face broke out with acne which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> It really really hurts though.</li>
            <li> It takes some figuring out, but with practice it works very well.</li>
            <li> but the YouTube videos were very helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I think the price is well worth it and far cheaper and convenient</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m entering my opinion because I really do know this product works.</li>
            <li> ANYTHING that yanks hair straight out of the follicle is gonna hurt</li>
            <li> for the darker hairs, they are stronger and I think they were pulled out at the root because I cannot see themat all -- no broken off ones at all.  </li>
            <li> can use this when I get out of the shower, and by the time I am ready for makeup, there is nothing to hide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin has started to feel baby smooth but not entirely yet..</li>
            <li> my jaw area neck and chin do not hurt that much</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as tweezing or waxing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I never realized how much hair I had on the side of my face  and cheeks.</li>
            <li> This tool removes the whole hair and roots.</li>
            <li> thanks, Val</li>
            <li> /&gt;Years ago, I had an electric epilady that was much like this spring</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do really like this spring thing.</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;d be amazed at how much hair it</li>
            <li> But it works really well.</li>
            <li> I think there was one cheaper option on Amazon, but I bought this one because it is stainless steel instead of some mystery metal.</li>
            <li> so  it really takes time and fortitude to  do it..</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very portable.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have quite a lot of them and it&#x27;s really embarrassing.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to pluck one by one, so I was really hopeful when I saw this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wow...it really hurts.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it because it really does work.</li>
            <li> because it got a lot more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Feels like \\&quot;threading\\&quot; but much gentler.  </li>
            <li> a week-- Pulls off hair gently-- follow directions and twist as indicated.  </li>
            <li> should mention too that I have very sensitive/fair skin-</li>
            <li> I tried an epilator before that was designed for the face, but I found that it just broke off the hairs at the skin and didn&#x27;t really pull them out.  </li>
            <li> I tried an epilator before that was designed for the face, but I found that it just broke off the hairs at the skin and didn&#x27;t really pull them out.  </li>
            <li> works incredibly well without damaging skin, even in difficult areas.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very hairy on my face.  </li>
            <li> And thanks.  </li>
            <li> And if you want to see it in action, and laugh your head off, you have GOT to look at the video review by Becky (beckygardens).  </li>
            <li> This product REALLY hurts.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what it was designed for and it does it VERY</li>
            <li> It works really well, but it’s not for weenies.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> , I have never had a smooth upper lip before I tried this product.</li>
            <li> was very painful,cannot use it</li>
            <li> However, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> My upper lip is hair free</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very tiring to use.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to control the amount of pressure you place on the spring, and the direction you want it to go in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheaper than my cheap facial wax person (though she is a pleasure to see.)</li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Really, you have GOT to try this.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it really does work.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt me as much as she indicated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> or you have to be really, really, really patient.......</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and there is no telltale sign that I have recently removed any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not so straight areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So really don&#x27;t try that.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much faster than using chemical infused creams and waxing.  </li>
            <li> The spring works very well, yes</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> they are MUCH cheaper and just as well reviewed.</li>
            <li> By the way, I don&#x27;t think it really hurts.</li>
            <li> Light colored facial hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> : The shipping was EXTREMELY  fast</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Plus it is made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I tried to use a battery operated elpilator, and it really didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Really am going to like this.</li>
            <li> Get ready to save a ton of time and money from not having to wax anymore.</li>
            <li> Very well made product.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> and then I smeared my face with an antibiotic lotion and let it be that way the whole day.</li>
            <li> I do it in patches and stop when the pain is a bit too much to bear.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt much.  </li>
            <li> weeks before ordering the R.E.M. Spring but using the two products together seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why everyone loves it so much.</li>
            <li> hahaha.  </li>
            <li> aside, I don&#x27;t see how anyone could argue against the fact that the thing really works.</li>
            <li> and you really have to work it to pull it out.</li>
            <li> Works really well at removing hair from the roots.  </li>
            <li> Any tips on how to not make it hurt as much??</li>
            <li> people have reasonable directions on use, and suggest reading those.  </li>
            <li> It is neat and very efficient</li>
            <li> This shows nothing and is so fast.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it on my lips, it hurts way too much.</li>
            <li> Much quicker than plucking and lasts longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> and he confirmed that the twisting motion torks (muscles moving in opposite directions)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that much to me</li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;m really used to the threading.</li>
            <li> I have light hair that you can only see up close, but I still prefer to get rid of it so that makeup goes on easier</li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that this is made of stainless steel</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> She really is a delight and shows you how to use this tool.</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes my upper lips was hair free - 3 of those minutes were trying to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> and it really hurts.  </li>
            <li> Since the R.E.M. covers a wide area, I figured it would capture many in one swoop.  </li>
            <li> Also with frequency there is ltitle to no pain because there isn&#x27;t as much hair there.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> If you give this product some practice it really works.  </li>
            <li> Very  embarrassing tho</li>
            <li> What I like about it is the control that you have, especially in sensitive area.</li>
            <li> and once you get the hang of it you can do it so fast and in any position-</li>
            <li> face broke out just as much using the R.E.M as it did using the epilator.  </li>
            <li> But it does work and keeps the hair off much longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I twist the ends, no hair is removed from either my lip or chin.  </li>
            <li> It does really work well</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> but I really do think it depends on the area where you are trying to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I can say that much..</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try the No No, but after reading the reviews, decided to look for an alternative solution.</li>
            <li> I really did, but it was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really does the job.</li>
            <li> And, this is all accomplished without ANY irritation,...</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my face really well and use a toner before using the spring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out nearly as much.</li>
            <li> I have never felt such smooth skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> The whole inverted U thing?</li>
            <li> This was at a straight line rather than a U, and I can try places that are supposedly off limits like the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this would work, but boy it does.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much on this item, bought it for my sister...</li>
            <li> I use it daily (just to keep completely smooth).  </li>
            <li> No worse pain than plucking.</li>
            <li> Why is something that hurts us so much so addicting?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t belive how much hair is on my face that I can&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use, you can use it while watching TV.</li>
            <li> Thanks God for YouTube.</li>
            <li> the first time I used this product it took some practice and second, it took some getting used to the pinching of hair pulling (not like waxing), especially the first time when you have the most dense amount of hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> Then on a cotton ball, gently apply some astringent or clarifier to close pores (will sting a bit).  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this product.  </li>
            <li> This tool is much beter than the alternative waxing or plucking one by one.  </li>
            <li> You really can just use it while watching t.v.</li>
            <li> this really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but when you get the hang of it, this product really works.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> hahaha...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t getting much hair, but I persevered and now I&#x27;ve got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the product but honestly, with the coarser facial hair I have</li>
            <li> Not being able to disinfect it completely you don&#x27;t want to risk the possible infection to another</li>
            <li> Not being able to disinfect it completely you don&#x27;t want to risk the possible infection to another person.     </li>
            <li> Definitely takes some getting used to the pain associated with tearing your hair out of a sensitive area, but the money saved on waxing makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The sensation is the same pain factor as tweezing and it does not work effectively as it leaves the smaller, finer hairs intact.  </li>
            <li> think the most sensitive spot, for me, was upper lip</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this product, finally a facial hair remover that actually does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> --this actually results in a more youthful and natural look than methods that remove all the hair, like waxing or shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was kind of a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> As a male, I wanted to be able to remove hair near my ear.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so the first time did hurt (like waxing or threading does), but after the first time it didn&#x27;t hurt so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as pain is concerned, I&#x27;m sure it is all relative and quite subjective.  </li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old woman going through &amp;#34;the change&amp;#34; and we all know that means more facial hair!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few minutes to learn to use it effectively ...</li>
            <li> is a simple yet very useful beauty tool.</li>
            <li> I also found it hurt less after a hot shower when my pores were more</li>
            <li> Upper lips get smooth, look clean... and are beet red from the loss of the epidermis and part of the dermis .....</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this device,the price really sold me, but I rolled it all over my face, and each time it only snatched out 1 or 2 hairs.</li>
            <li> but as I got older and approached that big milestone birthday, I wasn&#x27;t loving the fuzz staring back at me in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> As far as cleaning or getting those hairs out of the spring - I found that if I held on to both ends and quickly pulled the spring apart and snapped it back together quickly removed the hair -</li>
            <li> hair re-growth is absolutely normal with what I experienced waxing, I&#x27;ve had it about a month and used it once thoroughly and did a little retouch two weeks later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard, just takes a little practice, but then does a great job of removing all that unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I made sure to wash my face both before and after use.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt but that brief moment of pain is so worth it!  </li>
            <li> GET THIS, YOU WILL FEEL NORMAL!</li>
            <li> Personally, I find it fun!</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the other brand I have</li>
            <li> The other thing I like about this better than waxing is I do it weekly</li>
            <li> and i think i am going to be excited to see what else it does in the future!</li>
            <li> So much better than waxing or crème removers or any other thing that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> If you are familiar with threading then using this product is similar to that.</li>
            <li> I am ordering two more, one for purse and the other for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with many reviewers that this product was a little tricky to figure out at first.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of practice figuring out exactly how to hold and twist it, and different positions work better for different parts of the face.  </li>
            <li> Using the first time over the top lip I would suggest doing little sections as it does ouch.</li>
            <li> I was really excited that this was something I could use to rid my upper lip of the mass quantities of peach fuzz that exist without the use of chemicals and wax.</li>
            <li> Better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I used it The first day and loved the results, until a few hours later when my face broke out.</li>
            <li> The pain is intense for the first few uses but eventually it gets more bearable.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> And I am SO EXCITED about my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> immediately i placed an order i was really excited about these product finally today</li>
            <li> Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day and you&#x27;ll likely be more successful taking your time by spreading it out, a little every day or every other day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s plucking method better than any other hair removing or bleaching methods for my face.</li>
            <li> Suck it up the first time and you too will fall in love with this little darling.</li>
            <li> You are rubbing a metal surface on your face, it will pick up oil and dirt from other areas, so you may be more prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you twist one end counter-clockwise and the other clockwise.</li>
            <li> Threading on the other hand is more controlled.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had invented this unique tool and was banking the well-deserved money earned.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews are all correct, I was glad I read them because I was just about to spend the $200 on another product.</li>
            <li> As with many of the other reviewers, I will also say that it is not painless.  </li>
            <li> Hurts like heck when trying to get some of those stubborn facial hairs, but worth it!  </li>
            <li> Other areas I was able to continue to use it without taking a break for a breather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Threading was the best of the bunch, but it was expensive and there wasn&#x27;t any place I could get it done near where I live.</li>
            <li> Now, I will say that I am still fairly new at using this thing as I have only used it a couple of times, but i can say that,if you can get through the first session (made my eyes water), it&#x27;s not nearly as bad after that.</li>
            <li> Keep mine in the car and clean that upper lip on my morning drive in to work.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt any more, first few times it does hurt but now it does not.</li>
            <li> It got better as I progressed, as I guess the first few pulls were the longest.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt the first few times the most</li>
            <li> First, minor but true</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had my lip and eyebrows waxed or threaded, but never my chin because I was too embarrassed to let it grow long enough for an effective waxing.</li>
            <li> This thing is effective, and the results last a long time, 3 to 4 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> What a handy little thing!  </li>
            <li> You have to get a little creative with it around the curves of your chin, but other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use on the more flat surfaces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde and have a ton of very fine blonde hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is ok for hair removal on the upper lip, but I just can&#x27;t get it to work on my cheeks or chin at all, so I suppose for light touch ups on the upper lip in between waxing it works, but I can&#x27;t rely on this for my only method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, this product might work well for someone with only a few stray hairs or someone who has light facial hair that isn&#x27;t so noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the sideburn area has much thicker hair (at least for me), and it did hurt a lot the first time.  </li>
            <li> All the products worked well but this spring is quick easy and the results last a long time.</li>
            <li> I generally use it right after my shower, that way I don&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low tech, easy to use (there&#x27;s only two ways to twist it, so if one way doesn&#x27;t work, try the other way), still looks like new after the three years I&#x27;ve had it, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves only mild redness that is very temporary.  </li>
            <li> It definitely does not hurt as much as waxing does, and the pain passed quickly.  </li>
            <li> what I was amazed and delighted to feel was that half an hour later my chin was virtually hair-free.</li>
            <li> Worth paying a slightly higher price for something high quality that will no doubt last for years and years.</li>
            <li> This little gadget promptly (and easily) removes of face fuzz!</li>
            <li> It is pretty thorough in removing fine hairs, although certain areas always seem more difficult to remove hairs for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> and then otherwise it does not work to it full potential.</li>
            <li> electrologist said that because I tweezed for so many years, each facial follicle now had SEVERAL ROOTS and would take much longer to do than had</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought it and coming from a tom-boy type girl who never really buys this stuff, it is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I found that at first I had to bend the spring in a complete \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape and twist to get the hairs.  </li>
            <li> Most of it being peach fuzz while some hairs being dark and course.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only took one full day to get to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think when excessive cleaning the spring might stretch and not be as effective in pulling hair out.</li>
            <li> I like that its stainless steel so its very durable and will last a long time and durability is a very important thing to me when im spending money for something.</li>
            <li> Okay...... I really have to confess that I was one of the scoffers who really didn&#x27;t think this little gizmo would work at all, but boy am I surprised!!  </li>
            <li> I even did my upper lip and got lots of tiny fine hairs off, too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: If the fine people at Epilady decided to once again make the old style spring epilator, I&#x27;d definitely buy another</li>
            <li> Also be sure to turn the handles of the spring clockwise and counterclockwise as you move the spring in an up and down motion.</li>
            <li> Maybe, after more practice I can nail it down.</li>
            <li> Really fine hair is difficult for me (user error?) and has to be longer before the spring is effective.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks aren&#x27;t too hairy but have tiny little peach fuzz that starts fairly close to my sideburns.</li>
            <li> I am a new person!  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has tried everything and needs a new solution for hair removal!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it!</li>
            <li> and I have decided I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly easy to use, much easier than some of the other reviews led me to expect.  </li>
            <li> It works incredibly well, the reslults last much longer than expected or traditional hair removal methods, it&#x27;s small and beyond easy to use.</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;handles\\&quot; were much easier to get a grip on</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for new things that I can use to help me with this problem that is financially reasonable and decently easy/time efficient.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer have those inbetween waxing days where I feel less confident,</li>
            <li> I then watched the video for the device and it more or less is trying to sell it to you and not show you how to use it.</li>
            <li> It takes more time than waxing, but less than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> The pain is less than waxing, and more equivalent to threading or tweezing.  </li>
            <li> THE MORE U DO IT, IT HURTS LESS.</li>
            <li> It takes a sec to get the hang of it, but its easy going after that.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the less it hurts each time.</li>
            <li> I found that it worked better when you slightly bend the device while twisting both ends.</li>
            <li> The quicker I go, the less pain and more hair I take off.</li>
            <li> This works better than bending in half.  </li>
            <li> Besides, it was all over in less than 5 minutes (probably more like 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing found so many small fine hairs, as well as some larger ones that I missed.</li>
            <li> One word of advice: it is extremely easy to lose so be careful where you put it.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the less it seems to hurt.  </li>
            <li> More pain and less irritation sounds paradoxical, but that&#x27;s the case for</li>
            <li> And the fact that they grow back so quickly?</li>
            <li> You have to run over each area many times in several different directions, and even then, I wouldn&#x27;t call the job it does \\&quot;satisfactory.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and it removed my facial hair easily, quickly and didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried different things but ultimately nothing seemed to work better than the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> (I use Mrs. Meyers, but any mild grease fighting soap will do) in a container, submerge the R.E.M. Spring in it, and open and close the R.E.M. spring bungee style while it is submerged.  </li>
            <li> but I watched a quick TUTORIAL ON YOUTUBE and got it instantly.</li>
            <li> and as we&#x27;ve gotten older it seems to be getting THICKER and LONGER...  </li>
            <li> I am deeply considering buying a couple more to throw in my travel bag and to have as a back up!</li>
            <li> It does hurt initially, but the sting goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It hurt the most next to my lip and next to my nose.</li>
            <li> It worked best when going against the hair follicle, slowly and firmly moving the spring across the area.</li>
            <li> The plus side is that this is quick removal only.</li>
            <li> but it made the rest of my face seem hairier; recently I added the having my upper lip done but found I could not get there every week or so and needed to find a more convenient and cheaper solution.</li>
            <li> After just a few months, the Bellabe one started to oxidize, lose its smoothness and shine and get a kind of galvanized look to it, which also made it harder to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> however it seems as I am getting older</li>
            <li> then get a really good magnifying glass and tweeze the few that are left !  </li>
            <li> You will know when you are at a good angle because you can feel it grabbing more hair (not in a painful way, but a &amp;#34;hey</li>
            <li> but after having this my upper lip hair removes quickly and also i can do every week whenever i need.. ...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no worse than plucking and better than harsh hair removers.</li>
            <li> The angles make it more difficult to get the spring to catch so more passes were required.</li>
            <li> I could just feel it starting, so gave a fairly quick go over with the Spring Sprong.  </li>
            <li> Those never did me any good, and the motion was exhausting to repeat as much as I needed to do it.  </li>
            <li> I almost prefer waxing because its only one quick pain.</li>
            <li> the results were quick and obvious.</li>
            <li> I will never know how since my main priority was keeping them out of it, but it happened.</li>
            <li> Its relatively painless, quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> This gadget is so simple and quick.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly to remove hair around my lips.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that you can&#x27;t get the really short hairs, but it&#x27;s a lot better than tweezing.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple times twirling in different ways, and I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li> I will let you know about how quickly the hair comes back as soon as I have used it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The key is to go quickly and keep your skin taut.</li>
            <li> I went over one area dozens of times and it still didn&#x27;t get one particular</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to especially if you&#x27;ve never used one before just because of the stinging sensation, but that seemed to improve quickly.</li>
            <li> the older</li>
            <li> Tweezing was a problem because of the huge amount of hairs that needed plucking and using my Emjoi Gently gold Caress wasn&#x27;t working properly either because both methods produced major issues with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> have very fine blonde hair on my face, but it gets a tad too long for my liking.</li>
            <li> but it removes all those little fine hairs on the chin and upper lip pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The instructions is not clear on how to use it and how to clean it; it&#x27;s more or less figure it out yourself.</li>
            <li> Because I have more and more facial hair as I get older, this product might be more painful for me.  </li>
            <li> so my facial hair grows quickly and doesn&#x27;t respond to waxing like normal</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It recommends being cleaned with high pressured air.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It recommends being cleaned with high pressured air.</li>

            <li> I definitely, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Considering the alternatives, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend the R.E.M Spring over all of them.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it - don&#x27;t hesitate to order</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was highly recommended by a family member.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, it works so well.</li>
            <li> I have a few hairs on my chin that are more coarse than the others and tend to grow from different angles; it wasn&#x27;t able to remove those at all.  </li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain and this made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend not trying to remove it all at once.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for face with the exception of eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If there is a You Tube demo of it, I would highly recommend seeing how it works before you ever get discouraged about how to use it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s a must-have.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, and bought this as gifts for my girlfriends.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> rolling the spring over your lip really quickly before getting more precise, you help numb your lips and</li>
            <li> So needless to say, when I learned about this spring thing I was kind of excited.</li>
            <li> Are there other effective ways to remove facial hair?  </li>
            <li> (you know the long occassional hair that wants to surface once you are over 40 :) mostly tweezing and i used facial removal creme for some fluffy hairs before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply make a U shape and then twist your pincher fingers (making sure that your left and right are both going outward or inward at the same time).</li>
            <li> I love that I can do a little every day, so don&#x27;t have to wait for hair growth between waxings.</li>
            <li> Just know do a little at a time if does hurt,but it&#x27;s way better than waxing.</li>
            <li> so it will look a little better but</li>
            <li> A little bit more than a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Turns out there is a little more than just rolling.</li>
            <li> Yes it does hurt a little bit more, but the results are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was spending 30 minutes a day plucking the little hairs that would magically appear over night.  </li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s a tad bit painful at first (but not any more than tweezing), I quickly got used to it, and it&#x27;s so much easier and better than waxing, with no red skin or blemishes afterwards.</li>
            <li> The portion of the upper lip that had a quick sting to it was right below your nose, but it was definitely bearable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with a gorgeous head of THICK hair that runs down my back and unfortunately  a gorgeous face full of hair that goes from my unibrow (even above that I have a pretty fuzzy forehead that I took care of by doing an upside down crescent bend and rolling downward) to underneath my chin, on my neck.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on brows for some reason (probably due to the curvature of the face), but you can easily get those threaded by someone else anyway.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t hard to use and it quickly removes fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but once you get the technique down, it works great.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, yes it hurts some but not that bad.</li>
            <li> The best part is that there was no shadow on my skin or irritation as bad as I get from using chemicals.</li>
            <li> - I clean mine with anti-bacterial soap and dry it.  </li>
            <li> I considered getting an epilator, but with my sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t imagine that would go very well.</li>
            <li> clean the spring with isopropyl alcohol (and quickly dry it with a towel) after every use.  </li>
            <li> I use a magnified mirror to help see what I&#x27;m doing and in a few short minutes...smooth, smooth, smooth.  </li>
            <li> But nowhere near as much as waxing or plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes with the saying that it can be painful to look beautiful!</li>
            <li> My chin, while some areas were light, just never really responded to the laser treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very self conscious.  </li>
            <li> It would be selfish of me not to write dis review for others out there looking for a great product to remove their hair,I had to join the over 360 customers who wrote the reviews on dis product,if u r still in doubt about if it works,see the numbers of the reviews,and u&#x27;ll believe,numbers not lie.</li>
            <li> for the great price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but advantage  of not having to even look in the mirror when you use  it and cleaning up all the tiny hairs is prob worth  it.  </li>
            <li> I also used an astringent and my normal moisturizer when I was done.  </li>
            <li> Could be useful for those with only a bit of peach fuzz</li>
            <li> Eventually, your skin and hair will get used to being pulled, that you won&#x27;t even be able to tell it hurts after a few uses.    </li>
            <li> you may just have to adjust or go over a few more times, but it comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its good for small places like your upper lip and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I do like it, though when I first got it it did hurt to much that I didn&#x27;t touch it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d never have a normal life til one day I needed to help myself and get on with my life, make a change.</li>
            <li> Very simple and useful.</li>
            <li> and I could never get every hair because on top of having coarse hair was long ass peach fuzz...</li>
            <li> Ok, I did have a few tears sprout when I got under my nose</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal</li>
            <li> I only bend it to look like a smile, and roll.   </li>
            <li> Certainly fun to play with, especially for those tuffies who think they can take it.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than waxing because it isn&#x27;t messy and with waxing you have to reapply and hope you get it all.</li>
            <li> When I wax, I have a dark pink goatee or beard for a good 6-8 hours after.</li>
            <li> spin the springs end in the same direction and have fun with it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly useful for facial hair</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love it for is my cheeks and sideburns; it just takes too long.</li>
            <li> , so you might want to stay in until the redness subsides to avoid any strange looks in public. :)</li>
            <li> Warning, it will HURT the first time (obviously, if you are doing it on a full area of hair), but after that it is totally bearable</li>
            <li> i normally can tolerate pain</li>
            <li> I winced more than a few times.</li>
            <li> If you are frustrated with the traditional facial hair removal products as I was, you will be very happy to find this simple effective tool.</li>
            <li> A normal threading session at the salon would take about 15 minutes to get all my hair removed.  </li>
            <li> Given that my waxing experiences are pretty much non-existent, I&#x27;ll make this simple.</li>
            <li> Now that the initial treatment is over I can see each subsequent use becoming easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it will likely take you some time to get the hang of using this, but it&#x27;s worth that time.</li>
            <li> If I were able to leave them alone and let them grow long enough</li>
            <li> Oh, and I recommend you use this at night before bed as with waxing, there may be some associated redness (normal) that may take some time to abate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does get better, and using every few days keeps the pain to a minimum.</li>
            <li> but I numbed my face with ice first and barely felt a thing(I&#x27;m a wuss).</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on the glowing reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the accolades.</li>
            <li> For me it worked, when it was in the U shape as shown in the picture, but in other variations as well, slightly bent, at different angles, it even worked flat and straight on some areas-though it worked best in a U or semi-bent</li>
            <li> /&gt;5)Cheaper &amp; Lasts longer (I had my last spring for over a year and a half, and it worked great nearly the entire time!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is fast and easy, but with the long lasting effects of tweezing.</li>
            <li> Most of my hairs get grabbed when I sweep upwards at them from below, but there are a few that grow in an upward direction, or from right to left or left to right, and those weren&#x27;t getting grabbed with the others.  </li>
            <li> Most of my hairs get grabbed when I sweep upwards at them from below, but there are a few that grow in an upward direction, or from right to left or left to right, and those weren&#x27;t getting grabbed with the others.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe a little spring could easily remove the fuzzy hair from my upper lip so quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Be careful near your eyes and eyebrows, you cam easily snag hairs you didn&#x27;t intend to remove...</li>
            <li> It is not as you might imagine as easy as this smiling face makes it look, and especially on the upper lip!  </li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and very fair skin, so any facial hair shows up very clearly, and I&#x27;ve always been extremely self-conscious about people looking closely at my face.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about it that I bought my mother one the same day that I received mine, and I am now her favorite daughter (at least for a couple weeks).</li>
            <li> It hurts, but it pulls out all the little fine hairs really well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to fiddle with it to get it working right, if it pinches or doesn&#x27;t pull out hair, try a different angle and roll!!</li>
            <li> - Grabbed both baby-fine hairs and super-short coarse ones, including on zee chin - though it took some time to sort the right angles on some sections.  </li>
            <li> right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise) -</li>
            <li> upwards, downwards, right to left, left to right, diagonally, etc.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that whatever direction you&#x27;re sweeping, the right hand goes clockwise and the left hand goes</li>
            <li> right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise) -</li>
            <li> upwards, downwards, right to left, left to right, diagonally, etc.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that whatever direction you&#x27;re sweeping, the right hand goes clockwise and the left hand goes counter clockwise.</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of one reviewer to turn clockwise with the right hand and counterclockwise with the left.  </li>
            <li> Comes right back and is stubbly.  </li>
            <li> The next time I did it right.</li>
            <li> The key trick is to rotate the handles or the spring to &#x27;catch&#x27; or &#x27;grab&#x27; hairs right off the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that some of the coarser hairs won&#x27;t come out, but I don&#x27;t mind tweezing a couple of hairs and it beats how dry my skin was getting from the creams and wax.</li>
            <li> Make certain that the hair is pulled out and not simply tugged on by twisting in full movements rather than short and rapid movements.</li>
            <li> ummmm, she maybe has a little bit of peach fuzz that&#x27;s detectable because she&#x27;s got dark hair and fair skin, and it makes her really self-conscious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While, I will likely keep my tweezers nearby for singular strands of thicker facial hair, the REM Spring Sprong got my upper lip super smooth with only 20 minutes of effort the first time around.</li>
            <li> It does hurt when pulling out the really fine hairs especially around the lip and right above the lip, but the key is it does work.</li>
            <li> It might be ok for young people who have really tight skin.</li>
            <li> This spring gets everything quickly with no mess and no cleanup necessary.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it to be hair free for awhile, especially for those of us who have a lot of embarrassing facial hair and don&#x27;t want 5 o&#x27;clock stubble or red wax burn or to take hours in front of a mirror</li>
            <li> this little ingenious tool does it all at home quite easily -- it takes a little while to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plucking with tweezers is fine for obvious hairs, but it won&#x27;t get the smaller ones like the sprong does.</li>
            <li> The money spent is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Thought about laser hair removal but that only works on dark hair and most of this hair is very pale.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I actually was reading over a review I wrote on here in 2010 for a wax hair remover I have used relatively happily for years and have come to prefer for its cost, comfort and general effectiveness over other even professional methods such as laser and electrolysis.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of practice to get the correct curve and twisting motion, but once you &amp;#34;get it&amp;#34;, it really does pull the hair off and leave your skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> Keep your tweezers handy in case there are some strays though, it does take a little bit of experimenting to get it to work at different angles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed if your skin gets a little irritated and flaky the first time you use it on a full area of of peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li> The primary reason I purchased this item is because at my age (75), it&#x27;s not that easy to focus and aim directly at a single stiff chin hair with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li> NO mess!!</li>
            <li> you live</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I plugged in my headphones and took off to the bathroom to use my new hair removal tool.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over 4 years now, i had to buy a new one as I gave mine to my niece.</li>
            <li> i cant live w.o</li>
            <li> Just got this recently as I live in a place without anyone who can do threading (can&#x27;t wax or I break out).</li>
            <li> I went ahead and used it because it was new</li>
            <li> or you may have to order a new one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather live my life and returned to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Threading is not something new to me</li>
            <li> I use the REM together with Vaniqua (applied twice daily to slow down hair regrowth) and am very happy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be even better than threading at getting the hairs, without leaving the area raw or prone to acne</li>
            <li> However, if you do not use this product with swift hand movements, I can see how it might not be effective and possibly more painful.</li>
            <li> It is easy and less time consuming.</li>
            <li> Nair left my face too smooth and then the stubble came back in.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing is the turning of the handles, so that the hair is caught in the spring and literally being twisted off.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt much on the cheeks, but really, really, really hurts on the upper and lower lip.</li>
            <li> The spring really does work, even if your facial hair is very fine.uch-ups when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it brought tears to my eyes, but if you use it a few times a week, it&#x27;s not terribly painful</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and I spent a good few minutes going over the instructions</li>
            <li> It left my skin smooth and not red or irritated.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive this product prior to the expected shipping date.</li>
            <li> This product really solves the purpose..it removes hair really well but definitely not painless.</li>
            <li> I am one of the fortunate who don&#x27;t have an obvious facial hair issue.</li>
            <li> And then my lip would only be hair free for about a week before I would have to try to hide it again, waiting for it to grow enough to wax.  </li>
            <li> Although it tends to leave behind finer hairs, the R.E.M. spring is great for pesky areas like the chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I usually do it in bed every night before going to sleep as my hair grows pretty fast and this deals with them quick.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my facial hair and it is better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> done properly you can get that upper lip as smooth as silk</li>
            <li> do like the product because I am not putting chemicals on my face or exposing myself to unknown and possibly harmful  radiation (for lack of a better word).  </li>
            <li> You kind of have to go over the same spot a few times</li>
            <li> what worked best for me was to slightly bend the spring, place it below where I want to begin hair removal and then twist the ends back and forth as I slowly moved it up my skin.</li>
            <li> I was even able to rip out a row of mustache hair with little effort!  </li>
            <li> product does come with a holder which I was not aware of and it&#x27;s so small it will fit into any purse and even most clutchs.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to bleaches, since I have very sensitive skin, and stumbled upon the R.E.M. Spring.</li>
            <li> very sensitive area...</li>
            <li> The company claims that the spring will not cause irritation, but if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Better alternative,less messy and cheap in the long run than say,waxing for facial hair.</li>
            <li> they are such fine hairs in a such a sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> It gets most hairs on my upper lip, but does not grab the fine thin ones.</li>
            <li> As ridiculous as it may look, puffing your face out really helps in grabbing all obnoxious little buggers, and I&#x27;ve found that creating a tighter &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; helps in pulling out especially fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Not only being fair skinned but also having sensitive skin it is hard to find a product that works at &#x60;removing&#x27; the hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any rusting problems, but I do make sure to dry it thoroughly, and I do live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> A second one for my suitcase to have always at the ready!  </li>
            <li> The first minute I didn&#x27;t feel anything and realized I wasn&#x27;t bending it enough.</li>
            <li> You do not have to be in front of a mirror, or near an outlet!</li>
            <li> Among my friends I do seem to have a higher tolerance for pain, or maybe it&#x27;s just an acceptance of the inevitable.  </li>
            <li> **) is because of what the product actually is.  </li>
            <li> Back to the mirror I went and sure enough with me twisting the ends constantly</li>
            <li> I got it with free shipping with Prime, but the return shipping will be $6, so not worth returning.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The first time it does hurt, but so does any facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> And, it is not messy!  </li>
            <li> I was just considering getting it waxed for the first time until I finally decided to chuck out $15 for this after seeing some girl on Youtube</li>
            <li> The spring was pretty simple to use.   </li>
            <li> But, as others have said, that&#x27;s just at first because it&#x27;s taking out several at once.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Staying indoors and away from the natural sun light outside made me depressed and my self esteem was buried all the way deep into the earth&#x27;s soil!</li>
            <li> At $13, what&#x27;s there to lose??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this for the second time about a week after the first try.  </li>
            <li> - after the first time I used it, I broke out on my chin area and bottom of my cheeks since I had never removed hair there before (not unbearable, and I actually have acne prone skin).</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will find something that will make my life a bit easier in this area since I apparently have very stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> think I might be able to use the same handle building idea with something other than tape</li>
            <li> It did tingle a bit at first, but that was no big surprise from reviews I have read.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised to find that it came with 2 springs!</li>
            <li> At first i was going to give up because i can&#x27;t imagine how this 1 simple spring can take the hairs off.</li>
            <li> and I got pimples on my upper lip the first time</li>
            <li> It pulls hair out by the root on the first or second pass.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> As soon as I first tried the Spring on my facial hair, it found hair fibers I did not know existed.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Also I found you need to be going in the exact opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and my first application was on my upper lip and OUCH!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I find it so challenging.</li>
            <li> I thought $15 or so for these products would be easier to take than nearly $300 for the No!</li>
            <li> I received my spring about 2 hours ago and just by reading the reviews here, I learned how to use it properly and it really works!  </li>
            <li> So I guess the way to the no pain part is to keep up with the growth and not let it grow back in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I howled when my friend used one for the first time - her facial expressions!</li>
            <li> it hurts, so you need a big pain threshold, but it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This product has completely changed that!</li>
            <li> If you have the same problem the first time, keep trying.</li>
            <li> First let me say this even if it is obvious!  </li>
            <li> The spring is pretty short, yet you have to keep it bent and twist the ends when you use it.</li>
            <li> I love threading, but not many places do it</li>
            <li> Her glowing recommendation gave me hope that this might be the solution to a problem I&#x27;ve struggled with since puberty: a light layer of dark hair all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My problem areas are my &amp;#34;female sideburns&amp;#34; and there was pretty much only one review out of 500</li>
            <li> After trying wax strips for the first time 4 weeks ago, I still have a patch of red skin.</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;ve been suffering with facial hair since a teenager.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> this is more gentle than threading; (which I still do for my eyebrows as this device is not precise enough for shaping brows)</li>
            <li> I even use it on my nose - little tiny blond hairs that show up when the light hits you just right.</li>
            <li> This little spring is so easy to use</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t grab short hairs, and I can&#x27;t figure out how to clean out the inside of the  coil.</li>
            <li> We all know that Michael &amp; co haven&#x27;t particularly been cranking out new material in the last decade or two; but in the good old days, artists could at least fall back on existing album sales for a decent retirement.</li>
            <li> This little tool does exactly what it is supposed to do easily, quickly, efficiently, and with no mess.  </li>
            <li> Not totally pain free, but only really bothersome if you are a total wimp!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t come up much in conversations, but when it does I highly recommend this Spring Facial Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to control facial hair.</li>
            <li> The hair grew back the same thickness and consistency (contrary to popular beliefs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hair around my chin grew back the same speed (give or take 1-2 weeks) as shaving.</li>
            <li> I do still pluck some very thick unruly hairs, but this tool catches those super fine hairs that tweezers can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> originally stumbled on this product when I had a cold sore, and wanted to use something more gentle.  </li>
            <li> After I got the hang of it (which took all of about half a minute) it was smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend twirling your fingers as fast as possible to just yank out the hairs and not slowly plucking them out</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow, but I had to read them over a few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have dark, coarse hair and it gets most of those.</li>
            <li> About the same as tweezing (which I hate, given the number required for visable results with the pain), but for the same amount of pain, you get many many more hairs.  </li>
            <li> The creams leave my skin pretty sensitive and red, and I am embarrassed to go out of the house for a day.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt a little at first on cheeks &amp; right under nose</li>
            <li> not raw or anything</li>
            <li> I also have pcos and lots of little fine hair on my jawline</li>
            <li> first inkling that this wasn&#x27;t the miracle I was seeking was the fact that it just plain didn&#x27;t work on my normally shaved face, even though before starting I&#x27;d let the hair grow in much more than I&#x27;d ever want to be caught in public with.</li>
            <li> This is not the one tool for every single hair, but it&#x27;s definitely worth owning and using regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only concern (and this is for the future) is that in order to clean it properly you are supposed to gently pull the spring apart to separate the coils.</li>
            <li> Using it hurts very much,it does yank the hair out but not always on the first, second or third try.  </li>
            <li> It left to many hairs that were just slightly coming through the skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, and because I already use an epilator regularly, this was relatively painless in comparison.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a bit, but it&#x27;s a quick pain that only lasts a second.  </li>
            <li> I had been tweezing and shaving, but that was starting to take all day, and the shaved hairs grew back so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was able to quickly get hairs that had otherwise been difficult to get with waxing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive but not super sensitive skin, a mixture of fine and course hair, and so far the spring has done everything it&#x27;s advertised and nothing it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t pluck the coarse dark hair above my upper lip, it becomes a fairly noticeable mustache.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use, much less painful, and much more effective than I expected - and gets easier very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but I have lots of fine hair round my chin</li>
            <li> All the other reviews pretty much nailed it on the head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that this little bugger is a good investment if you can deal with a little pain for she sake of beauty/vanity.</li>
            <li> It does smart especially under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a smart device thank you thank you</li>
            <li> but sometimes it misses certain tiny hairs and like a one star rater</li>
            <li> and it does smart around the upper lip,</li>
            <li> I personally haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs because that is just too large of an area for me to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does remove hair but peach fuzz and fine light hairs will grow back as very thick hair</li>
            <li> I had little faith in this, but because it was relatively cheap</li>
            <li> I say resist the urge if you can because if you overdo it, you may never pick up the device again, whereas if you do it little by little, you will love the results so much you&#x27;ll stick with it and with each session, the sensation of pain really does go away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, I have to admit that I love the fact that this little gizmo is silent, unlike the epilator I considered buying.</li>
            <li> I presume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s grabbing more little peach fuzz over a larger surface area.</li>
            <li> Could NOT stay on top of it no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, but it&#x27;s hard to keep.</li>
            <li> Much better than plucking them out one by one with a tweezer, but you will still need a tweezer for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> However, it sure does the trick in removing those hard to get hairs from your face.  </li>
            <li> Right away I realized that when you hold it upside down you need to twist the ends left and right continuously in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for a product, but for this one I decided to make an exception, simply because when used a little differently than instructed, it works amazing for</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase if you&#x27;re looking for something that will pull every single tiny blonde hair right off your face without any compasion whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> But I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, especially if it promises a smoother upper lip.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way that the only spot it was good for, for me, was my upper lip.</li>
            <li> After a little maneuvering I figured out that holding it in a gentle U shape- not too close to a V!!!-</li>
            <li> Amazing tool, I owned a tweezer and got tired of squeezing the hair shaft was a strain on my fingers, so I threw it away when I got this</li>
            <li> I just rinse after with cold water and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> what 25 year old female wants to look like a man?</li>
            <li> The instructions aren&#x27;t really clear.</li>
            <li> To clean the tool I use a dry white face cloth because I like to see the results.</li>
            <li> Then you blow on it to clear out any hair.</li>
            <li> At age 70, my facial hair was very aging.  </li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> just wow...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a mustache since I was 8 years old..</li>
            <li> so much I bought a second one for my friend.</li>
            <li> I refused to shave as it seemed so masculine:</li>
            <li> It took me until the third try to really pick up the hairs.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for the upper lip, it is fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li> do a couple of passes each night and you keep yourself completely hairless.</li>
            <li> So naturally, I browsed Amazon for the highest rated hair remover, and when I saw this had 4 1/2 stars out of 5, I purchased it within seconds.      </li>
            <li> DO NOT use this REM Spring near your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I can use it while I am watching TV, because you don&#x27;t need a mirror; just touch the area until it feels soft.</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t completely gone yet, but</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing that really works with a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a thinner more delicate area than my chin.</li>
            <li> I found that it really helps to just use all kinds of different angles on your face and contoring to your chin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and is not irritated.</li>
            <li> and this by far is the one that I thought Got rid of my hair</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and have PCOS</li>
            <li> I use an old toothbrush to scrub at and get in between the coils.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product if you have hair on your whole face that you want to remove.</li>
            <li> but you really get used to it that its second nature.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my short and ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I will say that initially, it really stung - enough to bring tears!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly surprised that I&#x27;ve never seen this advertised anywhere</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s far exceeded my expectations so far, and then some.</li>
            <li> Come to find out as an adult</li>
            <li> I did as much as I could bear that night, and followed the next night.      </li>
            <li> Im 24 years old</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star simply because it can not get out really stubbon hairs unless they were longer to pull out.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying this product - not a waste of money.</li>
            <li> After doing my whole face, it was red</li>
            <li> And thanks to everyone else who left reviews, you made me try this product</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, after doing my whole upper lip...</li>
            <li> I just followed my natural instinct on how to twist the rod .</li>
            <li> I have had problem facial hair my whole life.</li>
            <li> I have had a &#x27;stache since I was 13 years old.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make my skin so red either like waxing.</li>
            <li> I placed the edge of the tape near the thinnest part of the tapered handle and started winding.</li>
            <li> Is this natural?</li>
            <li> Does it feel natural?</li>
            <li> And I still break out in a rash (I have sensitive skin),</li>
            <li> (really well above the lip, but...YOUCH!)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of facial hair, and this product is a real game-changer for me.</li>
            <li> But if you want fast and easy(although not painless) facial hair removal THIS IS IT!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t surprised to find that it caught hairs...</li>
            <li> so far day one..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s completely painless since you are plucking hairs basically, but</li>
            <li> Hold the spring straight and horizontally at the ends and twirl in opposite directions.</li>
            <li> Do this for a couple of times and it really helps in keeping the spring intact for further uses.</li>
            <li> Skin feels baby soft.    </li>
            <li> It is really that simple and will eliminate those unwanted hairs.     </li>
            <li> I use it frequently -</li>
            <li> Went from 30 mins (from application to being completely done) to 5</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really does work and get&#x27;s almost all the hair (I use it only for the hairs on my chin)</li>
            <li> My face has tons of red spots on the sides and I really can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin that changes what it can handle then use this product because it works at removing hair, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it after extended use.</li>
            <li> My skin was red afterwards, but no worse than if I had plucked the hairs one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item arrived fast and is incredibly simple in design.  </li>
            <li> As far as pain goes, if you have threaded by yourself for years, you would say what I am saying - \\&quot;It does not hurt - compared to the pain</li>
            <li> I started near the lip and moved up to the nose.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with low expecations of it actually being useful, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> This work Like wow in the beginning</li>
            <li> But so far, 1 star.</li>
            <li> (Please do not get this thing anywhere near your eyebrows,</li>
            <li> I feel like a professional at this already.  </li>
            <li> Has no trouble grabbing those and pulling them out.</li>
            <li> This really works wonders on your entire face.</li>
            <li> What developed after is what I refer to as my \\&quot;scab &#x27;stache\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> next time I used it a few days later, it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, because there weren&#x27;t as many hairs to pull.</li>
            <li> After a month, my hairs must be used to getting pulled out, because it hurts far less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is not messy.</li>
            <li> I also have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and private.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter, after she begged me to get it for her.  </li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, I found that it really does the job on my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have a fair amount of facial hair which always made me very self conscious.  </li>
            <li> Irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesnt completely rip the hair from its roots.  </li>
            <li> No messy wax, and you can do this at home.</li>
            <li> used to pay $32 to have my brows, upper lip and side threaded; $40 for the whole face.  </li>
            <li> and i will keep buying replacements when lost (2 so far).</li>
            <li> I have been using the REM for a month and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because it was shipped fast and the product was same as the description</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to waxing my upper lip, thanks.</li>
            <li> This spring actually works really well.</li>
            <li> and now i can see some blemishing near that area.....</li>
            <li> Tried it again and realized that yes this thing really does work, especially on coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I used to pluck, pluck, pluck out every individual hair, taking up so much time every day.  </li>
            <li> It is about the same level of pain as threading, but much faster.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble learning to use it.</li>
            <li> The problem was in the days afterwards, when I developed bumps and whiteheads in the areas this product had been used.</li>
            <li> I bought the R.E.M. Spring for my 90 yr old mother.</li>
            <li> However, she says there is an undeniable &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; factor and the face does sting considerably longer than the enclosed literature suggests.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I did try and use my sensitive face toner after use of spring , but it did not help.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that this worked.</li>
            <li> It does the job really well for my upper lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i completely recommend this product to all the girl like me...</li>
            <li> I almost gave up on an epilator, but I finally found one that works very well, and which does not make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used waxes and creams, but both cause my sensitive skin to break out.  </li>
            <li> I really like the spring facial remover</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough so if you decide you don&#x27;t like it later on, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin there look natural.</li>
            <li> I know how to thread, but I&#x27;m by no means a professional.</li>
            <li> wow..</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I was a natural blond (now I&#x27;m gray)</li>
            <li> have it done professionally.</li>
            <li> The R.E.M. got rid of the peach fuzz and the mustache hairs but was hit and miss on the coarse hairs, but I have to really pull at those with my tweezers sometimes</li>
            <li> While I will continue to have my eyebrows professionally done</li>
            <li> I am a frequent consumer of hair removal products.  </li>
            <li> I only write product reviews if I really has something to say.  </li>
            <li> I prefer not to use it in the most delicate areas like below my nose</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re working on a sensitive area, you have the control to go bit by bit and not rip it all out at once.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well if you do it properly.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> They say its hypoallergenic, but to someone with sensitive skin, its not.</li>
            <li> It does do what it says it will do, but if you are prone to break out or have sensitive skin, might want to stick with thread.</li>
            <li> I would warn anyone with sensitive skin and/or allergies to look for another hair-removal product.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is a early review</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a go, but I&#x27;m going to say that if you have coarse hairs that you yourself have issues pulling out via tweezers individually</li>
            <li> Worth the wait and money spent.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few minutes but it seems to work okay, but hurts when the hairs are being pulled out.</li>
            <li> (I get those rarely and minimally.  </li>
            <li> (I get those rarely and minimally.  </li>
            <li> So worth the $15 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I had cleared the whole area, and I&#x27;m not nearly as afraid to just run the spring over my jawline</li>
            <li> Some chin hairs are more stubborn than others but multiple passes with the spring over the course of a few days</li>
            <li> Nice that you can thin hairs this way, don&#x27;t have to worry about the in-between stages of hair re-growth that waxing has.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it hurts more if you go slow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, there was nothing wrong when I got it.</li>
            <li> I hate waxing so this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li> not because of major new growth that was visible.  </li>
            <li> The only *really* sensitive area is right above the lip.</li>
            <li> apparently I have way more hair on my upper lip than I previously thought (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy; I usually just run it over my chin and upper lip while I&#x27;m watching television or reading, a real no-brainer.  </li>
            <li> This is the same as the right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise approach, just worded differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If the hair is growing toward the left, roll from the left to the right.  </li>
            <li> right was more difficult, but it seemed to work</li>
            <li> right was more difficult, but it seemed to work</li>
            <li> My method is just to roll between your fingers in a back and forth motion, and sideways, left to right.</li>
            <li> with my thumbs facing each other, the U shape close to touching my face, almost straight up and down!</li>
            <li> It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Neat unique little invention.</li>
            <li> , forget other hair removers and try this one FIRST!  </li>
            <li> I am SO excited about this little guy.  </li>
            <li> another little pain in life that is worth it!  </li>
            <li> It is true that it is a bit hard to control exactly which hairs you want to pluck, but overall if you just want to get rid of hair above the lip it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is easy enough to do once you have it down, you can just sit in front of the TV and space it.</li>
            <li> It was not nearly as painful, I didn&#x27;t even bat an eye-probably because you are pulling much less hair.  </li>
            <li> That may sound silly or like an exaggeration but as a fair skinned young woman who has always had dark hair above my lip</li>
            <li> I work very closely with young students as a reading tutor, and I am aware that little kids don&#x27;t want to be looking at a grandma&#x27;s mustache.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about using this because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I did hope that I wouldn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs from this, but unfortunately my very sensitive skin apparently reacts that way to all hair removal attempts.</li>
            <li> I do have a little trick to keep the spring from not loosening up every time you clean it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely self-conscious and it pretty much ruined my social life.  </li>
            <li> only reason I gave this product four stars is because it did not remove some fine, dark hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, causes less irritation than waxing or chemicals, and there is no goop left on your face!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to figure out and use, I had it working on all of my peach fuzzy upper lip hair and had it removed in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and it actually hurts a lot less than wax and tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the chin and cheeks hurt less than that super sensitive area under the nose</li>
            <li> It does smart the first few times, but so does tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li> must say when I first tried this I thought it was a waste and pure junk</li>
            <li> I must say when I first tried this I thought it was a waste and pure junk</li>
            <li> I am still using the original one I bought a few years ago</li>
            <li> No wax, no bleach, no mess.</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, especially for the ladies who have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s already better than waxing because you don&#x27;t have to worry about letting hairs grow out to ridiculous or embarrassing lengths in between, and no appointments are neccessary.  </li>
            <li> You can try less of a U shape (more like a crescent shape) and also try rolling in different directions because hair grows at all different angles sometimes.  </li>
            <li> It is more subtle and does NOT pull on the skin.</li>
            <li> And yea sure, you need to get used to it (though I&#x27;m not sure if everyone can actually get used to it).</li>
            <li> If you still want to try it, I&#x27;d recommend doing it when your life is pretty low key</li>
            <li> It was a bit uncomfortable the first time I did it because I didn&#x27;t think it would take as many hairs all at once as it did.  </li>
            <li> I whipped it out of the box and started twisting and bending every which way and found that twisting them in the SAME direction upward AND downward both work as long as i put pressure on it, the pain along the jawline wasnt fun</li>
            <li> My friend actually shouted \\&quot;son of a mother!\\&quot; when it first worked on her upper lip.</li>
            <li> When I did the first pass over my upper lip, it felt like my skin was getting ripped up along with the facial hair, so</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my upper lip and for my pesky chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> If you twirl them the opposite way, no hairs get grabbed (this was the main thing I needed to figure out</li>
            <li> First I shaved for quite a few years and it was really hurting my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this spring mainly for my upper lip and chin areas (ouch!)</li>
            <li> mainly use this on my upper lips and cheeks around the mouth area.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly on the upper lip and the chin areas.</li>
            <li> Not only is she extremely helpful, but you will get a belly laugh just watching her video!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time and it removed the hair from my upper lip in a brief period of &amp;#34;tweaky-ouchy&amp;#34; encounter.</li>
            <li> Seems like, after the first few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> it took me about five minutes to do my entire upper lip as it was the first time i was using the product.</li>
            <li> She said the next morning her upper lip was in a lot of pain after trying it the first time...</li>
            <li> So while your skin may feel smooth, you&#x27;re left with a dark root -  ie a five o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> This worked temporarily, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a long term solution.</li>
            <li> I am a typical post-menopausal woman who is sensitive to hot wax and doesn&#x27;t have time for all the plucking!</li>
            <li> i used to have to go into those little salon&#x27;s at wal-mart and have my lip waxed in full view of everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty expensive when compared to other brands and thus I expect it to be of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this to any woman that has facial hair problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to everyone who, like me, is embarrassed by their facial hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have unwanted facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been dealing with facial hair since Junior High.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this tool would for my upper lip hair, but it was ineffective.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a hair(and</li>
            <li> This is definitely a hormonal issue that I either have to live with or eventually go to someone that can naturally elevate my levels of estrogen without using going through hormone therapy.</li>
            <li> Not only was I paying frequently for the waxing procedure itself, I live quite a ways away from the nearest salon</li>
            <li> my skin is smooth, the hair is gone, all with very little discomfort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I chose this product over the others because of the way the ends are shaped and because of the quality of the spring, even if it is a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have to bend it; if I just hold it slightly curved and turn it upward, and then come back downward, while twisting in the same direction with both hands, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> As I have been using it once a week over the last few months I am noticing less hair-I&#x27;m pretty sure I am just ripping out the roots on lots of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> of the hairs were very thick and some very fine, so</li>
            <li> :) the first time hurts pretty bad</li>
            <li> an Asian woman with black coarse hair - but my facial hair (and having used a threading tool for over 2 years now) is still very fine.  </li>
            <li> The waxing left my sensitive skin extremely reddened and it would actually take a day or two before my face returned to normal and it was a huge pain to apply the wax next to my hairline and not get any of it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I first tried to use the Spring Sprong; it had such great reviews it</li>
            <li> This is a bit painful, but is the best way I&#x27;ve found to remove facial hair above my lip and on my chin.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later I&#x27;m an old pro, and my face is baby smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second one immediately and am actually thinking of buying a few more spares.</li>
            <li> I only ordered one for me and one for my sister, who loves it too, and I am going to order a few more for my purse and back up.</li>
            <li> Now, I normally wax my upper and lower lip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried bleaching, hair removal cream &amp; waxing and its been so rough on my skin, its gone from breaking out, to just drying it out so much it hurt!</li>
            <li> I find that using it after softening the hairs with a hot wet towel for 10-15 minutes also helps to minimizes the pain.</li>
            <li> I would normally drive 12 minutes each way, pay 50 cents to a meter, a six dollar waxing fee and two dollar tip for the removal of the same hair.</li>
            <li> The U-bend is wide enough to not fit between the brow or under it, risk of catching eyelashes.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little bit to get the trick down to use it, but it was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> And it does leave a little redness, but it goes away really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I know...pretty hard to believe, but its true!  </li>
            <li> This little spring coil is quick.</li>
            <li> The spring seems to only grab fine hairs, completely missing the darker, thicker hairs on my chin that I purchased this to address.</li>
            <li> Laser leaves all the fine hairs to shine in the sun.waxing takes off a few layers of my skin,leaving me with open wounds,enough said about that.</li>
            <li> I am a woman who has tried EVERYTHING (tweezing, threading, shaving, waxing, Nad&#x27;s and Nair) to get rid of the fine (but long) dark hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> This did not remove hairs from the roots in certain areas of my face, such as the side burn area, upper cheek, and edge of lips/upper lip area.</li>
            <li> This little REM Spring for facial hair removal is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am sooo glad I gave this product a try, and I plan to continue to use it for a long time to come!t was honestly red for less time than after plucking or waxing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works on coarse hair, but for those baby fine little hairs that are too small to tweeze, this is a quick and easy way to 86 them.</li>
            <li> i suppose..the more frequently its used, the more you will get used to the pain, so it wont be as shocking as the first time.</li>
            <li> I would just like to recommend that the first time you use it, do it at night so that you&#x27;re not walking around all day with a red face (I would assume most people will turn at least pink when pulling hair out of their skin).  </li>
            <li> I had peach fuzz all over my face that was noticeably longer than most people&#x27;s, but due to my sensitive skin I was not willing to wax (or shave, for obvious reasons).</li>
            <li> That said, a number of years ago, I had most of my facial hair lasered off with reasonable results - my skin was sensitive to shaving, which made it bothersome and results not ideal.  </li>
            <li> The pain is minimal and it removes hair easily, and the price is extremely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it on the corner of my mouth first and after one or two false starts I got my hands coordinated and the hair came right out!  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with a lot of fine, pale facial hair for awhile.</li>
            <li> and it did not hurt at all since the hairs were new, short and not well rooted - no</li>
            <li> Now the only time the gravy train rolls into the station for elderly and burned out artists is a new tour.</li>
            <li> thing I would suggest to the new user - get your facial hair threaded once and watch what the technician does.  </li>
            <li> My cousin told me she was using a new &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; type item instead of tweezers for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Even if that is the case, this product is so affordable it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to buy a new one every year/ two years/ whatever it ends up being.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt anywhere near as much as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> When i got this at first it was pretty painful but removed so much hair and quickly..</li>
            <li> The sleeve it comes in is worth less than a penny.   </li>
            <li> I was not holding out much hope that this product would do the job, but after 10 years of tweezing and bleaching various areas of facial hair, I am a convert to the REM Spring Sprong.</li>
            <li> I lay a towel out, pull the Spring open bungee style again, and alternate between rolling it gently against the towel and shaking/banging it against the towel.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really pull out all the facial hair, even when I go through the same areas over and over.</li>
            <li> No woman I know wants to have extra hair, especially on her face.  </li>
            <li> I could remove this tiny facial hair myself at home the time I want .It doesnt hurt that much and when you get used to it</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I figured for less than $15 it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> did get this primarily for upper lip, but I do have a few hairs on my chin area, so I tried it there too.  </li>
            <li> I did get this primarily for upper lip, but I do have a few hairs on my chin area, so I tried it there too.  </li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that most of the time it wouldn&#x27;t pull the hairs out by the roots.  </li>
            <li> Second thought--who knew I had so much peach-fuzzy facial hair?</li>
            <li> the only spots that truly hurt me are my chin area directly under my lower lip and my sideburn-ish area near my ears</li>
            <li> The BEST, easiest, fastest, &amp; least expensive hair removal product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I make a solution of a few drops of a mild dish soap</li>
            <li> I also noticed the hair grew back more slowly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried bleaching, shaving, tweezing, waxing and asking nicely for the hair to depart from my upper lip, but alas, I remained unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I bent the R.E.M. in a gentle inverted U shape and moved it up and down my skin at the same time rolling the handles in and out (left hand going counter clockwise and the right going clockwise on the out motion and the reverse on the in motion).</li>
            <li> but then again your upper lip area is a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li> My upper lip is very soft and does not have the burn and irritation that I am used to.</li>
            <li> My upper lip is very soft and does not have the burn and irritation that I am used to.</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it on the \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; area or another very sensitive place.</li>
            <li> I used to go to my local salon for waxing, then I got a skin rash and burns, so I switched to the threading walk-in place at the mall; I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and lots of hair on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> To recap: more useful for the light hairs that can grow longer without being noticed, not good for the coarse, dark hairs that are noticeable the moment they grow past the epidermis.</li>
            <li> First, I have very fair skin, but thick black hair (it seriously sucks!)</li>
            <li> Pulling the hairs above my lip was quite easy, in fact, it took very little time to make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not extremely hairy like</li>
            <li> Extremely, no, it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the first time is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fun to use, but it&#x27;s efficient and does the job and is oh so much quicker than tweezers.</li>
            <li> The small purchase was definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li> but my upper lip was just too sensitive!</li>
            <li> The upper lip hurt but was completely doable!</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m not going to lie, this product that takes a little getting used to, at first I thought this thing doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> but every time I removed my facial hair with it, I got many small pimples along the jaw line and occasional break outs.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> And once you get the majority of hair, it is easy to just keep going over the same areas again and again until you get every last little</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to the twisting motion is kinda weird at first, but so easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it on wet, dry, moist skin, using in fully in U, slightly bent and straight, I&#x27;ve tried twisting the handles all different ways, and I&#x27;ve tried moving it in many directions.</li>
            <li> I have fine but dark hairs that grow on my upper lip, and it&#x27;s kind of painfully tedious to try and pluck the hairs individually.  </li>
            <li> there are some teeny tiny white hairs left, and this is why the final result wins out over waxing to me.</li>
            <li> Even when some hairs do break it is much better to have only a few grow back than having all of them grow back as when shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty thorough, getting every single hair, and it only took about 3 minutes</li>
            <li> right when you get out of the shower, and it hurts less.</li>
            <li> I did what a previous reviewer mentioned and turned my right hand</li>
            <li> Creams are more effective and less painful.</li>
            <li> not really sure how to clean the inside of the spring, but that also doesn&#x27;t affect the usage at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then when I&#x27;ve worked my way in, and its pretty much all numb, I will place the spring over my entire top lip lining and roll up to get the middle hairs.  </li>
            <li> Just as for many reviewers, it took a few tries to figure out how to roll and twist for maximum hair removal - and then those unsightly chin hairs were gone!</li>
            <li> some fine &amp; some thick.</li>
            <li> i.e. from 10 thick hairs per 2mm square area, to 10 fine ones per sq inch.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this is pretty much the same as plucking only with less effort because it gets them all with a twist of the spring.  </li>
            <li> Both calm irritated skin, and aid in healing things like those horrid little whiteheads that sometimes appear after depilatory treatments.  </li>
            <li> It might hurt a little but its worth the hurt ...</li>
            <li> To you Ladies who wrote about not finding success with this little Spring, please be patient and keep trying.    </li>
            <li> takes a little time to figure it out, but worth it..  </li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, but so worth the effort.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but worth the pain.</li>
            <li> In fact i found it fun each time i felt the little &#x27;pull/pluck&#x27; as i was just learning how to use it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but at my age (let&#x27;s just say \\&quot;older\\&quot;)I only have a few chin hairs that I have to clean up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering buying a back-up since I love using this spring to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine facial hair which makes my face look shady.</li>
            <li> Older women often have a double problem :facial hair under and around the chin and over the lips, and dimming vision that makes tweezing by hand impractical.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but quickly changed my mind after just one use!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned but absolutely hate how furry my face has gotten with age.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of ways to deal with my moustache, from ignoring it (until my new niece pointedly asked why her new aunt had a moustache), to depilatories (which led to chemical burns and owieness), to waxing (which left me red for hours), to threading (which hurts like a sonuvagun but doesn&#x27;t leave me red).  </li>
            <li> It hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for removing upper lip hair as well as facial hair.</li>
            <li> At first I wondered how this could possibly work, but I was tired of fine facial hair, and waxing is</li>
            <li> But then I just grew a pair and really went for it, twisting the tool up and down quickly, and it hurt less that way.</li>
            <li> as on the packing it mentions there is a special pouch that comes along with this packing, it was not there.&lt;br /&gt;Packing was open and the pouch was missing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy use, and as another reviewer mentioned, the secret is going back and forth in several directions, while twisting the device with your hands in opposite directions (maintaining the more or less U shape recommended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing, but huts bad at first</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought it with a huge dose of doubt that it could work; however, for such a small price, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I generally use it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it is more appropriate for an adult, or maybe it was just my daughter, but she hated it and ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> .. hair has to be long enough to grap up in it.. but not that much ..</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t hurt as long as I do it daily.  </li>
            <li> They both seem very durable, and I expect them to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised that the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover worked as well as it did.</li>
            <li> For the finer hairs on my upper lip, it whips those out with no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young woman in my 20&#x27;s and the only years I regret was when I didn&#x27;t have this in my life.</li>
            <li> I wax/epilate on a regular basis so my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> and yes it gets rid of the soft facial hairs</li>
            <li> But this tool is capable of leaving just enough tiny fuzz that it&#x27;s not obvious</li>
            <li> It hurts mostly near the ears and above my lip.</li>
            <li> O.O</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am 70 years old and facial hair has become a bit of a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> Completely cuts the hair at the upper lip area so it feels like shaven, and it doesn&#x27;t take the hair out from root as advertised.</li>
            <li> The lip is a bit sensitive but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is with my skin, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t like the R.E.M anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about some hair above my lip, so I&#x27;ve tried waxing, shaving, bleaching, tweezing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved my chin, and with hormone issues can sport quite the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> And how much it hurts is minimal.</li>
            <li> It took all of five minutes for me to completely de-hair my upper lip.</li>
            <li> ; There&#x27;s no getting around pain when you&#x27;re ripping sensitive facial hair out by the roots.</li>
            <li> : The ease of you use was actually much easier  than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been so self conscious about my excess hair and would fret about it daily.</li>
            <li> The hair comes back every two weeks so far</li>
            <li> I had stubble that I could just barely tweez(one days growth), and</li>
            <li> I had stubble that I could just barely tweez(one days growth), and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something scientific, but it seems like direct tweezing causes hairs to grow back faster stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my eyebrows threaded, so I&#x27;m not going near them, but I have used this on my sideburns and upper lip.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it on my upper lip, cheeks, and even on my toes!</li>
            <li> The tool does rip &amp; pull facial hair, but sometimes it breaks the hair and not pull it out completely from</li>
            <li> You can tell when it&#x27;s taking the complete hair out by feeling it, and also seeing the white tip at the end of the hair.</li>
            <li> The only hairs this got were the near invisible peach fuzz around my face and neck-</li>
            <li> No more long white hairs on my face!! :)</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t careful you will rip out your real hair.</li>
            <li> I am a 59 year old woman and was blonde before I went gray.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to bleach, I dislike waxing, and tweezing the individual hairs is too time consuming.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this to all of you girls who have soft skin and facial hair problem..</li>
            <li> What I felt was a tiny pinch, even directly under my nose.</li>
            <li> product will definitely work, even as I see it very time consuming, but my biggest problem is that if your hair is as short as mine, as I maintain the growth every week, the hairs seemed way to short to be grabbed by the remover.</li>
            <li> The downside to my facial hair is I always developed severe acne in the area where I removed the hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face felt the next day when I washed.  </li>
            <li> What it does do is remove enough of it so that I look like a normal human being, not a Sasquatch.  </li>
            <li> It may be more time consuming, but this is worse than even shaving.</li>
            <li> Ok, this hurts worse than my tattoo (in some areas).</li>
            <li> Better than caustic hair removers, bleach, and I would imagine it will weaken the roots.  </li>
            <li> However, not a lot worse than tweezing but also not a lot better than just tweezing.</li>
            <li> You have to play with the angle a little to get it right.</li>
            <li> It take a little time to get it right.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it hurts a little, but less than waxing.</li>
            <li> With my new position in the public eye, its crucial I bring my &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; game everytime in a crowd and am confident this will help those tv and photog moments.</li>
            <li> I am also pale so the dark hairs stand out even more.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason I wanted to try a new product was because the cream remover would sometimes cause redness that could last over a day in the same area.</li>
            <li> I did have to change the angle that I was using it (sometimes running it sideways instead of up and down), and have it bent more or less than I do on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I can quickly use it and be done with it in a few minutes and even use it daily without having to worry about about redness or itchiness.</li>
            <li> (If I do a few quick &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; before starting.  </li>
            <li> It is unlikely I would have ordered a Spring to remove facial hair if I&#x27;d not read what these other ladies had experienced.</li>
            <li> It only takes seconds to use and there is literally no mess.</li>
            <li> Right, Left, Up, Down, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It works great to remove the fine hairs but left me with a hundred tiny bloody scabs on my face!</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to get the right arch angle of the spring, but you can hear and feel it working.  </li>
            <li> This gadget did not remove 1 single hair - do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> First of all, the instructions for this say that you&#x27;ll feel a slight tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> normally I pluck and shave what I can not finish.. and have a dry course</li>
            <li> The product definitely provides for hairless skin, but idk.. it just looks and feels more of a subtle change than the drastic red hairless skin you get from waxing).</li>
            <li> like that I can see the hairs and their roots on the Spring, that it&#x27;s small and lightweight, and that I can use it whenever I need to for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> Because my hair grows rather quickly, I use the spring every 2-3 days and it takes me probably no more than 5 minutes to use.  </li>
            <li> I recently starting becoming self-conscious of the small brown hairs mixed in with the blond one on my upper lip (I just turned</li>
            <li> I have very light colored thin facial hair</li>
            <li> My facial hair is very light and thin.</li>
            <li> My face was a little red after the first few uses (like it would be with waxing) but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> It also helps a lot to apply a gentle, calming lotion or hydrosol to the area first, and throughout, if I&#x27;m removing serious overgrowth.  </li>
            <li> i am kind of use to really have every single hair plucked, this tool have shorten time spent on plucking facial thin hair.</li>
            <li> I do have trouble getting certain hairs above my lip and wonder if a smaller spring like I&#x27;ve seen at local stores could be helpful on certain curves of the face.  </li>
            <li> And it hurt just as much as all the other things (laser, wax, tweeze) in the end pulling hair from you skin, is pulling hair from your skin.  </li>
            <li> It HURTS just as much as any other hair removal method.  </li>
            <li> This works extremely well on those areas we ladies don&#x27;t really talk about, but spend a lot of time grooming.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews of this product were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a little pain to have a hairless upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> Who cares...it is worth a little pain to get your life back.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to--you need to keep it bent as shown in the picture, keep turning the end pieces, and move in different directions--and it does sting just a bit as the hairs are removed--but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes (not long) to figure out the right &#x27;twisting&#x27; motion, but after that....</li>
            <li> Not a single pimple with using the spring.</li>
            <li> use it, at first I coiled it up tight and then \\&quot;let go\\&quot;</li>
            <li> is not very nice, either, because the hair grows back quickly.</li>
            <li> - Always use a clean pillowcase the night you use this, and change it at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> the more painful... if you are able to wax and then do this as follow up you will have less pain.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to get to clear, hairless skin with this product</li>
            <li> holy cow, this thing really works.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of visible blonde facial hair that I have always been self conscious about.</li>
            <li> I am old enough now to be getting unwanted facial hair growth.  </li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive skin, and you don&#x27;t want to go in public red and bumpy, allow yourself some time before going out.  </li>
            <li> I am a 25 yr old African American woman.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well on my cheeks and chin, but I had a harder time removing the hair from the neck area and my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have tried professional laser hair removal and it only lasted about a year before it started to grow back.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and have a lot of soft facial hair and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d see what it was all about since I wasn&#x27;t about to spring for HUNDREDS of dollars for a &amp;#34;No-No&amp;#34; or some such electric torture device to trim my wild ear hairs and such.  </li>
            <li> Hairs grow at different rates of speed so the key to completely eradicating my problem will be consistency.</li>
            <li> For me, it didn&#x27;t hurt so much on my chin, but the upper lip and the sides/cheeks are a bit rough at the start.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s the only facial hair removal product that works.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, it&#x27;s wide open when it&#x27;s at this position meaning it doesn&#x27;t pull much of anything.</li>
            <li> well personally I think that waxing hurts worse and it is so much better than trying to tweeze each hair one at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive for just a simple spring.  </li>
            <li> Each option more unappealing than the last.    </li>
            <li> Worth the few minutes of pain several times a week.</li>
            <li> The next important thing is to roll slowly so the hair pulls out and does not snap off.  </li>
            <li> The pain is worth it to me because it lasts only a few seconds and does not leave any redness/bumps.</li>
            <li> As a fair skinned brunette I get some dark hair on my upper lip and also a few dark hairs on the upper side of my neck.</li>
            <li> This little unit gets the itsy bitsy hairs right up next to the lip and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash!</li>
            <li> I used it a lot when I first got it because I had a lot of &amp;#34;cleaning up&amp;#34; to do but after that initial week I&#x27;m down to once a week.</li>
            <li> At first I was little hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> With little practice you can master that, be aware it hurts when your hair pull, but as you keep using it you will get use to it.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little the first time, but not like waxing is painless.  </li>
            <li> But now after that first time there&#x27;s just a little &#x27;prickly&#x27; feel.  </li>
            <li> Its a little tricky at first to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it , it does work hurt a little at first</li>
            <li> it takes a little getting used to in order to get the cirrect motion down, but once you do it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li> but I have a good bit on my cheeks, jawline, chin and its fine above my lip, but I have some nasty \\&quot;witch</li>
            <li> And because they all started growing back at the exact same time, I was back to square one, having to either go back to shaving them, or hide out in my house for another week while they got long enough to REM again.</li>
            <li> and I want to tell them about the spring, but that would be too rude, Right?!   </li>
            <li> It takes a little time and isn&#x27;t pain-free (the pain is instantaneous, but enough to make my eyes water, especially on my upper lip) but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> but I got very little success.</li>
            <li> I got my entire chin done in less than two minutes, first try, no mirror.</li>
            <li> Without significant redness, definitely much less than with other methods.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product especially if you have normal hair growth and don&#x27;t have to pluck  everyday.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one of those cheap ones also and it was not good.</li>
            <li> I should add that the hairs I want to grip are not at all unusual (just your average thing).</li>
            <li> When the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover arrived I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to work it because the included instructions were minimal to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I have very course and dark chin hairs</li>
            <li> In at least one area, it felt smooth after I used the REM Sping, but a couple of hours later, I could feel them growing back in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it on other part of my body and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well, but it definitely works on the intended areas.</li>
            <li> I based my decision to buy this spring by reading other reviews and because it was the only one that states it is made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> For bigger longer hairs I can hold the ends and barely bend it.</li>
            <li> also recommend keeping up with it, doing maintenance while the hairs are very short and barely visible.  </li>
            <li> Just \\&quot;man up\\&quot; and get through the first few passes and your skin will desensitize.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have much success, it was just far too uncomfortable and missed a lot.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I got a few post hair removal bumps under the skin as I do after waxing</li>
            <li> -tip for easing the pain: I soak a wash towel in hot water and place it on the area for a few seconds before going over with the spring.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, I used an electric hair removing coil on my legs, so I know the idea is solid, it works, and, I&#x27;m tired of the fuss of waxing (not to mention the red blotching).  </li>
            <li> It did hurt the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just those first few pulls that don&#x27;t feel too good.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> (which is what I have done for the past 2 years...not fun).  </li>
            <li> Received my R.E.M. Spring a few days ago, used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> First few times I used it</li>
            <li> My skin was red for about 20 minutes; I just put a little vitamin E oil on a cotton ball and patted it on my upper lip right after using the spring.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to bend it, it just makes it easier for certain areas as there is less surface area.  </li>
            <li> The one down side is that it really hurts the first few times you do it, but I was expecting that.</li>
            <li> then I realized and it really got the hair down to the root.</li>
            <li> I guess it comes down to how much pain</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out above your upper lip when it&#x27;s angled right, and when you&#x27;re tensing your upper lip tight against your teeth.</li>
            <li> It takes very fine hairs but difficult under chin and around face corners.</li>
            <li> It sorta hurt at first, but it hurts LESS than tweezing did!</li>
            <li> After one month of use I&#x27;ve noticed the chin hairs have slowed in fully growing, but have turned more like stubble, and covering a larger area... not good!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was little worried, since this is my first time using such a product.</li>
            <li> A little tricky at first to figure out the proper technique</li>
            <li> We have tiny tiny fuzz all over our face, but waxing for me removes all of that too and makes my upper lip look kind of shiny and weird compared to the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I had an easier time on the chin hair and went slowly on bits of the upper lip over the coarse of a week before I ignored the watering eyes and then the sneezing attack and just kept going till the upper lip was hair free.  </li>
            <li> Now I will qualify that by saying that because it&#x27;s not painful for me, that doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t be for someone else.</li>
            <li> While I was unable to wax my upper lip due to my sensitive skin, my upper lip is now hair free thanks to the REM Spring!</li>
            <li> Well, the older I get, the harder it is to tweeze those little devils since I can&#x27;t hardly see them any more, dagnabit.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was the most painful but</li>
            <li> It can be painful at first, but this will become tolerable as you use it more.</li>
            <li> REM Spring really helps remove the hair with less pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for coarse chin hair as well as facial hair in general.</li>
            <li> I referred back to these reviews and one of the first ones recommended that that the spring only be bent slightly while you twist it clockwise and counter clockwise at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I used this last night, and my face barely looked red even five minutes</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t difficult to learn to use, and I had success the first try.  </li>
            <li> If wax didn&#x27;t burn my skin, I&#x27;d rather do that because at least it&#x27;s over quickly.</li>
            <li> At least waxing is quick.</li>
            <li> yes, especially the first few time you use it,</li>
            <li> It also causes pain, especially the first few times it&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to get the hang of it the first time you use it, after that it&#x27;s a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> My skin &amp; lips are very sensitive, and after waxing my lips for years with no real satisfaction I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, use it mainly on cheeks, ears and various other locations.</li>
            <li> They say that it will tickle or sting slightly when using this device, they fail to mention that if you are using it for the first time and have a good amount of facial hair that it will burn for just a few seconds, but it burns.</li>
            <li> Frequently washing and moisturizing the affected area with natural, high-quality products usually sees me clear in a couple hours.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frequently washing and moisturizing the affected area with natural, high-quality products usually sees me clear in a couple hours.)  </li>
            <li> The last thing I used that worked was a cream kit but for two days after my upper lip was so swollen and red from the chemicals I could barely talk.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not long enough to pull  </li>
            <li> The first use is a little uncomfortable, but it gets better with use and the results really last.  </li>
            <li> they are not long enough for it to grab them and it breaks them, but I was using it every day too.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s going to take a few days to get all the hair off, but my first round with it went really well.</li>
            <li> The trick is to do it frequently so it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to grow back as thick as the first time.</li>
            <li> I want my face to look natural just less hairy -- and the broken-off fuzz makes it seem like I have the fuzz of a 5-year old.  </li>
            <li> But I got smarter with the next move and twirled it between my fingers fast - and it hurt much less.  </li>
            <li> On top of having pretty bad arthritis to begin with, I have joint replacements in my left hand and my left thumb is fused at the knuckle.</li>
            <li> A bit painful at first (similar to if you ever got your upper lip threaded), but as I continued using it the pain become more tolerable.</li>
            <li> As pretty much everyone else writing reviews about these products, I&#x27;d been fighting facial hair for years - mostly upper lip, and the thin hair on the sides of my face in front of the ears.  </li>
            <li> My skin is fine afterward stings a little for a few minutes but no reaction or anything.  </li>
            <li> Removing hair on the upper lip does smart a little</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not long enough to be noticeable,so no big whup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that I am older, I have dark hairs growing on my neck and jawline.  </li>
            <li> but if you keep at it every few days to keep the are free of hair, it will hurt less since you are only ripping a little bit of hair at that point verses the whole lip and chin.</li>
            <li> Days after that, I even had a few large ones as well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad, especially if you don&#x27;t go crazy and try to get every last hair right away.     </li>
            <li> This little tool really, really works.</li>
            <li> This little tool gets the job done and fast.</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts, but I found that applying a little bit of Benzocaine at the site of hair removal works really well.</li>
            <li> The spring didn&#x27;t need to be opened that much to get those little hairs.  </li>
            <li> It works really well after a little bit of practice.  </li>
            <li> This really works but hurts a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all gone now, thanks to this little spring.  </li>
            <li> As you age, you get fine hair everywhere and some heavy hair in trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of dark, fine facial hair and usually go to get it waxed off once a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely takes a little trial and error, but after about 2-3 days you will be an absolute expert.  </li>
            <li> Previously, my main concern was only the dark, coarse hairs on my face and not the peach fuzz, but this baby gets everything, leaving my face smoother and softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt it in my life.</li>
            <li> Previously, my main concern was only the dark, coarse hairs on my face and not the peach fuzz, but this baby gets everything, leaving my face smoother and softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt it in my life.</li>
            <li> And since I&#x27;m now in my 50s, these tiny little hairs were appearing on my chin, but I really couldn&#x27;t see them well enough to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> I read countless reviews both good and bad and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with break outs, which was a huge plus, but after a few days just the thought of using this on my lip made me cringe.</li>
            <li> This is just as good, but no wax residue left behind that led to at least one pimple every time.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the few I had before using it disappeared the next day, which may mean my products are working better.</li>
            <li> As you slowly move the spring upward, twirl the right hand fingers clockwise and the left hand fingers counter-clockwise.</li>
            <li> only problem is getting those tiny hair out of the loops to clean this spring is really tough...</li>
            <li> Long and Thin and gets lost in drawer easily</li>
            <li> Received it last night but was too tired to open it (but was excited to get it).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I can see where people would think that the spring is confusing to use right out of the box</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please disregard all negative reviews because those people either don&#x27;t use it right</li>
            <li> Out of the box, few quick trials to get technique down and bye bye hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product at first, but after reading all the positive reviews, I decided that I&#x27;d have to try it for myself.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews from other people who had purchased it and had no trouble using it to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> The springs on the other brands don&#x27;t hold their shape as well as the R.E.M. Spring.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the same R.E.M Spring I bought in early 2012.  </li>
            <li> Very bed product it is not easy to use</li>
            <li> Hair removal cream - too long it burns, not long enough didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> (thumbs moving towards each other), rolling it slowly over cheeks chin,lip, or wherever I need it with medium to light pressure....</li>
            <li> - yes, it is a little uncomfortable in certain areas, but trust me it is NOT PAINFUL!</li>
            <li> But this little amazing tool is answer to my hard black chin hairs that grow back</li>
            <li> You really need to try this little sucker out ;)</li>
            <li> Saw this on Oprah and thought, for the money, I&#x27;d give it a try not sure if it clean down the my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> so I tried it again the next day and didn&#x27;t seem as bad, really no worse than waxing and pretty much just like getting it done by the \\&quot;string lady at the mall\\</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive and light skin, you may have spots of reddening that usually takes several hours to disappear (for me at least).</li>
            <li> Smart little gadget!</li>
            <li> most times its just an odd tingling feeling (not pleasant but not too umpleasant either).  </li>
            <li> After trying every other device on the market (some expensive; some not), this little spring is, by far, the best -- works like a charm, takes half the time, and I don&#x27;t have to do it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I did not like that I was not able to control it enough to reach certain hairs</li>
            <li> Yes, this was uncomfortable at first, but I was also removing quite a bit of peach fuzz from a large area.</li>
            <li> though it is advertised that you must bend the spring, I actually just lay it flat on the piece of skin where I want to remove hair (in this case it is on the sides of my face).</li>
            <li> Before I received the REM Spring I threaded my upper lip and thought that I had removed all of the hairs but apparently not.</li>
            <li> The first time is the absolute worst, but it gets better from there.  </li>
            <li> enables getting the tough old hair out easier using this first.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit to figure out, but once you get the hang of it you can get a very clean look pretty fast--and it actually wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s funny because I came back on amazon to read the negative reviews</li>
            <li> My only concerns are how long it will last and whether they might stop making it -</li>
            <li> I find that I need to use it 2 or 3 times a week, and when you do that, you&#x27;re only picking up those hairs that are long enough to be grabbed.  </li>
            <li> only picking up those hairs that are long enough to be grabbed.  </li>
            <li> Remember, that hairs grow at different rates, and what you can&#x27;t catch today will be long enough to catch tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get impatient and start making fast long twists...</li>
            <li> I have been using different methods to remove some minor facial hair</li>
            <li> I think in part, the hairs are thick and many of them in a small area.  </li>
            <li> This does take a few tries to really figure out how to get it to work, but boy does it!</li>
            <li> but you get it over with a few quick pulls rather than the bunch of little pulls you get with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Some reviews made it seem tricky to use, but the instructions in the box seemed clear enough and it&#x27;s just down to getting used to using it, finding your technique.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies you need to try this if you&#x27;ve exhausted all other possibilities!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so it was red and a little bumpy.</li>
            <li> Removes the fine hair above my lip and those sneaky random hairs on my chin that shock me when I finally notice them in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Other than hurting a little if you&#x27;re using it for the first time</li>
            <li> At first its hard to understand how to use</li>
            <li> First, you need to figure out how to use it, but that&#x27;s not too hard.</li>
            <li> I have super thick Eastern Eureopean hair and this thing works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my initial threading, I used it again in a few days to pick up new hairs</li>
            <li> To be honest, having little pimples next to my mouth probably gives people the wrong impression, I would rather stick with the cream and save up for lazer treatments.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works and is less painful than waxing (in my opinion).  </li>
            <li> That is my main issue just the peach fuzz that was getting a little long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say that the pain is about on the level of tweezing (which I find more painful than waxing) and it&#x27;s not unbearable, but if you&#x27;re going to be using this thing on sensitive facial areas or for any prolonged amount of time you&#x27;re going to feel it</li>
            <li> as I have dark hairs this is clearly visible.</li>
            <li> It is slightly confusing when you first get it on how it is used</li>
            <li> It really hurt no more than waxing or threading.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to tweezer the one or two really stubborn hairs, but it catches a lot on my chin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also a small tool that doesn&#x27;t take much room</li>
            <li> The upper lip was far more painful.  </li>
            <li> And what it does not pull out completely of the dark hairs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have dark hair that shows up on my chin and under my jaw bone.  </li>
            <li> The irritation is minimal, I only experience redness for 15-30 minutes, whereas with waxing, 6 hours later my face would still be red.     </li>
            <li> came in a padded envelope, the package squashed flat but the product undamaged.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The hair needs to be long enough to tweeze in order for this to pick it up.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to solve both problems, but found it to remove only some long hairs.</li>
            <li> have a lot of \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot;, up to 3/8-1/2\\&quot;long, and some darker and longer hairs on my upper lip and chin/neck.</li>
            <li> I only went for the waxing/threading because that seemed one way to get rid of the long fuzz as well as</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and I just wish my mother, who shaved every day, would have lived long enough to have used this product.  </li>
            <li> It also would take too long to do all the facial hair.</li>
            <li> , I do not know how long it will last, but I will probably replace in 6 months.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> The pain doesn&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li> Make up covers them up enough until they get too long.</li>
            <li> The REM Spring also works well on the whiskers when they are long enough.  </li>
            <li> After I got the rhythm going it didn&#x27;t take long to do my entire face.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but is worth the little amount of pain involved.  </li>
            <li> have to tell you that when I first put it on my face and twirled the Spring slowly it hurt a lot.  </li>
            <li> When I wax, if I so much as touch my lip with it and rip it off I end up with a bloody lip or a nice pink spot lining my lips...</li>
            <li> At first it does hurt but with continued use it hurts less and less.  </li>
            <li> It hurts much less because there are less hairs than the first time</li>
            <li> It hurts much less because there are less hairs than the first time</li>
            <li> others I tried it completely in an upside down u-shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (she is young and does not have the OTHER hairs yet!)</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive so it does get red and a little swollen from all the removal</li>
            <li> Your upper lip of course is a little sensitive but still a breeze.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin but did not get any little red bumps.</li>
            <li> For me, it is pretty painful to use on upper lip, so I generally wax first, and then use this to catch the strays.</li>
            <li> It is painful the first time I use it especially at the area between the nose and upper lip, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> and so I really have very few hairs to pull and the pain is a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> What worked for me was to use less of a U shape sometimes almost a straight spring with only the handles turned down, twirling the handles between thumb and index finger</li>
            <li> Then the next day hardly anything and nothing really since.</li>
            <li> It takes some fiddling with, but once you get your rythm down, this little thing really works!</li>
            <li> One other thing that&#x27;s a bit of a downer is that since it takes both hands to use the spring, you can&#x27;t pull your skin taut while using it on your upper cheek areas and even though I put my hair in a ponytail prior to using, I still have those \\&quot;baby\\&quot; tendrils that won&#x27;t go back in the pony</li>
            <li> I do it every few days to catch the new stealth hairs.</li>
            <li> and I still continue to use everyday to prevent any new growth or if I missed some hairs.</li>
            <li> It is only a little painful (nothing major and very quick) but it works very well.</li>
            <li> it only catches very long hair.</li>
            <li> My first thought is to use an after-sunburn type gel on your face first to help numb the surface and ease the pain.  </li>
            <li> I like it except it is making my skin red and dry.  </li>
            <li> I started on less sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> First of all, painful, not painful?</li>
            <li> I would imagine less pain with frequent use.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line is It worked and got rid of almost all those pesky facial hairs I had in a very short amount of time with minimal pain.  </li>
            <li> i got it today and got it earlier than expected, a definite bonus.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and the redness only lasted for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I am a 28 year old, half- hispanic female with dark facial hair on my chin, upper lip and cheeks.</li>
            <li> From a certain distance people smiled or guys would look and when they got close enough to see my extra hair, they became disgusted with me or would look away.  </li>
            <li> I generally use it every other day</li>
            <li> im totally native, similar to hispanic and was aaaalways frusterated with my peach fuzz and those several dark hairs on my li.</li>
            <li> some of the other reviewers apparently are</li>
            <li> My only issue is it does sometimes break the hairs so now that my dark hair are starting to grow back in</li>
            <li> For people that have issues with bumps I would recommend steaming your face first and using a very small amount of jasmine oil.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to use on certain areas of the face where you can&#x27;t get the angle of the tool</li>
            <li> I only wish I would have ordered this a long time ago and not spent so many years with an ugly lipline.</li>
            <li> I hate the mess and bother of trying to wax or thread myself and don&#x27;t like having to go to a salon (or mall) to get it done, so this little gadget is awesome!</li>
            <li> This device works almost as good as threading and it&#x27;s less painful, but you can&#x27;t use it on your eyebrows (face only).</li>
            <li> If you have a low tolerance for pain, you might think its painful at first attempts because there are so many hairs, but after regular use, it becomes common place...</li>
            <li> I got this more expensive one as I read the other ones didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Waxing worked, but it left my face too hairless and irritated - and then the stubble came back, again not pretty.  </li>
            <li> I did have a little bit of a breakout where I had used the spring the first time and my follicles were a little sore.  </li>
            <li> For other women with my type of facial hair, I can&#x27;t urge you enough to try this product.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I noticed is that I didn&#x27;t have a sudden outbreak of white head pimples where I removed hair.</li>
            <li> I also have a mole just above my upper lip, which I have injured with other methods of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried on my entire face, but I will only continue to use it on my upper lip since it hurts less there.</li>
            <li> Have you ever been so excited at the idea of something that you fail to see any potential negatives regarding that idea?</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the hairs that grow back seem to be growing back lighter and thinner.</li>
            <li> so I have not and will not try laser due to possibility of irreparable pigment damage in such an obvious place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As years have gone by, I&#x27;ve had to wax less and less, and I have high hopes that this method will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> This product is a little swirly miracle for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with hair issues all of my life and this little spring fixed all of them.</li>
            <li> This little thing completely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Use it frequently and it may sting a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a little trouble getting a few of the thinner, shorter hairs currently, but the majority is being pulled right out!</li>
            <li> I had one of those follicle hair electricuters and it was a pain and never worked, always left little red burn marks for the next day.</li>
            <li> and I actually got a little addicted to the smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt quite a bit at first, but that is to be expected if you&#x27;ve ever had to remove hair the hard way.</li>
            <li> It is effective but slightly painful, nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s painful but you will adjust unless your that kind of person who just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However, I think that it worked well, but be sure to use a numb cream before...</li>
            <li> I use exfoliating/anti-aging products on my face that aren&#x27;t recommended to be used for a while before waxing, so on top of making the appointments, and finding a babysitter and paying for the service, waxing is really inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s kind of painful.  </li>
            <li> I want to shake the people who gave a negative review because it hurts -- really?  </li>
            <li> I wonder why so many people are unhappy with the R.E.M. spring.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was painful the first time - maybe the first couple of times - but it was doing a big job!  </li>
            <li> but I found it to be too painful and not as effective.</li>
            <li> She failed to tell me that it would  make my eyes water, my nose run and send me into a sneezing fit.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really know how to use it and the directions were confusing (the one that came with the box).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mine seem to work really well for at least six months.</li>
            <li> For me, it is about getting rid of the dark upper lip hair and the scattered coarse \\&quot;man whiskers\\</li>
            <li> I also had to make several attempts to pull the coarser dark hairs from my chin and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my chin because I have these unsightly short dark hairs that crop up every once in a while (the joys of having female hormones, yay).  </li>
            <li> No red mustache from waxng to replace the dark upper lip anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with trying to eliminate facial hair, as I cannot stand to discover that I missed a dark, coarse one after I come home and know that I was out and about like that!  </li>
            <li> Hurts but it works, I have been waxed, plucked, and spent several hundred on the no-no.</li>
            <li> did not completely  beleive that this will work yet decided to try this</li>
            <li> even laser hair removal(doesn&#x27;t work on grey hairs)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything possible and spent hundreds of dollars on trying to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about the long term effects of shaving</li>
            <li> I used this product everyday until the hair was completely gone</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like the amount of time she spent with tweezers to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me too long to get the hang of though.</li>
            <li> but it took too long in the mirror</li>
            <li> I will say - be careful while using this on your upper lip under your nose because pulling a nose hair out on accident is no joke!</li>
            <li> The process took much to long.  </li>
            <li> the smaller something is, the harder it is for me to grip.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin at all pink or red or irritated.  </li>
            <li> Initially I spent about ten minutes getting used to it</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This left my face with a rough texture, like as if I shaved it.</li>
            <li> It works for those oddly long hairs and between waxings.</li>
            <li> I even use this on my eyebrows-- though you need to be extra careful here as you could pull off hair in places where you don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> Epilady/NoNo, minus their &amp;#34;bells and whistles.&amp;#34;  And the key to &amp;</li>
            <li> The tool needs a long range of space on the skin.</li>
            <li> But I continued and as long as I could feel it pulling, I knew it was pulling out hairs.  </li>
            <li> What took so long to make something to substitute for threading??  </li>
            <li> I also had a minor break out when I used it on my jawline.</li>
            <li> And it takes so long to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> Yanks out all the tiny mustache hairs with minimal pain.  </li>
            <li> It did not take me long to get the hang of this spring.  </li>
            <li> You need to roll the ends so that the open side of the flexed spring rolls closed, thus trapping and yanking out the hair.</li>
            <li> Just roll it over your face like you would roll dough on a surface to make it long and skinny.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to shave again as long as I keep using this spring.</li>
            <li> After I was done I still had a few short thick hairs left, but I&#x27;m willing to tweeze those out if this spring thing will do the rest.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive for about 24hrs after, so maybe in a week I will do round 3.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive for about 24hrs after, so maybe in a week I will do round 3.  </li>
            <li> but I cannot use it, complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Then I remembered the R.E.M. facial hair thing that I had.&lt;br /&gt;I found it again and spent just a couple of minutes working on how to use it.</li>
            <li> This product worked as advertised, and I expected the discomfort with the initial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Maybe that was the problem, but I don&#x27;t want to wait for the hair to get long</li>
            <li> the hairs don&#x27;t have to be all that long to be removed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and still have a long way to go.</li>
            <li> It beats standing at the mirror using tweezers for a long time, and is cheaper than waxing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of tweezers, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t know how to thread or find threading irritating, you might find this product useful.</li>
            <li> Then I place a thin layer of aloe vera gel on the upper lip to calm down the skin and prevent possible infection.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to really get it down - there&#x27;s definitely a technique to it -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely NOT painless, tears were rolling down my cheeks when I did my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I dated due to the fact that my upper lip and chin might scare him away because of those pesky little tiny coarse facial hair!</li>
            <li> I have used hair removal creams in the past and have burned my face even when I left it on for half the suggested time, so this is much safer.  </li>
            <li> This item is very painful to use, and it didn&#x27;t do a great job of removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> do a daily over-all, takes 5 minutes, MAYBE, bonus; there seems to be a lot less hair growing back!</li>
            <li> I am giving it 3 stars because my upper lip hair came back within less then a week.</li>
            <li> But I have pretty sensitive skin, and waxing makes me break out, or even worse, gives me raw red patches on my face for days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a half African half Puerto Rican 26 year old with PCOS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very affordable little tool, and comes with a little sleeve.</li>
            <li> For the price of only 1 waxing this little gem will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I usually get bumps with the epilator I used to use, it was time for a change.</li>
            <li> (duh, it&#x27;s a spring) and doesn&#x27;t really allow for a firm enough grip for the user nor is it stable enough to roll over and grip the hair and pull it out from the root.</li>
            <li> Yes, your pores will be closed which theoretically makes pulling the hair out harder, but I have found cold works much better than heat with this method.</li>
            <li> My main complaint about it is that the instructions were not clear on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I just start at one end and roll it to the other in the opposite direction that the hairs are growing.   </li>
            <li> It will remove these, but since I am still learning I usually need several passes to get them all and do occasionally resort to the tweezers for some final touch up.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 4 stars due to the learning curve on how to use it, and I still occasionally must resort to the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d found this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the troubles other users had with getting it to grip hairs properly.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to wait for those tiny hairs to grow in awhile like some other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plucking and waxing on the upper lip area before this, and have done laser on other areas of my body.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I wait till those few get long enough then I will try the spring and see if it gets them out without my having to go back and tweeze.  </li>
            <li> but you just keep trying different ways (based on the other reviews) and it does get the hair.</li>
            <li> only planning on making a lifelong committment to the man I&#x27;m marrying!  </li>
            <li> It should be a little bigger and maybe made with a different material</li>
            <li> Other reviewers noted that you have to get the knack of twisting the handles and also the preferred curve of the wand, which I totally agree with.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long I tweezed the hair under my chin and on it!</li>
            <li> I just rolled it in different directions and it quietly pulled out those little boogers.  </li>
            <li> I opened it up on my way to work and was excited to try it out.. seems weird..</li>
            <li> and I always preferred threading over other methods of facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> I imagine you could do your legs and other areas if you were stuck on a desert island, but it&#x27;s meant for smaller patches of skin.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 tweezer-type facial epilators and neither one would really do much due to the hair being so fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is an inexpensive, efficient way to go.&lt;br /&gt;Later--the little pouch it comes with left a blue stain on the damp counter.  </li>
            <li> Put it on my face in the U shape and started twisting the ends each going the opposite way of the other.</li>
            <li> , the $90 Emjoi Emagine epilator (don&#x27;t even think about that) and trying &amp; looking for other methods, I finally found the one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is all to give a little background to the sad story of REM and their latest merchandising play.</li>
            <li> &amp; I just noticed the other day that the &amp;#34;facial fuzz&amp;#34; is coming back</li>
            <li> &amp;Ive struggled with facial hair since I could remember &amp; its been so hard &amp; sensitive area for me.</li>
            <li> The hard part is catching hairs that are in weird directions.</li>
            <li> This is not very realistic to use if you don&#x27;t have the time and patience.</li>
            <li> I tweezed and fretted for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Even when I bleached it, the hairs were still noticable and the bleach job never lasted very long.  </li>
            <li> and I would still have about a week of bad growth before I would be able to make it back to the salon.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because it actually DOES work, but it is probably the most painful thing I have ever used for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to clean the hairs out of the inside of the spring.   </li>
            <li> Then washed my face and let in dry.  </li>
            <li> Cheapest and most efficient way of removing hair without any side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;Bit painful initially.</li>
            <li> If you are getting frustrated that you can&#x27;t get all the hairs, make sure that you are moving the spring in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> It fascinates me that some people care enough to go to such trouble.)  </li>
            <li> It will have trouble picking the tiny hairs though, not that it&#x27;s a  problem since they are so tiny no one can see them.</li>
            <li> I used it on my upper lip but could only get in a few yanks at a time before my eyes watered, my nose ran, and I had to stop.</li>
            <li> Took only a few minutes, but I had had enough for that go around....</li>
            <li> Took only a few minutes, but I had had enough for that go around....</li>
            <li> But after trying the same patch I only got a few hairs plucked out with a Norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li> Yes it pinches purchasing its better than harsh creams and expensive salon waxes.</li>
            <li> What this means is that I&#x27;m only going to write something if I absolutely hated the product or I absolutely loved the product.  </li>
            <li> , it takes a few tries to develop a method that works for you, but you know when you have it right -- and other reviews/tapes offer suggestions, but for me it was just trial and error for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is no more painful than using tweezers, and it&#x27;s far more efficient because it pulls out multiple hairs, instead of just one at a time.    </li>
            <li> It hurts a bit but grabs every single hair.  </li>
            <li> This one was offered as a single</li>
            <li> it has to date succeeded in removing a single hair and that was probably a mistake by the item.</li>
            <li> It takes off EVERY SINGLE HAIR.</li>
            <li> It bugged me every single day</li>
            <li> Have not used it for a single time.</li>
            <li> Keep it mind that sometimes it does not get every single hair-</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of tweezing your chin or upper lip, pony up the cash, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> as to the result -- it does tend to break off the fuzz since that hair is not strong enough to be pulled out (the emjoi does the same thing).  </li>
            <li> but since I used the hair remover cream less than a week ago I don&#x27;t think it was long enough to pull out.  </li>
            <li> Most unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It is just that we ladies are usually going after the hairs that others can see so clearly, and we can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this thing, especially since it only cost $13 and was simplistic in nature.</li>
            <li> I am a Latina with dark facial hair ESP on my cheeks, jaw area.</li>
            <li> I could afford only for those dark hairs, and that gave me bumps but no pimples.  </li>
            <li> but Im sitting in a dark living room watching tv with my teen..</li>
            <li> I have dark coarse chin and neck hair.  </li>
            <li> It removed my dark facial hair quite well, and in fact I could maneuver it around to catch hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I just have sensitive skin because I know this does not hurt for some people, but it still hurts for me.  </li>
            <li> Unlike wax strips, depilatories, or the hand-held hair removal devices, this does not leave a dark shadow along the hair line.</li>
            <li> after that there is minimal pain as long as I keep it up</li>
            <li> I have some dark hairs and also a lot of peach fuzz usually as my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; and this completely takes care of that in an instant!</li>
            <li> This takes way too long to do,and the results are minimal.</li>
            <li> For less than what I&#x27;d spend on a jar of hot wax, I&#x27;ve got a hair remover  that works just as well if not better!      </li>
            <li> In fact, the first time I used it I was a little overzealous, pressed too hard and gave myself some temporary bumps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard at first to get it to work</li>
            <li> so I started just keeping it in the box instead of loose or in the &#x27;pouch/sleeve&#x27; that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is learning how to use it efficiently.</li>
            <li> The key is to maintain the upside down U shape and twist the handles as you move against the hair&#x27;s direction of growth.</li>
            <li> just experimented, moved the spring back and forth, up down while twisting the ends, and *bravo.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> However, when you move to your chin, where you don&#x27;t have as hard a surface as teeth underneath, to tense your skin against, it becomes more laborious, and time consuming, producing little results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange to rate this 4-stars which Amazon equates to &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; because I certainly do not like the pain it inflicts on me.</li>
            <li> but if you just grit your teeth and keep at it, you get a little mini endorphin rush and long lasting results too.</li>
            <li> Who knew that this little strange looking tool would actually work!</li>
            <li> Had lots of very fine upper lip hair that was so difficult to remove... not anymore!!</li>
            <li> The learning curve really is relatively small, especially if you play at it, and the discomfort is minimal and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> The middle usually does hurt a little more, so I typically go up to where my upper lips &amp;#34;points&amp;#34; are, and then Ill start at the other outer st-ache corner area on the opposite side of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I just started experimenting with it on the skin above my upper lip and with very little trial and error</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem complicated, but I was trying to be thorough; the process takes me very little time, and I can do it during any moment of leisure in which my hands are free!  </li>
            <li> It may seem complicated, but I was trying to be thorough; the process takes me very little time, and I can do it during any moment of leisure in which my hands are free!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hairs along my upper lip and using tweezers is nearly impossible for hair removal.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it can be painful the first time you use it, but it&#x27;s so much simpler than taking out a tweezer and plucking one hair at a time</li>
            <li> I only had a slight redness, and it went away within minutes.</li>
            <li> (The package suggests that regular maintainace will take much less time going forward).</li>
            <li> Plucking is just not realistic.  </li>
            <li> I waited a few days for them to grow long enough to grip again, and tried once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I think if I use it regularly it will hurt much less, because there will be fewer hairs to pull.  </li>
            <li> I followed the first reviewer&#x27;s advise and twisted the ends in opposite directions...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I tried it, I thought i was following directions as I twisted the rods towards me and rolled along my chin.</li>
            <li> and it looks like I still get only about half of the hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nair for the face, but it still only gets about half the hair and sits on the skin for 10 minutes, which is quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyes watered a bit, but it was about the same as plucking and less than waxing pain-wise.  </li>
            <li> Products like Nair dried my skin, didn&#x27;t get all the hairs and the results didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I felt it grab the longer hair, but overall it pulled out less than 10% of it.</li>
            <li> Using it on my upper lip is less painless than waxing.</li>
            <li> In fact, sometimes I&#x27;m not sure if it only removes facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive delicate skin</li>
            <li> My skin is dark and although my vellus hairs are very long due to the PCOS, they&#x27;re only visible up close.</li>
            <li> The only trouble I have had with it is that it does not always pluck the coarse, dark hairs.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be much less painful and actually kind of like doing it now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and only painful around the lip.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t necessarily have to bend the spring into a tight U shape as shown in the pictures</li>
            <li> I tapped the device hard to remove any loose hair and put it in the soft case it came with.</li>
            <li> I tapped the device hard to remove any loose hair and put it in the soft case it came with.</li>
            <li> I actually think its way less painful than tweezing and waxing, which makes this even better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I found it less painful and more thorough than tweezing.</li>
            <li> My skin was red for a few minutes after use, but it was honestly red for less time than after plucking or waxing.  </li>
            <li> It is actually a little addictive.  </li>
            <li> Well, I let the hairs grow back a little, and I tried this product again.</li>
            <li> little to no irritation, and it&#x27;s totally portable.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice, but works like nothing else to remove the tiniest facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> This little spring is well made and solid.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I see women walking around with little blonde beards</li>
            <li> The little hairs from my upper lip, lower lip, and chin are gone.</li>
            <li> Ignore the twitching of your left eye and grounding of your feet on the carpet, and keep twirling the little torture device along your chiny-chin-chin.</li>
            <li> This little spring is such a savior.</li>
            <li> It definitely smarts a little.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little but hair removal at the root does, waxing and tweezing are no different.</li>
            <li> Then settled on various chemical removers or when in a hurry, one of those little battery powered hair removers/shavers.  </li>
            <li> It gives very tiny little bumps, but they disappear in a day or so.</li>
            <li> (it did hurt a little when I used it above my lip but did the job</li>
            <li> I can only stand to do a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Then I did the little electric trimmer after the laser treatment sort of made the hair finer (for a short period).  </li>
            <li> I experience a little redness similar to when you pluck you eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This gets all the short little hairs.  </li>
            <li> and it might make the skin a little red because you just yanked out a bunch of hair.  </li>
            <li> You bend it and then roll the little end pieces back and forth.  </li>
            <li> The hair stays away for weeks!!There is little irritation but that goes away shortly after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably different for everyone, depending on shape of face, direction of hair growth, etc., but with a little practice you&#x27;ll find what works for you.</li>
            <li> For me, it even gets tiny little hairs.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week to get all the little hairs, since hair grows at different levels</li>
            <li> It only stings a little when using it.</li>
            <li> It does get all the little white, peach-fuzz hairs off your face and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m presentable again.  </li>
            <li> Stings a little for a split second</li>
            <li> last little hair\\&quot; with tweezers, along with an infected hair follicle.</li>
            <li> I ended up doing a little icing of my face prior.</li>
            <li> , little white hairs are gone.  </li>
            <li> It pinches a little, but it actually works!!  </li>
            <li> Neat little contraption for facial hair removal!  </li>
            <li> I did end up with little red bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of reviews that it was hard to figure out how to use, as far as twisting technique and bending.</li>
            <li> : You need to be able to tense your skin (stretch it tight, distorting your face) tightly against a hard surface to achieve results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more painful on my upper lip, but I just sit on the couch and do a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read stated that the instructions were a little vague, but I was able to figure it out with a few passes.</li>
            <li> Slowly, agonizingly this little spring will rip those hairs from your sensitive upper lip as you twirl it between your fingers.</li>
            <li> have a lot of facial hair (no thanks to my dad!!!)</li>
            <li> This is actually more painful than waxing, threading, or tweezing since it takes longer to pull out the hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it any more painful than plucking your eyebrows, probably</li>
            <li> even making sure I used as directed it found it painful and too time consuming.</li>
            <li> It is slightly painful, but it is better than plucking hairs one at a time.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product even reading all the reviews noting how painful this can be.&lt;br /&gt;The more hair</li>
            <li> It nips a bit in the beginning, but I was expecting this to be more painful than waxing, which it is not.</li>
            <li> I think waxing is more painful.</li>
            <li> Sure, it was painful, but all hair removal is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that it works but more painful than expected.</li>
            <li> It clears lots of hairs away fast, but they come back thicker and darker which means it is not pulling the roots out - only cutting the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also much rather spend $13 to replace a tool that works, rather than $20-$60 on a machine that might fail for various reasons.  </li>
            <li> plucking becomes a long process as the spring only covers small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s not worth it, especially if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> took it out of the box and got to work on my upper lip, which I have been bleaching lately (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have always gone back and forth between bleaching and waxing).  </li>
            <li> I love it because if there&#x27;s a random couple of suckers on my upperlip before I have to head out somewhere</li>
            <li> I even spent about $70 at Sallys buying a wax warmer and</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a few short hairs but got everything else...</li>
            <li> I would have to sleep with Neosporin on my upper lip after using the cream since it was so harsh.</li>
            <li> I use mine every few days so that the hairs are still short</li>
            <li> I am finding it easier to use than I expected.</li>
            <li> Because if I had to deal with my kids coming in the bathroom to see \\&quot;what mom&#x27;s doing\\&quot;, I&#x27;d probably go mental.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> I have PCOS and because of the hormonal imbalance, I get hair on my chin and a few on my jaw line, neckline and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> but because I&#x27;d spent some time on youtube researching I already felt that I had a handle on it.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be harder to get the hang of than it was.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kinda fun playing with this silly thing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not ready to step up to the type of price.  </li>
            <li> I only have a few errant hairs on my chin, so I was done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten bunch of hair in a wide crescent before.     </li>
            <li> You only need to grab a few hairs.</li>
            <li> am not very hairy</li>
            <li> Removes all but a few tiny hairs, which can be tweezed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to figure out how it worked because I watched a few YouTube videos on how to use it; it&#x27;s fairly simple.   </li>
            <li> I should have spent my money on another tweezers.</li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t planning on doing anything about it because I didn&#x27;t want to make a lifelong committment to whole-face hair removal-</li>
            <li> My skin was a bit red afterward, but the irritation was gone after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A few times, I had to \\&quot;untwist\\&quot; the spring by turning the ends in the  opposite direction to \\&quot;let go\\&quot; of the hair, because I didn&#x27;t feel as though I could take the pain!  </li>
            <li> It is def NOT precise enough to do eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that there are a few hairs that grow in somewhat different directions from the others.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that there are a few hairs that grow in somewhat different directions from the others.  </li>
            <li> am giving 4 start because the packing was open and pouch was missing</li>
            <li> Thank you REM, you&#x27;ve just recruited a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> I like the way it leaves the tiny hairs behind and only grabs the bigger ones</li>
            <li> If I feel a few hairs on my upper lip or chin...</li>
            <li> I also watched a video on you tube because I did not really understand the written directions</li>
            <li> and it took only a few minutes to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> (not much curving at all) in an upward motion.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but for $13 I thought it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> i expected it however i thought it was one of those things like waxing where you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> then I work toward the center.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so irritated, It looked like I had broken out in hives, really.  </li>
            <li> I used aloe, wet wash cloths, nothing helped.  </li>
            <li> The spring does hurt for a few seconds after, especially the skin just under your nose.</li>
            <li> Much harder for me to use than expected.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with hair removal from my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get those tiny, tiny thin hairs, but overall, does the job.  </li>
            <li> that may be because i have already spent years waxing and tweezing these areas, so</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and will never go back to waxes or creams.</li>
            <li> They were all messy and had various drawbacks.  </li>
            <li> My only trouble was when I attempted to do my chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than waxing at the salon and only takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> so I got curious.</li>
            <li> for pain--yes, it does hurt if I&#x27;ve left the mini-moustache to grow for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say but</li>
            <li> Pain is minimal, and I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove the few facial hairs that seem to plague me (around 1-3 every 2</li>
            <li> There were a few very short stragglers that I grabbed with my tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Well, not really,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is relatively unknown.</li>
            <li> Pain is to be expected.</li>
            <li> After trying to use it over and over, she never really got the hang of how to use it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve discovered that if I use it every day there really IS no pain.  </li>
            <li> The shaving had to be done everyday &amp; even then it didn&#x27;t get close enough for me......</li>
            <li> I found this tool harder to use then I thought it to be after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> my  fifteen bucks well spent.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know the whole science behind it</li>
            <li> there were a few stragglers after I was finished, but I just plucked those out- no big deal After all that</li>
            <li> When I did get around to a second round...</li>
            <li> When I did get around to a second round...</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> As I should have expected, it just rips out the hair.</li>
            <li> Truly this product works as expected.</li>
            <li> Oh and it  removed only a few hairs.</li>
            <li> A few days ago I went a searching on Amazon for something to help with facial hair removal and came up with this product.  </li>
            <li> Mastering the technique takes several uses, I&#x27;m still working on it and have to shave a few areas of my face that I can&#x27;t do the rolling motion on.  </li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money</li>
            <li> A few years ago I started growing blond hairs above my lips.</li>
            <li> so I threw the spring in the trash after a couple of tries.</li>
            <li> I do have trouble getting it to catch onto really short hair but all in all</li>
            <li> few days later I tried this on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Does not really hurt either.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but figured it was worth a $20 gamble.</li>
            <li> I also got the cheaper one they sell with the pink on the two ends.  </li>
            <li> Shipped on time and product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Since I was kind of afraid of the pain, I was slow in my movements and GUHHH it made my eyes water</li>
            <li> Then he was more appalled and actually discovered the backwards twirl to release hair.</li>
            <li> I have spent years waxing, threading, plucking, and using creams to remove my ladystache but every few days the hairs come back!</li>
            <li> The cost of the spring pays for itself very quickly in not having to pay for salon services or creams that are toxic and not good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Getting used to the motion to utilize the device takes a little dexterity but is pretty basic all in all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, it takes a little figuring out and the first use or two can be pretty painful.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this one originally and bought other less expensive ones like Bebe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar to threading (I get my brows threaded) but for some reason threading on my face doesn&#x27;t work as well, so I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely hurts, I mean, obviously-</li>
            <li> Left the areas where I removed hair a little bit red, but with way less irritation and mess than waxing would have.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get it to actually work, twisting this way and that, reading other reviews and trying their recommended techniques, etc.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple...</li>
            <li> If I use it for half a minute or so every day, my face remains perpetually mustache-free.</li>
            <li> No more time wasted with tweezing and no messy waxes or creams!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re talking about ripping hair out of your skin and your face (at least for me) no less.</li>
            <li> But the reason I&#x27;m giving the product so few stars isn&#x27;t only due to that.</li>
            <li> This product is a little painful at first but wouldn&#x27;t mind that so much if it pulled out the hair instead of breaking it off.</li>
            <li> That problem is long behind me thanks to this little device!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My upper lip is slightly tender (emphasis on &#x27;slightly&#x27;).</li>
            <li> I usually wax my upper lip, but then i camt go out of thebhouse for a few hours because my lips is all red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a little while to figure out how to use it, and in the process my fingers got pretty tired.</li>
            <li> Other areas it does not really hurt at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really painful, but irritating and if you have a lot of peach fuzz, it&#x27;s hard to get it all at one time.  </li>
            <li> The spring never catches my skin as long as it&#x27;s pulled tight (I just stick my tongue under the area I&#x27;m rolling over and push out).&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Hands down, this little gadget is the facial hair winner!!</li>
            <li> This results in a much less painful experience, in fact, I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the feeling because I know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This results in a much less painful experience, in fact, I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the feeling because I know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I usually hold a cold bottle of water on the areas to soothe and that works magic.  </li>
            <li> The key is first to numb the area with an ice cube.</li>
            <li> I had been using Nair for the face and was not wanting to use such harsh chemicals and it was also making my skin dry and flaky in a few spots when I&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li> for now at least it gets results; I am still pretty slow at this</li>
            <li> As if that wasn&#x27;t enough of a problem, this thing can&#x27;t grab the big hairs, only the little thin ones.  </li>
            <li> It only took me a few minutes to get it down pat and now works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> With waxing, you have to let your hairs grow a little too long before you can wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I made that (dumb) mistake and had to order a new one for myself.</li>
            <li> So easy, less painful, less time, and removes multiple hair w/one twist!</li>
            <li> It not only took care of the thick hairs (roots and all), it picked up my long peach fuzz as well!</li>
            <li> That problem is long behind me thanks to this little device!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for the upper lip, chin, and jawline to get those fine hairs that were impossible for me to tweeze before (and waxing left me with nasty red bumps for days).</li>
            <li> If you keep up with it and not allow too many days between, it is much less painful.  </li>
            <li> It was much less painful on my chin as I have plucked that area for many years and it was not an issue.    </li>
            <li> Way more thoroughly, quicker, and less painfully than this spring.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a way that makes it any less painful.</li>
            <li> It grabs all my thick black hairs from the root and makes my face soft as can be.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers said, it does feel uncomfortable the first time you use it</li>
            <li> and then when that became to cumbersome to keep up with every other day, I invested in an epilator.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve regularly gotten it waxed or threaded.</li>
            <li> I had used various cream hair removal products in the past, they worked, however they tended to leave my skin feeling \\&quot;odd\\&quot; and I would often have reddish blotches for a while after their use.  </li>
            <li> I use to was with homemade sugar and lemon wax, but it would usually leave me with red spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t dare try in on any other part of my face) and resulted in ingrown hairs (bumps) as well as sore skin; plus, I didn&#x27;t always removed hair from the root.  </li>
            <li> I was still skeptical but it really works!  </li>
            <li> The price is extremely affordable, especially for a product that you can use everyday and all the time!</li>
            <li> Not pretty.  </li>
            <li> Not pretty -</li>
            <li> I ordered this upon reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> (this was due to a lack of coordination rather than a science-based determination to experiment).</li>
            <li> Try this before any other hair removal treatments.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have to be in a sharp U shape like in the picture.</li>
            <li> face was a little red, and a little blood, but it cleared up within 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands including the Bellabe</li>
            <li> I have read what other people said about turning \\&quot;both hands in, then both hands</li>
            <li> I have read what other people said about turning \\&quot;both hands in, then both hands</li>
            <li> You get used to it on other parts of your face, over the lip always hurts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I read about this in a review of some other product on Facebook.  </li>
            <li> I finish, I usually stretch the spring and let it snap back to get the excess hair out</li>
            <li> It seemed so difficult at first</li>
            <li> the other springs I tried did not</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get it to work on any other part of my face.</li>
            <li> The R.E.M. spring can be an extremely valuable grooming tool if you let it.t sometimes appear after depilatory treatments.  </li>
            <li> The R.E.M. spring can be an extremely valuable grooming tool if you let it.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says but as other have mentioned it does hurt.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this little tool to anyone wanting to get rid of those little unwanted face fuzzies.</li>
            <li> Have used other brands</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical of buying this apparatus.</li>
            <li> This could be due to the fact I always use Moisturizer both for cleaning and tinted for makeup use.</li>
            <li> Re: REM Spring Facial Hair Remover,--Have not used this product excessively yet, but agree with viewers who said It hurt from the aspect of the pinching sensation.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews and kept on looking.  </li>
            <li> One other thing to note, though.  </li>
            <li> Forget about waxing or other stuff.</li>
            <li> tried it on other parts of my face</li>
            <li> I had been visiting the salon every 2 weeks for the past several years just to get my moustache waxed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see waxing or using any other hair removal product again.</li>
            <li> no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, prickly feel, stray hairs that only seem to show when you&#x27;re in the car.</li>
            <li> No Pro thing.... very expensive and didn&#x27;t sound like something I&#x27;d like to use.</li>
            <li> :) For anyone who is struggling to get a hang of how to use it, watch this video: [...]</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands on amazon and trust me</li>
            <li> I would like to see other people sending in pictures of themselves doing this and smiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You literally just have to bend (like the picture shows) and twist one side then the other.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend mentioned the difference after I used it along with friends and other family members.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have yet to try it on some other areas.</li>
            <li> I should give it five stars, but I can&#x27;t love something that hurts :(</li>
            <li> I have tried everything in the past from smelly chemicals, bleaching, waxing, threading, etc, and nothing seems to work entirely.</li>
            <li> also took advice I read in some other comments -</li>
            <li> Be careful and wash your face before using and then use an astringent after because you do not want to break out!</li>
            <li> for the lip area, I find that an inexpensive eyebrow razor works extremely well over this</li>
            <li> and the people who said it made them break out - think of it like this:  you are pulling hairs out and leaving a small hole, which is a potential space for dirt and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> I had to do a small patch and then come back and try again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use this every other day if not every day.</li>
            <li> I have gotten my upper lip threaded in the past, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to continue doing it.</li>
            <li> There is minimal redness!</li>
            <li> I was not able to spend $50-100 on something to remove facial hair, so this item was just what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Use every other day so you don&#x27;t get a build up of a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me or the hairs are too short</li>
            <li> There are cheaper versions of this out there, I am not sure how similar they are</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little make the skin dry and time consuming</li>
            <li> It does look a little dry though</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble using it like other people described, you just hold it up to your face and it starts ripping out all the tiny little hairs, so be careful!  </li>
            <li> and it was a little more painful but not</li>
            <li> It turned a little red but went away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have peach fuzz and a little mustache plus a few stray coarse hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> It pulls every single little hair from the root.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t standing in front of the mirror trying to get every single little hair with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> As instructed, you have to be very careful around the eyebrows, but I found that I can shape the spring over my brow and work up and away.  </li>
            <li> Just be very careful if you decide to use the R.E.M around your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (thankfully there are only a very few of them).</li>
            <li> but the handle became a little loose.</li>
            <li> so needless to say my battle against my facial hair started early.</li>
            <li> This implement appears to be the same as the tweezing I started doing when I was in my teens and all I got from doing that was MUCH WORSE facial</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually mind having fuzz on my jaw line, but since it&#x27;s dark, I usually bleach.  </li>
            <li> However, the trouble came a few days later when I started breaking out.</li>
            <li> But a low cost semi painful experience is so worth the result of smooth(yes</li>
            <li> As a Latina, I have mad side burns/facial hair, and this baby plucked the hairs right out!</li>
            <li> All the other ones the coil became loose and wouldn&#x27;t grip the hairs after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was very painful on my upper lip as I have not plucked that area, although I have shaved it for many years.  </li>
            <li> Took me less than 2 minutes to do my upper lip, and there was very little redness, and no swelling, after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but no more than having it waxed and much less than tweezing individually.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the R.E.M. any day over waxing- no red face, very little pain and no sticky mess.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would make is that my hands get tired and that it sometimes can&#x27;t pick up the tiny, tiny hairs that are shorter than peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little painful at first, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li> You just have to turn the ends away from each other while moving the upside down \\&quot;U\\&quot; against the grain of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> When I run it over my lips to help numb; I hold the spring horizontal and then really quickly roll it down &amp; out(away from you).  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as badly as others have said, maybe because my hairs are really fine.</li>
            <li> Over the upper lip does hurt a bit, but I suppose I am desensitized to the pain due to all the years of plucking the suckers out.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s maybe a bit more painful than waxing, it&#x27;s a million times less messy, and you don&#x27;t end up picking bits of wax off your face for an hour.</li>
            <li> (i.e. not right before a job interview, reunion, photo session).  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to reach a certain length before using, you can use it every day to get the random hairs that have grown.</li>
            <li> The first use hurts like crazy as there are so many hairs to be pulled but from then on it is much less painful.</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin got a little pink.</li>
            <li> (you can also use it bent just a little into a wide rounded U shape).&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but not much IMO.</li>
            <li> I think it can be a little harder to cause pain to yourself.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that the handle is too small and its a little difficult to clean the hair off from the device.</li>
            <li> and I did have to use a tweezer on some stray hairs, but it was much less than waxing or any other method I&#x27;ve used to remove hair.</li>
            <li> The reason this has three stars is because the hairs that are being pulled are getting stuck in the middle, which is hard to remove inside the coil.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t hard at all, simply bend the spring in a U shape and you can blow out the hairs that you see lodged inside</li>
            <li> the only problem is it is hard to remove hair which grow in defferent direction</li>
            <li> but I thought this would help me avoid the contortions that I have to do in front of my bathroom mirror; hard to tweeze something you can&#x27;t see, when your head is pointed the opposite direction!  </li>
            <li> If you notice some red bumps, scrub your face - a little exfoliation usually works for me.</li>
            <li> It does hurt but no more than tweezing and my skin is red for a little bit</li>
            <li> The first time took the longest and was slightly uncomfortable, rather like little stings when the hairs are extracted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried waxing and hair removal creams and because my hair is so dark and thick, neither method really works without serious side effects (like chemical burns).  </li>
            <li> And I am a big baby who can hardly handle a flu shot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone seems to be having such a hard time figuring out how to use it with the instructions it comes with.  </li>
            <li> It is a little uncomfortable the first time you use it</li>
            <li> Hard to maneuver initially, but once you get the hang of it...piece of cake!</li>
            <li> I found that if I rolled the spring quickly over the area, it was far less painful than doing it slowly.  </li>
            <li> This product is effective, but has not become any less painful to use!</li>
            <li> There is a little minor pain, less than tweezing and a little redness.</li>
            <li> I have a small amount of very dark upper lip hair.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I find it doesn&#x27;t rip the hairs out from the root on my chin like it does elsewhere on my face.</li>
            <li> I was ready to chalk this up to another failed device.</li>
            <li> Not worth the pain and time.</li>
            <li> : It just hurt too much, at least waxing it only takes</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not worth my time, effort and suffering.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This item is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the least painful way for me to remove facial hair, but I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s pain free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all that dark</li>
            <li> At first, until you get the hang of it, you will likely tell yourself that it&#x27;s just too painful and decide to never use it again.  </li>
            <li> But not sure about long term effect.</li>
            <li> oh I&#x27;ll just tweeze those stray dark hairs away.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not worth what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly more painful than threading but not much more.</li>
            <li> I did not get any bumps (at least not yet) and did not get red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not especially adept with these kinds of instruments, so if I can use it, just about anyone can.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li> It look me a few tries to get it to work, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> and I have extremely thick dark facial hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a few seconds to figure it out, and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t seem like I could get it to work... but just give it a few tries</li>
            <li> It took a few tries</li>
            <li> As a result I had the worst breakout of acne and pimples which took a good month to resolve.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of using it, but you&#x27;ll know it when you do</li>
            <li> Some tweezing will be required for the occasional thick hair and strays.  </li>
            <li> I had developed a darkening at the mustache area and after researching it found it could be do to irritating hair removal products.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a little painful, especially when removing hair along the upper lip and along the sides of the mouth but thus far, no ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> But I think that other reviewers are right--it will hurt less over time as you have to pull less hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly forgetting to pluck and never having enough time since I have at least 30 thick black hairs on my chin/neck.  </li>
            <li> No more painful than threading, and if I stay on top of it, remove about every two weeks, then it&#x27;s less of a sting.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The second time was less painful than the first, which was encouraging.</li>
            <li> does kind of \\&quot;smart\\&quot;, but i wouldn&#x27;t consider it very painful.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to get the hang of using it, but it was relatively easy and was not as painful as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> i am typical south indian girl with thick facial hair....</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and it stated to hold the spring in an upside down &#x60;U&#x27; shape and push in and outward.</li>
            <li> Once I slowed down, the hairs were pulling out at the root.  </li>
            <li> once you get the motion down.  </li>
            <li> If someone could take down that picture, it is misleading.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to figure out, you have to twist it as you move it up and down - there is a video on YouTube that demonstrates it.  </li>
            <li> I would always try to keep my hair down to cover the sides of my face.  </li>
            <li> I still have to grab the tweezers for a stray beard hair here and there, but this thing has cut my tweeze time down 98%.</li>
            <li> I recommend watching some of the videos (youtube, etc) to get the technique(s) down that work for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hands down, it works.</li>
            <li> Tears are rolling down my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Once you get it down you can do this while watching TV and when it stops plucking your done.</li>
            <li> but she said it hurts when it goes ups and down.</li>
            <li> But then you might reconsider because you don&#x27;t want to be a wimp or because you don&#x27;t want to throw your money down the drain.  </li>
            <li> In about 2 months, I&#x27;ll probably be down to no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break it down in points, because, well, my thoughts happen like this in my head, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it down...</li>
            <li> I recommend this to other ladies with peach fuzz-lip!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this little gadget takes care of it.  </li>
            <li> And for heaven’s sake, don’t try this on any other part of your body!  </li>
            <li> Yes it hurts a little, but I think not as much as other methods.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said you can do this while watching tv!</li>
            <li> I used to go for threading every other week which costs a lot!</li>
            <li> will recommend this to other ladies in my life!</li>
            <li> I still use tweezers for my eyebrows, but those other areas are treated with the Spring!  </li>
            <li> The coils are tight wound and picks up hair strands in the exact same manner as threading does,too bad it can&#x27;t do eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It was a little painful around the lip area the first time I used it, but after that it only felt like a tingle.  </li>
            <li> ,maybe it depends on how tightly you twist the spring or maybe it just wasnt thick enough to grab?</li>
            <li> It certainly works to rip out your facial hair without chemicals, but it is painful and does take a lot of coordination, what with the twirling and moving.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is it was slightly painful at first till I learned to firm my lip before pulling out my lip hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a little unpleasant to pull the hairs out, but not painful.</li>
            <li> AND I can see the little ends that show they were really pulled out and not just broken at the skin!  </li>
            <li> AND I can see the little ends that show they were really pulled out and not just broken at the skin!  </li>
            <li> If you are someone like me who has been dealing with the problem of unpleasant facial hair I would highly recommend getting yourself one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fine/light that under artificial light, I can hardly see it and</li>
            <li> first round i end up using it my whole face; very painful.</li>
            <li> I did get a few little whiteheads afterwards, which has happened to me after an eyebrow wax in the past, so the next time I used it I wiped with toner afterward and applied a little Pro-Activ just to kill any bacteria that would cause this</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I have to have a half an hour session just getting rid of those hairs.</li>
            <li> so someone less hairy might not have to use it ever day, but if you have to, this is the tool to do it.</li>
            <li> but it hurts less than waxing.  </li>
            <li> Less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> and it hurts less</li>
            <li> i just got this about half an hr ago- cleaned my face</li>
            <li> it hurt less (probably bc i wasn&#x27;t paying attention)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t hurt very much, less</li>
            <li> even less so because plucking makes me sneeze</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37, like many women I have horrible facial hair,</li>
            <li> I think with practice this will become less commmon.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> , U KNOW EACH TIME HURTS LESS</li>
            <li> (I also feel it hurts less when they&#x27;re shorter).  </li>
            <li> UPS delivered it less than an hour ago</li>
            <li> And much less time consuming than plucking.    </li>
            <li> but I have skipped a day-you MIT need to use it less if your growth is slower.</li>
            <li> The results are not as drastic as waxing or using a depilatory cream but for way less hassle</li>
            <li> This is involves a lot less pain than waxing and takes less time than tweezing.</li>
            <li> no more burned skin as well as no more problems with facial hair</li>
            <li> I find there is less pain/tingling from this tool than there is with waxing or lip-sugaring.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less time consuming than plucking.</li>
            <li> but I had read that in a previous review</li>
            <li> but this happens less and less because there&#x27;s less and less regrowth with each use</li>
            <li> &quot; I ordered this name-brand spring vs the one at half the cost and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However - I&#x27;d like to make one slight correction to the manufacturer&#x27;s description of the experience of using this product:  </li>
            <li> downside to this device is that since it is slower than an epilator, it&#x27;s more painful (at least to me anyway)</li>
            <li> As you use it your face gets used to it and it hurts less and less.</li>
            <li> Not only was this difficult for me to use, but I had red patches all over my skin and had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> IT HURTS LESS TO JUST WAX IT OFF, OR</li>
            <li> way less than plucking</li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> which is odd based on the &#x27;painless&#x27; reviews i read, posted by some users.  </li>
            <li> but it was slightly defective</li>
            <li> I got the R.E.M. Spring (Spring) and learned how to use it in less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> I found it hurts less in the evening....</li>
            <li> anyway, the second round resulted in at least 66% of my chin hair being removed - say, a 4 sq inch area.  </li>
            <li> anyway, the second round resulted in at least 66% of my chin hair being removed - say, a 4 sq inch area.  </li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and unfortunately have the facial hair that goes along with it.  </li>
            <li> Over time, it will become less so.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin break out where i used it though, which i find quite odd.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there is a slight learning curve in terms of how to use it.  </li>
            <li> get much less stubble than with a razor.</li>
            <li> : when I wax my upper lip, it removes every bit of hair and it actually makes me look weird...</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s far too painful and would rather stick with professional threading.</li>
            <li> At least this way you aren&#x27;t risking a chemical reaction or burn and having an embarrassingly reddened upper lip for a few days while the skin heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then it is much less than when you wax or thread...</li>
            <li> Oddly, I found it easier to do it  away from a mirror, just lying in bed.</li>
            <li> This tool accomplishes what thread on can do but with less pain.</li>
            <li> There was no irritation and hurt less than waxing.</li>
            <li> It stings, but hurts less than waxing and you can do this yourself instead of having a perky 20 something pull your hair out with wax.  </li>
            <li> (I would typically break out after a threading session).  </li>
            <li> It may have pulled out the odd hair or two, but in NO WAY did do what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that they have sent me a previously returned product because the box opening flaps were worn out like it has been opened before.</li>
            <li> This little sucker is only going to make whatever patch you&#x27;re working on sting for a little bit</li>
            <li> I am going to try to use it on all part of my face except where the dark hairs are coming in and let them grow out a little.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit to get use to how to use it, but once you got it down its a breeze.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be intimidated, it is much faster, less messy, and less painful because you sort of ease the pain in which allows your skin to adjust instead of one big RIP and that tingly/irritated feeling after you wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it is unpleasant, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble to return it, but it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> It was really awkward the first couple of trys.  </li>
            <li> I thought laser removal would be a permanent fix, but that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> and I dont want to mess them up.</li>
            <li> Not good on coarse hair or patches of hair.</li>
            <li> Or use ice to numb the area first.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not know how or why I have lived this long without one.</li>
            <li> tacky fingers and a mess of popsicle sticks in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do have to mess with it to get it to work correctly.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer not having to deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> 3) Tweeze each and every little hair, one by one, consuming a day and a half if you want to get everything.</li>
            <li> Plus: its cheaper than having to go to a salon to have waxing done every 3 months, &amp; can be done anytime anywhere, a little less skin irritation than waxing  Con</li>
            <li> others have said, it&#x27;s comprable to tweezing (I think it might hurt a little less).  </li>
            <li> does and maybe a little less.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and doesn&#x27;t work gave me and ugly cut / burn on my face so embarrassed !</li>
            <li> It does take some practice to get it down and even then it&#x27;s not completely precise</li>
            <li> However, money is tight now</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now and it doesn&#x27;t get LESS painful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got those pesky dark or stiff hairs popping up here and there on my chin and get so embarrassed.  </li>
            <li> My face is bare of those nasty hairs and smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> Super painful, and one of my handles broke immediately so that it doesn&#x27;t twist correctly.  </li>
            <li> It worked, but it was super painful.  </li>
            <li> but wont remove tough white hair or black hair that has been tweezed for yrs.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little around the lips and close to the ears, but other than that it&#x27;s really very little pain if any.</li>
            <li> I still do a little finishing with tweezers.</li>
            <li> The reviewers are correct in that there is a little bit of a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> This takes a little getting used to, but now I use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a learning curve, I just searched on youtube for tutorials or videos of people using it.</li>
            <li> And since the hairs grow back at different rates, the first time will be the worst.     </li>
            <li> No irritation like I get with waxing (little pimple bumps) and nothing like the lotions, which burn my skin and still leave hairs...</li>
            <li> I SAVE over $230.00 per year with this little superstar.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has taken me a little while to figure out how get around all the curves of my chin where I have the coarser hairs.  </li>
            <li> Yes it hurts a little, but if you have been tweezing you can handle it.  </li>
            <li> I gave this little gizmo a try</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any irritation, it hurt a little</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but considering that you are pulling hair out of your face</li>
            <li> You will have a lot open follicles, some which may have never been opened before, and you don&#x27;t want anything icky getting in there and causing any sort of acne!  </li>
            <li> Pain level feels a little like threading</li>
            <li> and my lip was the smoothest it has ever been after hair removal, without redness or little welts forming.  </li>
            <li> This little Spring is heaven-sent: it works and I am grateful.    </li>
            <li> One little tool you shell out</li>
            <li> It gets every little hair.</li>
            <li> This little tool is a gem.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to--went from wondering if it was working at all to holy-flippin-cow-patties-on-a-stick that hurts.</li>
            <li> It took me a little bit of trial and error to get this to grab and remove hair</li>
            <li> My sister mentioned this little product she has been using and so I thought - I have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> It does take a little experimenting with the angle and curve to get it</li>
            <li> I thought there was no way this little spring would work</li>
            <li> A little bit.</li>
            <li> This product works in removing hair a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I do admit, it does literally yank out your hair and hurts a little.</li>
            <li> There will be a little redness (just like with tweezing) but goes away</li>
            <li> Takes a little while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little sore now</li>
            <li> There is a little sting involved, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little tricky on the chin area.</li>
            <li> It will hurt a little bit in the beginning</li>
            <li> No pain or discomfort at all, maybe just a little &amp;#34;twinge&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It does take a little experimenting to get it to work, but with the help of some amazon reviews and a video review (also Amazon)</li>
            <li> The product works similarly to other epilators from the past twenty years or so:  a curved coil rotates, pinching and pulling hairs out.</li>
            <li> You do need to moisturize your skin a little bit after doing it.</li>
            <li> This little thing has changed mine and my Mom&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> But I feel like it does a little bit of both.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for alternatives, when I found this little guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been battling those little beasts ever since.</li>
            <li> Then I saw this little gem.  </li>
            <li> and I am a little clunky still</li>
            <li> I have always been a little hairy</li>
            <li> we all dread ripping it off) with this little device</li>
            <li> it removes any little traces of hair (I did use a magnifying mirror).</li>
            <li> However it does take time to get iae to the feeling of pulling all these little hairs out .</li>
            <li> It does sting and makes my eyes water a little</li>
            <li> ... not sure how all these other reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t- it literally rips your hairs out.  </li>
            <li> It pulls those little hairs out all the way including the follicle.</li>
            <li> This hurts a little bit.</li>
            <li> my nerves are probably a little deadened.</li>
            <li> This little spring works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit for the learning curve but it works as described.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt a little bit</li>
            <li> but it does it takes out all of the little hairs out</li>
            <li> The REM spring works just as described with a little pain of course.  </li>
            <li> So little sting for the amount of hairs it pulls out.</li>
            <li> I use this a little every day.  </li>
            <li> However, wished it came with a little bag or something to put it in while not in use.</li>
            <li> It requires a little time to master a technique, once you I had it</li>
            <li> So addicting and gets every little hair.</li>
            <li> so I did experience redness, a little puffiness</li>
            <li> On the little hairs I find I have to bend it</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t handle it, just to a little bit each session,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Felt the usual sensation due to having hair pulled out.</li>
            <li> In doing so, this thing rips off every little hair, but never pinches the skin.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars, but I&#x27;ll agree that I think this is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get  use to the pain with this little device.  </li>
            <li> There is a little discomfort, but if you&#x27;ve had your lip threaded</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a problem with an excessive amount of hair growth on my chin due to changing hormones.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> This is the vest little invention.  </li>
            <li> Ofcourse there is a little pain to bear..</li>
            <li> it may take a little bit of getting used to</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little, of course, but then you get used to the pain</li>
            <li> After a little practice, you don&#x27;t even need a mirror, so you can use it while watching TV..</li>
            <li> little gadget is a God-send.</li>
            <li> that said I have discontinued using this because after my fifth time using it resulted in little pimple-like infected hair spots where I had yanked the hairs out.</li>
            <li> but, this does have a little bite to it, but OMG it works well.</li>
            <li> Try this product first before spending any money on expensive hair removal methods!</li>
            <li> A little costly for its simplicity.</li>
            <li> I went after my mom with this little device, but she wasn&#x27;t having it.</li>
            <li> I decided to to come back to this website to see if any had been added and see if maybe out of dumb luck I had been using this right---so off</li>
            <li> When they say it is painless, they are lying a little bit.</li>
            <li> with a little practice you can remove those pesky chin hairs as well.</li>
            <li> This little item, I think rivals if not surpasses the ease of use and practicality, not to mention the cost, of the wax strips</li>
            <li> Thought who would buy such a dumb invention..</li>
            <li> &quot;  I go nowhere without this little gadget.</li>
            <li> It works on the little hairs.  </li>
            <li> He said it works, but he felt the little accompanying sting.  </li>
            <li> However, it does  take a little getting use to.  </li>
            <li> It takes some time to get all the little hairs.</li>
            <li> So I decided to look for something else and came across this little device.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female who&#x27;s always had like a dark shadow on upper lip after trying to shave, epilate (the worst), and even tweeze the hairs.</li>
            <li> I would say the REM does work, however it is a bit painful when you first start using it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the hair this little spring trapped.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I even realized how hairy my cheeks were until I saw all those little buggers trapped in the spring.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I do a little everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You should use it a little everyday so that your skin gets used to it.  </li>
            <li> But, for those of us with looser skin, this product is a waste of time, and does little.</li>
            <li> I use it a little every day for a few minutes</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs, esp, the tough white ones, but overall..i would recommend.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I have very thick facial hair, very dark, and densely populated.  </li>
            <li> First time use is painful but gets less and less every time.</li>
            <li> I was finally where my skin was clear and after i used this i broke out bad.</li>
            <li> I just want to make it clear that this is going to hurt... and no matter how I look at it, it&#x27;s going to be a tedious job.</li>
            <li> and I ended up cutting up the larger pieces for my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;The spring</li>
            <li> It was painful and I can&#x27;t imagine using it in sensitive areas like the upper lip.</li>
            <li> Also, after a couple minutes of using this, my skin became almost numb and it was much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I pick it up while I&#x27;m watching TV and go over my trouble areas..</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I opened it and without much trouble figured out how to make it work.</li>
            <li> I am not brave enough to pluck hairs</li>
            <li> Hurts until you get used to it, after using a few times, the sensitivity to ripping hairs out of your face gets easier.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and was looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> plus I dont want to spend 20mins just to get adjusted to work... waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money and time.</li>
            <li> I always paid 28+tip at the salon every few weeks to get my chin, eyebrows and lip waxed.</li>
            <li> So I have to admit that I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make this thing work until I went on the web and found a few video&#x27;s with demo&#x27;s on them.  </li>
            <li> I have been fighting the stash for a few years...</li>
            <li> so i stopped for a few minutes, then continued.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this product a few times a week, just to keep up with it.  </li>
            <li> know a few things:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I plan to buy one for my suitcase and a few for friends.  </li>
            <li> You can hold it in front of a fan for a few seconds as well, if you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used it for a few months with not one ingrown hair, &amp; I am prone to them)  </li>
            <li> Waxing leaves the area around my mouth broken out in unsightly pimples and I am convinced threading was used as a form of torture back in the day...</li>
            <li> A few passes with the Spring Sprong and they were gone.</li>
            <li> - It may help to avoid harsh, alcohol-based toners, since it could irritate the skin and cause bumps.</li>
            <li> I go out everyday whenever I want to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and have no irritation.</li>
            <li> Give it a try if you&#x27;re tired of the waxing Nairing red face thing!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I bought it, as I have a few hairs that have conveniently popped up</li>
            <li> and I still have the same problem and worse.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> But since this saves me around $10 and I can use it everyday, it&#x27;s a must-have in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> EPIC fail when I tried that.</li>
            <li> Face creams always seem to irritate her skin and home waxing is messy, so she tweezes.</li>
            <li> It did sting on a few hairs</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted the money on it.  </li>
            <li> Another waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> I would still have to tweeze a few stubborn hairs it just wouldn&#x27;t grab.</li>
            <li> I just received the REM Spring a few days ago and i am hooked.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> it did remove visible facial hair, but the thin hair were not, as seen with the use of a 20x magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> I have longed to go camping but did not want to end up looking like a cave man after a few days of not removing my man hairs.  </li>
            <li> Well.. I am hairy with dark hair.. not sure</li>
            <li> I found this neat thing and read a few reviews and watched videos..</li>
            <li> sometimes the hair gets uneven after using it, it&#x27;s almost like shaving.</li>
            <li> are a few reasons why I will never try another product for hair removal on my face again:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> /&gt;-No messy wax getting on the sink, my clothes, or even the carpet</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> It does remove thin facial hair around lips and chin area.</li>
            <li> I had some trouble in using it.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of using it as instructed (it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair either)</li>
            <li> A must have for all women who are tired of facial hair..</li>
            <li> but it is time consuming because tweezers can pull 1 or a few at a time.  </li>
            <li> This product did not work, it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> but when I look in the mirror, I still see a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why the fifth star is missing in my review.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times with no results.</li>
            <li> I tried rolling it a few ways and after washing, but I still had to get the tweezer to pull out the remaining</li>
            <li> So I use it in front of the TV when distracted by that, or with a glass of wine and a small piece of dark chocolate at hand.</li>
            <li> I do get it to pull out the thicker hairs, but sometimes I have to go over the area a few times.</li>
            <li> With tweezing, for example, I&#x27;m peering into a magnifying mirror and trying to coordinate my tweezers and often missing the hair.  </li>
            <li> Throw away the pouch, it&#x27;s not important.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I decided to *try</li>
            <li> ever few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I widen and narrow the U shape while doing so.</li>
            <li> It gets easier after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> Which was weird because I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan 26, 2013: Follow up note on the \\&quot;painless\\&quot; part -- I&#x27;ve had this gizmo a few days now</li>
            <li> Every time I see a few, I just grab this and get to work.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days for about five minutes.  </li>
            <li> this thing is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I also let it grow out for a few days.</li>
            <li> I also let it grow out for a few days.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> However on occasion sometimes I notice I will have a few course stray hairs</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying, I recommend watching a few YouTube testimonials and the review from Becky Gardens.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes every day and your excess hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> shaving grows the hair after few days but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> After a few sessions.</li>
            <li> The cheap brand was worthless...</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube videos to help me out</li>
            <li> You can use it every few days.  </li>
            <li> Watch a few youtube videos to get an idea</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to use it everyday to eliminate the &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is waste your time or money on this  garbage</li>
            <li> Thus far, it is very helpful in taking out thick hairs that are annoying and bothersome in unwanted areas.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m use to plucking everyday.  </li>
            <li> A few twists and, voila</li>
            <li> Over the course of a few days if I use the tool each night before bed I can get everything.</li>
            <li> you have thin women&#x27;s hair, this may be different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try this again when my neck hairs grow out again, but this seems like I wasted money.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it a few time.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does not work.  </li>
            <li> You can use this anytime you have a few moments to yourself.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few methods before putting it away.</li>
            <li> Also, when I received the package the case was missing which make me believe that I was sent a used product.</li>
            <li> I mean really I&#x27;m not exaggerating -</li>
            <li> It is painful but the pain can be minimized if you moisturize the skin right before.</li>
            <li> Just as efficient and way less messy!</li>
            <li> , I cut my &amp;#34;hair removal time&amp;#34; in half!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*edited, within a day it began to hurt less and boy does it work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly embarassed!</li>
            <li> Hurts slightly, yet works like a charm!</li>
            <li> It is not fine hair or fuzz.  </li>
            <li> ; if you choose to watch the video, do NOT, repeat, NOT be drinking anywhere near your computer, or you run serious risk of spray!!</li>
            <li> Also, as I had read in at least one other review, it does appear to \\&quot;break\\&quot; some hairs rather than pull them.</li>
            <li> Yes it a little painful the first minute</li>
            <li> it is a little painful at first</li>
            <li> After spotting numerous black hairs on my face (of mostly blonde hair) in my late-20s, I got tired of randomly plucking and said</li>
            <li> It just plain DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> If you only want to remove hair above the lip, mustache, I suggest you just get it waxed because its less painful and  time consuming.  </li>
            <li> My daughter found it quite painful, but I barely bat an eye -- so the pain level is an individual thing that can vary greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use the spring every few days, it gets much easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> I am generally very skeptical of such products but this one actually works.</li>
            <li> I put it in my purse and carry it everywhere, but sometimes it&#x27;s not easy to find in my purse.</li>
            <li> I takes very less time to do the job.</li>
            <li> and I grow an uncomfortable amount of dark facial hair on my face that requires I routinely wax.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little during, but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li> Yes, it stings a little when the hairs get pulled out, but no more than when using tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I have been threading by myself the old fashion way ( using threads around my fingers) for years and just could not take the threads cutting through my fingers and having to do so every other day (since the small hair would not pluck).</li>
            <li> It hurts a little, but no more than waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li> My face was a mess!</li>
            <li> I was getting so uncomfortable being out and would actually position myself so that my less hairy side would be exposed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a less expensive brand as my back ups and for my sister.</li>
            <li> This is much faster than threading for me and event slightly less painful.</li>
            <li> Yep, there&#x27;s nothing painless about snatching out a dozen or so hairs all at once, but it&#x27;s no worse than plucking, and I think it was less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> If you try to do a side of your face or something in one sitting, your skin will probably go numb from all the yanking and you&#x27;ll be in tears--tweezing is not new for me, but I still tear up on the stubborn, deeply rooted hairs.  </li>
            <li> It hurts really bad at first, but you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li> And yes, if you&#x27;re using it for the first time it&#x27;ll bring tears to your eyes, but it&#x27;s not so bad after that.</li>
            <li> It does hurt the first couple times, but then it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful at first</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I was shocked at the amount of pain involved.</li>
            <li> It can be painful at first.</li>
            <li> First use can be painful but don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> The first use was a bit painful...</li>
            <li> It was so painful the first time I used it, that I had to continually give myself pep talks to continue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, after some painful experimentation, I cleared a 1 in sq area in a rather dense area on the point of my chin, with some blood, as it is ripping the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> I remember though, how painful it was at first.  </li>
            <li> Its painful at first</li>
            <li> It was painful as heck first time</li>
            <li> Yes at first it is painful</li>
            <li> You will be frustrated at first</li>
            <li> so I also have some dark thick whiskers.  </li>
            <li> In less than 4 minutes I had the technique down pat and it hardly hurt at all!  </li>
            <li> Waxing is messy and leaves a sticky film on my skin, plucking is slow and doesn&#x27;t get all the little hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting wax at the store every few months, this little baby lasts for at LEAST a</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a hard time getting used to the tool, but I had help from the previous reviewers.</li>
            <li> However, if I use just a slight bend, it rips out those little hairs like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!!</li>
            <li> The tool has a very tight spring</li>
            <li> but after a time, I realised that the process was either time consuming, expensive, or left the surface area uneven.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Nair and Sally Hansen depilatories, painful waxing, and plucking to get rid of my unsightly facial hair (upper lip, chin, sideburns).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing/tweezing (broke out), nair (chemical burn), facial buffers (didn&#x27;t work), epilators (too painful for upper lip) and threading.</li>
            <li> the only thing that was wrong with this product is one of the ends was missing</li>
            <li> I was so curious and doubtful if it really works</li>
            <li> Leaves little broken hairs, which turns to ingrown hairs, it&#x27;s not good hair grows back faster in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried bending the tool into a wider U shape and rotated the little handles and TADA!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little pain in the process, this is for you!  </li>
            <li> This little spring works!  </li>
            <li> and I use this to remove the little hair on my ears!</li>
            <li> This little thing is a MIRACLE!  </li>
            <li> I want to use it every day to get every single darn hair off my face, which is obviously unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and unlike some reviews I don&#x27;t find it very painful  </li>
            <li> It hardly took any practice before I was nabbing the little hairs and pulling them out.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It was a little hard to figure out how to use it, but once I got the hang of it...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading the bad reviews, but I think they must have very poor finger dexterity.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like unbearable for me, though--which is really something, because I hate pain and am told I have a lower tolerance for it than other people do.  </li>
            <li> No more going after every little hair!</li>
            <li> (although painful) on certain type of hair.</li>
            <li> I was certain that it was going to be painful</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow</li>
            <li> Seriously, pain ten times worse than anything ever.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as soon as I feel the hard little whiskers above my skin</li>
            <li> I someone skip waxes because I have to muster up too much courage to go through that terrible pain, even if the pain only lasts for a little while.</li>
            <li> A bit painful at first and hard to get all the hair off.  </li>
            <li> After I got the hang of it, it really wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful when it pulls out the hairs but about as much as when someone goes through the \\&quot;thread\\&quot; method of pulling out the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t that painful anyway.</li>
            <li> , yes it&#x27;s somewhat painful, but it&#x27;s no worse than being plucked, threaded or waxed.</li>
            <li> I find if I use it in just a small area at a time, then take a break, that I can deal with the pain.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that does not want to spend the money at a salon, and to someone that can handle the small bits of pain.</li>
            <li> so I thought the only solution was to try expensive laser treatment.  </li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about this device, but bought it anyway because hair removal is such a chore</li>
            <li> It hurt during the process but no more pain afterwards.</li>
            <li> Even with washing my face before and after use, it still caused pimples (which I am not even usually that prone to getting).  </li>
            <li> I expected this to be worse than it is.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m skeptical and wish the instructions for proper use were clearer.</li>
            <li> I read all customer reviews before puchasing this item and they seemed unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> If that happens it&#x27;s usually because you&#x27;re not maneuvering it correctly.</li>
            <li> the larger, coarser hairs are merely snapped off.</li>
            <li> NO MORE HEARING</li>
            <li> (they usually gather up at the end tips of the spring).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I&#x27;ve got some coarse hairs on my chin that I always have to pull out with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Am not exactly sure which mode of holding the Spring worked</li>
            <li> I have use another brand in the past.</li>
            <li> No more waxing or tweezing ever.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to stop because I can&#x27;t handle the pain.</li>
            <li> No more waxing for me, I&#x27;ve got the R.E.M.</li>
            <li> If this happens, pull on both ends of the spring to release it.)&lt;br /&gt;-the grips at the end are a bit small, but not that it changes the effectiveness of the item</li>
            <li> I have friends who go regularly to electrolysis, but that&#x27;s expensive and time-consuming.</li>
            <li> Not sure how we survived without these.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on the small hairs on the sides of my lip.</li>
            <li> I usually bleach</li>
            <li> I found out about this product and while it hurts, it hurts no more than waxing</li>
            <li> This thing works if you can get past the pain.</li>
            <li> cut off a small section and trimmed it to about two-thirds the height of the \\&quot;handles\\&quot; of the Spring Sprong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> No more razor on my face</li>
            <li> I struggled with facial hair that was difficult to tweeze and get it all.</li>
            <li> , I can do this every few days to keep my fast-growing hair in check!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it pulls the hair from the root or just breaks it off, it hurts like it&#x27;s pulling it from the root.</li>
            <li> I wasted all that money!</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its pulling from the roots or what..</li>
            <li> I used to wax my upper lip, and it was expensive because the wax cost about 15 bucks.  </li>
            <li> Not sure (as some reviewer stated)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not able to hold them out of the way while using the spring</li>
            <li> I usually start at one corner of my mouth or &amp;#34;st-ache&amp;#34; area:</li>
            <li> No more irritation or burns.  </li>
            <li> No more burning or peeling skin after applying depilatories.  </li>
            <li> The past two times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely terrible luck with home waxing kits as the wax sticks to my skin more than to the paper.</li>
            <li> so well it&#x27;s almost unbelievable.</li>
            <li> No more tweezing.  </li>
            <li> Your eyebrow area is too small.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reveiws</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use and manipulate to remove specific chin hairs.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product did NOT take the hair out of of the root, but instead broke it, creating the illusion that I had no hair on my face, but when I grazed the back of my hand to my cheek, I could feel the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This package is so small</li>
            <li> After reading a few of the consumer reviews I figured for the price I can&#x27;t lose!</li>
            <li> weeks),in between my usual threading sessions for the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so waxing just makes it worse since my skin will react like crazy and I end up walking around with a red irritated blistered upper lip instead,</li>
            <li> And I reccommend it for those that have a few hairs that need to go!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has waxed in the past and can handle the hair being removed.</li>
            <li> I suffer from excessive hair under and on my chin.</li>
            <li> No more threading,waxing or trimming.</li>
            <li> doesnt work for me at least and it was pretty painful..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of pain, and this was only &#x27;mildly&#x27; uncomfortable, if that.  </li>
            <li> usually gets those hairs out as well.  </li>
            <li> I usually use tweeze it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see how it works over time.</li>
            <li> I did small areas, stopped and started alot, and altering direction as you need to go against the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just not doing it correctly or what, but this thing doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> the past I would get rid of the hair by threading.</li>
            <li> I have been using a facial cream hair removal product and it was tiresome to use as well as time consuming.</li>
            <li> Pull your skin taut to prevent excessive tugging on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just experiment for a few minutes, moving against the grain in the U-shape, and don&#x27;t give up, &#x27;cause it works wonders!)</li>
            <li> I have lot of facial hair especially the moustache :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> I twisted and turned and finally gave up and got out the razor!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I figured for the small price what do I have to lose.  </li>
            <li> For someone like me who is cursed with dark full-face fuzz, however, it proved a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> very difficult to use, kind of painful</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> All of them are bothersome in some way (creams kill my skin, wax is a pain and messy, sugar doesn&#x27;t always work, epilators are slow).</li>
            <li> Still not really sure why I&#x27;ve done this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay for removing the hair.</li>
            <li> I usually do this (once every 2 weeks)</li>
            <li> No more creams or waxes for me.  </li>
            <li> It is so small you can take it with you on your trips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and efficient.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not developing the usual bumps.</li>
            <li> I still have to pluck the little black hairs, but it is MUCH MUCH less expensive than laser fees.  </li>
            <li> Slight sting but nowhere near as painful as waxing or tweezing.  </li>
            <li> I also bought Dr. Numb numbing cream and can use this on my upper lip now with way less pain.  </li>
            <li> it does pull out hair and it does its job, it pulls out sections at a time which i like because its faster and less painful than a pair of tweezers and not messy like waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since moved to an epilator because it is less painful and faster on my upper lip (no doubt due to the use of this product!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to use and the instructions are confusing.</li>
            <li> I had a very few darn stubborn hairs that I did use the tweezers on.  </li>
            <li> The thing is, the spring picked up all the vellus hairs and very few of the terminal ones.</li>
            <li> This disinfects the pores and I have had very few pimples from the process.</li>
            <li> They say - \\&quot;Might feel a slight tingling sensation...\\&quot; NOT!!  </li>
            <li> first it was painful and could not do it properly but with in 10 minutes u will learn it yourself and also u will get numb to the pain...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using tweezers, but I have a hard time seeing all of the hair, either because my eyesight is no longer 20/20 or the location makes it difficult to see and tweeze at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Now, if you&#x27;ve waxed before, and more than my meager attempts, it may not be so bad.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely feel it snagging all those annoying facial hairs.</li>
            <li> It hurts worse than threading, and makes your fingers sort of tired, but it does actually work.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it will not remove tough dark hairs..</li>
            <li> After that, the hairs grew in so dark and tough.</li>
            <li> Hard to get all the small hairs with this.</li>
            <li> a teenager with very pale skin, and</li>
            <li> I also learned from other reviews that the hair removal might be painful but this was only in learning how to use the tool in my case.  </li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t want to resort to chemicals due to sensitive skin, or to waxing because I hate the after-feel, I feel that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m headed.</li>
            <li> I sought this out because razors leave stubble, epilators are expensive, I don&#x27;t want strange hair removing chemicals on my face and my skin is too tan to bleach</li>
            <li> After you get through the initial removal process, it is much less painful, and there is very little breaking out (which occurs for me after waxing and shaving legs, too).  </li>
            <li> I usually thread my upper lip, but this is faster and less painful.</li>
            <li> It caught all the little hairs, not just the crazy ones that want to grow long.</li>
            <li> Less time consuming, less messy, and less painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> Usually if I run my tongue along my upper lip after shaving or whatever, the stubble is crazy.</li>
            <li> In fact, when I was hospitalized with a serious illness, I was driven mad with worry that I was sprouting it like wild weeds or something</li>
            <li> Waste of money and not effective!</li>
            <li> perhaps a facaial wax treatment for removing facial hair is less than painful.......</li>
            <li> I suggest starting somewhere less painful until you get the hang out it, maybe bottom of your lip, or chin.</li>
            <li> had this REM spring for a few years but then lost it while traveling, so I replaced it with the slightly less expensive Bellabe version (amazon.com/Bellabe-118-Facial-Hair-Remover/dp/B001RPL902/).</li>
            <li> The motions I use to catch hair in the spring are small, subtle, and effortless.  </li>
            <li> a little difficult to master and does hurt a little.  </li>
            <li> hard to use, doesn&#x27;t beat going to the salon and use the tread</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t hard to do at all</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still hard to get all of the hair.</li>
            <li> Could hardly wait to post a review.</li>
            <li> ; that hardly registers.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever get in-grown hairs</li>
            <li> , it is just hard to explain if I am not showing you how</li>
            <li> This is hard to use.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting accustomed to using this.  </li>
            <li> It removes peach fuzz hairs but does not remove the hard course hairs.  </li>
            <li> The R.E.M Spring handles are made of metal, and the Epicare handles are a hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> Figuring out how to use it was a bit hard, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Easier than hard wax (did I tell you about the dress that fell on?)</li>
            <li> (neither did I, although I wasn&#x27;t trying so hard).  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard i tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it to remove anything from my face.  </li>
            <li> so when you could hardly see the hair before, you are stuck with a man&#x60;s beard after.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t hard to use like some others</li>
            <li> She had a hard time figuring out how to twirl</li>
            <li> Hardly any pain.  </li>
            <li> Second,is it hard to us we?</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> One little secret - keep it moving faster rather than slower.  </li>
            <li> I had really bad facial hair on my neck and a little on my face.</li>
            <li> A little painful but did remove some facial hair.</li>
            <li> and I felt stupid using it and didn&#x27;t feel like it was really working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a lot of hair everywhere and having absolutely no hair on my face would just be weird.</li>
            <li> I am recommending this to everyone of my gf&#x27;s that suffers through threading of the upper lip!</li>
            <li> At least a razor wouldn&#x27;t leave stubble.</li>
            <li> From a teenage girl, I have always been afraid to kiss</li>
            <li> So the intensity of my facial hair would look so horrifying for a female.</li>
            <li> I would say to save your 20 bucks and tweeze those suckers.  </li>
            <li> This is truly life saving for someone who suffers with unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> The hairs that were not catching I found it helpful to pull out once i got a hold of them similiar to tweezing.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> read the reviews posted and even factored in the negative ones.</li>
            <li> (Uh, duh?)</li>
            <li> Im afraid to try my upper lip</li>
            <li> That said, I did not throw away my tweezers, because this thing is impractical for eyebrows, which I found out the common sense way.</li>
            <li> sometimes the delicate skin at the corner of my mouth would be abraded by the thread.  </li>
            <li> at least when it comes to the pain.</li>
            <li> No I&#x27;m not one of those people who loses a limb and then asks for an aspirin.  </li>
            <li> I sat watching TV and twisting that sucker and YOWZA</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what convinced me to at least try it.  </li>
            <li> Facial hair stinks.</li>
            <li> , the only bad thing is that alot of thin hairs were left behind.</li>
            <li> But, I know that when you&#x27;re using something that extracts hair directly from the follicle it is going to be painful.</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product was not what I expected: it doesn&#x27;t work if you hold the remover on the bases.</li>
            <li> I hated the hairy signs of post menopause and of course it happens at the same time that your magnifying mirror isn&#x27;t magnifying enough!  </li>
            <li> I bought some numbing solution just in case it hurt badly, but it really does not hurt any worse than waxing or threading.</li>
            <li> If it hurts and you want to chicken out before ripping your hairs out, roll them in the opposite direction (for example, if turning away from your face pulls, turn toward your face to release).  </li>
            <li> It was only painful in a few places</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and was nervous about how the pain people complained about</li>
            <li> This way, only a few are grabbed each time and it is not as painful.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it work well, but you don&#x27;t have to put chemicals into your pores, and smell that artificial smell of cream or wax all day.  </li>
            <li> For the amount of pain it inflicts, I have a feeling it also removes some of my skin, or at least pinches it each time.</li>
            <li> As far as painful I guess because I pluck so often</li>
            <li> I felt it &#x60;grab&#x27; the hairs and slowly removing them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dark hair on my upper lip (that I usually bleach)and those annoying \\&quot;goat</li>
            <li> Just start slowly and maybe on the chin, to get used to it.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re shorter than 1/8&amp;#34;, I use tweezers, but anything longer than that (probably because I have thick hair) gets grabbed.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull thick ones or I&#x27;d have given it 5 ☆&#x27;s,  but peach fuzz?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels like a slow version of waxing, so there is some discomfort involved,  but it isn&#x27;t excruciating pain.</li>
            <li> for the thick hairs you want to pull this item is too weak,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The marks are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> with threading was because my hair is thick  the artist use to cut my skin</li>
            <li> Roll slowly against the hair growth.</li>
            <li> also u don&#x27;t get that thick hair regrowth as you would with waxing.</li>
            <li> (I must have slow hair growth?).</li>
            <li> my skin is practically white, but my hair is very black, which is a terrible combination for facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to handle and it is painful but beauty is pain right?</li>
            <li> It worsens when you move to other facial areas that don&#x27;t have a hard area (like teeth) underneath to provide a hard base to tense the skin on.</li>
            <li> aside from a bunch of other crap, you have to deal with facial hair.</li>
            <li> No more struggles with wax, depilatories, etc., which were very hard on my delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> No more waxing!  </li>
            <li> I mean I knew everywhere else</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my face since menopause - no more!  </li>
            <li> I DID HAD WHISKERS, NO MORE!</li>
            <li> No more bleaching!  </li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I mean, I did expect some pain.</li>
            <li> NOT SEXY!  </li>
            <li> I mean, I pay close to that just getting my face waxed at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more waxing, thank goodness!</li>
            <li> No more waxing or shaving!  </li>
            <li> I mean, even that rapist Vince guy has the Slap Chop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, hair on my legs, hair on my stomach, hair on my arms</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> once you get past the learning curve!</li>
            <li> Small, portable!  </li>
            <li> It is slightly painful so using it can only be for small sessions at a time.</li>
            <li> The first few rolls were very painful!</li>
            <li> This product is certainly not painless, but it&#x27;s faster than tweezing and less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your face red nor does it have an unpleasant odor that you get with the creams.  </li>
            <li> never again:( not for sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only complaint is the price: $20 is an awful lot for a simple spring.</li>
            <li> unfortunately for me I get embarrassing dark course hairs around my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li> But use my tweezers much much less!!!</li>
            <li> I just held it in the u-shape, twisted it and moved it up and down over the area.</li>
            <li> Seriously addicting.</li>
            <li> After a few hours of researching and reading reviews I decided that I didn&#x27;t have much to lose if it was terrible and a lot to gain if it wasn&#x27;t and ordered one.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> But seriously.</li>
            <li> It was less expensive,  but watch for REM price reductions on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this makes tweezing next to impossible.</li>
            <li> It was those scary, black hairs I wanted to yank out, but this product didn&#x27;t help me with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it’s kinda ridiculous).  </li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> Watching these codgers drag themselves across the stage at your local highly-flammible nightclub borders on the inhumane.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m serious people- ladies-</li>
            <li> The ridiculous plastic contraption that is sold here to help with that, seems cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> Seriously??</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make it too serious of an event.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to hold the skin and roll with both hands at the same time.  </li>
            <li> , this seriously doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> At less than 20 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It is less time, less painful and less expensive than getting electrolysis.  </li>
            <li> I just tried it, and it way less painful than tweezing and waxing, or painful laser treatments that didn&#x27;t really work for me anyhow.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a solid little tool for removing that nasty little mustache that women shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Saw this little product, was skeptical.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical of this little spring device.  </li>
            <li> Little tedious to figure out how to use.  </li>
            <li> A little difficult to use</li>
            <li> I have become a little obsessed with using them, and use one of them every day.  </li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Its a little weird to use</li>
            <li> This is way less painful and a lot less time consuming than plucking with tweezers</li>
            <li> every other day I sit while watching t.v and role over the spots i hated and can feel little ones being pulled away, you can see them if you have a black background of clothing or something.</li>
            <li> I have a problem of hard chin hairs and its really irritating.</li>
            <li> You can physically see the hairs coming out and for me, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as some of these reviews are letting on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough that some women have to bear the embarrassment of hair on the face.  </li>
            <li> However my last order was of really bad quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that is about the same as getting you lips waxed but not has bad as threading.  </li>
            <li> and now I have bad sun spots on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t discover this tool much earlier.</li>
            <li> Once I figured it out, it pulled a little--only a bit painful on the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gooey, painful enough that I had to &#x27;brace myself&#x27; to pull the strips off</li>
            <li> This spring is EXTREMELY painful when used on the upper lip (mustache) area.</li>
            <li> Upper lips are always going to be painful.</li>
            <li> This thing was so painful for me that my eyes were constantly tearing and teeth clenching.  </li>
            <li> painful procedure to remove facial hairs....</li>
            <li> I use Sally Hansen hair remover for my upper lip once a week but using it for my whole face would have been expensive, time consuming and annoying, plus that stuff has an unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> So that part is not good .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then my boyfriend made fun of me and made me feel terrible</li>
            <li> I will say that I do find it painful, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the red welts like the salon waxing does.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too painful for me to use it properly maybe.</li>
            <li> Regular use is also the way to go, as the finer hairs are not as painful to remove.</li>
            <li> (if sometimes painfully) rip out the hairs on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> What troubled me most about the tufts that grow at the corners of my mouth is that they cast ugly shadows on my skin, looking ugly in photographs, and bleaching did not help.  </li>
            <li> What troubled me most about the tufts that grow at the corners of my mouth is that they cast ugly shadows on my skin, looking ugly in photographs, and bleaching did not help.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit painful, pending the area you use it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so painful and leaves my skin red.</li>
            <li> Works, painful because you take multiple hairs at once.</li>
            <li> This facial hair remover does what it is suppose to do, is it painful</li>
            <li> not good for someone who has a lot of hair on their face.</li>
            <li> Painful but totally convenient.</li>
            <li> I considered a laser and an expensive epilator to name a few.  </li>
            <li> now she believes I never loved her.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the thin hair and doesn&#x27;t get the thick hair.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t need to go to the salon anymore or fool around with those flypaper-like home wax strips that never do a thorough job, and that I somehow always manage to injure myself with (I get  a small \\&quot;rip\\&quot; on the corner of my mouth that looks like a cold sore for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with this removing thick hairs or thin peach fuzz type.</li>
            <li> (I use it a few time a week just so it will be less painful than if I waited a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Right under the nose is the worst.  </li>
            <li> I think waxing is less painful, but this is less irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they no longer make those and that&#x27;s too bad because it was less painful and much faster than using this spring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s comically shocking the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> About 5 years ago, after getting a terribly upclose picture taken, I was absolutely horrified to see that I had a beard!  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of this it rips all those nasty hairs out sooo much quicker than tweezing!</li>
            <li> I had to schedule my threading/waxing/emjoi when I would have at least 4 days without seeing people!  </li>
            <li> disappointed and looking for a different one now.</li>
            <li> yeah, if your reallllly dumb that would happen.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed before, afraid that I&#x27;d get dark regrowth.  </li>
            <li> but DUH, it&#x27;s ripping your HAIR OUT OF YOUR FACE!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this item from the beginning, but purchased it because I was too lazy to go to a salon..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong</li>
            <li> it hurts the worst the first time...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to use.</li>
            <li> in addition, pull the spring apart and blow on it very hard.</li>
            <li> No more uncomfortable, time consuming, unhealthy waxing and</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-I get cold sores and I have a TON less irritation after using this than I ever did with wax!&lt;br /&gt;-It</li>
            <li> I was afraid of taking off half an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I used ice cubes to slight numb an area before use.</li>
            <li> Visiting parlor to get it waxed or thread every other is very expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So don&#x27;t be afraid of this little sucker!  </li>
            <li> It is tough to do your chin</li>
            <li> After years of waxing I noticed that it was tough on my skin.</li>
            <li> No more tweezing for me, thank God!!</li>
            <li> I mean, we&#x27;re removing hair by the root here!</li>
            <li> I mean I have tried it all Tweezing, Threading, waxing,and the creams too!</li>
            <li> I mean, it hurts like hell, but the results, uncomparable!</li>
            <li> I knew it would hurt like crazy, so I decided just to tackle it a little bit every day.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to buy this because I am so tired of things that do not work.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> It really is not that painful at all.</li>
            <li> :  it can be painful, esp on the upper lip, but it beats one by one tweezing;  and it is a bit difficult to get the under chin hairs, just based on the jaw angles</li>
            <li> It comes in a box with poorly explained instructions.</li>
            <li> they drive me crazy everyday, but this thing got all of them but the shortest ones.  </li>
            <li> It does not pickup thin hairs..</li>
            <li> What it did succeed in, however, was pinching the hell out of my skin, leaving it red and bloody.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of waxing and letting the hair grow to a sufficient length to wax again because that means visable hair.</li>
            <li> Also, it would take me  5-10 minutes of rubbing the gadget on my face just to get the poor results that I got.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it hurt any worse than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> Tweezing - exhausting.</li>
            <li> It does leave some hairs behind, which you need to go over again to get.</li>
            <li> Not attractive</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair sadly.    </li>
            <li> It all depends on what side effect is worse for you.</li>
            <li> but I figured since this was a bunch at once it wouldn&#x27;t be much worse than waxing....</li>
            <li> Since my poor chin is already used to tweezing, I felt almost no pain.</li>
            <li> It will not pick up hairs that are too thick, those unfortunately will have to be removed with tweezers.</li>
            <li> My face has broken out on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was tired of waxing and plucking</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a lot of hairs.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts worse than waxing and isn&#x27;t as efficient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also tired of my mustache and sideburns, ugh.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This hurts worse than getting threaded or waxed.  </li>
            <li> now I think I&#x27;m addicted to it</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think it could be worse than tweezing.</li>
            <li> worse than tweezing combined with waxing.  </li>
            <li> , I started on my cheeks, but I was sort of tired by then, so I gave up.</li>
            <li> Cream hair removals are irritating, not this.</li>
            <li> Bleaching is annoying to keep up with and still leaves blonde, visible hair.</li>
            <li> In either case, I was getting tired of replenishing my supply of hair removal products.</li>
            <li> If you have larger hands or arthritis, this might be sort of annoying to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt worse.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of buying hair removing products, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I fell for false advertising.  </li>
            <li> It is false advertising.</li>
            <li> Using this remover is tedious, very painful and I feel a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Completely frustrated the other night I was looking up depilatory creams and this popped up as a suggestion.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other things I&#x27;ve done, it wasn&#x27;t terribly painful to me.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was concerned it would be extremely painful or that I wouldn&#x27;t get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will and isn&#x27;t anymore painful than other methods.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for a long time to try and keep up with having it removed, but for one it gets expensive!!</li>
            <li> all with less than satisfactory and usually painful results.</li>
            <li> And, it is quicker and less painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m not being dramatic.</li>
            <li> Cream is faster and less painful.</li>
            <li> I want something that&#x27;s a lot less painful.</li>
            <li> It does become less painful over time.</li>
            <li> it was less painful)..</li>
            <li> but it become less painful the longer you have it.  </li>
            <li> then i read the reviews and realized that not only does it work it would save me a lot of money vs going to the rude lady at the mall who does threading for about 40 bucks each time and does a terrible job in comparison.</li>
            <li> It hurt a little bit, but not too bad, and there was no redness afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It is a little painful</li>
            <li> A little painful through but not unbearably so.</li>
            <li> Little painful but does what it says.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying this product because I heard that it is painful</li>
            <li> kinda feels like I&#x27;m getting shocked on my face a little bit</li>
            <li> It will sting a little, but you&#x27;ll be shocked at the results.</li>
            <li> When it got to be a little painful in tender spots</li>
            <li> /&gt;It stings a little, but it&#x27;s not overly painful.</li>
            <li> A little painful</li>
            <li> Waxing is a painful, messy ordeal, and in between waxings my hair growth is unsightly.  </li>
            <li> It got so bad that I started wearing scarves everyday.</li>
            <li> I would wax but that was too messy and bad for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews for this product, though there are few.  </li>
            <li> but after you do it a few times- it doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> I wanted one product that would not need to be replaced for at least a year, something I can use without electricity, and something that will not be potentially dangerous for my body (like hair bleach).</li>
            <li> I have been through laser treatment, shaving, waxing, threading - but by far this hurts the worst!  </li>
            <li> To be clear, it is painful!!!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but ordered this anyway, because I was so tired of tweezing, and the creams and waxes just irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I must say even if I hated the tool the entertainment factor in watching her facial expressions while using it was &amp;#34;priceless&amp;#34;- bottom line is that sh asked me to order one for her and her two</li>
            <li> It is no more painful than threading and much, much less painful than depilatories and waxing.  </li>
            <li> although the process is somewhat painful its easier and less expensive then waxing...</li>
            <li> I put a cold pack on my skin to help numb it a little and that sort of worked.</li>
            <li> painful and time-consuming than tweezing (which I won&#x27;t even try), but not very effective, and the learning curb is too steep.</li>
            <li> If you leave it for a week and do it again, it will be just as painful, almost painful enough to make you throw it away and give up.   </li>
            <li> I am apparently allergic to this :( too bad because it worked quite well.</li>
            <li> Duh!!</li>
            <li> no more painful then threading</li>
            <li> It does not pull small hairs either and It was painful to use.</li>
            <li> I hate the mess</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeping tweezers nearby for the hard to reach strands isn&#x27;t a bad idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beyond painful to use and so hard to get the hand of it.</li>
            <li> so I was wary of trying to wax it myself or using a depilatory</li>
            <li> This spring does the job w/o leaving my skin feeling so weird</li>
            <li> There was one or two hairs that was difficult to get..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly sorry that I bought it.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t noticed any weird bumps after, or any redness.</li>
            <li> Completely miserable, the only way I could respond to this was by saying \\&quot;Thanks!\\&quot;    Trust me, ladies.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> FAIL.</li>
            <li> laser hair removal is just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The last 2 times I attempted to use wax hair removal, my skin broke out terribly</li>
            <li> For me it wasn&#x27;t about how I twisted the ends, but whether or not the bend would catch the hairs.  </li>
            <li> expensive than buying creme removers over and over again.  </li>
            <li> I know this is the easiest and least painful product I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> I debated over 2 days whether I should spend the money or not because I thought it might not work and that the reviews were fake</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.      </li>
            <li> It also helps to make the silly faces for difficult-to-get hairs.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> 1) Use that awful Nair for Face stuff that takes off a layer of your skin along with the hair, and walk around for three days with a red goatee and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> read a ton of reviews before buying and was skeptical about it because of the pain.</li>
            <li> They say to make an inverted U with the device, which I did, but I didn&#x27;t understand that then the device has to be gently twisted.</li>
            <li> Sadly this just hurt instead of pulling any hairs out.</li>
            <li> Plus I thought it would look weird to be completly</li>
            <li> I came across some at home machines that were awfully expensive ($400+ refills) and weren&#x27;t supposed to be used on the face (although that wouldn&#x27;t have stopped me).  </li>
            <li> but, it does not grab the coarser hairs which I unfortunately have covering my chin.</li>
            <li> I had watched a couple videos on youtube before trying it myself and did not find that it was difficult to use at all.  </li>
            <li> She found this product through a random search on google and ordered it immediately.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Either I am an idiot and missing something or this product is a scam.</li>
            <li> something went wrong.  </li>
            <li> No quite a fail, but not quite a miracle either.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use over broken skin!</li>
            <li> I find this to be helpful in the chin area but difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I thought it was not too expensive to take a chance..</li>
            <li> think that it is complicated</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> but now it doesn&#x27;t work anymore which is weird</li>
            <li> using this thing is WAY too tedious for me.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that difficult to use.</li>
            <li> complicated because if you dont know how to use it, it wont work.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have been banned from using it again</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find this too difficult to master.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this hair remover and were unable to use it.  </li>
            <li> Not even uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To use it, I just held the two ends like the picture, formed a \\&quot;u\\&quot; with it, placed it below the hairs, and then spun or twisted my fingers</li>
            <li> but instill found it difficult to pull all the hairs.</li>
            <li> Oh well... i was wrong.</li>
            <li> but they were wrong.</li>
            <li> Electrolysis is expensive and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Either I don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;right touch&amp;#34; or this thing is useless.</li>
            <li> I even tried to see if I was doing it wrong and tried it on my husbands arm hair and nothing came out.</li>
            <li> I was wrong -</li>
            <li> , I thought it was going to be really difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The upper lip hurts the worst!  </li>
            <li> It does remove the hair but sadly, it was causing my face to break out, even after cleaning it with alcohol, as the directions indicated.  </li>
            <li> I am skeptical.</li>
            <li> Worse thing I&#x27;ve gotten on Amazon!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was wrong.</li>
            <li> my fancy and expensive wax machine.</li>
            <li> One night I was bored and I attempted to use it.</li>
            <li> Find this item useless I&#x27;d rather go with waxing</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone one prone to random stray hairs, forget it.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I&#x27;m a fan and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing, threading, and plucking for years and was skeptical of this product.  </li>
            <li> I could see how some might not reap the benefits of it because if you can&#x27;t handle pain at all then trying to make yourself twist the spring could be mentally difficult.  </li>
            <li> It is not as painful (at least for me) as some reviews would make it seem.  </li>
            <li> Now you don&#x27;t need to buy an expensive epilator, or electronic hair remover.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It was very slightly uncomfortable, but I have used wax which probably toughened the area.  </li>
            <li> I mean once you get the hang of it, it isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> Did not pull any hair at all anywhere, I mean it pulls ,( and does so painfully)  but does not pull the hairs out, and I thought that was the goal?</li>
            <li> thing doesn&#x27;t work on thick, course hairs, (those nasty little wiry things that pop up out of nowhere!)</li>
            <li> it would be faster and less painful to pull them out one by one with tweezers!</li>
            <li> It was a little painful in the beginning, but II got used to it, and I use it on a weekly basis ever since I bought it, which is around three years now!</li>
            <li> Bad, painful and no easy to use</li>
            <li> they are all painful but this one is the least painful.</li>
            <li> The spring works, but it takes a really long time to work it, and it is awful painful.</li>
            <li> When it did grab a hair or two, it hurt like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to get rid of my chin hair.  </li>
            <li> But maybe after 5 min your skin just gets numb.  </li>
            <li> It was painful when used on my upper lip and the worst thing of all is my face broke out with painful pimples.</li>
            <li> So desperate started \\&quot;bic-ing\\&quot; my chin.</li>
            <li> I WAS AFRAID THAT THE HAIR WILL COME OUT THICKER AND DARKER, BUT</li>
            <li> BUT THEN IT KIDA GETS NUMB.</li>
            <li> Let me tell u that I WAS DESPERATE.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not at all awkward to use.</li>
            <li> spring over lips quickly to numb &amp; then finish off the rest in about 5 minutes or less&lt;</li>
            <li> Anyone who says this doesn&#x27;t hurt like hell is a liar or numb.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to veer from the U shape a bit.</li>
            <li> this is painful difficult and doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> I used a bit of ice to numb things a bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to get them</li>
            <li> By then my skin is already numb.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to use the crazy thing.</li>
            <li> This keeps the hairs shorter for a longer period of time and is not quite as inconvenient as waxing/threading, etc.</li>
            <li> I also found it way too awkward to use this way.  </li>
            <li> Waxing to me is too expensive and too painful.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of reviews about the pain</li>
            <li> and im obsessed now!</li>
            <li> My wife usually spends 5-10 minutes every night miserably obsessing over stray chin hairs and peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li> Buy this product you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it!</li>
            <li> USELESS!</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s worse, it was a painful piece of crap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels a bit prickly and tingly when you use it, but for someone like me not at all unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> It made using the spring actually very difficult.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable side effect which made me give up using this product after 4-5 attempts.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it is almost impossible to use  because it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> The 4 stars instead of 5 is because of bad instructions.</li>
            <li> it did hurt but not as bad as I imagined.</li>
            <li> the pain isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Not so bad.   </li>
            <li> and I had a bad breakout.</li>
            <li> , I DIDNT THINK I LOOKED BAD.</li>
            <li> Bad.  </li>

            <li> I tried waxing and it made be break out REALLY bad.</li>
            <li> BUT it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as waxing</li>
            <li> but I did it in stages and it wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> (though i think I grazed a part of my skin which had a cut or something on it and made it feel bad.</li>
            <li> The ouch factor is not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also painful and time consuming.</li>
            <li> but it is painful.</li>
            <li> Some of the blood caused by this injury leaked into my mustache, giving it a red-black tone that looked simply atrocious.    </li>
            <li> When I came out of the bathroom, my partner looked at me with a shocked face and said \\&quot;You look like hell!\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> It stings a bit, but I don&#x27;t think it is too painful to deal with.</li>
            <li> This was not as painful as I thought It was going to be</li>
            <li> It helps, but is painful and does not get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> it was so painful and the hair did not come off and then switched to a manual tweezer and then ended up going to a salon getting it waxed.</li>
            <li> It was still painful but bearable.  </li>
            <li> so there is no way it wasn&#x27;t going to be painful.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it takes a while to use and get the hang of, and it is painful, just as you would expect when ripping the hair out by the root.  </li>
            <li> It is painful, but beauty is painful</li>

            <li> but I hate how time-consuming using this hair remover can be because it misses some of the hairs</li>
            <li> So annoying.</li>
            <li> receiving it I was doubtful.</li>
            <li> I could see how some people would find this type of hair removal annoying.</li>
            <li> I have tried creams to remove hair and HATE the smell and redness.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great tool once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! My tip... Use a warm/hot wash cloth on your face first for a couple min. This will help a lot and it&#x27;s not as painful to use the spring. I think it works great I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years now. &amp; I just bought my mom one!</li>
            <li> This works really, really well. It hurts a tad, but nothing I can&#x27;t take. The only con is that I got sort of obsessive with it. I want to use it every day to get every single darn hair off my face, which is obviously unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Ordered 3rd one ...1 lost, 1 for gift and 1 for myself again..it&#x27;s little make the skin dry and time consuming</li>
            <li> I really like this device, however, the description of how to use it is way off.  I tried it like the instructions say and nothing.  Then I tried it how it made sense to me and it works great. I kept it almost straight, and rolled it up and down, on my face and arms, and it worked great. I have recommended it to several friends.  The 4 stars instead of 5 is because of bad instructions.</li>
            <li> Hurts but it works, I have been waxed, plucked, and spent several hundred on the no-no. All the products worked well but this spring is quick easy and the results last a long time. I am happy with the purchase I just wish I knew about it years ago!</li>
            <li> I bought a second one to be  sure I always have one!  I am still using the original one I bought a few years ago and I love it.  It is amazing how much &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34; we have on our faces and this R.E.M. Spring is better than wax, threading or hair remover (ouch) I&#x27;ve ever tried or used.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover worked as well as it did. It is a little painful but you get it over with a few quick pulls rather than the bunch of little pulls you get with tweezers. I have dark, coarse hair and it gets most of those. I still do a little finishing with tweezers.</li>
            <li> A spring such as this is used for facial hair removal. It&#x27;s supposed to be painless, but it isn&#x27;t. It does remove some hairs, but not  all. Maybe tweezers are the answer after all.</li>
            <li> I found this very easy to use.  It works very well, but it does hurt!  easy to use while watching tv .Could also probably double as a weapon.</li>
            <li> A second one for my suitcase to have always at the ready!  Yes, it takes practice to get the hang of it.  Spin and twist the ends in opposite directions; roll it all over, in every direction.  Use often and it does a great job.  So much better than the electric epilator I bought.  Cleaner and more convenient than waxing.</li>
            <li> It does what the description said it will do. I would suggest watching the YouTube video for best directions.</li>
            <li> This product really works great.  It only took me a few minutes to get it down pat and now works like a charm.  The only downside is it was slightly painful at first till I learned to firm my lip before pulling out my lip hair.  I suggest sort of using your facial muscles to stiffen your lip in the place you are going to be using it on.  I found it to be much less painful and actually kind of like doing it now.  If you are someone like me who has been dealing with the problem of unpleasant facial hair I would highly recommend getting yourself one.  Well worth the asking price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the spring for about a month or so now, and wanted to set the record straight since my first review. It&#x27;s a good touch-up product, and works okay (although painful) on certain type of hair. It has done well removing fine hairs from the upper lip and slowed their regrowth there, BUT unfortunately not so well on chin hairs. After one month of use I&#x27;ve noticed the chin hairs have slowed in fully growing, but have turned more like stubble, and covering a larger area... not good! I&#x27;m discontinuing use of the spring as the primary way for hair removal and going back to waxing. It&#x27;s still useful for on- the go touch ups when waxing is not convenient.</li>
            <li> Did not seem at all painful to me.  At age 70, my facial hair was very aging.  Face is now fuzz-free.  Hopefully I can throw away the cream I&#x27;ve been using for years and touchups will be easier.</li>
            <li> The spring seems to only grab fine hairs, completely missing the darker, thicker hairs on my chin that I purchased this to address. It&#x27;s also painful and time consuming. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this while sitting on the coach.  The first minute I didn&#x27;t feel anything and realized I wasn&#x27;t bending it enough. Once I figured it out, it pulled a little--only a bit painful on the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very quick, very easy, inexpensive and no chemicals to burn the skin. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Wow...just wow... This one is perfect... No need to use those wax or  those harsh hair removed, this one is perfect... It might hurt a little but its worth the hurt ...</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well and frankly any good hair removal has some pain involved.  I find if I use it in just a small area at a time, then take a break, that I can deal with the pain.  I am very fair skinned but absolutely hate how furry my face has gotten with age.  No coarse hair grows back just like with waxing or plucking which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the product but honestly, with the coarser facial hair I have, I think I&#x27;m better off with a standard tweezer. I got this to get rid of the very fine hairs that are noticeable up close on my face but I hate how time-consuming using this hair remover can be because it misses some of the hairs and I have to spend time constantly try to get rid of it by twisting it in different directions. Sometimes, I have to have a half an hour session just getting rid of those hairs. And the fact that they grow back so quickly? So annoying. Being able to grow hair fast is a blessing but also a curse in disguise. I was hoping I&#x27;d only have to use this about once every two weeks but I find that in order to be perfectly hairless, I have to probably use it every 3 or 4 days. Then there&#x27;s the fact that it hurts like a bitch in my more sensitive areas. Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product so I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much but honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again if I were to lose it or something.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this on Amazon.  The reviewers are correct in that there is a little bit of a learning curve.  In fact, the first time I used it I was a little overzealous, pressed too hard and gave myself some temporary bumps.  But the hint about holding the spring further up from the handles saved the day.  And the best part, no 5 o&#x27;clock stubble.  (I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this!)  Keeping up with it daily to hit the strays is key.  Spend the $20 if you&#x27;ve reached this stage in your life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned brunette who comes from a very hairy family. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of ways to deal with my moustache, from ignoring it (until my new niece pointedly asked why her new aunt had a moustache), to depilatories (which led to chemical burns and owieness), to waxing (which left me red for hours), to threading (which hurts like a sonuvagun but doesn&#x27;t leave me red).  This is comparable to threading except that I can do it myself. It yanks the hairs out nicely, hurts like a sonuvagun for few seconds, but then I&#x27;m left with nice hairless skin. Woot!</li>
            <li> I just got it today and used it right away. It works really well. I wish I knew this product before.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about six weeks and I LOVE it. I have quite a lot of coarse chin hair. It has always embarrassed me. I&#x27;ve tried tweezing, waxing, trimming- all with less than satisfactory and usually painful results. The REM spring is very easy to use and does not hurt. I get the best results if I use it right after washing my face in hot water before using any moisturizer. I&#x27;ve also learned that it helps to try rolling the spring in different directions over the same area. It only takes seconds to use and there is literally no mess. This is the BEST beauty product I have ever bought. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This was really effective for the first few times I used it. It hurts really bad at first, but you&#x27;ll get use to it. The reason this has three stars is because the hairs that are being pulled are getting stuck in the middle, which is hard to remove inside the coil. Not only that, but the handle became a little loose. Otherwise, this is a great alternative to remove facial hair. Fast and Effective.</li>
            <li> I found that this didn&#x27;t really work that well.  When it did grab a hair or two, it hurt like crazy.  Not worth the trouble to return it, but it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> With all the phenomenal reviews on this product, I expected much more. After using several times, I find it okay, at best. It does hurt a bit, but that isn&#x27;t what bothers me, as I had read that before purchasing. What does bother me is that it is time consuming to use, and it doesn&#x27;t even get all the hairs...or even close. You have to run over each area many times in several different directions, and even then, I wouldn&#x27;t call the job it does \\&quot;satisfactory.\\&quot; Also, as I had read in at least one other review, it does appear to \\&quot;break\\&quot; some hairs rather than pull them. Therefore, I still end up tweezing in addition to using this. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to use and the instructions are confusing. I do not recommend this product. I would like return it if I could.</li>
            <li> It Works well and is easy to use. It does a good job of removing the tiny hairs, the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for unwanted facial hair.  It was easy to use by following the simple instructions and now my face and chin are smooth and hairless.  Can&#x27;t wait to share this great solution with my Mom and my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> This little spring is so easy to use and it really does the job in seconds. I used to thread but I decided to try this and it&#x27;s soooo much quicker.  This is not for the eye area though so please don&#x27;t buy it for that.  As some other reviewers said, it does feel uncomfortable the first time you use it but after that it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything.  It&#x27;s super easy to use, there is no learning curve - just put the spring on there and roll.  I&#x27;ve found you don&#x27;t have to bend it for it to work, just play around with and see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with a lot of peachy facial hair and wanted to be able to remove it without using chemicals. This tool is not for fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have been my upper an lower lip waxed for years every 6 weeks, along with tweezing in between.  My daughter in law showed me this gizmo and I order on immediately.  No more waxing!  Best little device ever!  My face is bare of those nasty hairs and smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this has 4 stars. Yea sure, it kind of works. And yea sure, you need to get used to it (though I&#x27;m not sure if everyone can actually get used to it). Regardless, it hurts and it will keep hurting. I&#x27;m going to stick with shaving. Maybe it&#x27;s different for girls... I know you ladies don&#x27;t have the luxury to shave facial hair like us men. I just want to make it clear that this is going to hurt... and no matter how I look at it, it&#x27;s going to be a tedious job.</li>
            <li> This takes a little getting used to, but now I use it all the time.  Just roll it over my face to keep the hairs at bay! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I just got this and tried it and my face hasn&#x27;t felt this amazingly smooth since I can remember!! I am so excited over this product!&lt;br /&gt;And it did hurt but not as bad as I imagined.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001FXUTUM R.E.M. Spring]]  Extremely easy to use and it works well.  Slight sting but nowhere near as painful as waxing or tweezing.  You don&#x27;t even have to be in front of a mirror to use it.  I use it while reading.  Very cost effective versus waxing at a salon.</li>
            <li> a little difficult to master and does hurt a little.  I suspect you get used to it though - but advantage  of not having to even look in the mirror when you use  it and cleaning up all the tiny hairs is prob worth  it.  i&#x27;ll keep working with it!</li>
            <li> This thing is so amazing! As a Latina, I have mad side burns/facial hair, and this baby plucked the hairs right out! It&#x27;s painful at first but it&#x27;s a quick pain. Definitely beats going to the salon to get my hairy face threaded. LOL! This is for sure a money saver. I am so flipping happy I bought this thing. My face feels so soft and smooth, I simply love it! I even bought my sister one! ^_^</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I made sure to wash my face both before and after use.  I also used an astringent and my normal moisturizer when I was done.  This product still made be break out in the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had...maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  If you still want to try it, I&#x27;d recommend doing it when your life is pretty low key (i.e. not right before a job interview, reunion, photo session).  That way, you can give your face time heal.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I took a chance and bought this item.  It is much easier to use, much less painful, and much more effective than I expected - and gets easier very quickly.  My skin is very soft and smooth.  It is actually a little addictive.  Different degrees of bending do the job.  As instructed, you have to be very careful around the eyebrows, but I found that I can shape the spring over my brow and work up and away.  I have been looking for the right product for years. My only concerns are how long it will last and whether they might stop making it - I ordered a second one immediately and am actually thinking of buying a few more spares.</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned, brunette. I&#x27;ve had a mustache since I was 8 years old.. so needless to say my battle against my facial hair started early. I have literally tried it all. Depilatory creams, bleaches, microwave waxes, pre- waxed strips. I even spent about $70 at Sallys buying a wax warmer and all the accessories to use with it (which I am still grateful for..for the eyebrows!) and then when that became to cumbersome to keep up with every other day, I invested in an epilator. I have tried it all, with varying results.. but this tool has change everything!!    You do not have to be in front of a mirror, or near an outlet! I pick it up while I&#x27;m watching TV and go over my trouble areas.. or right before I wash my face at night. I use it everyday and I no longer have those inbetween waxing days where I feel less confident, my face is always hair free and smooth now. Now, I do have fast regrowth so someone less hairy might not have to use it ever day, but if you have to, this is the tool to do it. The irritation is minimal, I only experience redness for 15-30 minutes, whereas with waxing, 6 hours later my face would still be red.     There is a little bit of a learning curve, I just searched on youtube for tutorials or videos of people using it. You just have to turn the ends away from each other while moving the upside down \\&quot;U\\&quot; against the grain of the hair growth. Also play with the angles and the width of the U for different parts of your face. The more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll get it!    For $[...] I have regained a lot of confidence in my appearance, buy it.. you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> this product does work. the pain isn&#x27;t that bad. i did experience some breaking out. my only problem is getting around the curve of my jaw and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t go everywhere on your face (between brows e.g.) for me, i would have to use this every couple days to stay hair-free, which i haven&#x27;t done yet because i am leery of my skin breaking out.</li>
            <li> It is great and really remove hair by the roots without breaking them out , but you have to be accustomed to using  it correctly to get the best result. I used to go to salon to remove my  upper lip hair but  after I&#x27;ve got one of  spring sprong , i do my upper lip by myself. It a Little bit hurts but it saves my time and money ,and enables me to enjoy the best result ever .</li>
            <li> I am generally very skeptical of such products but this one actually works. I opened it and without much trouble figured out how to make it work. In 10 mins I had good hairless upper lip. It is  best for upper lip, can work on chin and cheeks too. But it wont work on eye brow area. Also, it needs a blowing through every now and then otherwise it does not work to it full potential. And if you have oily skin, you need to use a tissue to clean the skin first.  I am happy that I can do it anywhere even without the need of a mirror.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  You have to play around with it to figure out what works best.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t grab short hairs, and I can&#x27;t figure out how to clean out the inside of the  coil.</li>
            <li> Works well, once you get the hang of it! Beats the one by one method of hair removal using tweezers!</li>
            <li> I recently starting becoming self-conscious of the small brown hairs mixed in with the blond one on my upper lip (I just turned 30- ugh!). For several years all I ever did was cut them close to the skin with manicure scissors. This worked temporarily, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a long term solution. My first step to a clean upper lip was to try an at home waxing strip. That worked as well, but my lip was red for hours. I decided to purchase the Spring, because the reviews were great.     The first time I used the product I was shocked at the amount of pain involved. It really does hurt! If your skin is very sensitive to pain you might want to consider going to a professional (obviously you will still be in pain, but you aren&#x27;t inflicting it upon yourself), or bleaching might be your best bet. Well, I let the hairs grow back a little, and I tried this product again. The second time around the pain seems to have subsided a bit. I suppose I knew what to expect, so the pain was more tolerable. I would recommend this product to anyone that does not want to spend the money at a salon, and to someone that can handle the small bits of pain. The money spent is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, there are many, many nerve endings on your upper lip, using this device stings- BUT IT WORKS. And since the hairs grow back at different rates, the first time will be the worst.     I like the fact that it tends to grab the longer, coarser hairs, aka the hair you really want to be gone, and doesn&#x27;t do a \\&quot;clearcut\\&quot; like shaving or waxing. I&#x27;ve always had a lot of hair everywhere and having absolutely no hair on my face would just be weird. If I kept at it I could get rid of it all, so it&#x27;s even customizable.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and works as described by other Amazon reviewers.  I also learned from other reviews that the hair removal might be painful but this was only in learning how to use the tool in my case.  I would not hesitate to recommend this item. It does remove the hair!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Didn&#x27;t get a few short hairs but got everything else... No more tweezing for me, thank God!!</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do. I pulls out your fine hairs and it is easy to use. it&#x27;s a solid little tool for removing that nasty little mustache that women shouldn&#x27;t have. I like it so much I bought a second one for my friend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it really works! I still go to the salon occasionally for brow shaping, but this is a great tool for general upkeep.</li>
            <li> The REM is the best hair removal tool ever! I have tried so many things over the years- waxing, hair removal creams, electrolosis, lazer hair removal- but after a time, I realised that the process was either time consuming, expensive, or left the surface area uneven.  I read the reviews about this, but basically bought it as it said it was on Oprah- and we all trust the big O. When it arrived, I remember reading that some people had problems with how to use it- so I took my time to use it in different ways, trying to find the way that works best for me. What works best for me- is to actually roll it almost straight- with my fingers on the springy part- I just start at one end and roll it to the other in the opposite direction that the hairs are growing.   You can actually see the hairs being picked out by their roots- so many at once- it&#x27;s awesome.   I will never use anything else again. This is so cheap, so easy and so effective. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking myself to the waxers to remove irksome facial hair for more than a decade now, but I&#x27;ll never go again. This device works remarkably well to remove even tiny hairs on the chin, cheek and upper lip.  The discomfort involved is negligible and the product more than paid for itself during the first week I used it. If I use it for half a minute or so every day, my face remains perpetually mustache-free. Whoever invented this thing deserves to be rich.   Learning the knack of using the Spring Sprong is pretty easy, but if you want some tips just search YouTube to see the device in action. (I love this thing, but not enough to create a demonstration video! It fascinates me that some people care enough to go to such trouble.)  I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but the Spring Sprong deserves a plug.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product; once you get the hang of it, it is faster and more efficient than a tweezers. There is occasionally a hair or two left for my now neglected tweezers to take care of, but I don&#x27;t mind. If you&#x27;re sick of tweezing your chin or upper lip, pony up the cash, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to get rid of my chin hair.  I refused to shave as it seemed so masculine: waxing and lotions did not work.  I am not brave enough to pluck hairs so I thought the only solution was to try expensive laser treatment.  I bought the Spring Sprong as a last resort.  I am a new person!  My chin is smooth.  Such a fast and easy solution.  It does hurt but that brief moment of pain is so worth it!  Watch the videos and practice.  It took me until the third try to really pick up the hairs.</li>
            <li> After professional waxing, home wax strips, creme hair removers, electric tweezers and regular tweezers to remove a lot of facial hair (I am a female by the way), this product is the best, most effective, easy, cheapest and simplest solution of all, excellent product and great idea, simple to use. Hurts until you get used to it, after using a few times, the sensitivity to ripping hairs out of your face gets easier. Overall truly excellent and so glad I took a risk and gave it a try, it is now the only thing I use. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I always have problems with my upper lip and chin hairs. It kind of makes me feel low at times. Thanks god I accidently saw this when i was looking for an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not completely  beleive that this will work yet decided to try this and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i can get rid of unwanted facial hair anytime i want. and that really make me feel happy !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks to rem spring :)</li>
            <li> This implement appears to be the same as the tweezing I started doing when I was in my teens and all I got from doing that was MUCH WORSE facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now paying $60.00 for thirty minutes of electrology every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My electrologist said that because I tweezed for so many years, each facial follicle now had SEVERAL ROOTS and would take much longer to do than had I never tweezed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;URGE YOU TO CALL AN ELECTROLOGIST IN YOUR AREA AND ASK THEM ABOUT TWEEZING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the R.E.M. Spring for about a month now. I have a lot of visible blonde facial hair that I have always been self conscious about. In the past, I&#x27;ve regularly gotten it waxed or threaded. However, money is tight now so I decided to look for a cheap product I could use at home. I have very sensitive skin so I was wary of trying to wax it myself or using a depilatory cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found the R.E.M. Spring, it seemed like it was worth a shot. As other reviews have said, it takes a little figuring out and the first use or two can be pretty painful. However, once you figure it out and get over the \\&quot;first-use\\&quot; pain, it really seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can see the hairs and their roots on the Spring, that it&#x27;s small and lightweight, and that I can use it whenever I need to for a quick touch up. I generally use it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I find it doesn&#x27;t rip the hairs out from the root on my chin like it does elsewhere on my face. I&#x27;m hoping that with more use I can figure out an angle to hold it at so it doesn&#x27;t just break the hairs there. Other than that, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> At first I was scared to use this because I heard it hurts a lot at first. But then I built up my courage and used it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! It works very well too! I recommend this product because it works well and it&#x27;s easy!</li>
            <li> First of all, the instructions for this say that you&#x27;ll feel a slight tingling sensation. This is a lie. You will feel each individual hair being ripped from your flesh, not unlike some form of medieval torture. That said, though, the spring does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that the pain is about on the level of tweezing (which I find more painful than waxing) and it&#x27;s not unbearable, but if you&#x27;re going to be using this thing on sensitive facial areas or for any prolonged amount of time you&#x27;re going to feel it and it won&#x27;t be pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair removal itself isn&#x27;t particularly consistent, but if you stick with it you will get results. It&#x27;s pretty easy to use. You just do as the instructions say--bend it into an inverted u, place it against your skin where the hair is, and twist the handles (in the same direction). All it does is literally catch the hairs between the wires of the spring, and as you twist back and forth the hairs are pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d give it a solid \\&quot;OK\\&quot; because it does what it says it will, but it&#x27;s not any kind of miracle product.</li>
            <li> I had reservations about this product, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am so happy I did.  It REALLY does the job.  There is no learning curve to it...Just bend it and roll over the places you want hair to be removed.  It was a bit uncomfortable the first time I did it because I didn&#x27;t think it would take as many hairs all at once as it did.  However, my best advice to those using this is to think of it like pulling off a band aid...do it fast!!  I found that if I rolled the spring quickly over the area, it was far less painful than doing it slowly.  And, it seems to work much more effectively at removing hairs.  Once you get the majority of the hair removed, just follow up every couple of days for maintenance and there is virtually no pain involved.  I have thrown away all my hair remover creams since purchasing this.  I have ever found a product to work as effectively as this and will never use anything else!  I highly recommend this tool to EVERYONE who wants smooth skin!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. I read the reviews from other people who had purchased it and had no trouble using it to remove facial hair. The only problem...big problem... is that I appear to be allergic to whatever metal the spring is made from. I got rid of my unwanted hair and got a bumpy red rash wherever I used it. I tried washing my face immediately after using it and putting aloe vera on my face. That helped but did not alleviate the problem. In summary, the prodcut works great just be cautious if you have sensetive skin. [[ASIN:B001FXUTUM R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover]]</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product. It works great, does what it&#x27;s supposed to BUT it is painful! lol not so much in the upper lip but on the peach fuss on my face. I hear it gets better the more you use it but as much as it hurts I do not think I will use it too often and I have a pretty high tolerance for pain. I recommend it for the upper lip, it is fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;Btw I did not break out from it when I&#x27;ve used it on my face. I use  it on a clean face and clean the spring w my toner.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about this device, but bought it anyway because hair removal is such a chore and I&#x27;ll try almost anyhing that promises to make it easier. I&#x27;ve owned it now for a couple of months and I love it! I use it all the time and it works so well. The best part is how easy it is to use, and not painful for me! Now I will qualify that by saying that because it&#x27;s not painful for me, that doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t be for someone else. Of coirse that will depend on the thickness and number of hairs being removed as well as individual sensitivity to pain. But for me this is soooo much more comfortable than waxing, threading or even plucking. It should say something that I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one for a friend!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and the tool works easily.  Nowhere does it mention the misses that are built into the system.....the spring has to surround a hair to pull it out.  If you are off a bit, go back.  Easy to prevent redness.....do a couple of passes each night and you keep yourself completely hairless.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by the commentators that left specific instructions.  I found that if I bent the spring into a gentle shape and rolled both ends toward me, moving the spring up my cheek, it works perfectly.  This is the same as the right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise approach, just worded differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have preferred threading to waxing for its gentle, non-chemical approach.  Among my friends I do seem to have a higher tolerance for pain, or maybe it&#x27;s just an acceptance of the inevitable.  I can take this spring with me anywhere and will never need an appointment again.  This will save me money right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> hard to use, doesn&#x27;t beat going to the salon and use the tread</li>
            <li> This is a fun-to-use tool for removing facial hair and it&#x27;s soooo easy.  Waxing causes wrinkles and pulls your skin, whereas the R.E.M. Spring Sprong simply takes care of unwanted facial hair.  No regrets!  :-)</li>
            <li> This does do a nice job.  I didn&#x27;t feel as much of a pinch as others have reported, it feels more like a hair being tweezed out.  Not so bad.   I had used various cream hair removal products in the past, they worked, however they tended to leave my skin feeling \\&quot;odd\\&quot; and I would often have reddish blotches for a while after their use.  This spring does the job w/o leaving my skin feeling so weird and I did end up with blotches.  The reason I gave this just 3 stars (***) is because of what the product actually is.  It nothing more than a spring that could be purchased at most hardware or big Box stores.  The sleeve it comes in is worth less than a penny.   In the future if I need an extra I&#x27;ll go buy a spring and put a do-dad on the ends for the twisting part.</li>
            <li> This spring removed hair I didn&#x27;t even know I had (very fine). I opened it as soon as it arrived and was practicing in the car (passenger seat). Halfway through the car ride I was on my way to removing most of my chin hair. It is only a little painful (nothing major and very quick) but it works very well. There was one or two hairs that was difficult to get..you can be persistent or just grab tweezers for the 1 or 2 strays. But overall, my chin is now very smooth and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have very sensitive delicate skin and it removed my facial hair easily, quickly and didn&#x27;t hurt.  I only had a slight redness, and it went away within minutes. This product was much easier for me to use than waxing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and had all the unwanted hair on my face removed within 10 min.  This is so much easier than wax, less time consuming than tweezing and is totally awesome.  I love it.  It look me a few tries to get it to work, but once I got the hang of it it worked like a charm.  Left the areas where I removed hair a little bit red, but with way less irritation and mess than waxing would have.  I wish I knew about this years ago.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and was looking forward to using it. As a fair skinned brunette I get some dark hair on my upper lip and also a few dark hairs on the upper side of my neck. Not only being fair skinned but also having sensitive skin it is hard to find a product that works at &#x60;removing&#x27; the hair. I have tried everything from plucking to cream kits. The last thing I used that worked was a cream kit but for two days after my upper lip was so swollen and red from the chemicals I could barely talk. I would have to sleep with Neosporin on my upper lip after using the cream since it was so harsh. I read the reviews for this &#x60;spring&#x27; and figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it I was doubtful. It comes in a box with poorly explained instructions. It does come with a nice soft case to keep the spring in which was a plus. I read the instructions and it stated to hold the spring in an upside down &#x60;U&#x27; shape and push in and outward. I took the spring to a mirror and for 30 minutes nothing happened. I was ready to chalk this up to another failed device. I then watched the video for the device and it more or less is trying to sell it to you and not show you how to use it. I then went to the most popular video website and typed in the item and found one where a woman demonstrated using it. Right away I realized that when you hold it upside down you need to twist the ends left and right continuously in order for it to work. It did not state this in the instructions. Back to the mirror I went and sure enough with me twisting the ends constantly I felt it &#x60;grab&#x27; the hairs and slowly removing them. I will not say it was painless but then again your upper lip area is a very sensitive area. I was able to remove all the hairs and I did not have any redness after. It hurt during the process but no more pain afterwards. I also used it on the side of my upper neck and it removed those hairs as well. I did put some oil free moisturizer on my upper lip after to prevent any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was done I tapped the device hard to remove any loose hair and put it in the soft case it came with. Please note you cannot clean the device with water since it will rust. It recommends being cleaned with high pressured air. I will keep cleaning it the way I have been and hope it stays clean. Also remember to not share this with anyone, not even a family member. Not being able to disinfect it completely you don&#x27;t want to risk the possible infection to another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say when I first tried this I thought it was a waste and pure junk but now that I know how to use it I am so thankful for it. My upper lip is very soft and does not have the burn and irritation that I am used to. For the price and knowing you will be using it more than once it is a great investment. I would highly recommend this product. Give it some time to get used to learning how to use it and you will love it to!any dryness.

            <li> If it seems to good to be true...it is! I&#x27;m truly sorry that I bought it. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair unless it&#x27;s by accident. It&#x27;s faster to tweeze or just go to someone who does facial threading. This is a truly awful product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday, received it on Monday so super fast shipping!!!    I got 2, one for home, one for in my purse since I tweeze all the time.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and try it and all I can say is I LOVE THE RESULTS!  No irritation like I get with waxing (little pimple bumps) and nothing like the lotions, which burn my skin and still leave hairs...my skin is smooth, the hair is gone, all with very little discomfort.  Removing hair on the upper lip does smart a little but it hurts less than waxing.  I made sure to wash my skin, exfoliate, tone and moisturize, but I do that every night.  I washed my face before I used it, too, since I knew it would be my first use and I would get a lot of hair.  My hair is light but I have a good bit on my cheeks, jawline, chin and its fine above my lip, but I have some nasty \\&quot;witch hairs\\&quot; on my chin that look like whiskers and I am always tweezing them...they drive me crazy everyday, but this thing got all of them but the shortest ones.  In a day or two, they will be gone, too.  I think this little spring is my new best friend!!!      For those wondering how to clean it, I found that the ends unscrew and I just shook the hair out into the sink, reattached the end and kept going.  This is a keeper and I am telling everyone about it!  THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product after hearing about it from a friend. This spring works very well, I use it while I&#x27;m watching tv. It does hurt a little during, but nothing excessive. (It is ripping hair out of your skin girls. It&#x27;s gonna sting a bit.) But I haven&#x27;t noticed any weird bumps after, or any redness. So, I would definately reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> A miracle!  Try it- it will change your life!  It hurts a bit but grabs every single hair.  Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> This REM Spring Sprong is a wonderful product. I was not holding out much hope that this product would do the job, but after 10 years of tweezing and bleaching various areas of facial hair, I am a convert to the REM Spring Sprong. While, I will likely keep my tweezers nearby for singular strands of thicker facial hair, the REM Spring Sprong got my upper lip super smooth with only 20 minutes of effort the first time around. (The package suggests that regular maintainace will take much less time going forward). It also worked great on my cheeks. I had pretty good success on my chin/jawline area, but that was the somewhat  less fantastic of the three areas (upper lip, cheeks, and chin). It may be the angle that makes it more difficult to use the tool at the jawline. I am hopeful, though, that with more practice, I will be able to get into those nooks and crannies as well. I plan to order another one, so that I have a backup in my car for unexpected emergencies :)</li>
            <li> Removing facial hair is easy and fast for me now..leaves my skin soooo smooth. End of story &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! I have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), which causes abnormal facial hair in women. I have struggled with it for many years and I have used and tried everything out there, including several thousand dollars of laser hair removal, which did nothing but temporarily remove the hair and cause ingrown hairs. But, I have finally found the next best thing to true permanent hair removal (which just doesn&#x27;t exist yet). I&#x27;ll be honest, the first time I used it, the sensation was almost too much. But, if you keep up with it, you&#x27;ll never have to remove so many hairs at a time ever again. This results in a much less painful experience, in fact, I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the feeling because I know it&#x27;s working. Previously, my main concern was only the dark, coarse hairs on my face and not the peach fuzz, but this baby gets everything, leaving my face smoother and softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt it in my life. And, this is all accomplished without ANY irritation, redness, or breakouts whatsoever! I am very fair, and have extremely sensitive skin. Waxing, shaving and hair removal creams have all wreaked havoc on my skin leaving plucking as my only option. This product does in 5 minutes what I could never have accomplished with hours of plucking. It truly is amazing how simple, ingenious and effective this thing is. I don&#x27;t understand how people could not get it to work, all I had to do was touch my face with it and it was pulling out hair, and after some experimentation with angles, no hair stands a chance. I only ordered one for me and one for my sister, who loves it too, and I am going to order a few more for my purse and back up. PLEASE try this if you suffer with the humiliation and hassle of unwanted facial hair, you will be so thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li> I needed to find a way to manage unwanted facial hair removal at home - and this product works. The only down side is learning how to use it efficiently. Really happy that I bought it and like feeling empowered to maintain facial hair removal by myself.</li>
            <li> I just received the Spring Sprong in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out. I have been threading for years, but at $20 a visit, I either spend a lot of money over the year or I have peach fuzz on my lip! Anyway, I used this handy little tool today and could not be more pleased with the results. Luckily I have decent eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about those (there is a warning in the package not to use this on the eye area). The Spring Sprong did not hurt any more than threading does, it pulls out the tiny hairs, and it is much more cost effective! I recommend this to other ladies with peach fuzz-lip!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I did have some pimples pop up on areas used</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little product...I spend a lot of time and money going to the salon to have my upper lip hair threaded..The spring is so easy to use and does the job really well. I would definitely recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Hey this is the best product to remove facial hair. It takes no time to remove hair. It&#x27;s a must have item.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well to pull out a lot of hairs (especially not thicker ones). This is actually more painful than waxing, threading, or tweezing since it takes longer to pull out the hairs. Could be useful for those with only a bit of peach fuzz but it is painful. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product does exactly what I need it too. So easy to use and I just am thankful to whoever invented it. High five to that person!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for giving me a smooth hairless upper lip, chin, and sideburns. im totally native, similar to hispanic and was aaaalways frusterated with my peach fuzz and those several dark hairs on my li. I whipped it out of the box and started twisting and bending every which way and found that twisting them in the SAME direction upward AND downward both work as long as i put pressure on it, the pain along the jawline wasnt fun but only lasted a second, and its been 2 weeks and im still peach fuzz free. every other day I sit while watching t.v and role over the spots i hated and can feel little ones being pulled away, you can see them if you have a black background of clothing or something. GET THIS, YOU WILL FEEL NORMAL! not like a hairy animal. &#x3D;) hope i helped, cause this thing has givin me a more confident face.</li>
            <li> This product is okay if the hair you want to remove is fine and your skin is reasonably firm. It doesn&#x27;t grab coarse hair so well, and works pretty much only on skin that is fairly smooth/taut, so, because two hands are needed to operate it, it doesn&#x27;t work too well at all for those who would have to pull their skin taut to shave it. Still, it&#x27;s good for the upper lip area, particularly if you don&#x27;t like the idea of having a blade or an electric shaver near your nose, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It does not pickup thin hairs.. plus I dont want to spend 20mins just to get adjusted to work... waste of money.</li>
            <li> Seriously addicting. The BEST, easiest, fastest, &amp; least expensive hair removal product I have tried. Sooo glad I tried it! It does hurt a little at first on cheeks &amp; right under nose but it gets better :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26-year-old woman, and I like looking my best for my female partner.  Now, I love havin&#x27; a good lookin&#x27; mustache every now and then, but the little lady says she prefers clean shaven skin.    So naturally, I browsed Amazon for the highest rated hair remover, and when I saw this had 4 1/2 stars out of 5, I purchased it within seconds.      When my package finally arrived, I opened it up and ran inside the bathroom, locking the door so my partner wouldn&#x27;t see what I was doing.  When she knocked on the door and asked \\&quot;Hey, what are you doing in there?\\&quot; I had to tell her I was taking a big dump.  Worked like a charm.  She knows how I love my dumps.    When I followed the directions perfectly, the R.E.M Spring Sprong failed to remove any of my hair.  What it did succeed in, however, was pinching the hell out of my skin, leaving it red and bloody.  Some of the blood caused by this injury leaked into my mustache, giving it a red-black tone that looked simply atrocious.    When I came out of the bathroom, my partner looked at me with a shocked face and said \\&quot;You look like hell!\\&quot;    Completely miserable, the only way I could respond to this was by saying \\&quot;Thanks!\\&quot;    Trust me, ladies.  It doesn&#x27;t work on mustache hair.  I will never trust positive Amazon reviews again.  Now she wants me to get rid of my butt hair...  Here we go again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money and time.</li>
            <li> It clears lots of hairs away fast, but they come back thicker and darker which means it is not pulling the roots out - only cutting the hairs.  As if that wasn&#x27;t enough of a problem, this thing can&#x27;t grab the big hairs, only the little thin ones.  STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that someone invented this. I use to was with homemade sugar and lemon wax, but it would usually leave me with red spots and blemishes. This method does not. Just make sure that when you are trying to clean out the hair in the middle, you don&#x27;t stretch out the springs. I made that (dumb) mistake and had to order a new one for myself. *sign* you live and you learn, right?</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!    I wasn&#x27;t even looking for it, but came accross it one day when shopping for Beauty stuff and hair removal.    I saw A LOT of reviews of people that couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it, or it took them a while.    So I looked up videos, people demonstrated it, and it looked simple.      When I got my REM Spring, I opened it, and started rolling. IT WORKED PERFECT!!!  Yes, it did hurt a bit, but so does waxing.   Eventually, your skin and hair will get used to being pulled, that you won&#x27;t even be able to tell it hurts after a few uses.    I always paid 28+tip at the salon every few weeks to get my chin, eyebrows and lip waxed. NOW, I do my chin in seconds, my lip in seconds and I pluck my own eyebrows. I SAVE over $230.00 per year with this little superstar.     Warning: DO NOT use this REM Spring near your eyebrows. IT WILL CATCH YOUR EYELASHES AND IT WILL PULL THEM OUT!    Other than that. This is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My chin and lip hairs have even gotten thinner, and some have even stopped growing out. Yay!!</li>
            <li> I am old enough now to be getting unwanted facial hair growth.  This spring is one of my favorite purchases I&#x27;ve made in years.  It really works!  It&#x27;s easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time.  It&#x27;s pretty \\&quot;ouchy\\&quot; on my upper lip, but it does such a good job that it&#x27;s worth it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all on my chin and neck.  Totally worth every penny of the purchase price.</li>
            <li> Being in my 50s and in menopause for several years, I know all about doing the battle with facial hair.  I am not one of those women who feels she must remove every last hair on her face.  The very fine peach fuzz isn&#x27;t my concern.  For me, it is about getting rid of the dark upper lip hair and the scattered coarse \\&quot;man whiskers\\&quot; I get on my chin.  Over the years, I have tried different things but ultimately nothing seemed to work better than the tweezers.  So when I saw this little gadget with its good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  If it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t going to be out of a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has taken me a little while to figure out how get around all the curves of my chin where I have the coarser hairs.  It will remove these, but since I am still learning I usually need several passes to get them all and do occasionally resort to the tweezers for some final touch up. For the finer hairs on my upper lip, it whips those out with no trouble at all.  It does smart especially under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best is it is fast, and I am not spending so much time with the tweezers. I gave the product 4 stars due to the learning curve on how to use it, and I still occasionally must resort to the tweezers.  However, in all fairness my tweezer days may end completely as I become more proficient.  All in all, it is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Works great, has been the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far. Nice that you can thin hairs this way, don&#x27;t have to worry about the in-between stages of hair re-growth that waxing has.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was super easy to use. Sure, it hurts a little, but less than waxing. Plus you do not have to sit infront of a mirror to use it. I sit and watch TV and run it over my upper lip area, my jaw line, my chin. I have never been smoother or hair free! LOVE IT! Shoot, it&#x27;s cheap enough... stop debating and just try it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product for gifts to family and friends. I have used it and it works great. I can use it while I am watching TV, because you don&#x27;t need a mirror; just touch the area until it feels soft.</li>
            <li> The product description mentions nowhere that this item cannot be used on eyebrows. It says so in the instructions in the package. The U-bend is wide enough to not fit between the brow or under it, risk of catching eyelashes.   As for upper lip - it worked, but only cut the hair short instead of pulling them out so I was left with very tiny hair that couldn&#x27;t be tweezed or waxed and had to be bleached.  I got it with free shipping with Prime, but the return shipping will be $6, so not worth returning.</li>
            <li> It is ok for hair removal on the upper lip, but I just can&#x27;t get it to work on my cheeks or chin at all, so I suppose for light touch ups on the upper lip in between waxing it works, but I can&#x27;t rely on this for my only method of hair removal.  It stings a bit, but I don&#x27;t think it is too painful to deal with.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly easy to use, much easier than some of the other reviews led me to expect.  Very effective, and relatively painless.  Sure, there&#x27;s some stinging but nothing to make your eyes water or anything.  Less than 2 minutes and I was done.  Fantastic invention.</li>
            <li> If you tweeze, wax or use a shaving facial groomer, this is way better. It does smart the first few times, but so does tweezing or waxing. VERY fast, little to no irritation, and it&#x27;s totally portable. No more worries about bright sunshine, close-up encounters. Sure, it&#x27;s just like a minature slinky with handles, and probably costs $0.01 to manufacture, but compared to the cost of other hair removal systems and the sheer ingenuity and speed of the product, it&#x27;s worth the $13.00 any day!!</li>
            <li> So I have to admit that I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make this thing work until I went on the web and found a few video&#x27;s with demo&#x27;s on them.  Once I watched and practiced, I had no problem using this product.  If you&#x27;ve ever had your face \\&quot;threaded\\&quot; before, then you&#x27;ll recognize the discomfort.  This little tool is really handy!  I&#x27;m a Latina and have plenty of unwanted hair on my face!!  This cool spring really does a great job getting rid of all the fuzzy, fine hair all over your face.  For thicker hairs, it&#x27;s a hit or miss...but that&#x27;s what tweezers are for.  I use mine every few days so that the hairs are still short and it hurts less the more often you use it.  Be careful near your eyes and eyebrows, you cam easily snag hairs you didn&#x27;t intend to remove...but otherwise...go nuts!  The tighter you can make the skin in the area you&#x27;re working on, the better the results.  I love being hair free, my skin looks so much nicer without the fuzz!  :)  Be sure to use a mild toner afterward and moisturize!  They help the redness fade quickly...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  I have been fighting the stash for a few years... I don&#x27;t want to talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;This works amazing!  Yes it hurts a little, but if you have been tweezing you can handle it.  This tool makes the plucking a much faster process.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and you can watch TV while you do it instead of squinting to see in a magnified mirror one hair at a time.  You don&#x27;t even have to be able to see the hair... it will grab it.  Watch a YouTube video on &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a snap.  I wish I had known about this thing years ago.</li>
            <li> Super painful, and one of my handles broke immediately so that it doesn&#x27;t twist correctly.  Not worth the pain and time.</li>
            <li> The answers to my prayers!!  It takes a little practice, but works like nothing else to remove the tiniest facial hairs.  I&#x27;m thrilled with it!!</li>
            <li> i have had pcos since i was 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;awful. aside from a bunch of other crap, you have to deal with facial hair. i&#x27;m 25. what 25 year old female wants to look like a man? not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway- i just got this about half an hr ago- cleaned my face (so hopefully i won&#x27;t get the acne others were complaining about- thanks for the tip guys) and put this baby to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve done threading, waxing, shaving, creams, etc. threading is my favorite- but it&#x27;s still pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this spring is perfect. i&#x27;m not going to lie- it hurt like hell at first. so i stopped for a few minutes, then continued. eventually i left the bathroom and sat in front of the tv doing this- it hurt less (probably bc i wasn&#x27;t paying attention) and now i&#x27;m nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also- for those ladies who said it doesn&#x27;t get the coarse hairs- it DOES. you may just have to adjust or go over a few more times, but it comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, i suggest buying this!</li>
            <li> My spouse is using this hair remover for a month ... she is satisfied with this device ... She recommends this device her friends...</li>
            <li> It takes more time than waxing, but less than tweezing.  The pain is tolerable everywhere except the upper lip.  I also bought Dr. Numb numbing cream and can use this on my upper lip now with way less pain.  All in all a great product for me to use in between waxings or in case of emergencies (like going out and can&#x27;t get an appt to get waxed).</li>
            <li> This actually works well. It takes some experimentation to use it but once you get it down, it is effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dark hair on my upper lip (that I usually bleach)and those annoying \\&quot;goat hairs\\&quot; on my chin. Well, the older I get, the harder it is to tweeze those little devils since I can&#x27;t hardly see them any more, dagnabit. This REM spring yanks them out pretty well. I am finding it easier to use than I expected. Pulling the hairs above my lip was quite easy, in fact, it took very little time to make a noticeable difference. It takes more persistence to get the ones under my chin. I expect this is due to the shape of my face, since the spring seems to work better on a more convex surface and it&#x27;s easier to pooch out your lip than your neck. (For me, anyway!)    I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call this a painless procedure (how could ripping hair out be painless?) but it&#x27;s not bad, especially if you don&#x27;t go crazy and try to get every last hair right away.     Also, I have to admit that I love the fact that this little gizmo is silent, unlike the epilator I considered buying. Because if I had to deal with my kids coming in the bathroom to see \\&quot;what mom&#x27;s doing\\&quot;, I&#x27;d probably go mental.</li>
            <li> Interesting product. Sturdy feel in your hand. Definitely works on any hair - even fine hair, but hurts like woe. Not too sure how hygienic it is as it&#x27;s metal so you cannot wash it.</li>
            <li> This little spring is well made and solid. I purchased one of those cheap ones also and it was not good. This works well on light to mediums size hairs but thicker hairs still need tweezers.</li>
            <li> Definitely takes some getting used to the pain associated with tearing your hair out of a sensitive area, but the money saved on waxing makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been removing hair on my upper lip for years. I&#x27;ve used Nad&#x27;s, Nair, and Sally&#x27;s Hansen&#x27;s wax strips, and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ll never buy any of them ever again. Nad&#x27;s caused acne, Nair is just awful, and Sally Hansen&#x27;s worked ok but it&#x27;s gooey, painful enough that I had to &#x27;brace myself&#x27; to pull the strips off and I ended up cutting up the larger pieces for my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;The spring came in a padded envelope, the package squashed flat but the product undamaged. After a little maneuvering I figured out that holding it in a gentle U shape- not too close to a V!!!- with my thumbs facing each other, the U shape close to touching my face, almost straight up and down! and rolling it briskly back and forth worked perfectly to pull out every last little fine hair that often escapes my imperfect attempt at waxing...&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t hurt very much, less so I thought than waxing, but I&#x27;ve been tormenting my upper lip for years, so I thought I&#x27;d try it on a place that I&#x27;d never shorn, along my chin and it was a little more painful but not much.&lt;br /&gt;The hair re-growth is absolutely normal with what I experienced waxing, I&#x27;ve had it about a month and used it once thoroughly and did a little retouch two weeks later. I experienced a little break out on my chin where I hadn&#x27;t ever removed hairs, but my upper tougher lip was better overall for the wear!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this! You&#x27;ve got to fiddle with it to get it working right, if it pinches or doesn&#x27;t pull out hair, try a different angle and roll!! It *will* work, and work great.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product at first, but after reading all the positive reviews, I decided that I&#x27;d have to try it for myself.  The product is super easy to use once you figure out which direction to roll it.  I had some problems with some of the fine hairs breaking, but I was rolling it too fast.  Once I slowed down, the hairs were pulling out at the root.  It&#x27;s definitely NOT painless, tears were rolling down my cheeks when I did my upper lip.  But, it was so worth it!  Upper lip looks great and the hair pulled out at the root!  I also used it on the \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot; on my cheeks.  The hair isn&#x27;t completely gone yet, but considering this is my first try with the spring, I&#x27;m very happy!  I plan on using this product a few times a week, just to keep up with it.  I can&#x27;t believe all the hair this little spring trapped.  Overall fantastic product, great price!  I&#x27;m ordering another for a spare and telling my friends as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:  After I wrote this review, I broke out ALL OVER my face from using this product.  I still use it but make sure to wipe the spring with alcohol pads before, during and after use.  I also wipe my upper lip with an alcohol wipe prior to using the spring and use witch hazel after to close pores.  This product is effective, but has not become any less painful to use!</li>
            <li> I had been watching demos of another brand but it came in a set of two. This one was offered as a single so i tried it. It works good in the mouth and chin region. Still getting used to it. There is some pain at first but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I bought one for my daughter. She likes it too.</li>
            <li> Just got the R.E.M. hair remover a couple of weeks ago.  I have very sensitive skin so I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me.  I&#x27;ve tried waxing, depilatories and tweezing.  The only thing that didn&#x27;t give me a rash was tweezing.  But that is time consuming.  I gave this little gizmo a try and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It works great and my sensitive skin is not complaining.  Everyone talked about how much it hurt, but honestly, I think it hurts much less than waxing.  Wish I&#x27;d found this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money.  Even with washing my face before and after use, it still caused pimples (which I am not even usually that prone to getting).  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t even work on the coarser hairs. It only really works on the fine hairs. And then you get pimples where you used it. FAIL. *many sad faces*</li>
            <li> I simply cannot believe this product works as it does.  I read the reviews and bought it with a huge dose of doubt that it could work; however, for such a small price, I decided to try it.  Imagine my surprise when it worked exactly as advertised!  I have been having my face waxed monthly for years at a per time cost that is about the same as this product.  I read instructions and tried it.  It WORKS!  And, it is quicker and less painful than waxing.  Some things that seem too good to be true are true!  Reviews that state it does not work as directed must not have used as directed.  I did as it said--hold in U shape and just twist it back and forth with fingers.  Wow!  You&#x27;ve got to try this product.</li>
            <li> i bought this because the hair on my chin is getting out of control.  It is not fine hair or fuzz.  It is beard hair that is starting to come in gray.  I got tired of waxing and letting the hair grow to a sufficient length to wax again because that means visable hair. The spring takes some getting used to. It was difficult to handle and it is painful but beauty is pain right?.......Right??? Anywho,  I think the sping pulls some hair and cuts some hair but that isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me because I will just break out the trusty tweezers to get the ones that don&#x27;t come out from the root</li>
            <li> all I can scream is:&amp;#34; freakin&#x27; OUCH!!!&amp;#34;  This stupid thing hurts like heck. I will stick to waxing, thanks. I don&#x27;t like this thing ... you might, but I don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of experimenting with the amount of flex and how to turn the handles, but once you get used to it, it works great.  I love the fact that you can use it anytime you want without having to go to the threading studios.</li>
            <li> I tried the product because of all the great reviews.  I have PCOS and because of the hormonal imbalance, I get hair on my chin and a few on my jaw line, neckline and upper lip.  This product only removed about 20% of the hair on my chin (I wouldn&#x27;t dare try in on any other part of my face) and resulted in ingrown hairs (bumps) as well as sore skin; plus, I didn&#x27;t always removed hair from the root.  Also, it would take me  5-10 minutes of rubbing the gadget on my face just to get the poor results that I got.  I&#x27;d rather have it wax!  Better results, less pain and more consistent results with waxing.  I guess my sking is way more sensitive than many of the other posters.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because it actually DOES work, but it is probably the most painful thing I have ever used for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Great at removing hair, however causes tiny whiteheads on my chin the day after using.  That is despite cleaning both my skin and the epilator, and avoiding makeup and creams the entire following day.  I think this could just be my skin type, but be aware that it could happen to you.  I use it between my eyebrows only now, and I use a Finishing Touch and tweezers for the errant chin hair.</li>
            <li> Completely frustrated the other night I was looking up depilatory creams and this popped up as a suggestion.  After a few hours of researching and reading reviews I decided that I didn&#x27;t have much to lose if it was terrible and a lot to gain if it wasn&#x27;t and ordered one.  I can see where people would think that the spring is confusing to use right out of the box but because I&#x27;d spent some time on youtube researching I already felt that I had a handle on it.  It really isn&#x27;t hard to do at all once you get the motion down.  Some people complain because it hurts... well personally I think that waxing hurts worse and it is so much better than trying to tweeze each hair one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this and are on the fence know a few things:&lt;br /&gt;1) You are ripping hair out by the root, it is going to hurt and you are lying to yourself if you think it isn&#x27;t going to.&lt;br /&gt;2) The hair needs to be long enough to tweeze in order for this to pick it up.  Don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re going to be able to pick up teeny tiny stubble, that is just unrealistic.&lt;br /&gt;3) Read the inbox directions but if you are a visual learner then go and watch some videos on youtube and you will pick it up in no time.&lt;br /&gt;4) It is completely addictive! You will become a hair eradication machine. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully. My face is all hair-free now, it only took 20 min. It is very sturdy as well. I have sensitive skin, and it works great, no breakouts!I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I only bought this because of all of the favorable reviews.  I was still skeptical but it really works!  I have been plucking for years and so I&#x27;m used to the pain.  I expected this to be worse than it is.  I expected it to be harder to get the hang of than it was.  All in all, I am so pleased it surprised me.  I need to get out the tweezers to pluck a couple of strays about once a week.  Other than that, this little gadget takes care of it.  The best thing is, no mirrors necessary.    I have tried wax, creams (ate holes in my skin), even laser hair removal(doesn&#x27;t work on grey hairs) and this is the only thing that really works with a minimum of effort. I am so pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Just received my R.E.M Spring today!I was contemplating laser treatment for my chin but that was before i received this product. I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it would do me any justice, but yes girls this is a magic wand or should I say spring! I would definitely recommend this to anyone suffering with unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered my REM Spring on Sunday March 35 and it arrived today on Wednesday. Extremely fast service! The product is amazing. It takes a minute to figure out how to twist it. I had already looked up videos on YouTube to figure out how to use it. I have PCOS and I have extremely thick dark facial hair. I have tried everything possible and spent hundreds of dollars on trying to get rid of it. I was finally to the point of looking for electrolysis, then I found this wonderful product. The first time it does hurt, but so does any facial hair remover. But it is fast and easy, but with the long lasting effects of tweezing. It pulls the hair out at the root and leaves the skin smooth. I didn&#x27;t get any irritation, it hurt a little but I rather have it hurt and work! The price is extremely affordable, especially for a product that you can use everyday and all the time! The first time is the hardest because there is the most hair to remove and it hurts the most. The next time you use it, it is just maintenance. I heard through videos I watched that it is best to use it a lot to keep the nerves use to it, because if you go a long time without using it then it will really hurt when you use it again. A+ product and A+ service, do yourself a favor and order it. It is the perfect solution and now I have a little less stress in my life. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to get this to remove thinner hairs, but I haven&#x27;t been able to grab the thicker hairs, so it hasn&#x27;t replaced regular visits to a threading salon for me. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t gotten the technique quite right yet, so I&#x27;ll keep at it, but I&#x27;m skeptical and wish the instructions for proper use were clearer.</li>
            <li> Like the title says....I could see how some people would find this type of hair removal annoying. Personally, I find it fun! It does take some practice to get it down and even then it&#x27;s not completely precise but at my age (let&#x27;s just say \\&quot;older\\&quot;)I only have a few chin hairs that I have to clean up and it&#x27;s kinda fun playing with this silly thing. If you can&#x27;t be bothered, this is probably not for you. I don&#x27;t find it any more painful than plucking your eyebrows, probably even less so because plucking makes me sneeze and it&#x27;s a thinner more delicate area than my chin. I don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;moustache\\&quot; so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> This product changed my life; i finally get to say goodbye to wax! i only use wax for my upper lip but its such a hassle and so costly if you have to wax it every week. this is much like threading but way easier. you have to figure out how to use it the propper way tho. you gotta play around with it. its good for small places like your upper lip and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Because I have more and more facial hair as I get older, this product might be more painful for me.  If you keep up with it and not allow too many days between, it is much less painful.  The valuable points are that it is very easily portable and you can work with it while you watch TV or wherever you are sitting (in private).  And, it is not messy!  It may windup being a 5 star after I use it for a longer period, but not yet.  However, I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> This hurts and it burns your skin I hated it.</li>
            <li> If used correctly this is a very good product. Sure it hurts, but how can anyone think that pulling out hair would feel good. It is safe and does not leave scars like waxing, and the more you do the less hair you will have to pull out and it will get finer.</li>
            <li> I can not express what a relief it is to find something that works and is easy to use.  I&#x27;m 37, like many women I have horrible facial hair, something that I was ashamed of and always battled ever since I can remember. I didn&#x27;t care for chemical creams, never could quit get the hang of waxing, and plucking hair one at a time was time consuming.  So yes I resorted to shaving, it is embarrising but true. One week ago in my quest to find hair relife I stumbled across this product and I am now hair free, and released from the burdon of a razor.  This product does take just a bit to get used to. I did not need to watch the videos, but found it reassuring that there was support. I found that it really helps to just use all kinds of different angles on your face and contoring to your chin.  I had very course hair, some of it dark though I am fair skinned.  This got all of it!!!  Now I must warn it hurts, alot the first time.  But maybe after 5 min your skin just gets numb.  I was relentless and wanted to be hair free in one night, which I would say I was 95% hair free after a good 20 min, maybe more time.  I had alot of hair and, y chin was the most stubborn area.  Each day since, I have used it every night to get rid of the rest of my hair, some areas needed to grow a bit longer. This now takes 1 to 2 min tops. I had a very few darn stubborn hairs that I did use the tweezers on.  This DOES work on very very course hair! I cannot express how nice it is not to worry about my facial hair or 5 o&#x27;clock stubble. This is the only product I will ever need to use.  I plan to buy one for my suitcase and a few for friends.  I also did not have any reactions, though I did not wear any makeup the day I did my mass execution on my facial hair.  Buy this, you will be so glad that you did.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for facial hair removal.  It&#x27;s quick and easy.  It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It does hurt to use this product but the product works great!!! If you&#x27;re not used to hairs being pulled as a removal system i don&#x27;t recommend this for you. It does grab all the hairs though and gets them out from the root wich is important!</li>
            <li> Never before have I encountered a product such as this!  I read all customer reviews before puchasing this item and they seemed unbelievable.  The good news is they&#x27;re not!  This tool is so simple and produces amazing results!  I have always been blessed with a lot of facial hair.  Have tried waxing, triming, creams, etc. and have never been satisfied with results.  Within 30 minutes of receiving this item, I was \\&quot;hair free\\&quot;!  It has been 3 days now and still no hair in sight - not even a stubble!  Please try this product - you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> After following all instructions I had to go over my face several times to get rid of the hair. It was painful when used on my upper lip and the worst thing of all is my face broke out with painful pimples. I have no idea why. I washed my face thoroughly etc. I will try again and hopefully it will be better.</li>
            <li> Glad to have read the reviews before trying to use this - it definitely takes some getting used to but once I got the hang of it I was very impressed! Just \\&quot;man up\\&quot; and get through the first few passes and your skin will desensitize. I mean, we&#x27;re removing hair by the root here! It goes quick and easy once you get the bend-twist-roll technique going. I think the price is very good and the quality of the product is high.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this hurts so bad! What are these five star reviewers thinking? Go to the mirror with a pair of tweezers and pluck out a nose hair; the pain is comparable. Now ask yourself if you can handle doing that to your face multiple times. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. I suppose it does what it says but geeze. Made in Israel.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked better for me. I love it and it is so much faster than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on short hair.  I would not recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> First of all this is a hair remover so of course there is going to be some pain.  At first it does hurt but with continued use it hurts less and less.  I didn&#x27;t find that it hurt any worse than tweezing.  It does a really good job with getting the fine hairs but if you have coarser hair it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  All in all I like it and still use it.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female who&#x27;s always had like a dark shadow on upper lip after trying to shave, epilate (the worst), and even tweeze the hairs. I was just considering getting it waxed for the first time until I finally decided to chuck out $15 for this after seeing some girl on Youtube recommend it over 3 years ago! If only I had invested in this sooner. You just bend it into a U shape, and roll it inward/outward. I do both to catch all the hairs faster. Usually if I run my tongue along my upper lip after shaving or whatever, the stubble is crazy. But now it&#x27;s smooth, I honestly can&#x27;t believe how even the shadow is gone. This is the best, I swear.</li>
            <li> Me: 1/2 italian, 46 &amp; perimenopausal. Yes a perfect storm for facial hair. Always had moustache (started bleaching in high school) &amp; now, with hormones... I&#x27;m adding CHIN HAIRS?! And lots of em. Yikes! Could NOT stay on top of it no matter how hard i tried. Coming in thicker, both moustache AND chin. VERY depressing. So desperate started \\&quot;bic-ing\\&quot; my chin. But the stubble! and so soon! SIGH! Was miserable. Waxing - no $ or time for neither salon or at-home. Tweezing - exhausting. Hair removal cream - too long it burns, not long enough didn&#x27;t work. And the smell, yuck. Saw this little product, was skeptical. Read the reviews. They&#x27;re all very thorough and detailed. Couldn&#x27;t NOT try. Now i&#x27;m hair free on the lip and chin (&amp; have u ever really checked out the area right under the bottom lip? i was horrified). But it&#x27;s ok. This product... (sigh of happiness). My only regret is i never found it sooner. i will NEVER be without it the rest of my life. And i&#x27;m not being dramatic. Yes, it&#x27;s comically shocking the first couple of times. My friend actually shouted \\&quot;son of a mother!\\&quot; when it first worked on her upper lip. BUT it got like 12 hairs. All at one time! (she still bought one). Just start slowly and maybe on the chin, to get used to it. I do it every few days to catch the new stealth hairs. I&#x27;ll lay in bed watching tv and doing it and don&#x27;t even blink an eye now. I rub my chin all the time amazed at how smooth it is. All the time. Seriously. I&#x27;m really so very happy and NEVER have to worry or fret again. If only all life&#x27;s problems had such a simple solution. Thanks for listening to MY story.</li>
            <li> This really is a great item. I usually thread my upper lip, but this is faster and less painful. There are some cheaper versions out there, and I wonder if they work just as well, as 20$ for a spring seems a bit overpriced. I&#x27;m going to get a cheaper one and see. Maybe you should as well before buying this pricier version.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can name is that it&#x27;s not as precise as threading. It does leave some hairs behind, which you need to go over again to get. I think with practice this will become less commmon.&lt;br /&gt;Good item, would buy again and as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have battled with hair on my upper lip for two decades.  I have bleached, tweezed, waxed and even tried electrolysis.  Now that I am older, I have dark hairs growing on my neck and jawline.  Not pretty.  I could not keep up with plucking and waxing, and laser hair removal is just too expensive.  I read the positive reviews on this product, and decided to give it a try as it was inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought it.  I recommend watching youtube videos first to get the hang of using it.  I experienced only mild discomfort the first time I used it - but I have been waxing for years and may have built up some tolerance to pain.  I was amazed at how many hairs were removed.  I plan on using it twice a week to stay on top of the regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product four stars is because it did not remove some fine, dark hairs on my neck.  I could not pull the skin taut enough to then properly roll the remover to grab the hairs.  I also had to make several attempts to pull the coarser dark hairs from my chin and upper lip.  I will probably just pluck these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product - easy to use, good price, does the trick!</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my own face: chin and \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; for years. Waxing is a painful, messy ordeal, and in between waxings my hair growth is unsightly.  The REM Spring is so simple and easy to use and very effective. I love that I can do a little every day, so don&#x27;t have to wait for hair growth between waxings. It is a little unpleasant to pull the hairs out, but not painful. I am excited about how portable this tool is to use. While I was unable to wax my upper lip due to my sensitive skin, my upper lip is now hair free thanks to the REM Spring! My skin feels soft and is not irritated. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for about 2 weeks now and just love it.  It is not pain free, but no method of hair removal is.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Pretty ingenious!  The pain is less than waxing, and more equivalent to threading or tweezing.  It is pretty thorough in removing fine hairs, although certain areas always seem more difficult to remove hairs for some reason.  I have only tried this on the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> This item is very painful to use, and it didn&#x27;t do a great job of removing the hair.  I purchased 2, one for me and one for my mom, but they are both going in the yard sale.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of this thing, I loved it.  I wasn&#x27;t visualizing it correctly when I tried it the first time, it was a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; experience.  Then I pulled up a video and went, &amp;#34;Ohhh!  So *that&#x27;s* how you use it!&amp;#34;  The second attempt was much better.  Shipping was a little slow but it wasn&#x27;t terrible so  I was okay with it overall.  I would totally purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to get this device to work after several weeks of using it every day. If I don&#x27;t \\&quot;get the hang of it\\&quot; soon I will go back to waxing.</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition...it is easy to use, and it actually works...It doesn&#x27;t hurt if you have tweezed before...I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product and tried it out right away.  Yes, it was very painful on my upper lip as I have not plucked that area, although I have shaved it for many years.  It was much less painful on my chin as I have plucked that area for many years and it was not an issue.    I did not like that I was not able to control it enough to reach certain hairs so I ended up plucking as well.  I&#x27;ve since moved to an epilator because it is less painful and faster on my upper lip (no doubt due to the use of this product!).  I hope to use it again in the future for touch ups once I build up my pain tolerance.  Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to get to clear, hairless skin with this product, I had a lot of stray hairs that were not removed.      I&#x27;ve seen a more advanced threading gadget that is available for $150 but I&#x27;m not ready to step up to the type of price.  Hopefully this product will continue to be enhanced to make it more controllable, i.e. able to hone in on specific hairs to be removed.</li>
            <li> This was not as painful as I thought It was going to be I mean I have tried it all Tweezing, Threading, waxing,and the creams too! and this by far is the one that I thought Got rid of my hair the best and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the way that waxing and threading do so I am going to keep using this product instead of the others because it works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, but it&#x27;s hard to keep. Every time I let one of my lady friends or a lady family member use it, they take it and I have to buy a new one!! Sometimes I see women walking around with little blonde beards and I want to tell them about the spring, but that would be too rude, Right?!   So, if you&#x27;re are one of those ladies, like myself, just buy this already.  You won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and have PCOS so I have hair on my face. It has gotten so unbearable I had to do something to get rid of it. I did my homework on this gadget and it seemed to be good. I got it in the mail today and went straight to the bathroom to use it! I love this thing! I think every Woman who wants to remove hair should use it! It hurts a little but considering that you are pulling hair out of your face, it is going to hurt. It is better than tweezing hair off your face because the REM spring gets it off fast and more pain free than tweezers. Bottom line buy it you will like it! A plus is about the product is not made in CHINA!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t really bother explaining how to use it...there are plenty of other users who have done a great job with that so far.  As some of them have mentioned, it takes a little bit to figure out how to best use it, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a little different for everyone.  I would just like to say that it definitely grabs all hairs, no matter how short they are, so it&#x27;s already better than waxing because you don&#x27;t have to worry about letting hairs grow out to ridiculous or embarrassing lengths in between, and no appointments are neccessary.  I would just like to recommend that the first time you use it, do it at night so that you&#x27;re not walking around all day with a red face (I would assume most people will turn at least pink when pulling hair out of their skin).  Also, be sure to wash, tone, and use a soothing non-comedogenic moisturizer afterward.  You will have a lot open follicles, some which may have never been opened before, and you don&#x27;t want anything icky getting in there and causing any sort of acne!  Great product!  I recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of facial hair quickly, cheaply, and on their own schedule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 4/3/13: Three years later, I still have my R.E.M. Spring.  I clean it after every use with a quick rinse in a very mild soap water mix.  I make a solution of a few drops of a mild dish soap (I use Mrs. Meyers, but any mild grease fighting soap will do) in a container, submerge the R.E.M. Spring in it, and open and close the R.E.M. spring bungee style while it is submerged.  This helps dissolve your facial oils and get off any stubborn hairs stuck to said oil.  Sometimes this isn&#x27;t good enough, so I use an old toothbrush to scrub at and get in between the coils.  Make sure you dry your Spring thoroughly if you do this!  I lay a towel out, pull the Spring open bungee style again, and alternate between rolling it gently against the towel and shaking/banging it against the towel.  You can hold it in front of a fan for a few seconds as well, if you&#x27;d like.  I haven&#x27;t had any rusting problems, but I do make sure to dry it thoroughly, and I do live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the best invention ever. I didn&#x27;t ever realize how much hair I had on my face until this--I mean I knew everywhere else I was hairy like a man but this just verified how much facial hair I had lol and now I am stoked that there&#x27;s a product out there I can use to keep looking like a girl! It is slightly confusing when you first get it on how it is used but I watched a quick TUTORIAL ON YOUTUBE and got it instantly. Once you know how to use it and which direction to roll it&#x27;s the simplest yet most genius hair removal tool out there. Pain level feels a little like threading but it really does get better even after the second use. I 100% RECOMMEND TO THIS TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE. Such a smart device thank you thank you thank you! Maybe now I won&#x27;t scare away guys with my facial hair--just my man voice instead.</li>
            <li> I have hair on my entire face. Its not really visible unless in direct bright sunlight. This product works to remove the hair just as it says. It was easy for me to figure out how to use it unlike some of the reviewers. The spring was pretty simple to use.   --- Cons ---  1. This spring is EXTREMELY painful when used on the upper lip (mustache) area. If you leave it for a week and do it again, it will be just as painful, almost painful enough to make you throw it away and give up.   2. It did not remove the really light \\&quot;baby hairs\\&quot; from my forehead at all. This was the area that I bought the Spring Sprong for and it didn&#x27;t work there. I think the hairs are too fine for this spring to work there. I have turned the spring in every possible direction, and it still wont remove the hairs.  3. It&#x27;s kind of expensive for just a simple spring.  4. Its difficult to clean the hairs out of the inside of the spring.   --- Pros ---  1. The REM Spring Sprong is very easy to use.  2. The pain is minimal in most areas  3. There has been no stubble or ingrown hairs on my face when using this product. (I&#x27;ve used it for a few months with not one ingrown hair, &amp; I am prone to them)  4. You can use it in the privacy of your own home, ( I use it while watching television)  5. You don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to reach a certain length before using, you can use it every day to get the random hairs that have grown. (I use it a few time a week just so it will be less painful than if I waited a couple of weeks and all the hair grows back)  Overall, I would recommend this product if you have hair on your whole face that you want to remove. If you only want to remove hair above the lip, mustache, I suggest you just get it waxed because its less painful and  time consuming.  - UPDATE  I have been using the Spring for 6 months now and the most important things are to use it often to reduce the pain and make sure that your face is washed and exfoliated before and after each use. One time I used itright after work without washing my face and I had a bad breakout.</li>
            <li> This product is a little swirly miracle for people with sensitive skin.  Waxing leaves the area around my mouth broken out in unsightly pimples and I am convinced threading was used as a form of torture back in the day...its unnecessarily painful! I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the idea of using a hair removal cream on my face and after tweezing about 10 hairs I gave up...who has time for all of that?  I started using a bikini trimmer, but it was never as smooth as I had hoped and had a prickly feel within two days.  I was nervous about the long term effects of shaving so I tried to do it sparingly.  After researching my remaining options, I came across the REM spring. I was certain that it was going to be painful but I had tried almost everything else, so for 9.99 it seemed worth a shot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived I was so excited to give it a try.  I had watched you tube videos after purchasing to try and get the hang of the motion needed for the spring to be effective. I&#x27;m not going to go into how to use it, just you tube \\&quot;spring hair removal\\&quot; videos and there are plenty of tutorials at your disposal. I found that it was much easier to learn how to use it by watching videos than the instructions provided in the box when you purchase the spring.  There is also a video on the REM spring website that demonstrates how to use their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I plugged in my headphones and took off to the bathroom to use my new hair removal tool. It grasps the hair at the root and with a quick twist pulls them out. It didn&#x27;t hurt anywhere near as much as I had expected.  The portion of the upper lip that had a quick sting to it was right below your nose, but it was definitely bearable. My eyes watered when I did this section, but it was more the location than the intensity of the pain that caused it. 15 minutes later and my lip was the smoothest it has ever been after hair removal, without redness or little welts forming.  I am certain that it will get quicker with practice and frequency of use, but I am beyond pleased with the results of my first time!! I am recommending this to everyone of my gf&#x27;s that suffers through threading of the upper lip!</li>
            <li> It does hurt to use this Spring Sprung but it well worth it. I have alot more hair even though mostly blonde on my face then I realized and it really got the hair down to the root. I got this more expensive one as I read the other ones didn&#x27;t work as well. Be sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my face since menopause - no more!  This is a great product that works and is less painful than waxing (in my opinion).  I have very fine hair and the spring grabs them and pulls them out.  I do not make a u-shape as shown in photos.  I just twist it while it is straight - like I said- works great.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used numerous methods of hair removal and have put up with the discomfort of each. The last 2 times I attempted to use wax hair removal, my skin broke out terribly and I was at a loss about what to try next. I saw this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. All I can say is THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!! While there is no product that will remove hair with no discomfort whatsoever, this one is by far the most tolerable I have come across. And I can do it while I&#x27;m relaxing and watching tv. This is the best way to do a little maintenance each week and keep my skin looking smooth and soft. I&#x27;m going to order a couple of extras to make sure I always have one available.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reiviews I decided to take a chance on this item.  I was glad I did.  I agree with most of the reiveiws--it does take some practice.  For me it wasn&#x27;t about how I twisted the ends, but whether or not the bend would catch the hairs.  The upper lip was quite easy; the corners of the mouth, not near as easy.  It is a bit painful when it pulls out the hairs but about as much as when someone goes through the \\&quot;thread\\&quot; method of pulling out the hairs.  It is about what should be expected of any hair pulling in sensitive areas.  I would recommend this product.  It sure beats tweezers!</li>
            <li> Best product I loved it at first its going to hurt when you use it. But youll get use to it. It actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> Ive had this product for several months now. I do like it, though when I first got it it did hurt to much that I didn&#x27;t touch it for several weeks. I womaned up and decided to give it one more shot and I did love the results, plus my hair takes about 3 weeks to grow back. Yeppy! Just know do a little at a time if does hurt,but it&#x27;s way better than waxing.</li>
            <li> It helps, but is painful and does not get all the hair.  I prefer the creme hair removers.&lt;br /&gt;Less expensive than buying creme removers over and over again.  Best for light hair removal needs.</li>
            <li> Older women often have a double problem :facial hair under and around the chin and over the lips, and dimming vision that makes tweezing by hand impractical.  I bought this product hoping to solve both problems, but found it to remove only some long hairs. Perhaps I can&#x27;t get the hang of holding it properly.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> At first I was little hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. I had really bad facial hair on my neck and a little on my face. Shaving only made it thicker and longer. It got so bad that I started wearing scarves everyday. I live in Los Angeles and it can get pretty hot here...it would be 100 degrees and I will never take my scarf off because it was too embarrassing. A friend persisted I try this so I did and I love it! It took a while for me to learn how to maneuver it and because I had a lot of hair on my neck so it took some time for me to remove all of it and eventually I had a smooth, soft, and hairless neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny because I came back on amazon to read the negative reviews and I thought they were hilarious. Yes there is pain but you get use to it after a while. I think it hurts mostly around the upper lip....but hey beauty has a cost. It does pluck the hair from the root but sometimes it misses certain tiny hairs and like a one star rater said it sometimes breaks the hair instead of plucking it out. If that happens it&#x27;s usually because you&#x27;re not maneuvering it correctly. What I did was turned my head sideways to get the smaller hairs. Like everyone says it really does take a while to figure out how it works best for you. I used this product everyday until the hair was completely gone and I still continue to use everyday to prevent any new growth or if I missed some hairs. I say try it. It&#x27;s inexpensive and it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this one originally and bought other less expensive ones like Bebe&#x27;s. All the other ones the coil became loose and wouldn&#x27;t grip the hairs after a few uses. I have had my original REM for about a year and it still works just like new.</li>
            <li> I have very light colored thin facial hair so I was concerned that the spring sprong wouldn&#x27;t pick it up.  It works great!!!  When I did the first pass over my upper lip, it felt like my skin was getting ripped up along with the facial hair, so yes it hurts but this is the best solution I have come across to keep away unwanted facial hair in a long time.  I am a big fan.</li>
            <li> Got mines today, so happy!!!! A bit painful at first (similar to if you ever got your upper lip threaded), but as I continued using it the pain become more tolerable. More importantly it did an amazing job, this little gadget is the real deal. I love it; pulled the hair out from the root and I no longer have to pay to get my hair removed anymore. I found it really easy to use on my upper lip, got it on my first try. I definitely, highly recommend this product. I wish I knew about this product before.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading the bad reviews, but I think they must have very poor finger dexterity. I got my R.E.M. Spring in the mail yesterday and WOW my face today is complete free of hair (except, of course, my eye brows and lashes). I tore open the box last night and started using it immediately. If you have tweezed or waxed or ANYTHING else you know what pain can be. I know this is the easiest and least painful product I have ever used on my face. Upper lips are always going to be painful. Suck it up! It is worth a little pain to have a hairless upper lip and chin. If you roll the spring back and forth between your forefingers and your thumbs and move your hands instead of trying to roll the spring all over your face it works great. I am sending this website to every female in my family. I was telling friends about it at work to day and they want one too!!!</li>
            <li> Love it...works great and im obsessed now! &#x3D;) At first its hard to understand how to use but you really get used to it that its second nature. Hurts but you do get used to it as well...i love it!</li>
            <li> It has always been a joke between my sister and me that we might be part Sasquatch.  Seriously, we&#x27;re pretty hairy.  Luckily, it is not dark hair, but light colored peach fuzz hair that coats our faces.  When the sun hits us it looks like we&#x27;ve got halos around our faces.  Not pretty - and as we&#x27;ve gotten older it seems to be getting THICKER and LONGER...  Ugh.  In my 30 years, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to get rid of this hair.  I&#x27;ve use things like Nair, plucking, and waxing.  Nair left my face too smooth and then the stubble came back in.  Not attractive (neither was the skin burn from the Nair).  Plucking is just not realistic.  I don&#x27;t have that much time in my day.  Waxing worked, but it left my face too hairless and irritated - and then the stubble came back, again not pretty.  So, when I got the spring sprong, I immediately tried it out.  I was impressed!  What I like is that it doesn&#x27;t take out all of the hair (although I&#x27;m sure if you did it enough you could get rid of most of it).  What it does do is remove enough of it so that I look like a normal human being, not a Sasquatch.  And, when the hair grow back in it is not stubbly at all!!!  Now, I have to tell you that it does hurt, just a bit.  Nothing like waxing, though!  And it does leave a little redness, but it goes away really quickly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was quite thrilled when I first used this. I didn&#x27;t have the troubles other users had with getting it to grip hairs properly. I only have a few errant hairs on my chin, so I was done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as soon as I was finished I ran my finger across my face and felt tiny stubble. I realized that instead of plucking the hair, the unit was breaking them off close to the skin. I waited a few days for them to grow long enough to grip again, and tried once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I just got stubble. While it seems to grab and pull out the natural, fine hairs of your face without issue (and really, who needs that?) the larger, coarser hairs are merely snapped off. I had to wait another couple of days to tweeze them properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use tweezers or wax. It may be more time consuming, but this is worse than even shaving. At least a razor wouldn&#x27;t leave stubble.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  Considering the alternatives, I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s simple, no fuss and easy to use.  A bit painful at first and hard to get all the hair off.  But overall, solid product for the price and convenience.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of twisting it (to me it&#x27;s like snapping my fingers with it) it does the job nicely. I make sure to do a light scrub after as I will break out if I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that easy to clean but I blow and keep going and it&#x27;s been working very well. I have to go in all directions to ensure the cleanest removal. I have already given 2 as gifts as well.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, the spring action &amp;#34;stings&amp;#34; as the hairs are being pulled out, but product works as what is supposed to do!&lt;br /&gt;Pulls the unwanted hairs out !! I like the product-would recommend to anyone. The price @ 19.99.. not bad either.</li>
            <li> It takes very fine hairs but difficult under chin and around face corners. Very good item for inside a woman&#x27;s purse.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IT REALLY WORKS. IT HAS IT TRICK SO U HAVE TO GET USE TO IT AND DO IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT IT DOES WORK. I USE MINE SEVERAL TIMES A WK, JUST CUZ I DONT WANT TO START TO SHOW. I WAS AFRAID THAT THE HAIR WILL COME OUT THICKER AND DARKER, BUT NO. I ADMIT IT HURTS A LILL AT THE BEGGINING, WELL U R PULLING THE HAIR OUT U KNOW!! BUT THEN IT KIDA GETS NUMB. THE MORE U DO IT, IT HURTS LESS. KINDA THE SAME WAY WHE UN PLUCK UR EYEBROWS, U KNOW EACH TIME HURTS LESS AND IT COMES OUT EASIER. IF THERE WERE MORE STARS I WOULD GIVE MORE. THIS IS GREAT, AFORDABLE, COMPACT, EASY TO USE AND IT WORKS. NO MORE HEARING MY NAIL LADY (CHINESSE) SUGEST EVERYTIME, \\&quot;WAX UPPER LIP\\&quot;? NEVER DONE IT B4, I DIDNT THINK I LOOKED BAD. WHEN I USE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS LIKE OMG! I DID HAD WHISKERS, NO MORE!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this product but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve been discouraged about all the extra hair growing on my lips, chin and the rest of my face. Now, I normally wax my upper and lower lip but I DID NOT want to start waxing my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product just arrived today and I&#x27;ve been holding off on waxing because I wanted to try this product.  Let me just say, IT HURTS.  Of course it hurts!! You are ripping out hair but it&#x27;s no worse than waxing.  And once you get the majority of hair, it is easy to just keep going over the same areas again and again until you get every last little hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how well this thing works! I am so pleased with how smooth my upper and lower lips are.  I had to go over some areas several times but it&#x27;s not a  big deal.  I just kept rolling the product on my face until everything was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I concentrated on my lips today.  Tomorrow I will work on my chin and cheeks... Just take it easy and take breaks when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there was much of a learning curve with this thing at all.  It works like a charm for me and I didn&#x27;t really think twice about how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed at all with this product... In fact, I am THRILLED and I can even take it on the road quite easily and use as necessary... not something I can say about hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great find...</li>
            <li> Just need to get the hang of it, but it works great... great invention. Then use some hair growth inhibitor to keep it from growing back and you should be all good. Like it says, don&#x27;t use on eyebrows because you will snag your lashes unless you figure some way to keep from doing it, like a patch on the side you&#x27;re working on lol.</li>
            <li> I am a typical post-menopausal woman who is sensitive to hot wax and doesn&#x27;t have time for all the plucking! The spring works so well I&#x27;ve recommended it to my sisters and friends! LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This little product is wonderful! It works incredibly well, the reslults last much longer than expected or traditional hair removal methods, it&#x27;s small and beyond easy to use. I am deeply considering buying a couple more to throw in my travel bag and to have as a back up!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She likes it and it does the job! I just didn&#x27;t like the amount of time she spent with tweezers to do the same thing. The time savings is just a bonus.    Update: My wife likes it so much that she has now purchased more for her friends. These apparently make great inexpensive gifts according to her. I&#x27;m glad that she is happy and would recommend this to anyone, especially a husband looking for something to buy his wife. My wife really feels that it is a time saver, because she doesn&#x27;t have to painstakingly take one hair out at a time with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Took a while until I got the hang of it but it seems to get all the fine hair.  Since the hair is pulled out - it takes longer for it to come back and when it does - it comes back finer.  Makeup gets on easier and I love this product!</li>
            <li> It is really amazing. It works very well on my short and ingrown hair. It does get a little challenging under the chin area, but with practice I was able to figure out a way to do it, by holding the spring all the way on the top, rather than the bottom and getting on the nooks and crannies. I can quickly use it and be done with it in a few minutes and even use it daily without having to worry about about redness or itchiness. It might not work that well if the skin is moisturised or oily, I would use a toner or something before using it. I was using Emjoi tweezer it was so painful and the hair did not come off and then switched to a manual tweezer and then ended up going to a salon getting it waxed. I am able to do it at my pace and my convenience and I don&#x27;t feel the pain anymore now.</li>
            <li> This works very well and you don&#x27;t have to wait for those tiny hairs to grow in awhile like some other products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It stings a bit when you first use it. But it works and I like the results. Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Easy affordable hair removal. For the price of only 1 waxing this little gem will last a long time. First time use is painful but gets less and less every time. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some type of hair removal because I&#x27;ve been using creams that have ended up burning my skin and leaving burn marks (which are now fading thankfully).  I know how threading works and the Spring Sprong seemed very similar to it.  I debated over 2 days whether I should spend the money or not because I thought it might not work and that the reviews were fake but I was wrong.      I took a risk and bought it and I&#x27;m glad I did because it does work if you practice with it, which only took me like 5 seconds to figure out because I found helpful reviews here.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as plucking because it pulls the hair out fast by the root and I have thick hair sadly.    The only complaint I would make is that my hands get tired and that it sometimes can&#x27;t pick up the tiny, tiny hairs that are shorter than peach fuzz.  But I just go with my tweezers to pick up anything that it missed.  I like to use the Spring Sprong while watching a movie, I don&#x27;t even need to have a mirror, I just keep rolling it over the areas that I know have hair and it keeps pulling them out like a pro.      Cleaning it wasn&#x27;t hard at all, simply bend the spring in a U shape and you can blow out the hairs that you see lodged inside (they usually gather up at the end tips of the spring).  Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought it and coming from a tom-boy type girl who never really buys this stuff, it is absolutely worth it.  Horray for my first review &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The R.e.m. Spring Sprong seems to work well. I can definitely feel it snagging all those annoying facial hairs. However, I can&#x27;t quite get it to pull out the entire hair by the root and not just snap it off at a shorter point. Any suggestions?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this recently and had doubts that it would really work, despite all the great reviews.  Well, it works amazingly well!!!  I am so impressed that something this simple could work so well.    When I went to use it for the first time today, I didn&#x27;t even read the instructions. I just started experimenting with it on the skin above my upper lip and with very little trial and error quickly began pulling out the tiny fine hairs.  I will say that initially, it really stung - enough to bring tears!  But, as others have said, that&#x27;s just at first because it&#x27;s taking out several at once.    I cannot be more thrilled with the results!  No more bleaching!  I&#x27;m truly surprised that I&#x27;ve never seen this advertised anywhere (I stumbled upon it on Amazon while looking for a good facial waxing product).  I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My daughter kept taking mine, so I had to buy another one for me. Once you get the hang of using it, it really works great. Look for an online video to help show you the right way to hold and turn this. The directions aren&#x27;t that helpful, so a watching a video is best. I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I ordered this upon reading other reviews. It arrived quickly, and as described.  I read the directions, and also the helpful hints that others left on this site.  I had no problems whatsoever using it. It did exactly what I expected, and honestly did not hurt nearly as much as I had thought, based on reviews. It really hurt no more than waxing or threading.  I wanted it mostly for my chin area. Unfortunately for me, I&#x27;ve got some coarse hairs on my chin that I always have to pull out with tweezers. A few passes with the Spring Sprong and they were gone. I figured I may as well try it on my lip and cheeks as well for the peach fuzz.  My face has never been smoother.  I have very sensitive skin, so it was red and a little bumpy. I used some Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Rosewater and Glycerin toner, and within the hour the redness and bumps were gone...so if you have sensitive skin, and you don&#x27;t want to go in public red and bumpy, allow yourself some time before going out.  I&#x27;ve always had my lip and eyebrows waxed or threaded, but never my chin because I was too embarrassed to let it grow long enough for an effective waxing. As years have gone by, I&#x27;ve had to wax less and less, and I have high hopes that this method will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> This works better than waxing. It is effective but slightly painful, nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this thing, especially since it only cost $13 and was simplistic in nature. However, it&#x27;s far exceeded my expectations so far, and then some. I use it on my upper lip, cheeks and chin.  What I love:  - Cost effective! No batteries to replace. No wax to deal with or pay for. No going off to the salon to pay a fortune on a regular basis to have someone else do it, and there&#x27;s no wasting gas in order to get there. I&#x27;d also much rather spend $13 to replace a tool that works, rather than $20-$60 on a machine that might fail for various reasons.  - It may not be as fast, but it&#x27;s far more gentle on the skin vs. waxing. This hurts, but only from the hair being pulled out rather than my skin along with it. It was also much gentler on my face than my electric epilator that I use for my body.  - No blemishes! I sometimes get breakouts when I pluck or wax my face, although it&#x27;s not every time. I thought for sure I&#x27;d break out, but had no problems. In fact, the few I had before using it disappeared the next day, which may mean my products are working better. Who knows!  - Gets faster and more pain-free the more you do it. Since hair tends to grow in cycles, I&#x27;m doing it once a week or so, just to keep on top of things (I also feel it hurts less when they&#x27;re shorter).  - Grabbed both baby-fine hairs and super-short coarse ones, including on zee chin - though it took some time to sort the right angles on some sections.  - It&#x27;s spiffy and portable. If there&#x27;s ever a zombie apocalypse, I&#x27;ll be set in my cave or non-powered hidey hole.  Tips:  - Make sure you try it from different angles, and try to turn the device into an upright U-shape if some hairs aren&#x27;t being plucked up, or even somewhat straight. It also helps to make the silly faces for difficult-to-get hairs.  - I clean mine with anti-bacterial soap and dry it.  - Make sure to exfoliate your skin one to two times a week, especially around the time you use this. I use a scrub, sonic brush or enzyme peel (mostly a gentle peel), depending on my mood/circumstances. Wash your face before and after with a non-irritating soap.  - Always use a clean pillowcase the night you use this, and change it at least once a week.  - Wash your hands if you have to touch your face, or avoid doing so right after.  - It may help to avoid harsh, alcohol-based toners, since it could irritate the skin and cause bumps. I use Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Mist, which is more of a tonique to restore pH balance after I wash my face (and it gently exfoliates) - though I&#x27;m sure any kind will do.  - Check Youtube to see how others use devices similar to this</li>
            <li> First, let&#x27;s be real.  It&#x27;s essentially tweezing many, many hairs at once.  It does cause pain.  If you can&#x27;t handle pain, don&#x27;t buy this.  If you can handle pain, this is a no brainer.  Think of how much money you save over time!  It is easy to use, causes less irritation than waxing or chemicals, and there is no goop left on your face!  Also, I would only wax areas that made sense with a strip, for many reasons, including cost.  With this, there is none of that fear.  Remove where/whenever you like!  Sit back and watch your favorite sitcom and tear the hair right out of your face.  :-)</li>
            <li> So...after I got the hang of it it worked...with some time and effort anyways. The only thing I dislike it the pimples on each side of my mouth I got. Part of the reason I wanted to try a new product was because the cream remover would sometimes cause redness that could last over a day in the same area. So to compare cream vs. coil...they both leave their mark. Cream is faster and less painful. Coil seems to keep hair away longer. It all depends on what side effect is worse for you. To be honest, having little pimples next to my mouth probably gives people the wrong impression, I would rather stick with the cream and save up for lazer treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young woman in my 20&#x27;s and the only years I regret was when I didn&#x27;t have this in my life. From a teenage girl, I have always been afraid to kiss I guy I dated due to the fact that my upper lip and chin might scare him away because of those pesky little tiny coarse facial hair! Yeah I&#x27;d have to tweeze each and every one a night before I have to go out anywhere. It came to a point where I just gave up going out and will head out atleast once a week. Staying indoors and away from the natural sun light outside made me depressed and my self esteem was buried all the way deep into the earth&#x27;s soil! I&#x27;m fair skinned and my hair is naturally dark. So the intensity of my facial hair would look so horrifying for a female. I thought I&#x27;d never have a normal life til one day I needed to help myself and get on with my life, make a change. I researched online and I found this! Came in the mail and I started to make a difference in my life. I&#x27;m so used to this product and I am so thankful. This is amazing, anyone who is suffering from what I went through SHOULD REALLY PURCHASE THIS!  It worked from me and now I have a higher self esteem and I&#x27;m not insecure anymore. I go out everyday whenever I want to. Now I can finally look for a job because I got my confidence back and this product is great!</li>
            <li> Fuzzy Wuzzy wuz a... not me! Ha! This little REM Spring for facial hair removal is absolutely fantastic. UPS delivered it less than an hour ago and I&#x27;m fuzz-less already.    To you Ladies who wrote about not finding success with this little Spring, please be patient and keep trying.    Let me tell you about my experience: I read the reviews here last week before I ordered the Spring and when it arrived today the tips from these reviews were forgotten. Off I went with my Spring, magnifying mirror, tweezers, and eye glasses to find hairless happiness. I read the instructions that came with the Spring and went from there.    The Spring was turned into a U for most of the time in use, and the ends were twirled in one direction or another or the same while I experimented (this was due to a lack of coordination rather than a science-based determination to experiment). Voila! The little hairs from my upper lip, lower lip, and chin are gone. Am not exactly sure which mode of holding the Spring worked but something did.    I&#x27;m not advocating going about this willy-nilly, but if you spend a bit of time you will succeed. Don&#x27;t be too locked into the how of it. Try staying with the U shape and turning the ends to see what happens... play with it. You will be sooo glad you did.    My upper lip is slightly tender (emphasis on &#x27;slightly&#x27;). That&#x27;s not a problem for me. This little Spring is heaven-sent: it works and I am grateful.    Thank you, Amazon.com, for these reviews. It is unlikely I would have ordered a Spring to remove facial hair if I&#x27;d not read what these other ladies had experienced.</li>
            <li> After researching facial hair removal, I took a chance on this and love it.  It stings the first time you try it but then you get familiar with the areas of your face and which sting more than others.  Try this before any other hair removal treatments.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to bleaches, since I have very sensitive skin, and stumbled upon the R.E.M. Spring. I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I was skeptical. Especially because it looks so simple. Truth be told, it&#x27;s wonderful! Don&#x27;t believe that it doesn&#x27;t hurt, it does. The same as plucking. However the spring is a lot faster and gentler. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and have no irritation. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> You know what? This little tool really, really works. I wish they&#x27;d take the word &#x27;painless&#x27; out of their advertising though, because it certainly isn&#x27;t. As anyone who&#x27;s tweezed or waxed knows, ripping a bunch of tiny hairs out by their roots at once is anything but &#x27;painless.&#x27;    If you&#x27;re like me, prior to this tool, you had one of three options for hair removal. 1) Use that awful Nair for Face stuff that takes off a layer of your skin along with the hair, and walk around for three days with a red goatee and irritated skin. 2) Face the pain of waxing it off and still walk around with a red mustache and irritated skin afterwards. 3) Tweeze each and every little hair, one by one, consuming a day and a half if you want to get everything. Each option more unappealing than the last.    But this! One little tool you shell out [...] bucks for one time, that you can use without a mirror, sitting in front of the TV, and within a half hour or so be nice and smooth, with no irritated and red skin. SWEET! This little tool is so awesome, I want to tell everyone about it. And it&#x27;s so simple! No waxes, no tweezers, no smelly creams!     It *is* tricky to learn how to use, however, I will say that. Don&#x27;t give up, however. Just experiment. The most important thing is the turning of the handles, so that the hair is caught in the spring and literally being twisted off. And it doesn&#x27;t have to be in a sharp U shape like in the picture. I&#x27;ve gotten bunch of hair in a wide crescent before.     Give it a try if you&#x27;re tired of the waxing Nairing red face thing! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but once you get the technique down, it works great.</li>
            <li> I had one before and lost it???  So I ordered another.  Easy to use and unlike some reviews I don&#x27;t find it very painful  Better than tweezing.  I use it sometimes while watching TV.  Easy way to keep the unwanted grannies at bay.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  The sensation is the same pain factor as tweezing and it does not work effectively as it leaves the smaller, finer hairs intact.  Save your money and use your tweezer.</li>
            <li> Super easy and fast.  I actually think its way less painful than tweezing and waxing, which makes this even better.</li>
            <li> Works like a wonder. I used to use an electric epilator, which started eating at my face and leaving sores. Bad.  This is actually pretty gentle. I don&#x27;t feel a lot of pain to to be fair I wax/epilate on a regular basis so my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive to it.  There is a bit of redness if I use it a lot. It didn&#x27;t take me too long to get the hang of though.</li>
            <li> This thing works wonders. It gets every little hair. It does take a little bit to get use to how to use it, but once you got it down its a breeze. I love using it because its so much more fast then tweezing and I feel like I won&#x27;t miss any spots!</li>
            <li> I have been through laser treatment, shaving, waxing, threading - but by far this hurts the worst!  Besides that it is handy to travel with and really does work.</li>
            <li> It works, but it hurt like hell. Also I have very fair skin and many tiny red bumps appeared and lasted several days after I used the spring sprong. I switched over to a motorized womens facial trimmer and I like it much better. No pain or bumps and the same smooth results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing this product for a while now and people seem to like it,so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.   First, I have very fair skin, but thick black hair (it seriously sucks!) I&#x27;ve tried plucking and waxing on the upper lip area before this, and have done laser on other areas of my body. So here&#x27;s my pick review:    Does it work?: Yes it removed the unwanted &#x27;stache from my upper lip (took about 5 min)  Does it hurt?: Oh yes it does. And it hurt just as much as all the other things (laser, wax, tweeze) in the end pulling hair from you skin, is pulling hair from your skin.  Plus: its cheaper than having to go to a salon to have waxing done every 3 months, &amp; can be done anytime anywhere, a little less skin irritation than waxing  Con: It just hurt too much, at least waxing it only takes 2-3 pulls where as this you have to keep on rolling.. and pulling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial hair remover. I use it on my chin and it removes even the tiniest of hairs.</li>
            <li> Very simple and useful. I recommended it. Satisfactory result. I have use another brand in the past. Far better than that.</li>
            <li> I am a 25 yr old African American woman.  I&#x27;ve been blessed with a gorgeous head of THICK hair that runs down my back and unfortunately  a gorgeous face full of hair that goes from my unibrow (even above that I have a pretty fuzzy forehead that I took care of by doing an upside down crescent bend and rolling downward) to underneath my chin, on my neck.  I have struggled since the age 13.  I didn&#x27;t know any better because the women in my family didn&#x27;t talk openly about being hairy and I was too embarrassed to ask.  Come to find out as an adult they are freakin hairy too!      It started with shaving and went to waxing and tweezing my uni, cheeks, mustache, chin, jaw line, and neck.. in more recent years.      Let me tell u that I WAS DESPERATE.  This was interfering with my whole life.  I didn&#x27;t want to go outside!  Especially not in the daylight.   I could feel peoples eyes on me in the grocery store line, in the line at the post office, sitting next to me at dinner, etc.  From a certain distance people smiled or guys would look and when they got close enough to see my extra hair, they became disgusted with me or would look away.  Waxing was breaking me out and tweezing 1 by 1 was OK but it took too long in the mirror and I could never get every hair because on top of having coarse hair was long ass peach fuzz... UGH!!    SO the shipping was ok.  I ordered on Sunday and got it on Friday.  I cleaned it with a paper towel and rubbing alcohol 1st.  Then washed my face and let in dry.  This thing was so painful for me that my eyes were constantly tearing and teeth clenching.  I decided  to do my normal 1 by 1 tweeze job on as many of the really coarse hairs first and then I went over all the areas with the spring.  It was still painful but bearable.  Since I&#x27;m sooo hairy I didn&#x27;t expect to get it all the 1st night.  I did as much as I could bear that night, and followed the next night.      MY FACE IS VIRTUALLY HAIR FREE AND SMOOTH NOW!!!!!  I use the spring every nightjust to catch any strays and keep my face smooth.  My skin is sensitive so it does get red and a little swollen from all the removal but that goes away in about 15-30 mins.  I usually hold a cold bottle of water on the areas to soothe and that works magic.  I was going to give this 4 stars because of the pain but I HAD a ware wolf face so there is no way it wasn&#x27;t going to be painful.  It pulls every single little hair from the root.  You can try less of a U shape (more like a crescent shape) and also try rolling in different directions because hair grows at all different angles sometimes.  If you have like 4 or 5 hairs on your chin I would say to save your 20 bucks and tweeze those suckers.  The mustache was unbearable for me so I just shave it...but that&#x27;s like a walk in the park for this gal.    Give it a try!  If you&#x27;re really hairy just try what I did and you won&#x27;t regret it.  Good luck all!!    I hope this helps someone.  XOXO</li>
            <li> Wow this product is great..........ya, it does does take some time to get use to it but once you know how to use you will love it..........the only problem is it is hard to remove hair which grow in defferent direction but over all it awsome.........loved it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 going on 3 months. it works great and it&#x27;s easy. yes, it&#x27;s painful but you will adjust unless your that kind of person who just can&#x27;t. first round i end up using it my whole face; very painful. just make sure that after each usage that you wash your face completely with luke warm water and apply 100% Aloe Vera Gel so that you calm the irritation or make sure you don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product once you get the hang of it. It&#x27;s not hard, just takes a little practice, but then does a great job of removing all that unwanted facial hair. Not totally pain free, but only really bothersome if you are a total wimp!</li>
            <li> This is the best way to remove facial hair I&#x27;ve ever tried. Waxing is messy and leaves a sticky film on my skin, plucking is slow and doesn&#x27;t get all the little hairs. This spring gets everything quickly with no mess and no cleanup necessary. It&#x27;s so easy to just pull it out, run it across my skin a few times, and be good to go. It does hurt the first time, but now I&#x27;m at the time where I&#x27;m happier the more it hurts because it means I&#x27;m getting more hairs out. It really is not that painful at all. I am so happy I found this solution because it totally beats anything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really only good for facial hair; doesn&#x27;t work well for anything else because the hair is not as fine and there&#x27;s too much surface area.</li>
            <li> painful procedure to remove facial hairs....perhaps a facaial wax treatment for removing facial hair is less than painful.......but, this item does remove hair...you may be able to tolerate the pain</li>
            <li> Got this today and I LOVE IT!! Its very easy to use, it pulls facial hairs out without catching your skin. It&#x27;s truly amazing. No more waxing or tweezing ever. Your upper lip of course is a little sensitive but still a breeze. I had so much fun using it, my husband was laughing at me. I am so happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> Im 24 years old &amp;Ive struggled with facial hair since I could remember &amp; its been so hard &amp; sensitive area for me. I&#x27;ve tried bleaching, hair removal cream &amp; waxing and its been so rough on my skin, its gone from breaking out, to just drying it out so much it hurt! I tried covering it up with make, like that really helps -_-. this is AMAZING! I absolutely love it! I tried it as soon as it arrived, its so fast &amp; easy to use! yes it does sting a little but the rest just kind of didnt matter once I saw the hairs gone frm my face! I HIGHLY recommend this to any woman that has facial hair problem. I cant remember when the last time my face looked &amp; feeled so smooth. note:I had no breakout or irritation. You really need to try this little sucker out ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my upper lip for a while now, so my hair is used to getting ripped out. This thing hurts like a motherf*****. You kinda get used to it, but I haven&#x27;t yet, and it&#x27;s still hard to get all of the hair. Usually I have to stop because I can&#x27;t handle the pain. I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an area that&#x27;s so close to your sinuses. Anyways, if you can handle the pain it gets the job done, but I can&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll stick to waxing. Worth the try for the price.</li>
            <li> I just used the spring sprong for the first time.  It is more time consuming than waxing (which I can&#x27;t do anymore because it really irritates my skin), but really does remove the hair.  It even gets those teenie tiny ones.  It does not hurt much on the cheeks, but really, really, really hurts on the upper and lower lip. It does not seem to affect the skin at all and you can remove hair all the way to the edge of the lip line.  I think if I use it regularly it will hurt much less, because there will be fewer hairs to pull.  I gave it four stars because it takes a while to use and get the hang of, and it is painful, just as you would expect when ripping the hair out by the root.  Update:  I have had this product for about a week now and I love it!  I did have a little bit of a breakout where I had used the spring the first time and my follicles were a little sore.  After you get through the initial removal process, it is much less painful, and there is very little breaking out (which occurs for me after waxing and shaving legs, too).  You only need to grab a few hairs.</li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t make up my mind about this product.  I bought it, as I have a few hairs that have conveniently popped up that I can&#x27;t see very well to tweeze. Embarrassing, yes. A sign of maturity, ah yes.  I don&#x27;t have many but I thought this would help me avoid the contortions that I have to do in front of my bathroom mirror; hard to tweeze something you can&#x27;t see, when your head is pointed the opposite direction!  This spring did get the fine baby hairs; that&#x27;s not what I needed. The pain factor; similar to waxing my upper lip. Ouch. Quickly done, though, so not too bothersome.  Now I needed this for those slightly coarse hairs. So not a big help. I still had to do the contortionist tweeze thing.  I would not buy this again. It does work on fine hairs though, so it is slightly useful. It is just that we ladies are usually going after the hairs that others can see so clearly, and we can&#x27;t. Nobody likes to feel like the evil witch in that Wizard of Oz movie. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Product is great at removing facial hair.  So easy to use.  Yes, it stings a little when the hairs get pulled out, but no more than when using tweezers.  You get used to it.  Advantage is that many hairs get pulled at once, rather than one at a time, and you don&#x27;t have to use a mirror.  Love that it gets fine, fluffy hair on cheeks and jaw line. If it&#x27;s not grabbing the hair, try moving the spring in different directions, and also adjusting the shape of the \\&quot;U\\&quot;.  If it&#x27;s more of gentle curve than a proper U-shape, it might catch the hairs better because the space between the spring is smaller.  Works for me!  Also, for those who complain about in-grown hairs and red bumps - clean your skin before using and use an astringent right after.  You need to close your pores. If you notice some red bumps, scrub your face - a little exfoliation usually works for me.</li>
            <li> takes a little time to figure it out, but worth it..  I&#x27;m not used to waxing or tweezing, so the first time it hurt, but it beat taking the time to go to get it waxed or working with the wax..face was a little red, and a little blood, but it cleared up within 10 minutes.  This is very cost effective too.  First time I was done in about 20 minutes, and my face is the smoothest it&#x27;s been in 15 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this thing works great to remove my unwanted facial hair.  The result is smoother and longer lasting than shaving.  Less time consuming, less messy, and less painful than waxing.  And much less time consuming than plucking.    Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I saw the Oprah likes this but I want one that is made the in the USA, this is made in Israel.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is the best facial hair removal method that I&#x27;ve tried so far. It&#x27;s simple to use and leaves my face really smooth. It takes a little time and isn&#x27;t pain-free (the pain is instantaneous, but enough to make my eyes water, especially on my upper lip) but it&#x27;s well worth it. I&#x27;ve tried using it on other part of my body and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well, but it definitely works on the intended areas. I&#x27;m very happy with this investment.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. I have tried waxing plucking and creams. This by far is the best thing I have ordered. I have been working on it all day to perfect the angles and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a ton of reviews before buying and was skeptical about it because of the pain. I hated plucking...but I figured since this was a bunch at once it wouldn&#x27;t be much worse than waxing....but I did prepare myself for the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it and messes with it at my computer. I was surprised at how quick I caught on to it. I kept doing it on and off at tonight my face is perfect !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing ever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the lady in the picture is smiling! THIS STUFF HURTS!!! However, I think that it worked well, but be sure to use a numb cream before...</li>
            <li> Overall I am liking this product.  The issue I have is that when you view images, the hair inhibiting cream is also shown.  That is part of the reason I ordered this product since I thought I&#x27;d get what was in the pictures.  Otherwise I would have gone with a cheaper option.  If someone could take down that picture, it is misleading.</li>
            <li> I read a number of the reviews and I thought what the heck, it would be worth the try for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I am not very hairy but I have lots of fine hair round my chin and they seem to be getting longer.  My sister shaves her face and that was the last thing I wanted to do so I decided to try the REM Spring.  I watched the video of the woman in the list of reviews and I loved her honesty and that was another reason I thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I love it&lt;br /&gt;and my face feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It feels a bit prickly and tingly when you use it, but for someone like me not at all unpleasant.  Far better then waxing and tweezing.  There were a few very stubborn hairs I had to still tweeze but all in all Im very pleased with the results.  I give it a 4 star simply because it can not get out really stubbon hairs unless they were longer to pull out.  Maybe if I wait till those few get long enough then I will try the spring and see if it gets them out without my having to go back and tweeze.  I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> It works!  It&#x27;s a little hard at first to get it to work but you just keep trying different ways (based on the other reviews) and it does get the hair.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the awesome reviews, I decided to buy this product. I watched the video review and saw her technique and simply copied it. It works amazingly well (especially for the price) on facial hair and I&#x27;m glad I bought it! No more waxing for me, I&#x27;ve got the R.E.M.</li>
            <li> The spring works alot like the threading process, and once you get the hang of the motions, hair removal is very easy. It is painful, but beauty is painful i suppose..the more frequently its used, the more you will get used to the pain, so it wont be as shocking as the first time. Removes all but a few tiny hairs, which can be tweezed. Hair grows back after a week for me, but my hair growth is very quick anyway. For most people i&#x27;m sure it will last a few weeks. Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> This little tool is a gem. I have extremely fine hairs along my upper lip and using tweezers is nearly impossible for hair removal. This brilliant spring is so easy to use and it grabs all the little hairs in a short amount of time. No batteries, no cords, nothing. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I do like this tool to remove hair from my upper lip and chin area. It works really good but is painful.</li>
            <li> Being somewhat hairy-faced I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will &#x27;tweeze&#x27; better than I can see and not take me an hour staring into a magnifying mirror.  I always put a gob of vaseline on my face 30 minutes or so prior to tweezing and did so before I used the Spring.  Then I wiped off the vaseline and went to work.  In just a minute or two every hair on my face was gone.  Ok, I did have a few tears sprout when I got under my nose but otherwise it was painless and so very effective!  Perfect for sensitive skin like mine that doesn&#x27;t like chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to figure out, you have to twist it as you move it up and down - there is a video on YouTube that demonstrates it.  And yes, if you&#x27;re using it for the first time it&#x27;ll bring tears to your eyes, but it&#x27;s not so bad after that.</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the other brand I have</li>
            <li> This little gadget promptly (and easily) removes of face fuzz! The instructions aren&#x27;t really clear. They say to make an inverted U with the device, which I did, but I didn&#x27;t understand that then the device has to be gently twisted.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the thin hair and doesn&#x27;t get the thick hair. But works for the medium easy to reach hair.</li>
            <li> I just got my R.e.m. Spring Sprong in the mail today and as soon as I received it, I wanted to try it out. Before ordering the product, I read over 100 reviews about it, and was so excited to give it a try.   I have a lot of dark, fine facial hair and usually go to get it waxed off once a month. It&#x27;s pricey and takes up to 25 minutes. I needed an alternative solution to facial hair. I&#x27;ve been tempted to try laser hair removal, but that would cost me a lot, and my dermatologist says that it might not even work for me.   Anyway, so I tried the R.e.m. Spring Sprong, and I love it. It works pretty well. I read a lot of reviews saying that it was painful; however, it wasn&#x27;t for me. I think that for anyone who has had their face waxed before, it&#x27;s definitely not very painful. I didn&#x27;t have to figure out how it worked because I watched a few YouTube videos on how to use it; it&#x27;s fairly simple.   I used it on my cheeks, my chin, my upper lip, and neck. It worked really well on my cheeks and chin, but I had a harder time removing the hair from the neck area and my upper lip. I think the hair on my upper lip didn&#x27;t fully grow out, and that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work as well there.  My overall comments about this product are that it&#x27;s a great alternative to waxing. It&#x27;s also easy to use - I now use it while watching Friends on TV. :)   Also, I washed my face with a cleanser right after using the product and had no breakouts. If your skin gets irritated easily, I recommend putting Aloe Vera on your face after using the product - just make sure it&#x27;s the kind with no alcohol or fragrance.   I recommend buying this product - not a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product!  I no longer have to wax.....yayyy.  I thought it would hurt to use the product but it didn&#x27;t hurt me at all.  Waxing is worse!!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this little tool.  Worked great.  Out of the box, few quick trials to get technique down and bye bye hair.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, use it mainly on cheeks, ears and various other locations. Neat unique little invention. Bought it for the heck of it but turned out to be one of those things that pleasantly surprise you.</li>
            <li> OMG! Amazing tool, I owned a tweezer and got tired of squeezing the hair shaft was a strain on my fingers, so I threw it away when I got this R.e.m. Spring Sprong.  So easy, less painful, less time, and removes multiple hair w/one twist! Smart and inexpensive! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative for waxing. It does hurt initially, but the sting goes away quickly. I would recommend the Spring Sprong to anyone who just doesn&#x27;t have the time or money to go get waxed every month. The price will make up for waxing after the first couple of uses. It does take some getting used to the twisting motion is kinda weird at first, but so easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> Sadly this just hurt instead of pulling any hairs out. I read the instructions over and over...tried all different methods of twisting but I got very little success. I&#x27;d rather just tweeze for now.</li>
            <li> How did I not know about this sooner?  Could have saved so much money on waxing at the salons.</li>
            <li> I use it to hang purses on.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair removal item ever. I wish had this years ago. No wax, no bleach, no mess. NO HAIR. This thing hurts just a little&lt;br /&gt;( not even close to waxing ). I have super thick Eastern Eureopean hair and this thing works! You will not regret it. I am buying every female friend one of these for gifts. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Hello, I want to say first off that I have hair all over my face (lip, chin, cheeks, lots on my forehead, neck) and I have been using a trimmer for years. I don&#x27;t like waxing b/c I break out almost every time. I just got this today and it&#x27;s AWESOME!!! I have a TON of peach fuzz all over so it&#x27;s going to take a few days to get all the hair off, but my first round with it went really well. It stings a little around the lips and close to the ears, but other than that it&#x27;s really very little pain if any. LOVE this tool. I&#x27;m going to buy one for all my friends for birthdays or Christmas! Every woman needs this tool!!</li>
            <li> good product, but stings and u just never use it again for some reason</li>
            <li> Go go gadget remove hair. I never thought I&#x27;d review a hair removal product cuz let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;d rather everyone believe I&#x27;m naturally smooth on my own, not mama gorilla here. But geez I love this spring so much I want to tell everyone about it. I&#x27;ve never felt so smooth. It&#x27;s ridiculous. It took a little getting used to--went from wondering if it was working at all to holy-flippin-cow-patties-on-a-stick that hurts. But just the first time, ladies. Ignore the twitching of your left eye and grounding of your feet on the carpet, and keep twirling the little torture device along your chiny-chin-chin.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the excellent reviews it got.  I&#x27;ve used for a month and yes it gets rid of the soft facial hairs and it does smart around the upper lip, but when it comes to the coarse post menopausal chin hairs, a razor does better.  The reason I wanted to avoid the razor is because it causes ingrown hairs which cause an infected pimple.  This isn&#x27;t good for those coarse hairs and I still have the same problem and worse.  I wish it had worked but it doesn&#x27;t.  Will still be on the look-out for a better tweezer or electrolysis eventually.</li>
            <li> It is just a gimmick.  I should have spent my money on another tweezers. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not extremely hairy like some of the other reviewers apparently are but I do have issues with itchiness and rash after I shave. So, this is a great solution. I&#x27;m telling you, it rips out every bit of hair. The one downside is that you can really feel it. It hurts like heck!</li>
            <li> This thing worked wonders for me.  About 5 years ago, after getting a terribly upclose picture taken, I was absolutely horrified to see that I had a beard!  I have a lot of fine and light colored hair on my jawline, but it&#x27;s longer than most women&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s not terribly noticeable (I didn&#x27;t think) except for in direct sunlight and at certain angles.  But it has made me very self-conscious for years.  I would always try to keep my hair down to cover the sides of my face.  I never did anything about it because I feared that it would grow back thicker and darker.  I use Sally Hansen hair remover for my upper lip once a week but using it for my whole face would have been expensive, time consuming and annoying, plus that stuff has an unpleasant smell.  I didn&#x27;t want to remove all of the hair on my face, as after doing my upper lip, when I sweat it seems to bead because there is no hair to catch it.  Plus I thought it would look weird to be completly hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting married in 6 weeks and have been absolutely dreading the upclose outdoor pictures-our venue is a community park and getting pictures at dusk will be unavoidable.  I still wasn&#x27;t planning on doing anything about it because I didn&#x27;t want to make a lifelong committment to whole-face hair removal-only planning on making a lifelong committment to the man I&#x27;m marrying!  A couple of weeks ago I saw some infomerical (can&#x27;t recall the product, maybe NoNo), so I went online to look at reviews and that led me to read up on an assortment of products.  I came across some at home machines that were awfully expensive ($400+ refills) and weren&#x27;t supposed to be used on the face (although that wouldn&#x27;t have stopped me).  I have also researched electrolosis but found out that I wouldn&#x27;t be a good candidate because my hair is light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I stumbled onto this product and I poured over the reviews and ordered that day.  I was so excited for it to come that I ripped it out of the box.  I went to work with a 2x mirror in a well lit room.  It did hurt-like others have said, it&#x27;s comprable to tweezing (I think it might hurt a little less).  Tears welled up in my eyes a couple of times but it wasn&#x27;t like I was about to scream out in pain.  I tried to do my moustache but since I used the hair remover cream less than a week ago I don&#x27;t think it was long enough to pull out.  It took me a little bit of trial and error to get this to grab and remove hair but I knew not to give up.  After doing my whole face, it was red (like when I pluck my eyebrows) but I put some moisturizer on and went to bed and woke up with smooth silkly, normal skin.  It does look a little dry though, I probably should have reapplied the moisturizer in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can do this in the convenience of my home.  I will try to give an update as to how often I have to use this product to maintain my face as it is now-not completely hairless, there are VERY short fine hairs remaining, you know like most normal people!  I plan to do it twice a week.  This is the cheapest, easiest, most ingenious product for facial hair removal I&#x27;ve seen!  I keep looking at my face in mirrors from the angles I used to dread and it makes me so happy.  While I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m looking forward to getting a bunch of pictures taken of me, it&#x27;s no longer because of my facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to tell all of my female friends and family members about this!!  And thanks to everyone else who left reviews, you made me try this product and I am so grateful that I did!  I am not big on reviewing, but I felt I had to add my story since I got a lot out of everyone else&#x27;s.  For other women with my type of facial hair, I can&#x27;t urge you enough to try this product.  At $13, what&#x27;s there to lose??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this for the second time about a week after the first try.  It was not nearly as painful, I didn&#x27;t even bat an eye-probably because you are pulling much less hair.  It is tough to do your chin, I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the most efficient angles, etc.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to use this more than once a week for maintenance, which is awesome!  Oh, and it did end up making me break out on my jaw line by my ears. But they weren&#x27;t pimples, just bumps and they went a way within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this hair removal tool out, because I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to remove those fine hairs on my upper lip without lots of irritation. I use exfoliating/anti-aging products on my face that aren&#x27;t recommended to be used for a while before waxing, so on top of making the appointments, and finding a babysitter and paying for the service, waxing is really inconvenient for me. Hair removal creams smell rotten and give me a rash every time, plus the hair grows back super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face first and then tried this out, hesitantly. Let me tell you, after doing my whole upper lip...the faster you move this tool, the better. Since I was kind of afraid of the pain, I was slow in my movements and GUHHH it made my eyes water and it really hurt. I put a cold pack on my skin to help numb it a little and that sort of worked. But then I just grew a pair and really went for it, twisting the tool up and down quickly, and it hurt less that way. I really like the way the ends of the tool twist around easily, and because they are kind of tapered at the end it&#x27;s not at all awkward to use. The tool has a very tight spring so it got all of the fine hairs I could see and some I couldn&#x27;t. It hurt the most next to my lip and next to my nose. But now that I&#x27;ve gotten it over with, I&#x27;m happy with the result...there are some teeny tiny white hairs left, and this is why the final result wins out over waxing to me. We have tiny tiny fuzz all over our face, but waxing for me removes all of that too and makes my upper lip look kind of shiny and weird compared to the rest of my face. But this tool is capable of leaving just enough tiny fuzz that it&#x27;s not obvious you removed the hair from your upper lip. I think I could have removed it all if I just sat for a while watching T.V. while I did it, but I got the all of longer darker hairs that bothered me in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I chose this product over the others because of the way the ends are shaped and because of the quality of the spring, even if it is a little more expensive. I will be buying these as gifts for all my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> I am a Latina with dark facial hair ESP on my cheeks, jaw area. I was getting so uncomfortable being out and would actually position myself so that my less hairy side would be exposed. I mean really I&#x27;m not exaggerating - I was thinking about shaving cause it was so gross. My sister mentioned this little product she has been using and so I thought - I have nothing to lose. The fist time was no big deal. I just followed my natural instinct on how to twist the rod . Don&#x27;t think about it too much. I didnt have to curve it so much . In some areas it was almost straight. You can tell its working by hearing the satisfying pulling of the hair. It doesn&#x27;t hurt me on the jaw but the mustache kills! I use it everyday but I have skipped a day-you MIT need to use it less if your growth is slower. Please don&#x27;t hesitate - I would pay 5 times the amount for how much better I feel about myself.</li>
            <li> I was definitely a skeptic before purchasing this item, but I figured..what the heck did I have to lose? I spend ~$10 plus tip and gas just to travel to the salon to get my upper lip waxed when I get my eyebrows done. This little spring is such a savior. In fact, I left it at home and I&#x27;m away for about 4 weeks, so I&#x27;m seriously considering buying a back-up since I love using this spring to remove facial hair. It works fantastic for pulling hair, and you just have to get used to it. The pain is there, but after 1-2x of using it, you will get used to it. If you&#x27;ve ever epilated before, this is similar except you can control the direction and way the hairs are coming out. I will say - be careful while using this on your upper lip under your nose because pulling a nose hair out on accident is no joke! It hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for removing upper lip hair as well as facial hair. I don&#x27;t think this would work on coarse, thicker hair, I stick to epilating/waxing/shaving for those. But since this saves me around $10 and I can use it everyday, it&#x27;s a must-have in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - after the first time I used it, I broke out on my chin area and bottom of my cheeks since I had never removed hair there before (not unbearable, and I actually have acne prone skin). I would suggest washing your face after using this but don&#x27;t give up on it. I stopped breaking out after continually using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tweezed or waxed when it came to facial hair so I was skeptical of this little spring device.  I have to admit, however, that it works pretty well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It does take a little experimenting with the angle and curve to get it just right but it removes all those little fine hairs on the chin and upper lip pretty quickly.  The first couple of times you use it prepare for some watery eyes.  It definitely smarts a little.  It does get easier each time you do it.  The only problem I had was that it didn&#x27;t get the coarser hairs as well as tweezing.  I&#x27;m not complaining though.  I still feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth with the first use and this thing will last forever.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with hair issues all of my life and this little spring fixed all of them. It now takes me 10 mins to get rid of any unwanted hair instead of 30 mins or more. When I got this out of the box I asked myself \\&quot; what was I thinking?\\&quot;. I thought there was no way this little spring would work but it did and it&#x27;s painless.</li>
            <li> OUCH!!! is all I can say.  If you love pain, use this. I don&#x27;t like it at all. I want something that&#x27;s a lot less painful.</li>
            <li> This is soooo much easier and faster than tweezing. I have a lot of haris on my chinny, chin, chin, and this product makes removing them fast and easy. It hardly took any practice before I was nabbing the little hairs and pulling them out. Since my poor chin is already used to tweezing, I felt almost no pain. If you haven&#x27;t tweezed or waxed before, you will feel it. Ladies, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> After reading the product and customer reviews, I was able to catch on quickly and got right to removing the hairs on my upper lip, chin, and cheek areas. I&#x27;ve been getting waxed at salons for a number of years and I think the pain factor of the Spring Sprong is equal to that of waxing. You can definitely feel and see it working. My skin was a bit red afterward, but the irritation was gone after a few minutes. It did a great job of removing the fine hairs (which is what make up most of my face fuzz), but I had to use tweezers for the hairs that were really short and the ones that were embedded just barely under my skin and close to surfacing (my stylist calls them pepper spots). The pain takes getting used to (it feels like waxing without the goop), but overall, this is a great product for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> I love it. ...., I bought that last time for me, it saved me lot of money. this time I ordered it for my friend, she wanted to gave it a try. I got it very fast, only one complain she had wished they send REM spring with a pouch, which they have a picture on the paper inside the package, she just got Spring no cover, so She have to find something where she can keep this (but when I ordered last time It came with cover..so don&#x27;t know why not this time...). So if you are ordering that make sure they send you cover too, its very convenient to keep it in place. Using is little tricky, its basically needs roll and twist movement against the hair growth, but there are many U-Tube videos on spring, they have demonstrated beautifully. With little practice you can master that, be aware it hurts when your hair pull, but as you keep using it you will get use to it. And for keeping face free from unwanted hair you might have to use almost 2- 3 times a week depends on how much hair you have. I generally use it right after my shower, that way I don&#x27;t hurt as much and also I always use my astringent after I finish using REM--just a suggestion....overall great product.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I read the reviews about this product, so when it arrived I was eager to use it immediately. However, I was really disappointed with the results. It didn&#x27;t really pull out all the facial hair, even when I go through the same areas over and over. I didn&#x27;t mind the pain (yes, its painful!), but I just wanted to see good results, and I didn&#x27;t. Can&#x27;t recommended.</li>
            <li> This little tool gets the job done and fast. I gave it 4 stars because the handles could be better. It should be a little bigger and maybe made with a different material so it doesnt always slip out of your hands.</li>
            <li> I bought the REM Spring Sprong about 6 months ago. I use it once a week.  It is very easy to use once you play around with it a bit.  I use it mainly for my upper lip and for my pesky chin hairs.  It works well to pull them out.  You can see that it is working because all of the hairs are stuck in the spring.  That being said, it is very easy to clean as well.  The only trouble I have had with it is that it does not always pluck the coarse, dark hairs.  I sometimes have to tweeze those regularly.  But, it is a lot better than having to tweeze all of the hairs one at a time.  It does leave some redness, but that goes away pretty quickly.  Is there some pain?  Yes.  When you are ripping hair from your body, you are going to have some pain.  This pain is manageable.  The more you use it, the more you get used to it.  Overall, it is a helpful product that I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I just received my REM Spring in the mail yesterday and I am amazed at how quickly I was able to get it to work.  I watched several youtube tutorials on this product while I was waiting to receive it and that helped.  This product works so well! It pulls the hair out by the root and you don&#x27;t even need a mirror.  I don&#x27;t mind using tweezers, but I have a hard time seeing all of the hair, either because my eyesight is no longer 20/20 or the location makes it difficult to see and tweeze at the same time.  The REM Spring pulls out multiple hairs at once and again, no need to see what you are doing.  I used it last night while watching a movie without a mirror or even a light on! In a nutshell, you bend it into a \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape and then twist the ends in a circlular motion, while running the spring across your face.  To be clear, it is painful!!!  A few times, I had to \\&quot;untwist\\&quot; the spring by turning the ends in the  opposite direction to \\&quot;let go\\&quot; of the hair, because I didn&#x27;t feel as though I could take the pain!  All in all, I really love this product and have been thinking of ways ot reduce the pain.  My first thought is to use an after-sunburn type gel on your face first to help numb the surface and ease the pain.  That and pop an ibuprofen about 20 minutes beforehand.  I will have to experiment and will update my review with the results!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with some doubt in my mind, because many hair removal products just don&#x27;t seem to work for me. I have very dark hair and very fair skin, so any facial hair shows up very clearly, and I&#x27;ve always been extremely self-conscious about people looking closely at my face. I purchased the REM Spring and in the first evening of getting it, I had managed to remove all of the hair that had been bothering me since I was a kid! It&#x27;s quick, and because I already use an epilator regularly, this was relatively painless in comparison. The REM Spring is also great because it&#x27;s so small and portable, doesn&#x27;t use electricity, and its stainless-steel body has no disposable parts to damage the environment. It&#x27;s also easy to sanitize. I have been using this for about two months now and have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest advantage of this product is that you don&#x27;t necessarily have to be squinting into a magnifying mirror to remove the hair; I can use it while watching TV or reading. It took me only about 5 minutes to figure out how to use it according to the directions, and I absolutely love this thing. Effects on hair and hair regrowth are the same as tweezing or epilating. A friend wanted to go get facial threading done, but this is cheaper and you can do it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-cannot reliably do eyelid area below eyebrows (the instructions advise against it because you could catch your eyelashes. If this happens, pull on both ends of the spring to release it.)&lt;br /&gt;-the grips at the end are a bit small, but not that it changes the effectiveness of the item&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not really sure how to clean the inside of the spring, but that also doesn&#x27;t affect the usage at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-sustainable, long-term product made of stainless steel&lt;br /&gt;-no chemicals, unlike using hair-removal creams&lt;br /&gt;-no disposable parts (unlike razor cartridges)&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-tiny and portable&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-same amountof pain as with tweezing/epilating&lt;br /&gt;-very fast to remove large amount of hair as opposed to tweezing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give this a try, because I&#x27;d never heard of this before and it&#x27;s absolutely great!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this thing. I have very stubborn hair that I have even had trouble removing with wax so I was worried that like so many other things I have tried this product would work for most girls but not me. I am happy to say that is not the case. This is truly life saving for someone who suffers with unwanted facial hair. It is so much faster and easier than waxing and for me it even works better. It is so quick and easy that I can remove hair in a couple of minutes. So many times I would get ready to go somewhere and panic because I didn&#x27;t have time to tweeze or wait for wax to heat up. No more! This is so fast. It has boosted my confidence! I have fought unwanted hair for 10 years and wish I would have known about this sooner. It is the best thing I have found yet and extremely affordable! I can&#x27;t say enough good about this thing!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised and happy with this little device. It was easy to figure out and use, I had it working on all of my peach fuzzy upper lip hair and had it removed in less than 5 minutes. It stings a little but hair removal at the root does, waxing and tweezing are no different. The results are not as drastic as waxing or using a depilatory cream but for way less hassle you get 95% of unwanted hair removed and I kind of prefer a realistically groomed look to a an overly perfect fake look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes me feel bad for my grandmother. I used to watch her sit in front of a magnifying mirror and painstakingly pluck hairs from her cheeks, chin, and upper lip on a nightly basis. If she had an R.E.M. she could have saved a lot of time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, buying on Amazon was a snap. Got this item for a good price and free shipping too thru supersavers.</li>
            <li> First, you need to figure out how to use it, but that&#x27;s not too hard. It does pluck unwanted hair BUT it is very painful and plucking becomes a long process as the spring only covers small areas at a time. For me, it&#x27;s not worth my time, effort and suffering.</li>
            <li> This is involves a lot less pain than waxing and takes less time than tweezing. It takes a sec to get the hang of it, but its easy going after that.</li>
            <li> This is one of those slap-yourself-on-the-forehead, \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t I think of that\\&quot; ideas. It is just a spring. But it works! I have very fine blonde hair, and I&#x27;m super paranoid about the peach fuzz on my chin and upper lip. I tried waxing and it made be break out REALLY bad. I&#x27;ve tried tweezing, but it is SOOO time-consuming and I just can&#x27;t see all the tiny hairs. I considered getting an epilator, but with my sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t imagine that would go very well. Then I found this thing and decided to give it a shot. It works really well. And no pinching skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt? A little bit. But if you can handle plucking your eyebrows, you can use the REM Spring. Just pretend it tingles. Give it a shot. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this out for fun, as I read a number of reviews.  I use this around my face while watching a movie or something, and it really does work.  It takes a few minutes to get the right arch angle of the spring, but you can hear and feel it working.  I don&#x27;t have a real hair \\&quot;problem\\&quot; but I use it for the thicker more apparent hair around my mouth.  I&#x27;m very happy I bought this; great product :)</li>
            <li> This product works in removing hair a little at a time. It is slightly painful so using it can only be for small sessions at a time. It definitely removes hair but it only takes a bit at a time so it takes awhile to start seeing a difference. Overall if you have patience and pain tolerance this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this but can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to make it work properly. Is it me or????</li>
            <li> Got rid of my wife&#x27;s mustache so I love it!</li>
            <li> Just got this today and used it tonight. Amazing. I have had problem facial hair my whole life. I&#x27;ve done depilatories, bleaching, tweezing, even shaving. I work very closely with young students as a reading tutor, and I am aware that little kids don&#x27;t want to be looking at a grandma&#x27;s mustache. I have friends who go regularly to electrolysis, but that&#x27;s expensive and time-consuming. I sat in front of the TV and did my face (do I say &amp;#34;sprung&amp;#34;?) in about 20 minutes. I&#x27;m sure it will go faster next time. Easy, thorough, and effective. Yes, it hurts a bit. Not too much. Yes, my skin got a little pink. I just washed and moisturized my face and it&#x27;s fine. My lip and jaw are hair free! I love this product so much! Could hardly wait to post a review.</li>
            <li> I loved this the first couple times. Wax tends to rip my skin, and have to pluck. This removed all the hair and was much faster than plucking. Now it still removes a good amount of hair, but I have to use tweezers to remove the final 20%.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to find something to make removing unwanted chin hairs faster and easier. I have tried professional laser hair removal and it only lasted about a year before it started to grow back. This product is great if you have fine hairs but, it does not grab the coarser hairs which I unfortunately have covering my chin. I will continue to use on my upper lip as those hairs are a lot finer but as for the chin hairs I will continue to use a combination of plucking one by one and shaving. Hopefully I will find something that will make my life a bit easier in this area since I apparently have very stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does. As soon as I got the R.E.M. Spring, I used it right away.  It was really awkward the first couple of trys.  After I got the hang of it (which took all of about half a minute) it was smooth sailing.  I have waxed, used nair, and threaded my own face for years.  What I like about this product is that it&#x27;s quick, clean, and very effective. This little device is awesome.  It does what it says it does and it does it very well. I am very impressed and I will be buying some for my sisters that tried it and loved the product as well. I would give this a million stars!</li>
            <li> I have had a &#x27;stache since I was 13 years old. My mother was virtually hairless so provided no guidance on how to deal with things like foo man choo &#x27;staches and unibrow. Let&#x27;s just say that my hair management evolution has been interesting. I have plucked, waxed, bleached, shaved, etc, etc, etc. Hands down, this little gadget is the facial hair winner!! Ignore the instructions to bend it in a \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape. EPIC fail when I tried that. However, if I use just a slight bend, it rips out those little hairs like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!! Finally a solution for unwanted cheek hair! I don&#x27;t think I even realized how hairy my cheeks were until I saw all those little buggers trapped in the spring. So here&#x27;s the downside; yeah, it hurts. BUT it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as waxing and I think does a much better job of getting all the hair. The other thing I noticed is that I didn&#x27;t have a sudden outbreak of white head pimples where I removed hair. Any time I wax, I&#x27;m pretty much guaranteed that within a day or two, I have a handful of pimples in the waxed areas. Not a single pimple with using the spring. I also didn&#x27;t have the redness that waxing creates. I&#x27;m tossing out the wax strips and using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I was actually searching for the type of thread they use in threading techniques because I love the results of threading and wanted to do it myself at home for convenience...then I came across this. This product IS threading without the difficulty. It is so easy (unless you don&#x27;t read the two step directions first). Simply make a U shape and then twist your pincher fingers (making sure that your left and right are both going outward or inward at the same time). It gets everything! It even got the fine hair! I love this thing it is so quick and you get the hang of it after the first time (or about 10 minutes of playing with it). It is def NOT precise enough to do eyebrows!! Do not even try! I noticed that it is only as precise as it&#x27;s width (about the circumference of a pencil).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I am really impressed with this little tool.  I had watched a couple videos on youtube before trying it myself and did not find that it was difficult to use at all.  It does hurt a bit, but it&#x27;s a quick pain that only lasts a second.  I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t get all of the hair, and I wound up having to use tweezers in a couple places, but overall, it did a good job.</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I am a 28 year old, half- hispanic female with dark facial hair on my chin, upper lip and cheeks. I have used creams, I have waxed and I have shaved. I am just a real hairy person which is pretty embarrassing considering the fact that I am a woman. Hiding a mustache is just not possible with makeup :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I received this product today and laid on my bed to read the directions. I decided to experiment on my chin (no mirror) and I felt it pulling out the hair on the first try! Now, this might have been because I did watch review video&#x27;s before purchasing this product so I had a good idea of how to make it work. But the directions were also well written and I had no problems deciphering them. I got my entire chin done in less than two minutes, first try, no mirror. It is a Godsend. I do admit, it does literally yank out your hair and hurts a little. However, if you have ever grabbed more than one hair while tweezing then you know this feeling. I also noticed that it hurts more if you go slow (which people are bound to do the first time they try something). So, watch the videos so that you are a little more comfortable. There will be a little redness (just like with tweezing) but goes away pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does come with a holder which I was not aware of and it&#x27;s so small it will fit into any purse and even most clutchs. I kind of wish it was a drawstring bag but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing to know is that this product works quickly, works effectively and is easily carried around with you. I highly recommend to everyone who, like me, is embarrassed by their facial hair.</li>
            <li> I think it is the best invention since button up boots and so much cheaper than waxing. Takes a little while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> My wife usually spends 5-10 minutes every night miserably obsessing over stray chin hairs and peach fuzz.  She claims that after her first pregnancy, her hormones transformed her into a year-round werewolf.  Face creams always seem to irritate her skin and home waxing is messy, so she tweezes. And tweezes. And tweezes.  She found this product through a random search on google and ordered it immediately.  Upon its arrival she raced to the bathroom and spent 30 minutes learning how to use it effectively.  It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and the wife is really happy with it.  She says it&#x27;s a hundred times faster and more effective at removing the small (and almost unnoticeable) hairs.  Her face has never felt smoother and I can tell she&#x27;s a lot more confident. (even though it never bothered me)</li>
            <li> This works amazingly and hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for weeks! This is a great product I wish I&#x27;d found it years ago!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is easy to use and well made.  Not sure how we survived without these.  One of my favorite items to suggest to others!  My favorite gift to sisters, cousins and good friends!</li>
            <li> Very cheap and doesn&#x27;t work gave me and ugly cut / burn on my face so embarrassed ! Never again</li>
            <li> Ouch! For someone who has been getting waxed since she was 16 and tweezing since 12 I would say this product ia by far the most painful&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have much success, it was just far too uncomfortable and missed a lot. I bet with practice it would be good but couldn&#x27;t stick with it with the pain it induces</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and everything.  It kind of hurts but then you get used to it. You can also YOu tube the how to.  Anyway, I like the convenience of having something quick and easy and portable. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use! beats going all the way to the salon! I will order another one, just for back up.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Plucks out several hairs at a time, therefore saving me grooming time in the mornings. Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you!!! I am 38 and I have these horrible hairs on my chin! Not too many but enough! I use this device in my face and poof...my stubborn hairs are gone! I use it once a week to snatch the hairs out of my chin.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! If you can tolerate waxing, threading or tweezing you can definitely use this tool. After I finish, my chin is SMOOTH! I also use it on the small hairs on the sides of my lip.</li>
            <li> Oh. My. Gosh. I came across this product by accident and it intrigued me so much that I just HAD to buy it. (And I&#x27;m not an impulse buyer) I got it this morning and I&#x27;ve been using it for over an hour already! It works SO wonderfully. You can physically see the hairs coming out and for me, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as some of these reviews are letting on. It hurts mostly near the ears and above my lip. I will recommend this product to anybody who&#x27;s complaining about peach fuzz/facial hair. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t get this if you don&#x27;t have some pain tolerance for hairs being removed from your face. Think, plucking 10-20 hairs at once. It happens quick but it happens none the less.&lt;br /&gt;I think the most sensitive spot, for me, was upper lip *ZOINKS!* that&#x27;ll wake you up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I always do any grooming in the evening so it can heal as I sleep. I have tried creams to remove hair and HATE the smell and redness. I have also tried waxing but they don&#x27;t work well. So I was looking for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my spring today and after about 20-30 minutes I removed most of the hair that was bothering me. It was easier under the chin than around the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little sore now but I am about to go to bed. I also washed my face really well afterwards - so hopefully my skin will be ok tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to twist in and then out as someone else posted earlier. Also to keep it on your face firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was appalled when he asked about it and then, out of curiousity, thought he would try it. Then he was more appalled and actually discovered the backwards twirl to release hair. So there you have it. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands including the Bellabe and I highly recommend the R.E.M Spring over all of them. The springs on the other brands don&#x27;t hold their shape as well as the R.E.M. Spring.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the same R.E.M Spring I bought in early 2012.  The spring is still in very good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an Asian woman with black coarse hair - but my facial hair (and having used a threading tool for over 2 years now) is still very fine.  My sister, mom and cousins have had positive experiences with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the spring with isopropyl alcohol (and quickly dry it with a towel) after every use.  I also use witch hazel astringent on my face after threading.  Between the isopropyl alcohol on the tool and the witch hazel astringent - the acne breakouts are very rare.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I spent more time trying to figure out how to grab the hair than anything else.  The process took much to long.  I gave up, paid for threading, then came back home and tossed this contraption in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!!!  I wish I would have known about this years ago.  Results are very much like waxing, without all the hassle that comes with waxing.  My face is finally smooth.  I am so happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but ordered this anyway, because I was so tired of tweezing, and the creams and waxes just irritated my skin.  I also have a mole just above my upper lip, which I have injured with other methods of hair removal.  After several sessions of practicing with this, I have the hang of it, and it is AMAZING.  Yes, it is unpleasant, but it is worth it.  It is pulling hair out!  Depending on your pain tolerance, I&#x27;m sure the sensation gets better.  Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of a wuss. LOL. I&#x27;m on my 10th or 12th session, and it really doesn&#x27;t bother me much at all. I use this as I&#x27;m watching TV or a movie, so I&#x27;m nice and distracted!  Afterwards I&#x27;m amazed how smooth my skin is around my chin and lip, and there is no irritation on my mole or my skin.  Other reviewers noted that you have to get the knack of twisting the handles and also the preferred curve of the wand, which I totally agree with. I&#x27;d also advise moving in different directions on your skin to make sure you pull the hair from the angle that it is growing from. I&#x27;m SO glad I ordered this.  Bye-bye creams, waxes, and tweezing... hello smooth skin!</li>
            <li> This spring sprong was easy to use.  It did sting on a few hairs but it&#x27;s no worse than when you pluck an eyebrow hair out.  It didn&#x27;t pull out 4 or 5 of my courser hairs so I just plucked those by hand.  I never would have thought of doing that before trying this spring sprong thing.  I usually bleach but those 4 or 5 courser hairs would never lighten up enough.  I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now and it doesn&#x27;t get LESS painful! It still makes my eyes still tear up and makes me curse everytime I use it. It does work though which is nice and the hair that does grow back grows back lighter which is even better! Worth the few minutes of pain several times a week.</li>
            <li> After years of waxing I noticed that it was tough on my skin. I found out about this product and while it hurts, it hurts no more than waxing does and maybe a little less. Plus it&#x27;s easier and cheaper. Doesn&#x27;t really make my skin so red either like waxing. Gets rid of the little hairs here and there great.</li>
            <li> This tool really works. It&#x27;s low tech, so nothing to break and it&#x27;s super easy to use. Smart little gadget!</li>
            <li> WOW! I am in love with this product! I want to tell all my girlfriends! Where has this been all my life? Once you get the hang of this it rips all those nasty hairs out sooo much quicker than tweezing! It does hurt but no more than tweezing and my skin is red for a little bit but it goes away within a couple of hours. When I first tried this using the others reviewers suggestion of clockwise and counterclockwise it didn&#x27;t work so well but after experimenting it worked best for me to turn the handles in and put the spring below and move up. I go in different directions for hair that grows in different directions. The hairs that were not catching I found it helpful to pull out once i got a hold of them similiar to tweezing. Buy this product you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This thing works if you can get past the pain. It will make your eyes tear up. I dread using, but it works great.</li>
            <li> First thing is first. It&#x27;s painful. Granted, you&#x27;re in control so you can ice your face, control the speed etc, which threading places don&#x27;t do. I imagine it will get better over time, but it will take time. After using it initially, I did break out but I think that&#x27;s more my skin&#x27;s fault than the product&#x27;s. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and you don&#x27;t even need to instructions to see how it works.  It&#x27;s well built and has yet to break on me. Even when I pull the spring out to blow away the hairs, it holds well.  Overall, i&#x27;m pretty impressed and will certainly keep using it in replacement for threading or waxing. It doesn&#x27;t work on brows for some reason (probably due to the curvature of the face), but you can easily get those threaded by someone else anyway.</li>
            <li> Crap. And what&#x27;s worse, it was a painful piece of crap. I think they should sell this with something that can douse the pain cause I&#x27;m no wuss, but I was ready to throw this thing and hide under the covers.  I should&#x27;ve known that a metal spring wouldn&#x27;t be pain free, and I guess I did kinda know that. I mean, I did expect some pain. But the first time I used it, I just started yelling passwords to my bank accounts because I thought someone was torturing me for information. O.O</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise this thing highly enough, I wish I knew about it years ago.  This little tool does exactly what it is supposed to do easily, quickly, efficiently, and with no mess.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble using it like other people described, you just hold it up to your face and it starts ripping out all the tiny little hairs, so be careful!  I won&#x27;t need to go to the salon anymore or fool around with those flypaper-like home wax strips that never do a thorough job, and that I somehow always manage to injure myself with (I get  a small \\&quot;rip\\&quot; on the corner of my mouth that looks like a cold sore for a few days.  Nice.)  Tip - do this every day right when you get out of the shower, and it hurts less.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I first tried to use the Spring Sprong; it had such great reviews it I ordered it and it hadn&#x27;t really occurred to me that it was going to be a HUGE problem getting it to work for me. On top of having pretty bad arthritis to begin with, I have joint replacements in my left hand and my left thumb is fused at the knuckle. Somehow being bionic managed to slip my mind as I hit the \\&quot;buy with one click\\&quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some pinch grip left in my hands but the smaller something is, the harder it is for me to grip. Try as I might spinning this thing in different rotations just wasn&#x27;t going to happen. I looked at the tool again and realized the tapered ends were the problem if they were just wider somehow I could get a better grip on them and maybe get it to work. Frustrated, I consulted my toolbox to see if anything in there could be of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strapping tape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut off a small section and trimmed it to about two-thirds the height of the \\&quot;handles\\&quot; of the Spring Sprong. I placed the edge of the tape near the thinnest part of the tapered handle and started winding. Before long I had built up what looked more like a Q-tip bulb shape on each end. The new \\&quot;handles\\&quot; were much easier to get a grip on and I gave it another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I might be able to use the same handle building idea with something other than tape so it will look a little better but for now at least it gets results; I am still pretty slow at this but it *does* work.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work as was promised :(  I cannot see that it removes any hair;  only irritates my skin. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted the money on it.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> This product really gets the job done.  There is a little sting involved, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable.  It is very simple to use and my chin was baby smooth after just one use.</li>
            <li> Did try it. It does work. A little painful but did remove some facial hair. alternative to tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use this to get rid of the hair on the cheek bone area. It gets the job done. It was a little painful in the beginning, but II got used to it, and I use it on a weekly basis ever since I bought it, which is around three years now! An Excellent Product!</li>
            <li> TORTURE.  Seriously, pain ten times worse than anything ever. I don&#x27;t know why. But seriously. Like whoa. I got this because I wanted a non-shaving alternative to the chemical creams that burn the hair out of your face. Is this natural? Sure. Does it feel natural? No. It feels like Hell. I only use it when I have to. And I still break out in a rash (I have sensitive skin), though not as much as when I pluck, go figure. Only works with longer hair, so you gotta grow your woman-beard out to the point of people noticing. Sigh. Just wish I never had to deal with any of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works very well and I was surprised how great it was for the upper lip area. A little painful through but not unbearably so. Also, a little tricky on the chin area. You have to play with the angle a little to get it right.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over 4 years now, i had to buy a new one as I gave mine to my niece. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the company no longer providers the pouch and you buy the product, now you have to buy separately, it was nice have the bag and you put it away.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money! Followed directions and reviews.  No help and definitely didn&#x27;t deliver as promised.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Works as stated. It is painful the first time I use it especially at the area between the nose and upper lip, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money for me.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  Maybe it was just me.</li>
            <li> This product does indeed work.  It takes longer than promised, especially if your hair doesn&#x27;t all grow in one direction.  But it does work.  (really well above the lip, but...YOUCH!)</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I read about it in Oprah&#x27;s O Magazine and they loved it. When I received it, I read the directions and even went to the REM website and watched a video of how to use it, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work for me. I almost gave up and thought about tossing it, but then I decided to experiment since there were other people who liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what worked:&lt;br /&gt;1.) You don&#x27;t necessarily have to bend the spring into a tight U shape as shown in the pictures (you can also use it bent just a little into a wide rounded U shape).&lt;br /&gt;2.) Lay the spring against your skin just below where you want to remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.) As you slowly move the spring upward, twirl the right hand fingers clockwise and the left hand fingers counter-clockwise. If you twirl them the opposite way, no hairs get grabbed (this was the main thing I needed to figure out and the instructions didn&#x27;t explain it).&lt;br /&gt;4.) Doing this grips the hairs and pulls them out, and yes, it does hurt for a split second but no longer than that and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin at all pink or red or irritated.  I suspect it hurts more when you first start using it, but after multiple uses, I&#x27;m thinking it will hurt less.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot understand why the REM company doesn&#x27;t explain how important it is to twirl your fingers in the right direction.  I was ready to toss the thing. I should add that the hairs I want to grip are not at all unusual (just your average thing). So I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I had to figure this out for myself, whereas the company could have done a better job of explaining how to use it. Once you figure this stuff out, the spring itself does a great job and is worth 5 stars for how it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have used this for quite a while now, and it by far hurts the most the first time you use it, I guess because it is grabbing the most hairs that first time.  I find that I need to use it 2 or 3 times a week, and when you do that, you&#x27;re only picking up those hairs that are long enough to be grabbed.  It hurts much less because there are less hairs than the first time (I think individual hairs grow at different rates).  So definitely do not judge this based on the first-time level of pain - it&#x27;s no big deal and I LOVE the way it works.  I have read what other people said about turning \\&quot;both hands in, then both hands out\\&quot; and that accomplishes the same thing I recommended (right hand clockwise, left hand counterclockwise) - that accomplishes \\&quot;both hands in\\&quot; and that is the sweep that grabs the hairs and pulls them out. The \\&quot;both hands out\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t grab any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update:  I&#x27;m still using this 2-3 times a week and I love it!  I have noticed one additional thing that I thought I would mention.  I have a magnifying mirror which I use occasionally and I&#x27;ve noticed that there are a few hairs that grow in somewhat different directions from the others.  Most of my hairs get grabbed when I sweep upwards at them from below, but there are a few that grow in an upward direction, or from right to left or left to right, and those weren&#x27;t getting grabbed with the others.  So now I sweep at the hairs from every possible direction: upwards, downwards, right to left, left to right, diagonally, etc.  This picks up those remaining hairs.  This also should help if you&#x27;re trying to get hairs on a curvy surface like your chin area. Just remember that whatever direction you&#x27;re sweeping, the right hand goes clockwise and the left hand goes counter clockwise.you&#x27;re only picking up those hairs that are long enough to be grabbed.

            <li> I used to have my upper lip waxed regularly at a salon and got tired of trying to fit it in to my schedule.  I tried home waxing (ugh!).  Then settled on various chemical removers or when in a hurry, one of those little battery powered hair removers/shavers.  I saw the REM Spring and figured I&#x27;ve tried everything else, why not.  This little thing completely exceeded my expectations.  Yes, there is some discomfort - it is pulling your hairs out after all.  But it is no worst than waxing.  And no irritation afterward, which I always had to deal with after waxing or using a chemical remover.  I use a magnified mirror to help see what I&#x27;m doing and in a few short minutes...smooth, smooth, smooth.  I&#x27;m ordering another to keep in my travel bag.  I only wish I had found this sooner!</li>
            <li> It seems to remove finer or medium hairs, and that is good.  But I still have to pluck out some coarser ones with tweezers.  I am not buying a No No! as it has not gotten very good reviews, and is expensive - so the REM will have to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have a problem of hard chin hairs and its really irritating. Visiting parlor to get it waxed or thread every other is very expensive. But this little amazing tool is answer to my hard black chin hairs that grow back super quick.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and since then my upper lips and chin is not a problem now. I love it and I can use this tool even watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as on the packing it mentions there is a special pouch that comes along with this packing, it was not there.&lt;br /&gt;Packing was open and the pouch was missing. So that part is not good .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise its worth !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 4 start because the packing was open and pouch was missing</li>
            <li> I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) Which causes unwanted hair growth.  This thing is amazing! I just tried it, and it way less painful than tweezing and waxing, or painful laser treatments that didn&#x27;t really work for me anyhow.  And, it&#x27;s SO FAST!  Just roll it across the area, and you are done!  Leaves only mild redness that is very temporary.  It&#x27;s kind of like threading I&#x27;d say. This thing should last forever too cause there is nothing to break.  If you have any unwanted hair, buy this thing. It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I feel duped. Either I am an idiot and missing something or this product is a scam. Did not pull any hair at all anywhere, I mean it pulls ,( and does so painfully)  but does not pull the hairs out, and I thought that was the goal?</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on a recommendation from a friend.  The R.E.M Spring worked great.  It wasn&#x27;t difficult to learn to use, and I had success the first try.  It did tingle a bit at first, but that was no big surprise from reviews I have read.  Now I can get rid of that baby fuzz that bugs me when light hits it.  No woman I know wants to have extra hair, especially on her face.  This will work great if you give it a try.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time yesterday and YEAH !!! it pulls the hair out from the roots...U cud actually see the white ends on the hair !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some getting used to tho !!! U have to place it NOT the direction the hair grows but OPPOSITE !! so when u spin either ends it wud grab the hair from the end !!! and YES..it YANKS IT OUT !!! its not a painful yank but it is quite tolerable---give or take ur tolerance for pain !!! :).............GREAT  PRODUCT !!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to try this! It is faster and easier than waxing. Just as efficient and way less messy! I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in this product. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that it came with 2 springs!</li>
            <li> so being a brown girl, I have facial hair EVERYWHERE. this is a really good alternative to threading, especially if you don&#x27;t know how to do it. this rips the hair right out. yes, it hurts, but its worth it. my face looks a billion times better!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Removes hair easily from cheeks, chin, and upper lip area. It will hurt a little bit in the beginning but then you get used to it. It gives very tiny little bumps, but they disappear in a day or so.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Nair and Sally Hansen depilatories, painful waxing, and plucking to get rid of my unsightly facial hair (upper lip, chin, sideburns).  Depilatory creams lost their potency over time and left my skin burned and irritated, waxing caused bleeding, and plucking didn&#x27;t remove hair from the root and produced bumps on my skin.  I even considered electrolysis/laser hair removal, but did not do it because of the enormous price tag and the fear that my face would be ruined in case something went wrong.  My cousin told me about the REM hair remover and purchased it as a gift for me, and I used it for the first time today.  I would recommend this product to every woman suffering from unsightly facial hair and can&#x27;t afford to buy store products all the time or do laser hair removal.  Yes, it is a little painful at first, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all! It is no more painful than threading and much, much less painful than depilatories and waxing.  There was no irritation or redness noticeable on my skin, unlike with waxing and hair removal creams.  It was easy to use when I followed the instructions (included) and pulled hairs from the root - even hairs that I could not see on my face!  My skin feels so smooth and hair-free, even after only one use!  It even comes with a carrying case, so I can put in my purse and take it with me on the go. I will continue to use it to keep my facial hair at bay! :)  Wonderful product - definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased anything that works so well and is even better than it&#x27;s advertising.  It&#x27;s so easy; I usually just run it over my chin and upper lip while I&#x27;m watching television or reading, a real no-brainer.  No pain or discomfort at all, maybe just a little &amp;#34;twinge&amp;#34; that hardly registers.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but quickly changed my mind after just one use! It&#x27;s easy to use and not painful at all! My mom and sister have one as well.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this sooner!! I absolutely love this product! It is easy to use and works great. I used to tweeze and it would take me so much time but with this product I get better results in a fraction of the time. I didn&#x27;t find it very painful but I&#x27;m used to the pain from tweezing. I&#x27;m very glad I found this! :)</li>
            <li> At first i was going to give up because i can&#x27;t imagine how this 1 simple spring can take the hairs off. But once you get a handle of it, it works. Feel just like threading at the threading spa. I love it. No more razor on my face</li>
            <li> This pulls all your hair out at one time. The problem is it does not pull hairs out by the root, but by the tip. So this makes it painful and causes in-grown hairs. I hardly ever get in-grown hairs and they were terrible after I used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough that some women have to bear the embarrassment of hair on the face.  Using this remover is tedious, very painful and I feel a total waste of money.  Unless you have only two or three hairs on your face, prepare for a lot of work, and, a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this product and figured she would try it out. She said it is painless and does the job. She uses it every once and while.</li>
            <li> This is the quickest, easiest, most pain free facial hair removal technique I have tried.  I use it on the fine, blonde hair on the sides of my face &amp; along my jawline &amp; it gives smooth hair free skin &amp; did not hurt a bit. (it did hurt a little when I used it above my lip but did the job well so was worth it).  The first time I used it I got a few post hair removal bumps under the skin as I do after waxing but I must have got used to it as I haven&#x27;t had any after subsequent uses.  I purchased a threading tool at the same time and found the REM spring much easier to use and more effective. The other thing I like about this better than waxing is I do it weekly and it removes the short hairs in each cycle as they grow rather than waiting 4 weeks between waxing appointments.  The fact that it is very cost effective is a bonus.  My search for an effective facial hair removal technique ends here.  Easily 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This thing pulls hairs, it really does, any maybe I&#x27;m still trying to perfect the technique but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do so well on coarse hairs. This could be my experience because I don&#x27;t let those more noticeable hairs get very long but thing is, I can feel the spring catching them but not pulling them out.  I think it&#x27;s worth a go, but I&#x27;m going to say that if you have coarse hairs that you yourself have issues pulling out via tweezers individually this probably won&#x27;t work on those hairs.</li>
            <li> Very bed product it is not easy to use .it is very paimfull product  I disagree with all the publicity</li>
            <li> This actually works.  I like that you don&#x27;t have to wait until the hair grows out in order to use it again.  I definitely recommend it.  It doesn&#x27;t even hurt.</li>
            <li> This works well when you have a lot to pluck.  It doesn&#x27;t do individual hairs...well I can&#x27;t get it to.  Long and Thin and gets lost in drawer easily so I started just keeping it in the box instead of loose or in the &#x27;pouch/sleeve&#x27; that comes with it.  Just takes a bit to get the feel of using it.  I don&#x27;t twist it...just bend and straighten to grip and pull out hair.</li>
            <li> This is the most fantastic facial hair removal system I have ever found! I struggled with facial hair that was difficult to tweeze and get it all. I hated being in the sunlight before the R.E.M. Spring. I even stopped wearing make up because it showed the hair even more. It can be painful at first. The upper lip is a challenge but I did it in stages and it wasn&#x27;t so bad. Then once the first fine hairs are gone it goes much easier. The trick is to do it frequently so it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to grow back as thick as the first time. I have told friends who have now ordered them and I am getting one for each of my sisters. No red bumps and the reddness that follows the use of the spring disappears within the hour.</li>
            <li> OK so ive been waxing my face for years and will no longer heat wax again.  as ive aged I routinely pay good money for &amp;#34;youth rejuvenation&amp;#34; that does not mix well with waxing.....i.e. unless your considering a total skin peel..ouch!! im sooo glad I found this product and will definitely be telling my friends and sisters about this product.  With my new position in the public eye, its crucial I bring my &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; game everytime in a crowd and am confident this will help those tv and photog moments. Thank you REM, you&#x27;ve just recruited a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! I&#x27;m still using it, though I may say it&#x27;s a bit pricey, nonetheless, I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it still works perfectly fine. Hurts at first, then kinda feels good. Haha! But hey, no pain, no gain right? :D</li>
            <li> A very nice product i have seen so far. Worth the wait and money spent. Results get better by practice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am 70 years old and facial hair has become a bit of a problem for me.  Mostly it is fine, light colored hair on my chin, cheeks and ajowls... almost invisible to most people.. but not me.  I use this tool to remove it easily and quickly.  I&#x27;m so happy I discovered it.  As others have said, it will not remove tough dark hairs.. so you still need tweezers for those.</li>
            <li> This works better than waxing - gets the smallest, finest hair. Takes a little practice, but so worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Completely cuts the hair at the upper lip area so it feels like shaven, and it doesn&#x27;t take the hair out from root as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over a year ago, and couldn&#x27;t get the hang of how to use it. It sat in my make-up kit for the last year,but after so many instances of burning my skin with all types of depilatory creams, I decided to give the R.E.M. spring another try. Oh my gosh, I&#x27;m sooo glad I did. The spring REALLY works! You just have to practice to see what works for you, don&#x27;t give up if at first you don&#x27;t succeed. What worked for me was to use less of a U shape sometimes almost a straight spring with only the handles turned down, twirling the handles between thumb and index finger (thumbs moving towards each other), rolling it slowly over cheeks chin,lip, or wherever I need it with medium to light pressure....VOILA, &#x27;FUZZ\\&quot; free. The first time took the longest and was slightly uncomfortable, rather like little stings when the hairs are extracted. Remember, that hairs grow at different rates, and what you can&#x27;t catch today will be long enough to catch tomorrow. If it&#x27;s not long enough to pull  it&#x27;s not long enough to be noticeable,so no big whup.&lt;br /&gt;I do a daily over-all, takes 5 minutes, MAYBE, bonus; there seems to be a lot less hair growing back! Face is SUPER SMOOTH and I haven&#x27;t experienced redness or irritation. Have introduced family member to the R.E.M. spring and she loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a review writer as a rule, but this product has worked so well... no more burned skin as well as no more problems with facial hair, I just had to share.</li>
            <li> When the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover arrived I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to work it because the included instructions were minimal to say the least.  It does take a little experimenting to get it to work, but with the help of some amazon reviews and a video review (also Amazon) I was able to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What worked for me was holding it in a U shape and I turned the side in my right hand clockwise and the one in my left hand counter-clockwise (That is, I was turning both sides so that they were going the same direction).  It worked best when going against the hair follicle, slowly and firmly moving the spring across the area. I&#x27;d also like to note that you don&#x27;t necessarily have to have the spring bent into a U shape to make it work.  For me it worked, when it was in the U shape as shown in the picture, but in other variations as well, slightly bent, at different angles, it even worked flat and straight on some areas-though it worked best in a U or semi-bent shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point is, you&#x27;ll probably have to play with it a bit to get the hang of it and see what works for you.  It hurts at first, but honestly it was more of a mild irritant for me, not too bad, kind of like when you first start plucking your brows.  It definitely does not hurt as much as waxing does, and the pain passed quickly.  However it will probably vary from person to person as to how much pain you experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line is It worked and got rid of almost all those pesky facial hairs I had in a very short amount of time with minimal pain.  I am absolutely thrilled with this product, finally a facial hair remover that actually does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> I works really well for chin and lip hair, but aside from that I don&#x27;t see it working for anything else.  I use it though because its cheaper than threading</li>
            <li> I do not often leave reviews, but I am so delighted by this product, I wanted to share my excitement. This little spring works great!  I found it very easy to use, with no learning curve whatsoever.  It was a little painful around the lip area the first time I used it, but after that it only felt like a tingle.  I have a lot of facial hair, and this product is a real game-changer for me.</li>
            <li> This is an effective tool. It seems as though it will last for years. I like the way it leaves the tiny hairs behind and only grabs the bigger ones--this actually results in a more youthful and natural look than methods that remove all the hair, like waxing or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts! I can only stand to do a little at a time. I just keep it on the bathroom counter and do it once or twice every now and then. It does become less painful over time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on the glowing reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the accolades. The product works similarly to other epilators from the past twenty years or so:  a curved coil rotates, pinching and pulling hairs out. The difference is that you control the rotation, rather than an electric motor. This is great for those light, barely noticeable hairs on the upper lip and sides of the face,but if you have the coarser, darker hair on the chin and neck, it will have to grow to a noticeable stubble before it is long enough for the spring to catch. The whole point of epliators is to prevent the noticeable stubble in the first place. To recap: more useful for the light hairs that can grow longer without being noticed, not good for the coarse, dark hairs that are noticeable the moment they grow past the epidermis. No quite a fail, but not quite a miracle either.</li>
            <li> i expected this to be some kind of hit and miss sort of thing, but with great reviews, i bought it! i got it today and got it earlier than expected, a definite bonus. i used it today and read the instructions briefly, and within 2 minutes i was using it! maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;ve waxed and threaded before because the pain wasn&#x27;t too terrible- but it worked great and felt smooth! not raw or anything (though i think I grazed a part of my skin which had a cut or something on it and made it feel bad. don&#x27;t use over broken skin! that is an obvious measure). works great and feels very smooth! love this and i think i am going to be excited to see what else it does in the future! i used it on my upper lip/chin and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was little worried, since this is my first time using such a product. But it exceeded my expectation, love this product.</li>
            <li> omg, i&#x27;ve had this forever and i just LOVE it. i used to have to go into those little salon&#x27;s at wal-mart and have my lip waxed in full view of everyone. i was so embarrassed. i also found it embarrassing to go to places and say you want your lip waxed. everything else i tried in the privacy of my home never worked that well. but then i saw this on oprah (or a similar item) and gave it a try. i can&#x27;t live without it! it kind of hurts, but its worth it and you get used to it. if you do it right after a hot shower the pain is lessened significantly. since i got this i havent set foot in a salon to ask to get my lip waxed. i just quickly do it at home. i cant live w.o this product</li>
            <li> has saved me time and money. no more painful then threading and you get used to it faster than threading.</li>
            <li> Could not get this product to work at all, tried and tried but I could not get it to remove and hair.</li>
            <li> I find this to be helpful in the chin area but difficult to use. Maybe with more practice it will become easier. It was worth what I paid for it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It helped remove a lot of facial hair, however it doesn&#x27;t remove all of it.  I use an eyebrow tweezer to remove the rest.  It is painful to use.  But overall I think it is ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this springy thing. It takes just a bit of practice, but then you&#x27;re up and running.  The ouch factor is not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> I love it!. I use it only for my upper lip facial hair and it works great! You have to get used to the feeling but once you do is the fastest most effective way to do it at home without the mess of wax or cream. You do need to moisturize your skin a little bit after doing it.</li>
            <li> Works great without leaving marks on the face. Great not to constantly have to be paying for a depilatory, which leaves burn marks, and then the potency of the cream fades before you&#x27;ve barely gotten through the tube.  I do have trouble getting certain hairs above my lip and wonder if a smaller spring like I&#x27;ve seen at local stores could be helpful on certain curves of the face.  There is some flicking pain still, after having used the product a number of times.  But it just hurts in the second the hair is being removed, doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m VERY happy to have discovered this product.</li>
            <li> This works best to remove hair above my upper lip and below my lower lip and chin.  I have used hair removal creams in the past and have burned my face even when I left it on for half the suggested time, so this is much safer.  However, this spring doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the hair from the sides of my face very well.  After the first couple times it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I would suggest washing your face after using, because my face broke out with acne which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> Very happy!!! It works great....No more uncomfortable, time consuming, unhealthy waxing and chimicals!!THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves little broken hairs, which turns to ingrown hairs, it&#x27;s not good hair grows back faster in my opinion. goodluck</li>
            <li> Love this!  Easiest hair remover ever.  It does hurt the first couple times, but then it&#x27;s not too bad.  And no prep or cleanup so easy to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> This spring works... I&#x27;m not going to lie tho.  It hurts!</li>
            <li> This feels like a torture device. I can&#x27;t lie. I try and use it but I&#x27;m reluctant. The quality is great and it is stainless steel so should last. I use it then clean with an alcohol wipe. It&#x27;s just painful, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this spring tool is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  they are all painful but this one is the least painful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long I tweezed the hair under my chin and on it! This little thing has changed mine and my Mom&#x27;s life. It really really hurts though. But we can just roll it over a few times a week to keep things nice and smooth and voila! Perfectly smooth chin. I have some coarse hairs as well and it grabs those too. Love this and hope it lasts forever! Highly recommended if you have unwanted facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 23, 2016 This spring started to wear out and I would have to keep going over the same spot to try to get it to pull out the hair. I would still have to tweeze a few stubborn hairs it just wouldn&#x27;t grab. I started to order another one, but decided to get the Braun epilator and shaver combo 9 instead. It comes with attachments for ripping out the hair at the root on your face, body, anywhere really, and also has a shaver if you&#x27;d rather do that on more sensitive areas. I use the epilator part on my chin and under my chin and it removes every hair in a flash just about pain free. Way more thoroughly, quicker, and less painfully than this spring.</li>
            <li> I love removing hair with this - it&#x27;s so easy and addicting.  I do it while watching tv.  No mirror required.</li>
            <li> The pain is no problem. I have a high tolerance for pain. But it makes hair grow back thicker and darker than before. You might think that&#x27;s a myth but try using it for 6 months and see the results. I have of these and I have to say it&#x27;s not worth it, especially if you have dark hair. For blondes, it probably won&#x27;t matter. The plus side is that this is quick removal only. But I&#x27;ll be throwing it away now.</li>
            <li> This tool is very easy to use and very effective.  I used to get my lip waxed every 7-10 days.  This is just as good, but no wax residue left behind that led to at least one pimple every time.  It is so easy, I can do this every few days to keep my fast-growing hair in check!  I find there is less pain/tingling from this tool than there is with waxing or lip-sugaring.</li>
            <li> I found this product works best if I let the hair grow a few days, so I tried it on my upper lip and yea, it works but it hurts A LOT. I stopped using it however because it irritated my skin so much I guess from pulling many hairs at once. It would leave my skin red for over a day so that I would have a red lined area where you could see every hair was pulled from.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and handy... usually use while watching tv LOL.  I highly recommend it - don&#x27;t hesitate to order</li>
            <li> Well.. I gave it a four stars. It does work a lot faster than plucking and in between threading. It does cut some of the hairs which I didn&#x27;t like but if you have really good tweezers you can get them out. The pain... you can prepare yourself but it still won&#x27;t help the first time. My husband thought I was insane he saw the hair roll up in the spring and cringed but he was impressed by how smooth my skin was.You get used to it on other parts of your face, over the lip always hurts. If you want to be hairless and not spend a lot than you&#x27;ll tolerate it, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s kind of painful.  I don&#x27;t have the greatest technic yet, but I&#x27;m still learning.  It&#x27;s better than chemicals though and it&#x27;s less time consuming than plucking.</li>
            <li> This is great. All you have to do is quickly roll it over your hair and it rips it out. The first time is the hardest and I got pimples on my upper lip the first time but I had read that in a previous review so I had some salicylic acid on hand.  It worked so great I got my mother one as a gift too.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the less it hurts each time. definitely recommend it! :) the first time hurts pretty bad but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than the electric kind.  It takes some figuring out, but with practice it works very well.</li>
            <li> I just received the REM Spring a few days ago and i am hooked.  Using it is almost addictive when you are sitting i found myself taking it out of the box and using it while watching television.  My face has never been so smooth. It is not painless BUT it is not painful either a little above the lip but the res of the face is great.  I agree with another reviewer it works on fine hair, remember it sort of pulls it out so the thicker the hair, well ouch.  All in all i love mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with facial hair and can&#x27;t believe how well this works and how easy it is!  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it but the YouTube videos were very helpful.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of spring hair removers until I saw this one on Amazon. The reviews sold me and I ordered one. Before using the REM, I had to use a cream hair remover for hair on my chin every 3 days. When I had my chin waxed at the salon, stubble would begin to appear after 6 days. The REM spring stings when I use it but this happens less and less because there&#x27;s less and less regrowth with each use and it takes about 2 weeks for any hairs to appear. I&#x27;ve saved so much time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> I bought this with trepidation, as I was really fearful it wouldn&#x27;t work. The price is great for a product you know works, but a bit dear if it doesn&#x27;t.  Well, let me tell you, IT WORKS.  It is fabulous, by far my favorite method of facial hair removal.  Similar to tweezing, but faster and easier, and it gets a lot more than I can. And when the hairs grow back they aren&#x27;t coarse like shaved hairs get.  I sit and twirl this spring across my face while I watch tv and it just couldn&#x27;t be easier. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all of my lady friends. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> actually the rating is for the design, not for the product. if you are ok with the pain then this is ok for you. efficient but painful.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t even need a mirror to use this device.  If I feel a few hairs on my upper lip or chin... I just use the spring to remove the bothersome hairs and off I go.  I can use this spring while I am watching TV or quickly before I apply my makeup.  I generally use it every other day and so I really have very few hairs to pull and the pain is a non-issue.  So much better than waxing or crème removers or any other thing that I have tried.  Get away from the magnifying mirror and use the rem spring... so much easier!</li>
            <li> I bought this for $20!! And for what it does, I do not think it is worth that much. It&#x27;s good quality, there was nothing wrong when I got it. I&#x27;ve tried on my entire face, but I will only continue to use it on my upper lip since it hurts less there. The only thing I like is that it&#x27;s faster than threading my upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It just plain DOES NOT WORK. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it.  It sucks.</li>
            <li> Great efficient hair remover made of durable steel with nice metal handles at end. Small and handy, fits anywhere, good product</li>
            <li> OK, so  it&#x27;s just a wire-spring thing that you run across your face. Simple. Does it hurt - yep. Extremely, no, it&#x27;s manageable. The results are worth it though. Perfectly smooth without any blemishes.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good but if can bear the pain while using this, you can get it. We just used it twice and that&#x27;s it. Getting waxing or threading is easier than this. I would not recommend this if you can&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li> This hurts alot! The good thing is it doesnt cause breakouts and it is cheap.  If you can get through the pain, it will be a great product for you.  My advice would be to get a really good wax first to remove most of the hair, and use this to maintain.</li>
            <li> I think I have now purchased one of these for all my friends!  This device is ingenious!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. I am not sure if it pulls the hair from the root or just breaks it off, it hurts like it&#x27;s pulling it from the root. But I feel like it does a little bit of both.</li>
            <li> it did remove visible facial hair, but the thin hair were not, as seen with the use of a 20x magnifying mirror. i am kind of use to really have every single hair plucked, this tool have shorten time spent on plucking facial thin hair.</li>
            <li> Trying to keep my face hair free is literally a part time job; I never leave the house without a tweezer, I have one in my purse, car, bedroom, office etc... This is a fantastic product and the answer to my quest. I have been getting my eyebrows threaded for awhile and I love it but it made the rest of my face seem hairier; recently I added the having my upper lip done but found I could not get there every week or so and needed to find a more convenient and cheaper solution. Well ladies this is it. It does an outstanding job, I do it while watching TV or laying in bed. I do use my lighted makeup mirror for the &amp;#34;fine detail&amp;#34; work on my upper lip but found after a couple of uses this is not necessary . I also watched a video on you tube because I did not really understand the written directions and it took only a few minutes to get the hang of it. It does hurt a bit but  you get used to it easily and what hair removal procedure doesn&#x27;t hurt. I had my sister use it today and I must say even if I hated the tool the entertainment factor in watching her facial expressions while using it was &amp;#34;priceless&amp;#34;- bottom line is that sh asked me to order one for her and her two daughters.&lt;br /&gt;While I think the price is well worth it and far cheaper and convenient that going to the mall I decided to try a less expensive brand as my back ups and for my sister. But if you want fast and easy(although not painless) facial hair removal THIS IS IT!! next step will be the at home eyebrow threading tool !!  .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  bother with this product.  I tried every method suggested on how to use.  It just doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Take a little while to master the technique but its great!  My face has never been so hair free! Love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, I never write reviews for anything.  I&#x27;m a half African half Puerto Rican 26 year old with PCOS. I have coarse hair, very coarse stubborn hair that refuses to part with the follicles. Stubborn enough to not be picked up by waxing, or a battery-powered facial epilator. I had been looking for alternatives, when I found this little guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews posted and even factored in the negative ones. I&#x27;m familiar to threading (I get my brows threaded) but for some reason threading on my face doesn&#x27;t work as well, so I was a little skeptical. That and, how could something so simple be able to rip the hair out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I order this, it gets in the mail and I rip the package open. I immediately wash my face and make sure to pat it with a very warm towel and set to work. I had already seen the youtube tutorials and the instructions. I wasn&#x27;t surprised to find that it caught hairs... what I was amazed and delighted to feel was that half an hour later my chin was virtually hair-free. Tried it on one side of my stache, it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s not even red (I really think the hot towel helped). The tricky spots (under the chin) you have to play with the angles and you know it&#x27;s working when the thing just grabs it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m entering my opinion because I really do know this product works. Like those have said before me, you have to be patient with it, play with it, and be prepared to have some pain. ANYTHING that yanks hair straight out of the follicle is gonna hurt (Uh, duh?) and if you have stubble you&#x27;re probably trying to tug at new hair or you have to play more with the angle and the closeness of the spring to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product wins on all accounts. I don&#x27;t have to look like Chewbacca nor am I doomed to spending money on batteries, creams, wax that rips everything but your hair, and it&#x27;s relatively fast and easy, and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from coarse hair and understand there willbe some pain, this is a very worthwhile investment. I&#x27;m buying 2 more as backups :D</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing, threading, emjoi hair remover, and electrolysis -- I could have saved a lot of time, money and pain if I had purchased this earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot;, up to 3/8-1/2\\&quot;long, and some darker and longer hairs on my upper lip and chin/neck. I also have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out.  I had to schedule my threading/waxing/emjoi when I would have at least 4 days without seeing people!  Each time, I would get red spots that turned into pimples all over the area.  I used every cream that claimed a solution -- nothing worked.  So for 12 years, I just lived with break-outs in order to have an unhairy face.  Electrolysis I could afford only for those dark hairs, and that gave me bumps but no pimples.  But the cost--ugh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this product -- I was skeptical of the glowing reviews, but the price made it worthwhile to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNBELIEVABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it takes a few tries to develop a method that works for you, but you know when you have it right -- and other reviews/tapes offer suggestions, but for me it was just trial and error for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it stings as it pulls the hair, but big deal-- it is nothing to threading or waxing or emjoi or electrolysis.  And it is entirely in your control.  If it gets too much -- stop for a few minutes and go back later.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the first time is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as to the result -- it does tend to break off the fuzz since that hair is not strong enough to be pulled out (the emjoi does the same thing).  But for me, that is just what I prefer.  I want my face to look natural just less hairy -- and the broken-off fuzz makes it seem like I have the fuzz of a 5-year old.  I only went for the waxing/threading because that seemed one way to get rid of the long fuzz as well as the darker hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the darker hairs, they are stronger and I think they were pulled out at the root because I cannot see themat all -- no broken off ones at all.  If they had been broken off, I should feel them, because they are coarse -- and my skin is as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that brings me to the last result -- which was nothing! -- some redness (like a strong blush) that disappeared within 1/2 hour and NO PIMPLES! NO BUMPS AT ALL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this when I get out of the shower, and by the time I am ready for makeup, there is nothing to hide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, forget other hair removers and try this one FIRST!  Save yourself the money and pain I have gone through.</li>
            <li> If you like threading you will love this! I am blonde and have a lot of soft facial hair and it works like a charm! The lip is a bit sensitive but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> When I was in my mid 20&#x27;s I had some peach fuzz.  I thought it was normal and it wasn&#x27;t that bad. Then my boyfriend made fun of me and made me feel terrible so I did something I have regretted for the next 20 years. I shaved.  After that, the hairs grew in so dark and tough. I have been battling those little beasts ever since. I was extremely self-conscious and it pretty much ruined my social life.  First I shaved for quite a few years and it was really hurting my skin.  Then I maxed out my credit cards doing laser hair removal. I thought laser removal would be a permanent fix, but that&#x27;s not true. I wasted all that money! Then I did the little electric trimmer after the laser treatment sort of made the hair finer (for a short period).  The last thing I did is the epilator.  I like it except it is making my skin red and dry.  I started looking at waxing to see if that might be better. Then I saw this little gem.  I got it in the mail last night.  I gave it a try and it worked great, even on the stiff wiry hairs.  I just rolled it in different directions and it quietly pulled out those little boogers.  I cleaned up the rest with tweezers. I hope this will allow me to go camping. I have longed to go camping but did not want to end up looking like a cave man after a few days of not removing my man hairs.  This might be the device to change my life. The price is unbeatable and I believe this is going to be a life changer.  Painful? Who cares...it is worth a little pain to get your life back. It really isn&#x27;t that painful anyway.</li>
            <li> Well.. I am hairy with dark hair.. not sure if hormones or family genes.. I find myself constantly plucking, waxing shaving and never feel okay about results and do not want to go to the pros or cant afford to .. I found this neat thing and read a few reviews and watched videos.. I thought it was not too expensive to take a chance.. today it came in the mail.. I opened it up on my way to work and was excited to try it out.. seems weird.. but why not.. I got home tonight and have been trying the different angles to turn it to figure it out..sometimes I get nothing but Im sitting in a dark living room watching tv with my teen.. I simple twist at different angles and sometimes get stuff and sometimes not. my skin has started to feel baby smooth but not entirely yet.. normally I pluck and shave what I can not finish.. and have a dry course feel that I put makeup over.. ewww.. so far day one.. I am thankful for finding this.. Im not sure if its pulling from the roots or what.. my jaw area neck and chin do not hurt that much Im afraid to try my upper lip but maybe soon.. I  do recommend this product.. for minor hair issues or even more.. hair has to be long enough to grap up in it.. but not that much ..</li>
            <li> According to my wife: It works as described. Will make a good companion for emergencies. But not for regular use. Hair seems to look thicker when it comes back. Also, the speed of hair growth increases with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Okay for occassional use, not recommended for regular use.</li>
            <li> They say that it will tickle or sting slightly when using this device, they fail to mention that if you are using it for the first time and have a good amount of facial hair that it will burn for just a few seconds, but it burns. That aside, its a wonderful product. You just place over your lip, bend and twist and poof!! hair is gone, skin is smooth and non irritated. I was hesitant buying this product but now I am grateful I did. Will save me a lot on creams, and waxing, and bleaching etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and fast too. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s completely painless since you are plucking hairs basically, but in a faster inexpensive and cleaner way. This is the best method of removing facial hair in my opinion. It will have trouble picking the tiny hairs though, not that it&#x27;s a  problem since they are so tiny no one can see them. I use it 1-2 times a week. takes literally 2 mins.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few minutes but it seems to work okay, but hurts when the hairs are being pulled out. My husband just got me a NoNo so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t tried this thing before. Great price and it works. I followed the first reviewer&#x27;s advise and twisted the ends in opposite directions...I&#x27;ve only used it once and I am a little clunky still but it WORKS! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as tweezing or waxing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Using this is like plucking, but of course it&#x27;s broader and more hair comes out. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, it&#x27;s really good for when you just want it to be over, takes less time than ripping out five or six hairs at once with tweezers. That said, I did not throw away my tweezers, because this thing is impractical for eyebrows, which I found out the common sense way.</li>
            <li> This thing works. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fun to use, but it&#x27;s efficient and does the job and is oh so much quicker than tweezers. Sometimes you still need to do just a bit of a tweeze afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this REM spring for a few years but then lost it while traveling, so I replaced it with the slightly less expensive Bellabe version (amazon.com/Bellabe-118-Facial-Hair-Remover/dp/B001RPL902/). After just a few months, the Bellabe one started to oxidize, lose its smoothness and shine and get a kind of galvanized look to it, which also made it harder to use and keep clean. I lived with it for a while and then when the price dropped on this REM version, I bought one.  It&#x27;s worth it.  The one I had for years stayed clean and smooth the whole time I had it and the new one appears to be holding up as well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results of the REM Spring.  Recently had to replace mine and decided to try a different brand, the Bellabe, for comparison. Wish I could exchange it and buy the REM again.  REM is stronger,  more efficient with heavier duty stainless steel.  It pulls hair out by the root on the first or second pass. Bellabe took multiple passes to get the coarser hairs, if getting them at all and broke some hair off at the surface.  It was less expensive,  but watch for REM price reductions on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with facial hair since before I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried waxing, plucking, threading, and even shaving (eeeek). Keeping up is a pain and costly. I was searching for the no!no! Which is over a $100 when the REM spring hair remover came up. For the price I thought, \\&quot;might as well try it\\&quot;. Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used! It takes awhile to get the hang of it but once you do, it is fast and easy. I experience a little redness similar to when you pluck you eyebrows. It didn&#x27;t last long. I also use moisturize afterwards. My hair is thinner which I&#x27;m excited about! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product works excellent - you just have to figure out the technique that works best for you.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now. I have had no issues that I can think of. I have always been a little hairy however it seems as I am getting older I am growing more hair in places I never had before (cheeks). I use this all over my face and its great. I don&#x27;t have issues with ingrown hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. If you have ever gotten your face threaded its the same feeling. If you keep doing it you will have no issues with pain.</li>
            <li> I tried it out as soon as it arrived. I wanted something to replicate the effect of facial hair threading. The instructions were easy to follow, but I had to read them over a few times to get the hang of it. I have been using it every day since. Great for moustache and chin hair - but have been scared to try it anywhere else. The best thing is that there is no mess, very little discomfort - and it really cleans up!! I&#x27;m going to buy a couple for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I used to wax my upper lip, and it was expensive because the wax cost about 15 bucks.  Going to a salon is even more expensive.  However, this item is perfect.  For less than what I&#x27;d spend on a jar of hot wax, I&#x27;ve got a hair remover  that works just as well if not better!      What I like the most about this device is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like waxing does.  It pulls the hair out, and nothing more.      And for those of you that think that this thing is painful, think again.  It is no more painful than using tweezers, and it&#x27;s far more efficient because it pulls out multiple hairs, instead of just one at a time.    I love it!</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well but requires some practice.  The most important thing to know is that you must approach the hair from opposite the direction of growth.  If the hair is growing toward the left, roll from the left to the right.  My facial hair grows all different directions so I have to roll the thing every which way but it does eventually remove all of the hair.  It is less time, less painful and less expensive than getting electrolysis.  The next important thing is to roll slowly so the hair pulls out and does not snap off.  You can feel the difference between a break and a pull out.  Even when some hairs do break it is much better to have only a few grow back than having all of them grow back as when shaving.  Initially I spent about ten minutes getting used to it and now I spend about one minute before bed every other night and have been delighted.  The first use hurts like crazy as there are so many hairs to be pulled but from then on it is much less painful.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, extremely sensitive skin and was concerned the R.e.m. Spring Sprong wouldn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it: while it&#x27;s a tad bit painful at first (but not any more than tweezing), I quickly got used to it, and it&#x27;s so much easier and better than waxing, with no red skin or blemishes afterwards. It&#x27;s fantastic for the upper lip, chin, and jawline to get those fine hairs that were impossible for me to tweeze before (and waxing left me with nasty red bumps for days). I had absolutely no problem figuring out how to work it: it even works great just rolling it flat (not much curving at all) in an upward motion. What an inexpensive, wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product an year ago and I am using it every two weeks since then. I am a big fan of threading and I always preferred threading over other methods of facial hair removal. R.E.M. Spring Sprong is the best substitute for traditional threading and is very handy. I use it to remove facial hair and it works really fine. If you regularly wax/thread your facial hair then there will be no problem of having rashes or tiny red spots over the face after using R.E.M.       The only complaint that I have is that the handle is too small and its a little difficult to clean the hair off from the device. When I try to clean the hair off from the device, the spring gets loosened. I do have a little trick to keep the spring from not loosening up every time you clean it. Hold the spring straight and horizontally at the ends and twirl in opposite directions. Do this for a couple of times and it really helps in keeping the spring intact for further uses.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t quite figured the technique out yet. Also my face broke out.  I was hoping that wouldn&#x27;t happen. Any way it&#x27;s still too early to tell if this is the best option</li>
            <li> This is the only one to buy.  Don&#x27;t even bother with any other brand.  Keep mine in the car and clean that upper lip on my morning drive in to work.</li>
            <li> WOW!  Where has this tool been all my life??  I LOVE it!!  I&#x27;ve struggle with facial hair all the time. I actually bought a NONO and have been using that because it shortens the hair by burning them off (no the NONO DOES NOT remove the hairs)  and I&#x27;m not using chemicals or paying for waxing. Now that I found REM, I&#x27;m beyond ecstatic!!!!  Yes it hurts at first, cause you are pulling the hairs out, but once you start to get the hang of it, it works smoothly. I never realized how much hair I had on the side of my face  and cheeks. This tool removes the whole hair and roots. Some of the super fine hairs maybe broke off but I know they have been damaged by using the NONO, so I&#x27;m not concerned. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!  Thank you REM!!!</li>
            <li> This product works well and has continued to work well over several months with using weekly to remove facial fuzz.</li>
            <li> I realize facial hair is just something we must battle almost daily.  Actually this is as good as it gets!  I have bought 3 and keep them handy because for me it is a constant battle.  I have tried many different methods from tweezers, shavers, wax etc.  I find waxing does not get it all, neither does anything else. I get the best job I can with the R E M then get a really good magnifying glass and tweeze the few that are left !  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!  Life is not perfect but we live with it best we can--such is the life of a lady who has unwanted hair on her chin!  A unique product!</li>
            <li> Operating under the paradigm \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; I ordered this name-brand spring vs the one at half the cost and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the package and it took me about two minutes to figure it out.  Bend and roll, it couldn&#x27;t be easier.  I want to shake the people who gave a negative review because it hurts -- really?  Ripping your mustache out by the roots is painful?? Who knew.  No more painful than threading, and if I stay on top of it, remove about every two weeks, then it&#x27;s less of a sting.&lt;br /&gt;But this is more gentle than threading; (which I still do for my eyebrows as this device is not precise enough for shaping brows) sometimes the delicate skin at the corner of my mouth would be abraded by the thread.  The spring never catches my skin as long as it&#x27;s pulled tight (I just stick my tongue under the area I&#x27;m rolling over and push out).&lt;br /&gt;And I can&#x27;t be the only one who has tiny hairs on my toes and instep, can I?  This also works well for that.  I imagine you could do your legs and other areas if you were stuck on a desert island, but it&#x27;s meant for smaller patches of skin.</li>
            <li> Ok. It hurts. A little bit more than a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34;.  Not sure (as some reviewer stated) I will EVER get used to the &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; part, especially over the lip/under nose area. But it works pretty good in removing facial hair. I do it about every 5 days. I noticed on longer hairs around the chin area, not so effective but it really does a darn good job once you get the hang of it. Pretty clever!! Would have rated it a a 5 if it worked on those chin hairs!! But use my tweezers much much less!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so quick and easy to use before doing a makeup. but i think it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> This is an effective way to remove upper lip hair without the expense or pain of waxing and threading. The key is first to numb the area with an ice cube. Five to ten seconds does the trick. Yes, your pores will be closed which theoretically makes pulling the hair out harder, but I have found cold works much better than heat with this method. With the area numbed, I don&#x27;t feel a thing and am able to quickly and thoroughly remove the hair above my lip. You will have to experiment with the spring at first to find the best twisting method, but once you do, this is a waste-free and affordable way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really works and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I love that you can take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I used it when I first purchased Itami thought it worked wonders. For some reason I went back to shaving and tweezing. I happened to look in my makeup bag and found the REM spring and used it and fell back in love. The only downside to this product is the hair accumulating inside of the spring itself.</li>
            <li> The R.E.M. spring works great and is easy to use.  no need for a mirror. you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> As soon as I first tried the Spring on my facial hair, it found hair fibers I did not know existed.  The mirror can not always show rogue hairs.  Yes, it is going to feel like multiple &#x27;tweezers&#x27;, but I swear once you begin process it becomes 2nd nature and painless.  I also noticed the hair grew back more slowly.  I use the wand while watching TV, since it doesn&#x27;t involve &#x27;lotions&#x27; or using timers, you do not need to monitor what you&#x27;re doing, just twist away. In time you won&#x27;t even feel it but you will see the results - and without redness or skin blotches.  I want another for travelling.  thanks, Val</li>
            <li> it works but it is Painful.  i could only use on my chin.  everywhere else is just too painful.  pulls out root</li>
            <li> OMG.. Talk about a great product.   Easy to use and is a time saver from plucking and waxing.    I did not even read the directions.   I pulled it out of the box and started rolling it around on the problem areas of my face.   It worked wonders.. Skin feels baby soft.    I did find that I do not have to bend it like in the picture.   I only bend it to look like a smile, and roll.   It is really that simple and will eliminate those unwanted hairs.     I have plucked, waxed, used creams, and this by far is the easiet and most effective way to remove those hairs..   I am in heaven..    I would recommend this to everyone..   It will be the best $17.00 you have ever spent on a facial hair remover product!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but for $13 I thought it was worth a shot. I am thrilled to say that it works great on me--particularly on the upper lip. I will say that I do find it painful, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the red welts like the salon waxing does. It was definately a good little investment to me. Saving $ on waxing, and so convenient.</li>
            <li> I have bought this couple of times and was quite satisfied with the product. However my last order was of really bad quality.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty expensive when compared to other brands and thus I expect it to be of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed and looking for a different one now.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite new gadgets. I love it! I threw out all my facial waxing stuff. I use it for upper lip, lower lip and chin. Works perfect and gets the hair out by the root so it last a good amount of time. Very easy to use, you dont even need to look in the mirror. i use it while laying in bed and watching TV. I have not used it on my eyebrows because it would be hard to make them perfect and I dont want to mess them up. But it is perfect for any other facial hair. It hurts a little but not much IMO. I wish I would have found this a long time ago. Well worth the $$!!</li>
            <li> It is amazing I dont have to go to the saloon any more I could remove this tiny facial hair myself at home the time I want .It doesnt hurt that much and when you get used to it you cant stop it.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, plan to send to family and close friends as gifts, but only those who won&#x27;t be offended by receiving a hair removal product that really works well.</li>
            <li> Just as for many reviewers, it took a few tries to figure out how to roll and twist for maximum hair removal - and then those unsightly chin hairs were gone! However - I&#x27;d like to make one slight correction to the manufacturer&#x27;s description of the experience of using this product:  They say - \\&quot;Might feel a slight tingling sensation...\\&quot; NOT!!  Rolling this springy thing around one&#x27;s chin and upper lip HURTS!  It&#x27;s pulling hairs out by the roots! I use it frequently - but I have to muster up my courage each time, knowing what&#x27;s coming.  So - great product, but NOT painless.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, very light colored hair on my upper lip and a bit on my cheeks next to my hairline. It&#x27;s so fine/light that under artificial light, I can hardly see it and this makes tweezing next to impossible. I have had 2 tweezer-type facial epilators and neither one would really do much due to the hair being so fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, I had an electric epilady that was much like this spring and it worked wonderfully. Unfortunately, they no longer make those and that&#x27;s too bad because it was less painful and much faster than using this spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do really like this spring thing. The pro&#x27;s are that you can use this virtually anywhere and I find that it&#x27;s very easy to use as well. I&#x27;m so happy that I won&#x27;t ever have to wax again! The waxing left my sensitive skin extremely reddened and it would actually take a day or two before my face returned to normal and it was a huge pain to apply the wax next to my hairline and not get any of it in my hair. I don&#x27;t have that problem with the spring. Another nice thing is I can throw this in my purse and if I missed a spot, I can easily and quickly take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this device is that since it is slower than an epilator, it&#x27;s more painful (at least to me anyway) but if you just grit your teeth and keep at it, you get a little mini endorphin rush and long lasting results too. One other thing that&#x27;s a bit of a downer is that since it takes both hands to use the spring, you can&#x27;t pull your skin taut while using it on your upper cheek areas and even though I put my hair in a ponytail prior to using, I still have those \\&quot;baby\\&quot; tendrils that won&#x27;t go back in the pony elastic and I&#x27;m not able to hold them out of the way while using the spring so have to use muliple hair clips to make sure I don&#x27;t get that head hair tangled in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If the fine people at Epilady decided to once again make the old style spring epilator, I&#x27;d definitely buy another but I&#x27;d also keep this spring for touch-ups when I&#x27;m away from home. The spring really does work, even if your facial hair is very fine.uch-ups when I&#x27;m away from home. The spring really does work, even if your facial hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> I read about this in a review of some other product on Facebook.  I read countless reviews both good and bad and decided to try it.  Yeah it hurts but it works.  Sometimes it&#x27;s tricky to use, but for the most part it&#x27;s really great and so much cheaper than waxing!</li>
            <li> Do work but not what I expect.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this forever!  It does smart a bit, but boy is it better than tweezing.  Works great on both coarse and fine hairs.</li>
            <li> idk what to say. the item works, but it&#x27;s really painful. i expected it however i thought it was one of those things like waxing where you get used to the pain. sometimes the hair gets uneven after using it, it&#x27;s almost like shaving. some hairs get plucked and some just ripped parts of the hairs on the surface. it&#x27;s too painful for me to use it properly maybe. i&#x27;m probably not using the item appropriately. i used it for a couple of months and then quit. the waxing method is more preferable to me. at least when it comes to the pain.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for removing unwanted chin hair. I will say if you plan to use this on your lip area, it will hurt.</li>
            <li> I have always used wax for my upper lip area. My skin &amp; lips are very sensitive, and after waxing my lips for years with no real satisfaction I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few reasons why I will never try another product for hair removal on my face again:&lt;br /&gt;1) The Spring is AMAZING for super sensitive skin (waxing only irritates my skin &amp; lips)&lt;br /&gt;2) Quick &amp; Easy (Wax takes a while to dry, and lets be honest- we all dread ripping it off) with this little device, I cut my &amp;#34;hair removal time&amp;#34; in half!  Went from 30 mins (from application to being completely done) to 5 mins!!&lt;br /&gt;3) Your skin gets used to it!!  (If I do a few quick &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; before starting.  My skin numbs itself &amp; I can focus on where I need to remove the hair instead of the pain&lt;br /&gt;4) NO mess!! (I have always hated the wax &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; that you get after applying it- on the sink &amp; my clothes.  Not to mention those chunks of wax under your finger nails after pulling it off)&lt;br /&gt;5)Cheaper &amp; Lasts longer (I had my last spring for over a year and a half, and it worked great nearly the entire time!)&lt;br /&gt;6) Your hair doesn&#x27;t grow back thicker!!!  Yeah, I know...pretty hard to believe, but its true!  Ever since I started using this product, I noticed that my hair is not coming back thicker/harder to remove!  It is not thinning, but hey its nice to know that its not as noticeable when it does grow back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Usage:&lt;br /&gt;-Have been using this method for about 2 yrs and i&#x27;ll never go back!&lt;br /&gt;-By rolling the spring over your lip really quickly before getting more precise, you help numb your lips and the rest of the two minutes finishing up is a breeze for both pain &amp; getting it taken care of in no time&lt;br /&gt;-When I finish, I usually stretch the spring and let it snap back to get the excess hair out (you&#x27;d be amazed at how much hair it removes)&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting wax at the store every few months, this little baby lasts for at LEAST a year!&lt;br /&gt;-No messy wax getting on the sink, my clothes, or even the carpet (I have dropped it a time or two on the way from the microwave to the bathroom.  And it doesn&#x27;t come out of carpet!)&lt;br /&gt;-Went from the 30 min- heat, apply, wait...wait....wait...RIP, clean up&lt;br /&gt;TO:&lt;br /&gt;-Run spring over lips quickly to numb &amp; then finish off the rest in about 5 minutes or less&lt;br /&gt;-I get cold sores and I have a TON less irritation after using this than I ever did with wax!&lt;br /&gt;-It is a tad embarrassing, but yes I do get chin hairs &amp; the spring works great on that area as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally stumbled on this product when I had a cold sore, and wanted to use something more gentle.  I did some research, and saw a YouTube video on this (At first I thought OMG! That looks terrible-  TRUST me, its not!)  So it is a spring with two handles on each end.  You will NEVER pinch your skin, so don&#x27;t worry about that! When I run it over my lips to help numb; I hold the spring horizontal and then really quickly roll it down &amp; out(away from you).  You&#x27;ll start by holding it with your thumb &amp; your index finger.  Your thumb will be closer to your face--- As you roll (down/back &amp; out) your index finger will come closer to your face &amp; thumb will move downward &amp; away)  I just keep doing this until I notice that it is not painful anymore and then begin with more detail.  When you begin in more detail you can place the spring in multiple directions (not all of the hair &amp;#34;lays&amp;#34; the same way- think of this as &amp;#34;going against the grain&amp;#34; some hair is easier to remove at a different angle than the rest.  I usually start at one corner of my mouth or &amp;#34;st-ache&amp;#34; area: Place the spring to &amp;#34;follow&amp;#34; your lips shape and then roll UP.  You will know when you are at a good angle because you can feel it grabbing more hair (not in a painful way, but a &amp;#34;hey its grabbing a lot&amp;#34; kind of way)  then I work toward the center.  The middle usually does hurt a little more, so I typically go up to where my upper lips &amp;#34;points&amp;#34; are, and then Ill start at the other outer st-ache corner area on the opposite side of my mouth.  Then when I&#x27;ve worked my way in, and its pretty much all numb, I will place the spring over my entire top lip lining and roll up to get the middle hairs.  It is much easier to experiment &amp; see what works best for you.  But don&#x27;t be intimidated, it is much faster, less messy, and less painful because you sort of ease the pain in which allows your skin to adjust instead of one big RIP and that tingly/irritated feeling after you wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!  Watch the youtube videos if you are still unsure of how to use this product, it helped me in the beginning!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think that it is complicated, it is just hard to explain if I am not showing you how</li>
            <li> Wow! it work grea! I save $40 from facial thread at the Mall.  It pull out most of your facial hair easilly, and not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;My Sister-In-Law tried it and want to order right away too.</li>
            <li> A good set of tweezers is more effective and time-saving -- which makes this product pretty much worthless. .. Not to mention it can be fairly painful even while being ineffective.</li>
            <li> This does it&#x27;s job for sure! Once I figured out how to use it correctly (had to search on youtube) I was able to quickly get hairs that had otherwise been difficult to get with waxing. Be warned: it hurts! The pain is worth it to me because it lasts only a few seconds and does not leave any redness/bumps. As you use it your face gets used to it and it hurts less and less.Also I can use whenever for touchups and is cheaper than buying wax strips at the store. I have only used this on my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> This did not remove hairs from the roots in certain areas of my face, such as the side burn area, upper cheek, and edge of lips/upper lip area. This left my face with a rough texture, like as if I shaved it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works as it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with mine. You just have to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping tweezers nearby for the hard to reach strands isn&#x27;t a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Ok, this hurts worse than my tattoo (in some areas). But it works really well. I also have pcos and lots of little fine hair on my jawline, this gets it ALL.</li>
            <li> I watched a video of a lady using this thing and she made it sound like it was working but I couldn&#x27;t see any actual hairs that she had pulled out.  She said though that it worked and that it hurt to use it.  It didn&#x27;t hurt, but it sure didn&#x27;t remove much of anything.  I guess you have to grow an actual beard before it might actually work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  I figured out later I could just let my facial hair grow some and use my epilator and it would probably work better.</li>
            <li> I like this thing- simple and easy to use. I usually have to tweezer the one or two really stubborn hairs, but it catches a lot on my chin. Can&#x27;t take it on the upper lip- ouch. Overall, glad I bought it. Cheaper than repeated trips to the salon. I think there was one cheaper option on Amazon, but I bought this one because it is stainless steel instead of some mystery metal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like pain so I was skeptical about ordering this product.  I found if I use it a minute or so each day that removing the hair feels only like a tingle.  No I&#x27;m not one of those people who loses a limb and then asks for an aspirin.  This really doesn&#x27;t hurt as long as I do it daily.  I love not using chemicals and I love that I can travel easily with it.  I don&#x27;t even need a mirror!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t always catch everything, but more fun then tweezing</li>
            <li> My colleague recommended me this product and I love using this product regularly. It does remove thin facial hair around lips and chin area. You just need to hold it correctly to use the product in a right manner. If you are familiar with threading then using this product is similar to that. You will need some practice of holding it correctly when you will first start to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially when I started using this I had some trouble in using it. But once I got a hang of it, it became very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not worth the pain.Doesn&#x27;t remove hair well at all. Creams are more effective and less painful.</li>
            <li> I bought this device after reading so many positive reviews and very much regretted it.  It took forever to remove even the lightest, finest hair.  I have fair, sensitive skin, and warn you not to use this device if you do as well.  Within a few hours of using it as instructed (it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair either) I noticed red blisters/bumps forming all over from where the hair was removed.  My skin was so irritated, It looked like I had broken out in hives, really.  It was terrible, I couldn&#x27;t leave the house for two days.  I used aloe, wet wash cloths, nothing helped.  Maybe more so the fact that I have sensitive skin, but I just hope I can save anyone else the pain that I experienced from using this product.  Would never have bought it!</li>
            <li> was kind of a waste of money.  finally bought the nono.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin. Not only was this difficult for me to use, but I had red patches all over my skin and had to discontinue using it. Very disappointing. The idea sounds great, but the reality wasn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li> very sensitive area...the face so  it really takes time and fortitude to  do it..but it  does work</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t honestly believe that this would work, but decided to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did!  I definitely prefer this to waxing and it does a much better job.  It doesn&#x27;t even hurt that much and is easy to get used to.  I have been telling all of my friends and family about this tool.  I may even purchase some for Christmas presents.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> never again:( not for sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo368A2308HNJYZ]]Hi I have upper lip facial hair .,.. and for me its grows very quickly .. and every month i had to go to parlor.. but after having this my upper lip hair removes quickly and also i can do every week whenever i need.. ... Nothing bad about this product.. accept the pain.. which is acceptable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You tube Link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[..]</li>
            <li> Is easier to use then some reviews would have you believe.&lt;br /&gt;Hurts like the dickens and makes me sneeze which in my book means it works well.</li>
            <li> A must have for all women who are tired of facial hair.. I don&#x27;t know how I didn&#x27;t see this product until now. It works excellent</li>
            <li> it works perfectly for my facial hair, sometimes requires to do the same area couple of times before you get rid of all hair, but overall it is just great</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised.  It came before expected, in perfect condition and would recommend to others who need to do a tough up more than once a week on facial hair. The pricing is good for the product.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t work for me, until I read the instructions. Duh!! Works like a charm on the peach fuzz above the upper lip. Which is what I bought it for. Can&#x27;t say whether it works on courser hair. But it serves it&#x27;s purpose for me. Good bye nair which was burning my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove facial hair.  With a magnify glass, I can see it pulls then releases but it doesn&#x27;t remove.  The sensation from pulling your facial hair makes it feel as if it removes it but it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s like using your hand to pull your hair from you head but not remove it.  A good tweezers does the job but it is time consuming because tweezers can pull 1 or a few at a time.  I returned the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover.</li>
            <li> None of this stuff actually works. When you use it simply will not work. Don&#x27;t buy this product stick with traditional products.</li>
            <li> It is painful but I am glad I bought it because it saves me so much time. My sister recommended me to try it out. It will not pick up hairs that are too thick, those unfortunately will have to be removed with tweezers. I would wax but that was too messy and bad for my skin. I was also having laser hair removal, which helps a ton, but it became toooo painful even with numbing cream.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  Omg, the best product I have found for removing facial hair.  Natural, reusable, economical, not messy, side effect free!  No more irritation or burns.  It took some practice, maneuvering, and time to get the hang of it and have precision but don&#x27;t give up!  It is totally worth every penny....and then some.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was a piece of junk. This didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Save your money by not buying.</li>
            <li> It seems to be able to pull the hair quite a bit, but some of the upper lip tends to look like you shaved...so it&#x27;s not entirely 100% great. I&#x27;d recommend it though. Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond simple to use.  I am very happy with this purchase.  No more burning or peeling skin after applying depilatories.  Use with a magnifying mirror for best results.  I highly recommend this product, especially for the ladies who have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I prefer tweezers. This is hard to use. Not worth the effort. Tweezers are way easier to handle and much more efficient.</li>
            <li> even making sure I used as directed it found it painful and too time consuming.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. Little painful but does what it says.</li>
            <li> It really does work and get&#x27;s almost all the hair (I use it only for the hairs on my chin) but it does leave only like 2 or 3 hair that it can&#x27;t get for some reason but that doesn&#x27;t bother me i just tweeze those. I prefer this than shaving (a HUGE no-no) or waxing. I&#x27;s pretty easy to work with once you get the hang of it. Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Oh man does this hurt. I bought this because of the great reviews, but I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the pain. I used it on my upper lip but could only get in a few yanks at a time before my eyes watered, my nose ran, and I had to stop. Kudos to the women who can do this!</li>
            <li> Pretty cool!!! It takes some fiddling with, but once you get your rythm down, this little thing really works! I am Italian and after my second pregnancy, my chin hair got out of control. I would have to pluck every day, no joke. I still have to grab the tweezers for a stray beard hair here and there, but this thing has cut my tweeze time down 98%. I just use it while I watch TV at night and it keeps my face smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li> This gadget did not remove 1 single hair - do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> This product did not work, it was a waste of money.  I fell for false advertising.  Would not recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Yes, this does cause temporary discomfort, but the tradeoffs are worth it!  First of all,  it WORKS!!! 2.  Reasonably priced. 3. Very portable. 4. No batteries, cords 5.  Sanitary for one user  I recommend watching some of the videos (youtube, etc) to get the technique(s) down that work for you.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but is worth the little amount of pain involved.  No batteries or chemicals.  Just be sure to clean the area first with witch hazel so as not to get bumps.</li>
            <li> I have spent years waxing, threading, plucking, and using creams to remove my ladystache but every few days the hairs come back! I do not have the time, patience, or money to get them removed that often. I tried the R.E.M hair remover and it works just as well as threading and can be done while lounging around the house. It is wonderful, and YES it does hurt a bit, but no more than waxing. The key is to maintain the upside down U shape and twist the handles as you move against the hair&#x27;s direction of growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rewriting my original review which was five stars. I don&#x27;t know what it is with my skin, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t like the R.E.M anymore. The past two times I&#x27;ve used it. My face has broken out on my cheeks. This time it&#x27;s horrible. My face has tons of red spots on the sides and I really can&#x27;t use this product. This didn&#x27;t happen with my first couple uses but now it doesn&#x27;t work anymore which is weird but oh well. For those of you who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin that changes what it can handle then use this product because it works at removing hair, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it after extended use.</li>
            <li> I live it and my friends love it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt that much&lt;br /&gt;I told all my friend to buy it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and it hurts so bad! It feels like I am using tweezers.  I don&#x27;t know why they say it is painless.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  I have dark coarse chin and neck hair.  Little tedious to figure out how to use.  Got to experiment.  May have to still pluck a stray hair but gets almost all of it.  Better than using nair or those mini shavers.  Wish I&#x27;d found it sooner.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I thought it was another scam. But let me tell you this product is excellent as it really works. I was tired of waxing and plucking but this is so much easy to use and I just love it. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and not effective!</li>
            <li> Anyone who says this doesn&#x27;t hurt like hell is a liar or numb.  Certainly fun to play with, especially for those tuffies who think they can take it.  I&#x27;m one of those, and I yelp when just ONE hair comes out.  I thought I&#x27;d see what it was all about since I wasn&#x27;t about to spring for HUNDREDS of dollars for a &amp;#34;No-No&amp;#34; or some such electric torture device to trim my wild ear hairs and such.  Now I&#x27;ve just got to find a gal I dislike sufficiently who deserves this weapon ... either that or some masochist.</li>
            <li> Very cool.  It hurts a little the first time, but not like waxing is painless.  It will be a good alternative to paying to be waxed.  Looks to be sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting accustomed to using this.  It seemed so difficult at first but once you get used to it, it works great.</li>
            <li> If you have a penchant for pain, this is the item for you.  If you are not fond of feeling hair and skin being ripped off your face, then this is not the item for you.  I have no idea what I was thinking when I purchased this, but the level of pain is astronomical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use it once, rip the hair out and then have to wipe tears away.  Upper lips get smooth, look clean... and are beet red from the loss of the epidermis and part of the dermis .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my chin hairs. I have quite a lot of them and it&#x27;s really embarrassing. Even though they are blonde, you can still see them in the sunlight. Years ago I made the mistake of shaving them off, and now more and more seem to be there every year. It takes forever to pluck one by one, so I was really hopeful when I saw this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, I thought i was following directions as I twisted the rods towards me and rolled along my chin. NOTHING happened. I put it away for a while and just today took it out again to give it a try. Turns out there is a little more than just rolling. You have to twist the springs while running them up along your skin, not rolling. Also I found you need to be going in the exact opposite direction of the hair growth. So for my chin, I had to angle it a bunch of different ways till it grabbed each hair. I also found it hurt less after a hot shower when my pores were more open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow...it really hurts. Especially when you get to that nice soft skin under your chin. BUT it works and that&#x27;s what I was looking for. I even did my upper lip and got lots of tiny fine hairs off, too! My skin was red afterwards, but no worse than if I had plucked the hairs one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the hairs were very thick and some very fine, so I would say this product works well on all hair types. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not good on coarse hair or patches of hair. Good for getting a strand at a time. Very painful in beginning. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different hair removal. Nair works best for me.</li>
            <li> This does take some getting used to. Don&#x27;t give up!! Just keep trying and hold  it at  all different angles.</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I recently felt that the blonde hairs on my upper lip were casting a shadow that made it appear gray, almost like if I had darker skin on my upper lip.  The item arrived fast and is incredibly simple in design.  It took a few tries to get it to actually work, twisting this way and that, reading other reviews and trying their recommended techniques, etc.  It pulled all the hairs out, but let me say it definitely hurts.  It makes my nose twitch and my eyes water b/c they are such fine hairs in a such a sensitive area.  I will say that I have never, ever removed the hair on my lip before, so maybe if you are used to waxing or threading it won&#x27;t be as painful for you.  This is a great product though, since you don&#x27;t get that obvious red mustache I see when women wax their lips.  I did get a few little whiteheads afterwards, which has happened to me after an eyebrow wax in the past, so the next time I used it I wiped with toner afterward and applied a little Pro-Activ just to kill any bacteria that would cause this and I haven&#x27;t had an issue.  Overall, great price, does what it says and very convenient.  I&#x27;m happy. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> When i got this at first it was pretty painful but removed so much hair and quickly..then I ended up stretching it and since then it hasn&#x27;t worked.  So note to others...don&#x27;t stretch it out...a.k.a don&#x27;t yank the ends in opposite directions.</li>
            <li> I am 47 and I have tried many products.  This is by far the best!!! I had given it to my teenage daughter to try it and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about some hair above my lip, so I&#x27;ve tried waxing, shaving, bleaching, tweezing. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It does work, but I can&#x27;t seem to get all of the hair. I find I have to still tweeze some hair afterwards. The spring does hurt for a few seconds after, especially the skin just under your nose. Until I get laser hair removal, I&#x27;ll continue to use this as I find it&#x27;s the cheapest, fastest, and easiest.</li>
            <li> Product came in just like described. Seemed like a great time saving idea. Much harder for me to use than expected. It leaves behind a lot of hairs. I am sticking with my Revlon Diamond tip tweezer.</li>
            <li> Ouch. It works for those oddly long hairs and between waxings. But, ouch.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was highly recommended by a family member. I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so great about it. I think most of the time it cuts the hair instead of pulling it out. Tweezing takes longer, but is much more effective.</li>
            <li> using this thing is WAY too tedious for me. It DID remove my chin hair effectively but my sides of my face...nada. I&#x27;m better off tearing the hairs out one by one. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cling to my hairs there - maybe they are too fine? Guess I will stick to waxing.</li>
            <li> I use this spring mainly for my upper lip and chin areas (ouch!) and have been mostly happy with the results. My only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t remove ALL the hair. I go over an area multiple times until I can&#x27;t feel it pulling any more hair but when I look in the mirror, I still see a few stray hairs. Maybe they&#x27;re too short for it to grab?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip for easing the pain: I soak a wash towel in hot water and place it on the area for a few seconds before going over with the spring. It makes it easier to pull out the hair. It also gets better the more you use it - I think the skin just adjusts.</li>
            <li> very painful but it works</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate the pain, this is a great tool. I use it before and after I wash my face. Plucks most of my hair off and keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a lot easier than plucking out one hair at a time, that&#x27;s for sure. It doesn&#x27;t work the way it says to do in the instructions, but just bend it to catch a bunch of hairs between the wires and roll or pull.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3N5WSTO0GJK1Z]]This is a video showing my very first time using the REM spring. It hurts! However, it also works and works well. The coils grab onto my facial hair and rip, it&#x27;s gone. I will continue to use it because it really does work. the chin and cheeks hurt less than that super sensitive area under the nose, that is a killer! But it&#x27;s worth it to be hair free for awhile, especially for those of us who have a lot of embarrassing facial hair and don&#x27;t want 5 o&#x27;clock stubble or red wax burn or to take hours in front of a mirror plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*edited, within a day it began to hurt less and boy does it work! My face it smoother than it&#x27;s been in years! It still hurts under the nose and probably always will but totally worth it. Excellent and I love my hairless face! And no five o&#x27;clock shadow!</li>
            <li> This baby works pretty good.....the other springs I tried did not</li>
            <li> I received it 2 days ago and it took me a minute to figure out how to use this tool. Really, it is not difficult at all. Put it on the area where you want to remove hair, bend, twist the 2 ends towards you at the same time as you move the spring in upward direction. its that simple. I have been threading by myself the old fashion way ( using threads around my fingers) for years and just could not take the threads cutting through my fingers and having to do so every other day (since the small hair would not pluck). This device is just amazing. it removes any little traces of hair (I did use a magnifying mirror). it took me a couple of minutes to get rid of upper lip and chin area. I am ordering two more, one for purse and the other for my travel bag. No bad reaction, no bruising nothing with this device. I do put a drop or two of my vitamin c serum in the area that is plucked. As far as pain goes, if you have threaded by yourself for years, you would say what I am saying - \\&quot;It does not hurt - compared to the pain before\\&quot;.   Arrived on time. No complain.</li>
            <li> I am loving this sprong. I did not know how to use it correctly at first, so I could not get any hairs up, but I kept trying until I had it right. Took about a full minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And apparently I have way more hair on my upper lip than I previously thought (*blush*) because it got a lot more than I expected. This is much better than waxing because it isn&#x27;t messy and with waxing you have to reapply and hope you get it all. Then there is the skin irritation and redness that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plucking with tweezers is fine for obvious hairs, but it won&#x27;t get the smaller ones like the sprong does. It does hurt quite a bit at first, but that is to be expected if you&#x27;ve ever had to remove hair the hard way. It almost feels like getting your hair snagged on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done though and it causes me no skin irritation which is something I&#x27;ve always hated because I felt like I had to take care of my upper lip when I had time to \\&quot;recover\\&quot; before being seen. With the spring I can just use it quickly and be done. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this ground shipping on Oct. 14 and it arrived on Oct. 19 to TN.</li>
            <li> Using it for 3 months now. I just love it. I use to spend almost $30 per month to get threading done. Now it is easy and fun just twisting and turning. It does not hurt any more, first few times it does hurt but now it does not. It is so easy to carry and use it any time, any place. It is great.</li>
            <li> THIS THING HURT LIKE HECK! I WILL NEVER USE THIS AGAIN. IT HURTS LESS TO JUST WAX IT OFF, OR I, JUST USE HAIR REMOVAL CREAM AND DO IT ONCE A WEEK.. NO PAIN!! :)</li>
            <li> This works just as advertised and I am very pleased.  I think I will try icing around my mouth before using next time though, it stings a bit.</li>
            <li> My two problems... 1. Although they&#x27;re fine hairs, I have too many hairs above and below my lips and they grow RIGHT up to my lips. When I wax, if I so much as touch my lip with it and rip it off I end up with a bloody lip or a nice pink spot lining my lips... sores around your mouth &#x3D; NOT SEXY!  2. I&#x27;m a redhead... very fair skin. When I wax, I have a dark pink goatee or beard for a good 6-8 hours after. I&#x27;ve even had a layer of skin ripped off and had a goatee for days. Embarrassing!!!!  This little unit gets the itsy bitsy hairs right up next to the lip and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash! And EVERYTHING gives me a rash! My first time using it was today. I sat watching TV and twisting that sucker and YOWZA you can feel it works... but you get use to it. My face is completely smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and NO pink spots! Took me appx 10 minutes! No burn feeling after. No itching. This is a ginger&#x27;s best friend.   :)  SO happy!</li>
            <li> Hurts a bit at first, longer the hair the more it hurts!</li>
            <li> It works and you can see it works as you use it. Of course it hurts, it works and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far on facial hair-- so easy to use, very effective! I will now carry it around wherever I travel.  Feels like \\&quot;threading\\&quot; but much gentler.  I use once or twice a week-- Pulls off hair gently-- follow directions and twist as indicated.  If you are not used to hair being pulled-- can be slightly painful but you will get used to it. Better if you have a 5x or 10x mirror.  I even use this on my eyebrows-- though you need to be extra careful here as you could pull off hair in places where you don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with hair removal from my upper lip.  With tweezing, it takes me about an hour and it looks like I still get only about half of the hairs... waxing is really expensive to do consistently, but always gives me the best results.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely terrible luck with home waxing kits as the wax sticks to my skin more than to the paper. I&#x27;ve tried nair for the face, but it still only gets about half the hair and sits on the skin for 10 minutes, which is quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention too that I have very sensitive/fair skin- my skin is practically white, but my hair is very black, which is a terrible combination for facial hair.  I am always on the lookout for new things that I can use to help me with this problem that is financially reasonable and decently easy/time efficient.  Reading the reviews for this, I was excited, but hesitant.  Nevertheless, I figured for less than $15 it was worth a shot.  I mean, I pay close to that just getting my face waxed at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I tried this product!  I followed the advice of one reviewer to turn clockwise with the right hand and counterclockwise with the left.  I started near the lip and moved up to the nose.  I used different widths of the bend- sometimes I held the spring straighter and others I tried it completely in an upside down u-shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain was totally manageable.  My eyes watered a bit, but it was about the same as plucking and less than waxing pain-wise.  It was exponentially faster than plucking and got rid of all the hairs on my upper lip!  I think for that, the pain was well worth it.  I assume as I use it more frequently, the pain will decrease.  I was pretty thorough, getting every single hair, and it only took about 3 minutes total time- way less than plucking does (and got sooo many more hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to clean my face after use and apply moisturizer and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with breaking out.  My skin was red for a few minutes after use, but it was honestly red for less time than after plucking or waxing.  My skin is pretty sensitive though too, and I know that, so I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t more irritated for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this primarily for upper lip, but I do have a few hairs on my chin area, so I tried it there too.  I only have a couple every now and again, so plucking is still easier for those I think, but this worked well there too- getting the angles right was more difficult, but it seemed to work well once I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to comment on the hairs- I tried an epilator before that was designed for the face, but I found that it just broke off the hairs at the skin and didn&#x27;t really pull them out.  I can see all the hairs in the spring sprong AND I can see the little ends that show they were really pulled out and not just broken at the skin!  Perfect!  I am sooo glad I gave this product a try, and I plan to continue to use it for a long time to come!t was honestly red for less time than after plucking or waxing.

            <li> This item is great! It&#x27;s wonderful at removing unwanted facial hair and the greatest aspect is that it&#x27;s small enough to even tuck away in your purse or travel kit. My sister is the one who recommended this product and I&#x27;m glad she did. Now my mom, mother-in-law and even my aunt have asked me to buy a second and third REM spring for them so they can keep it in different handbags.&lt;br /&gt;The REM spring is also wonderful because it&#x27;s easy to use. I have to say that it can be painful the first time you use it, but it&#x27;s so much simpler than taking out a tweezer and plucking one hair at a time and it&#x27;s convenient if you haven&#x27;t had time to go to your waxer/threader.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my 60s and I&#x27;ve been worried about trying to wax my fragile skin. This product is superb, even better than advertised!&lt;br /&gt;It works incredibly well without damaging skin, even in difficult areas. I have recommended it to all my friends and will continue to send the link to anyone who is interested in a safe way to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> The Spring does the job, if somewhat painfully - like a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; Epilady/NoNo, minus their &amp;#34;bells and whistles.&amp;#34;  And the key to &amp;#34;pain management,&amp;#34; I have learned, is to keep up with it: do it often.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is the price: $20 is an awful lot for a simple spring. And, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, the price went up quite a bit almost overnight. That&#x27;s why the fifth star is missing in my review.</li>
            <li> My daughter says she can&#x27;t use it, but I surely can. The first day wowza, it hurt quite a bit. Then the next day hardly anything and nothing really since. Saved the cost of a lip rip (my words for a wax) as it is priced the same as a wax. Been moustache free for a month now. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product does the job getting the hair from the root! However it does take time to get iae to the feeling of pulling all these little hairs out . Overall great product</li>
            <li> It works well, but it is almost impossible to use  because it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts worse than waxing and isn&#x27;t as efficient.  Sorry I bought it!</li>
            <li> Bad, painful and no easy to use</li>
            <li> It works so well it&#x27;s almost unbelievable. First use can be painful but don&#x27;t give up. I am mid 60&#x27;s and have had a difficult time with coarse gray hairs mostly on my chin .... gone. There is a little bit of a learning curve but keep at it, great tool.</li>
            <li> DOES. NOT. WORK. this is a total rip. I&#x27;ve tried using it on wet, dry, moist skin, using in fully in U, slightly bent and straight, I&#x27;ve tried twisting the handles all different ways, and I&#x27;ve tried moving it in many directions. it has to date succeeded in removing a single hair and that was probably a mistake by the item. THIS. IS. USELESS!</li>
            <li> Thought this was a great idea but when push came to shove all it did was hurt and cut the hair</li>
            <li> I love this and use it several times a week to keep the wee hairs away!  because it pulls by the roots, hairs stay away longer than bleaching or shaving.</li>
            <li> The product is good. It took awhile for me to get the hang of how to pull the most hairs at one time. It is slightly painful, but it is better than plucking hairs one at a time.</li>
            <li> The first use was a bit painful...but after that it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. No more tweezing.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Once i figured out how to use it, it works ok.  Doesn&#x27;t get those tiny, tiny thin hairs, but overall, does the job.  It does sting and makes my eyes water a little... not sure how all these other reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t- it literally rips your hairs out.  Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> As someone that is growing older (aren&#x27;t we all....) and sprouting more and more little hairs in places where they don&#x27;t belong (oh, aren&#x27;t we all doing that as well?) I&#x27;ve been a waxer. But I have pretty sensitive skin, and waxing makes me break out, or even worse, gives me raw red patches on my face for days. Not attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was looking for an epilator and saw this. The price caught my eye. I like inexpensive. And since it would work for the area I need it, I decided to bite the bullet and order one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, it works. I did what a previous reviewer mentioned and turned my right hand clockwise left hand counter. Instant results. It is very painful, and that&#x27;s coming from someone that doesn&#x27;t think that waxing is painful. But I think that other reviewers are right--it will hurt less over time as you have to pull less hair. Took me less than 2 minutes to do my upper lip, and there was very little redness, and no swelling, after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on an epilator, or gets chemical burns from depilatories, or hates to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: I wanted to add that I tried this on my chin today. I&#x27;ve always shaved my chin, and with hormone issues can sport quite the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow if I&#x27;m not careful.  I shaved yesterday. Today I was able to pull a ton of hair from my chin. I did have to change the angle that I was using it (sometimes running it sideways instead of up and down), and have it bent more or less than I do on my upper lip. It&#x27;s trial and error. I&#x27;m praying this works well enough that I do not have to shave anymore. It pulls those little hairs out all the way including the follicle. Ouch!</li>
            <li> I bought this with low expecations of it actually being useful, but I was pleasantly surprised. It actually works!It&#x27;s not painless but it&#x27;s no worse than plucking and better than harsh hair removers. I have very fine facial hair and more of it since menopause. It takes out hair I can&#x27;t even see yet. I used it right away and pulled hair out so it&#x27;s not that difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I wish I had found this 20 years ago. Easy to use. It amazed me how simple it removed so many hairs at one go. Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> WOW! I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is amazing. I wish I knew about this product sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer wrote, it would be unreasonable to expect that a facial hair removal device would not hurt. This hurts a little bit. But nowhere near as much as waxing or plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works really well! Without significant redness, definitely much less than with other methods. I love this thing.</li>
            <li> This gets all the short little hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate. Must have</li>
            <li> in my experience, this product mostly picks up the near-invisible peach fuzz but barely picks up the darker, noticeable hairs that you really want gone.&lt;br /&gt;also, it&#x27;s hard to use on certain areas of the face where you can&#x27;t get the angle of the tool just right. it can&#x27;t grab those hairs if the angle isn&#x27;t right.&lt;br /&gt;it does kind of \\&quot;smart\\&quot;, but i wouldn&#x27;t consider it very painful. that may be because i have already spent years waxing and tweezing these areas, so my nerves are probably a little deadened.</li>
            <li> This little spring works like a charm. So easy to use, and it actually hurts a lot less than wax and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;First time use: I just bent it and started rolling it upwards against the hair growth. Within minutes I had a smooth lip. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it is supposed to.  Some reviewers said they had a learning curve to use it, but I found it very easy to use.  I laid on my couch, watched Judge Judy and in no time, I am hair free.  As you age, you get fine hair everywhere and some heavy hair in trouble spots.  This product removes all of it.  This was amazing and I just wish my mother, who shaved every day, would have lived long enough to have used this product.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> I tried it the moment I received it in the mail and it worked! It does take time to get the hang of it and I would take many breaks in between because I am a coward and it hurt. The pain is the same as threading. My upper lip did get red but the redness was gone after an hour. So happy that I decided to get it because waxing was $12 a session and this is so convenient that I can do it whenever I can at home. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The instructions in the package are lacking. I tried it a few times with no results. Then, I tried bending the tool into a wider U shape and rotated the little handles and TADA! It is amazing. I have not had to use any facial hair remover cream since I bought it. I do still pluck some very thick unruly hairs, but this tool catches those super fine hairs that tweezers can&#x27;t reach. I literally sit and watch tv while using the tool. The hairs are caught in the spring then removed with a thorough cleaning once a week. Don&#x27;t use it on the eyebrows. The tool needs a long range of space on the skin. Your eyebrow area is too small. I use this everyday and will never go back to waxes or creams.</li>
            <li> Not that easy to use. I have fine, blonde hair and it just doesn&#x27;t do a great job with it.</li>
            <li> This facial spring hair remover is excellent.  It takes a little bit for the learning curve but it works as described.  I was so happy with this I sent one to my sister.</li>
            <li> Does not work on fine white hairs</li>
            <li> easy to use, works great! I tried it right out of the box and was very pleased.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and the redness only lasted for a few minutes. I thought it would last longer and it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purcahse! I had been using Nair for the face and was not wanting to use such harsh chemicals and it was also making my skin dry and flaky in a few spots when I&#x27;d use it. this is a much better alternative!</li>
            <li> I like this.  The first time I used it, it brought tears to my eyes, but if you use it a few times a week, it&#x27;s not terribly painful and it keeps that upper lip fuzz-free.  Certainly much better than chemicals and creams.</li>
            <li> I just got it and gave it a try...WOW...it was great...spin the springs end in the same direction and have fun with it...DIDN&#x27;T HURT ANY MORE THAN PLUCKING...just put some aloe on after and your good...</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use and it doesn&#x27;t grab the coarser hairs.  Good for grabbing peach fuzz if you can get it to work right.  I still use it occasionally in the upper lip area but I can&#x27;t get it to work on any other part of my face.</li>
            <li> No pain, no gain.  This is a bit painful, but is the best way I&#x27;ve found to remove facial hair above my lip and on my chin.  Over the years I tried creams, bleaches and waxes.  They were all messy and had various drawbacks.  This is easy, effective and doesn&#x27;t need time to set up.  I even use it in the car while waiting to pick up kids.  I honestly can&#x27;t give it enough stars.  If you don&#x27;t mind a little pain in the process, this is for you!  It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt much more than plucking your eyebrows.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and my first application was on my upper lip and OUCH!  But I continued and as long as I could feel it pulling, I knew it was pulling out hairs.  It got better as I progressed, as I guess the first few pulls were the longest.  Today is the first time I have used it and I have almost no lingering irritation and my face is smooth, which makes my skin look better and makeup smoother.  I have lots of light, fine hair that keeps appearing around my upper lip, chin, etc.  I think I am going to like it.  I dislike cremes that smell horrible and shaving is not very nice, either, because the hair grows back quickly.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and I spent a good few minutes going over the instructions so I could make sure I used the R.E.M. Spring correctly. I tried it on the corner of my mouth first and after one or two false starts I got my hands coordinated and the hair came right out!  Everything, including the peach fuzz, got caught in the spring. Some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read stated that the instructions were a little vague, but I was able to figure it out with a few passes. When holding the spring in a U-shape make sure both hands are place in the same manner (like holding a book), and then roll the ends of the spring towards your palms and then away. This causes the spring to move up and down catching the hair. My only trouble was when I attempted to do my chin. The angles make it more difficult to get the spring to catch so more passes were required. Overall, I found it less painful and more thorough than tweezing.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t usually write reveiws but I have to say that this one does exactly what it says.  It does hurt a little bit but if you are used to tweezing, it doesn&#x27;t feel much different than that.  What I love is that is gets every single hair, even ones you don&#x27;t see.  I am 44 years old and just recently noticed much more peachy fuzz on my top lip.  I used mine about a week ago and I still do not see any growing back. I LOVE this product!  No more time wasted with tweezing and no messy waxes or creams! It&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
            <li> This work Like wow in the beginning I thought it didn&#x27;t work but it does it takes out all of the little hairs out I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  What took so long to make something to substitute for threading??  Although I am still trying to perfect my technique, I can still see how well it works.  I bought one for all the ladies in my family and I&#x27;m going to have to buy one for my daughter since she took mine and won&#x27;t share!  Thanks Amazon for carrying this really useful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this and am glad that I got this brand instead of any knockoffs.  I&#x27;m AA type 4C hair and I&#x27;m very hairy on my face.  I&#x27;ve done everything to allieveate the problem.  Laser hair removal, diploratory creams and tweezing and waxing.  This works!  Compared to other things I&#x27;ve done, it wasn&#x27;t terribly painful to me.  The end parts unscrew for cleaning, too.  I will use this the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I have PCOS, so there are coarse hairs growing on my neck. I&#x27;ve also got acne-prone skin and an aversion to strong chemicals. This looked like a great product that didn&#x27;t need continuous maintenance or refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a few seconds to figure it out, and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected. I&#x27;m used to tweezing the hairs individually. The thing is, the spring picked up all the vellus hairs and very few of the terminal ones. (Vellus hairs being the light, fine hairs like peach fuzz while the terminal/androgenic hairs are the coarser dark ones.) My skin is dark and although my vellus hairs are very long due to the PCOS, they&#x27;re only visible up close. It was those scary, black hairs I wanted to yank out, but this product didn&#x27;t help me with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish the spring worked for my purposes, but it wasn&#x27;t able to pick up the thicker, more visible hairs. I also had a minor break out when I used it on my jawline. It seems to require multiple passes to have any effect on hairy folks like myself. I tried rolling it a few ways and after washing, but I still had to get the tweezer to pull out the remaining hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this will work well for people who have uniform hair types/lengths or people who want to pick up longish hairs that are fine to medium thickness. I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it on the \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; area or another very sensitive place. The spring itself is well made, and it would be easy carry it in a purse or take it when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad the REM Spring doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I am ordering this product, knowing it will work well.  Many years ago, I used an electric hair removing coil on my legs, so I know the idea is solid, it works, and, I&#x27;m tired of the fuss of waxing (not to mention the red blotching).  I&#x27;m also tired of my mustache and sideburns, ugh.&lt;br /&gt;But the real reason for this review is to say, WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW BY BECKY!!!!  She meticulously presents the product and the process, but more than that, she is very, very funny!  Strange to say that it does make me feel better about subjecting myself to pain when I watch someone else cringe in pain.  But again, Becky is really really funny - I laughed almost the whole way through.  Keep making those videos Becky!  And thanks.  Cathy</li>
            <li> This item is not worth the money.  It removes peach fuzz hairs but does not remove the hard course hairs.  It is difficult to use and manipulate to remove specific chin hairs. Would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> The REM spring works just as described with a little pain of course.  I will continue to use th product.</li>
            <li> I bought the REM Facial Hair Remover, and it took me awhile to get use to it, but I love it.  I have black hair so my face has tons of hairs I want to get rid of.  I put on ponds and let sit for about one hour, then I use the spring facial hair remover.  It is not so painful.  Either way, the pain is worth getting the ROOT out.  Great product for women!!</li>
            <li> Okay...... I really have to confess that I was one of the scoffers who really didn&#x27;t think this little gizmo would work at all, but boy am I surprised!!  I received mine two weeks ago.  I did have to use it several times, along with tweezing the occasional stray (my problem is the chin area), but once I got it done, my chin was as smooth as the proverbial babies bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now two weeks later, and I used it again last night.......not because of major new growth that was visible.  I could just feel it starting, so gave a fairly quick go over with the Spring Sprong.  If it lasts 2 weeks again, I&#x27;ll be over the moon with joy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read many of the reviews, and the advice about going clockwise with one end and counter clockwise with the other was excellent advice.  And if you want to see it in action, and laugh your head off, you have GOT to look at the video review by Becky (beckygardens).  That&#x27;s what convinced me to at least try it.  REM should hire this woman!!!  Word of advice however; if you choose to watch the video, do NOT, repeat, NOT be drinking anywhere near your computer, or you run serious risk of spray!!</li>
            <li> I looked at all the great reviews for this product and I was excited to try it out. But once I did, I found out that the process takes forever. I knew that it would take me an hour to get about every hair on my face- and I was cool with that because I decided that I could watch TV simultaneously. BUT- unfortunately, this product did NOT take the hair out of of the root, but instead broke it, creating the illusion that I had no hair on my face, but when I grazed the back of my hand to my cheek, I could feel the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed in this product and after re-reading the reviews, Im going to give it another shot- hoping that the technique I was using was improper. But so far, 1 star. ):</li>
            <li> This product REALLY hurts. The good news: use it frequently and it is markedly more tolerable. Perfect between waxes or as a home alternative to threading.</li>
            <li> Tears are rolling down my cheeks.  This hurts worse than getting threaded or waxed.  And it takes so long to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> I did get this product to remove all the fine hairs on my upper lip but it took quite a while and a lot of twisting and bending the spring at all angles. Probably because our faces have so many angles but just a word of caution that it isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks. I would still recommend the product though because it does eventually do the job and it is quite painless.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Yanks out all the tiny mustache hairs with minimal pain.  It&#x27;s cheaper than waxing at the salon and only takes a few minutes.  One more star if cleaning was easier.  I&#x27;m not sure why I find it so challenging.</li>
            <li> This thing yanks out hair.  That&#x27;s what it was designed for and it does it VERY WELL.  You will probably cringe and tear up at some point.  I still do.  So if hair pulling makes you cry, well...don&#x27;t get this.  I use this on my chin because I have these unsightly short dark hairs that crop up every once in a while (the joys of having female hormones, yay).  If they&#x27;re shorter than 1/8&amp;#34;, I use tweezers, but anything longer than that (probably because I have thick hair) gets grabbed.  Really fine hair is difficult for me (user error?) and has to be longer before the spring is effective.  This is basically for spot treatment.  If you try to do a side of your face or something in one sitting, your skin will probably go numb from all the yanking and you&#x27;ll be in tears--tweezing is not new for me, but I still tear up on the stubborn, deeply rooted hairs.  And for heaven’s sake, don’t try this on any other part of your body!  Honestly, this should go without saying, but I was curious to see if it would work on leg hair, so I tried a spot on my calf.  It worked, but it was super painful.  Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried waxing and hair removal creams and because my hair is so dark and thick, neither method really works without serious side effects (like chemical burns).  I’ve had to resort to shaving and this (it’s kinda ridiculous).  This little sucker is only going to make whatever patch you&#x27;re working on sting for a little bit and it might make the skin a little red because you just yanked out a bunch of hair.  An ice cube on the skin will fix that easily.  It&#x27;s low tech, easy to use (there&#x27;s only two ways to twist it, so if one way doesn&#x27;t work, try the other way), still looks like new after the three years I&#x27;ve had it, and easy to clean.  It works really well, but it’s not for weenies.  ;P</li>
            <li> This package is so small I thought it had not come, but was in the box with a with a larger item.  Guess what it really works!  Ripped out the soft hair on my top lip with no problem, also some hairs on my neck that I could never get to with tweezers.  Sending one to my daughter.  You bend it and then roll the little end pieces back and forth.  You will know immediately when you make contact.  It did nothing on my face but the hairs are sparse and very light.  Oh the joy of aging, but this is a problem at any age I guess.  Better than caustic hair removers, bleach, and I would imagine it will weaken the roots.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with many reviewers that this product was a little tricky to figure out at first. I had to watch a you tube video in fact to see how it works. Honestly though I&#x27;m not sure how the instructions could be written better to explain it. Maybe a DVD? It removes the hair fairly quickly without having to go over spots over and over. It left my skin smooth and not red or irritated. It does hurt since you&#x27;re ripping the hairs out by their roots, but it&#x27;s no different than waxing or plucking. I am going to buy these for friends as christmas presents.</li>
            <li> This thing is so simple, I cannot believe I never heard of it before. What a time saver. All the other reviews pretty much nailed it on the head.</li>
            <li> After trying every other device on the market (some expensive; some not), this little spring is, by far, the best -- works like a charm, takes half the time, and I don&#x27;t have to do it everyday.  No irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> All the good reviews are true - this is such a simple product in design, and so effective. It&#x27;s particularly useful for facial hair (EXCEPT EYEBROWS! DO NOT DO EYEBROWS!!!). Yes it hurts, but I found that applying a little bit of Benzocaine at the site of hair removal works really well. Regular use is also the way to go, as the finer hairs are not as painful to remove. Much safer than sugar wax on the face - which can sometimes pull off the top layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still hurts like heck, after several months of use. I find that using it after softening the hairs with a hot wet towel for 10-15 minutes also helps to minimizes the pain. If you plan on using this product before (or in preparation) of an event (e.g., wedding or formal event), do it a day or two before. If you have sensitive and light skin, you may have spots of reddening that usually takes several hours to disappear (for me at least).</li>
            <li> I actually came across this item while searching for the no! no!  I saw the rating so I got curious. After reading a few of the consumer reviews I figured for the price I can&#x27;t lose! I&#x27;ve been getting my face threaded once to twice a month and at $30 a visit it added up. Within 5 minutes I was able to figure it out and on my way to a smooth face! I compare the pain to threading and more tolerable than waxing.</li>
            <li> I never have been able to make this work very well.</li>
            <li> It did not take me long to get the hang of this spring.  I think it is wonderful!  It does sting a bit, flat out HURTS on the upper lip, but if you continue through the pain it gets better fairly quickly.  I had an easier time on the chin hair and went slowly on bits of the upper lip over the coarse of a week before I ignored the watering eyes and then the sneezing attack and just kept going till the upper lip was hair free.  As I have been using it once a week over the last few months I am noticing less hair-I&#x27;m pretty sure I am just ripping out the roots on lots of the hairs.  No red mustache from waxng to replace the dark upper lip anymore.  I am happy.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying this product because I heard that it is painful and I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is painful. But it does the job, I have never had a smooth upper lip before I tried this product. The hair stays away for weeks!!There is little irritation but that goes away shortly after. I feel confident that people aren&#x27;t looking at my mustache, they are looking at me! I&#x27;m confident because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the hair coming back quickly like buzzing it off. This products works! No pain, No gain.</li>
            <li> It really pulls the hairs out!  So little sting for the amount of hairs it pulls out. Great product for the upper lip and chin area. Wax always left me very red and irritated, this does not.</li>
            <li> I wonder why so many people are unhappy with the R.E.M. spring.  I have been using it for many months to happily (if sometimes painfully) rip out the hairs on my upper lip.  I twist the spring against my skin so I feel it catch the hairs I want removed, adjust if necessary, and pull.  Of course, it took some experimentation to learn the proper technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect many users&#x27; difficulty lies in following the official directions too closely.  Those never did me any good, and the motion was exhausting to repeat as much as I needed to do it.  The motions I use to catch hair in the spring are small, subtle, and effortless.  It&#x27;s more bending than twisting the item; gently separating the coils of the spring, applying it to the roots of the unwanted hair, closing the coils over them, and commencing a pulling and rolling motion.  It is very quick.  It helps to go against the growth direction of the offending hairs, and you might even want to ruffle them so they&#x27;re standing up before you apply the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila: you may now elegantly decimate your moustache, or whatever.  (Please do not get this thing anywhere near your eyebrows, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for pain--yes, it does hurt if I&#x27;ve left the mini-moustache to grow for a few weeks.  Take the spring to that kind of growth and, hell yeah, yanking out the hairs brings tears to the eyes.  It is nothing like unbearable for me, though--which is really something, because I hate pain and am told I have a lower tolerance for it than other people do.  Your experience may vary, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it helps to shower, or at least wash my face, in very warm water if I&#x27;m having difficulty.  It also helps a lot to apply a gentle, calming lotion or hydrosol to the area first, and throughout, if I&#x27;m removing serious overgrowth.  I use the calendula and rose hydrosol (with aloe vera, etc.) from 100% Pure, or Avalon Organics&#x27; lemon hand &amp; body lotion.  Both calm irritated skin, and aid in healing things like those horrid little whiteheads that sometimes appear after depilatory treatments.  (I get those rarely and minimally.  Frequently washing and moisturizing the affected area with natural, high-quality products usually sees me clear in a couple hours.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yo, the results?  Perfect.  Smooth.  Much better than I got with burning, toxic bleaches.  What troubled me most about the tufts that grow at the corners of my mouth is that they cast ugly shadows on my skin, looking ugly in photographs, and bleaching did not help.  That problem is long behind me thanks to this little device!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem complicated, but I was trying to be thorough; the process takes me very little time, and I can do it during any moment of leisure in which my hands are free!  It is tricksy to describe the technique, but I hope I was able to help someone.  The R.E.M. spring can be an extremely valuable grooming tool if you let it.t sometimes appear after depilatory treatments.  (I get those rarely and minimally.

            <li> was very painful,cannot use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the result. It is NOT totally painless as I thought, but it&#x27;s bearable. It worths the price.</li>
            <li> I use this a little every day.  It is so simple it&#x27;s crazy.  Just like the picture you bend it and roll it on your face and it pulls out the peach fuzz hair.  That is my main issue just the peach fuzz that was getting a little long.  I&#x27;m not going to lie.  It is painful.  Right under the nose is the worst.  That&#x27;s why I do a little everyday.  My skin is fine afterward stings a little for a few minutes but no reaction or anything.  The pain is just like tweezing or anything else so it&#x27;s not anything you can&#x27;t bear.</li>
            <li> OMG!  I cannot express how painful this is.  However, it works very well.  I have now used it 3 times and it still hurts.  I think waxing is less painful, but this is less irritating to my skin.  I&#x27;m hoping it will get better with time!  The 4 stars is strictly because of the pain factor!</li>
            <li> This system does what tweezers cannot - removes lots of hair from the root cleanly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;I will not have to wax</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull thick ones or I&#x27;d have given it 5 ☆&#x27;s,  but peach fuzz? Yes! Extends the time in between being threaded.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says but as other have mentioned it does hurt.  More so the first time you use but it does get better as time goes on.  (or maybe the hair is just thinner).  I would recommend watching the youtube listing how how to use as it will save you some time on the learning curb.  I would say that is about the same as getting you lips waxed but not has bad as threading.  Happy hair removing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the recommendation of a friend.  I wish I would have known about it years ago!  After getting used to how to twirl the spring it  does a good job of cleaning the unwanted hair from my face.  However,at first when you use it you will notice that it really \\&quot;smarts\\&quot; when the spring grabs a hair! Don&#x27;t worry though...your tender skin will get used to it. It&#x27;s a good investment!</li>
            <li> Since I recently purchased the R.E.M Spring and the Epicare, this will be a review of both. As pretty much everyone else writing reviews about these products, I&#x27;d been fighting facial hair for years - mostly upper lip, and the thin hair on the sides of my face in front of the ears.  And since I&#x27;m now in my 50s, these tiny little hairs were appearing on my chin, but I really couldn&#x27;t see them well enough to get rid of them.  I&#x27;d tried waxing, bleaching, depilatories, and shaving the upper lip.  It was a constant battle keeping up with it.  So I was about to spend what I saw as waaaay too much money on the No! No! Hair Removal System, when I ran into reviews of the R.E.M. Spring and the Epicare.  I thought $15 or so for these products would be easier to take than nearly $300 for the No! No!, so I first purchased the R.E.M Spring.  It did an absolutely great job removing all the hair I could and couldn&#x27;t see.  Yes, it was painful the first time - maybe the first couple of times - but it was doing a big job!  It took a bit of practice figuring out exactly how to hold and twist it, and different positions work better for different parts of the face.  It&#x27;s probably different for everyone, depending on shape of face, direction of hair growth, etc., but with a little practice you&#x27;ll find what works for you. People were saying they had two - one for home and one for their purse, so I bought the Epicare a couple of weeks later.  I just wanted to see the difference.  I would say they both work equally well.  The R.E.M Spring seems to be made of nicer materials, and its spring is a bit smaller than that on the Epicare. The R.E.M Spring handles are made of metal, and the Epicare handles are a hard plastic.  They both seem very durable, and I expect them to last a long time.  I have become a little obsessed with using them, and use one of them every day.  But there always seems to be some hair to remove, perhaps because it doesn&#x27;t all grow in at the same time.  All in all, these were both great purchases, do exactly what they claim, and I saved myself about $250 by not purchasing the product I had planned to purchase.were both great purchases, do exactly what they claim, and I saved myself about $250 by not purchasing the product I had planned to purchase.</li>
            <li> I received my spring about 2 hours ago and just by reading the reviews here, I learned how to use it properly and it really works!  It sorta kinda feels like I&#x27;m getting shocked on my face a little bit but the pain isn&#x27;t something you can&#x27;t get over.  I found that at first I had to bend the spring in a complete \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape and twist to get the hairs.  After the longer hairs were gone, it seemed to have stopped working but I could still see some hairs in my magnifying mirror so I knew they were there.  I referred back to these reviews and one of the first ones recommended that that the spring only be bent slightly while you twist it clockwise and counter clockwise at the same time.  The spring didn&#x27;t need to be opened that much to get those little hairs.  This worked like a charm!  I feel like a professional at this already.  This beats putting that smelly hair removal cream on my upper lip anyday! My upper lip is hair free and I&#x27;m happy!  I would definitely recommend this little tool to anyone wanting to get rid of those little unwanted face fuzzies.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made product and it works but, with lots of practice. I found that it worked better when you slightly bend the device while twisting both ends. This device works almost as good as threading and it&#x27;s less painful, but you can&#x27;t use it on your eyebrows (face only). I was pleased to receive this product prior to the expected shipping date. I think it&#x27;s worth buying since you save lots of money on threading or waxing.</li>
            <li> This definitely works. Using the first time over the top lip I would suggest doing little sections as it does ouch. It takes some getting used to; sometimes it picks up and sometimes not.  I believe that is because I am not using it right.  Be sure to lay it flat on the face and then twist.  Fuzzy face be gone!</li>
            <li> Would be better as an electric instrument that twisted automatically - as is, it&#x27;s very tiring to use. Not seeing the advantage over waxing.</li>
            <li> Works really well. However, wished it came with a little bag or something to put it in while not in use. I put it in my purse and carry it everywhere, but sometimes it&#x27;s not easy to find in my purse. LOL....I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  The small purchase was definitely worth it!  The first day I received it... it didn&#x27;t seem like I could get it to work... but just give it a few tries and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  Don&#x27;t worry!  Just work the spring in different directions and movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can YouTube videos of people using similar products. It&#x27;ll make more sense then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I don&#x27;t know why I struggled in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should use it a little everyday so that your skin gets used to it.  Or use ice to numb the area first.</li>
            <li> Waxing is faster, but this tool is better.  It is better than tweezing, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have PCOS so my facial hair grows quickly and doesn&#x27;t respond to waxing like normal women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use this on my upper lips and cheeks around the mouth area.  I&#x27;m still practicing around my jaw line, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as this tool is used correctly, it is very effective.  I&#x27;m still not a pro at using it, but it gets easier every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a slow version of waxing, so there is some discomfort involved,  but it isn&#x27;t excruciating pain.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but took a chance and ordered it.  It really works.  It is painful but does the job.  The pain only lasts like when you tweeze but pulls out more than one hair at a time.  It was quick and better than cream remover which tends to burn your face.  Would recommend product to all.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Oprah and thought, for the money, I&#x27;d give it a try not sure if it clean down the my facial hair.  BOY OH BOY!!!  This little spring works!  I was amazed.  It did hurt the first few times I used it but it does the trick and the hair seems to grow back thinner.  One caveat, you need to clan your skin before and also put some type of acne cream after or else you may break out.  This is what I do not and have not had any problems.  I wish I could use it for my eyebrows too but it doesn&#x27;t work.  Nevertheless, perfect for hair all over your face and chin except eyebrows.  BTW, for your chin, I use it horizontally not vertically and it gets all the hair out.  I love it so much, I have given it as a gift as well.  Great tool for us with hairy faces!!!</li>
            <li> this product truly works. it removes hair and i have been using this spring for my upper lip instead of spending $10/week on threading/waxing. you have to get the hang of it first but it definitely does work.</li>
            <li> This product is certainly not painless, but it&#x27;s faster than tweezing and less painful than waxing. It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t mind a tear now and then....</li>
            <li> I had little faith in this, but because it was relatively cheap I gave it a try. It&#x27;s a tiny bit painful, pending the area you use it on. I used it on my chin and it works absolutely perfectly. What a great little investment.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for a product, but for this one I decided to make an exception, simply because when used a little differently than instructed, it works amazing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is advertised that you must bend the spring, I actually just lay it flat on the piece of skin where I want to remove hair (in this case it is on the sides of my face). I find that when laid completely flat, it removes hair much better than when bent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is not necessary to use the handles themselves to roll the spring against the direction of the hair. I have gotten much better results when placing my fingers directly on the spring, and just rolling it upwards on my face. It is much easier to control the amount of pressure you place on the spring, and the direction you want it to go in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these little tweaks, I really love how effective this product is; you may have to go over an area a couple times to ensure that the hair is removed, but it is worth it. No more waxing, thank goodness!</li>
            <li> This is a tool that yanks out your hair. It&#x27;s like the feeling when your wearing a watch that stretches, and it pulls your arm hair. Maybe my pain tolerance is low, but it does hurt. I think that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. I almost prefer waxing because its only one quick pain. But with this, its yank after yank. Take a shower first, or wash your face with warm water to soften your hair. Or maybe ice where you want to focus on before you start.</li>
            <li> Have you ever been so excited at the idea of something that you fail to see any potential negatives regarding that idea? That was me with this product. I was really excited that this was something I could use to rid my upper lip of the mass quantities of peach fuzz that exist without the use of chemicals and wax. I read almost every review for this and similar products and convinced myself that I could withstand the pain, but I just can&#x27;t. This thing hurts. Think &#x27;medieval torture device&#x27; type pain. I only tried for about 3 days to remove my hair. Once you get the hang of manipulating the device to actually pull hair out, you do actually see it in the coils, which for me, only gives me the drive to continue temporarily. And as I got my face closer to the mirror and realized just how many times I would have to rip hairs out of my face in order to rid them all, I became discouraged and set the device aside to collect dust. I keep telling myself I will try it again, but I know deep inside I should have gone with my gut instinct and bought the Olay Hair Removal cream that I have heard works. Although I didn&#x27;t want to resort to chemicals due to sensitive skin, or to waxing because I hate the after-feel, I feel that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m headed. If you can take tweezing, you should be able to handle this...just take tweezing your eyebrow area and multiply that by about 100 and you&#x27;ll get the idea. Kudos to those reviewers who have the pain threshold it takes to use this device</li>
            <li> So easy to use. Works like a charm. Better than other products I&#x27;ve tried. Delivered on time. Not much else to say but that I love it and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Figuring out how to use it was a bit hard, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s pretty awesome. Bend it into a U shape and simultaneously twist it using the ends, it gets pretty much everything. It will sting a little, but you&#x27;ll be shocked at the results.</li>
            <li> Okay. Yes, it hurts some. So I use it in front of the TV when distracted by that, or with a glass of wine and a small piece of dark chocolate at hand. Medicinal, right? I am not the best at using something like this, but this I can easily use. And how much it hurts is minimal. I bought, or will this week--a second for the second television. Easier than hard wax (did I tell you about the dress that fell on?) Cheaper than my cheap facial wax person (though she is a pleasure to see.) THIS is the ticket for fine hair, light in color on the face and chin.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the answer to all my unwanted hair problems, but it does really well at removing hair from places I&#x27;ve had trouble with before (chin, neck, lip). It&#x27;s easier and quicker than plucking individual hairs and lasts longer than shaving. Pain is minimal, and I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions to it. Overall, pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to go to my local salon for waxing, then I got a skin rash and burns, so I switched to the threading walk-in place at the mall; I have very sensitive skin and I always wondered how sanitized these places are -- I often got breakups and irritation after each visit -- this little ingenious tool does it all at home quite easily -- it takes a little while to get the hang of it but it works very well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this product, DO IT! I&#x27;ve tried waxing/tweezing (broke out), nair (chemical burn), facial buffers (didn&#x27;t work), epilators (too painful for upper lip) and threading. Threading was the best of the bunch, but it was expensive and there wasn&#x27;t any place I could get it done near where I live. I came to Amazon looking for the No!No! but after reading the reviews, I wasn&#x27;t feeling confident enough to order it. This was an item that Amazon suggested for me; so grateful! It&#x27;s perfect for my upper lip and chin. It takes off EVERY SINGLE HAIR. Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy and quick. It&#x27;s probably the least painful way for me to remove facial hair, but I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s pain free, it&#x27;s just better than most. The only thing I don&#x27;t love it for is my cheeks and sideburns; it just takes too long. I use my epilator instead. Anyway, love this product; I&#x27;ll never stop using it.</li>
            <li> Love this tool, all my girlfriends and I ordered it. It hurts a little but worth the pain. Product came just as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to waxing and plucking.  I use it on my chin and upper lip.  It&#x27;s not painful on my chin at all.  For that alone, it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s much more painful on my upper lip, but I just sit on the couch and do a little at a time.  It&#x27;s not too bad.  It does a great job if you get the technique correct.  It take a little time to get it right.  I do get it to pull out the thicker hairs, but sometimes I have to go over the area a few times.</li>
            <li> Just got this recently as I live in a place without anyone who can do threading (can&#x27;t wax or I break out). It works wonderfully. just follow the directions. Essentially i spun the spring between my thumb and pointer finger as though I was snapping those two fingers (but more gently) and had no issues with figuring it out. of course it hurts - hair removal almost always does. It probably feels like it hurts more because you are doing it to yourself - you lose the element of surprise. But its great! Highly recommend it after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> No more waxing, this is a great and easy way to get rid of facial hair. I have used this for years now and it still works great, I have one in my purse and one in desk at work and of course one at home and I just pull it out whenever and facial hair is gone. So easy to use. Well worth the money, I have got my monies worth and them some.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews for this product, though there are few.  It works GREAT!  I had no problem getting it to work immediately; I didn&#x27;t even need to read the directions.  It took all of five minutes for me to completely de-hair my upper lip. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  Yeah, it hurt, but I numbed right below my nose with ice, and that helped a lot.  I can tell that it won&#x27;t hurt very much after this first time if you just do maintenance.  Really, you have GOT to try this.  I thought I was stuck using disgusting depilatories for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> complicated because if you dont know how to use it, it wont work. it doesnt grab the thicker facial hair, only the baby hair. not something for me.</li>
            <li> This hair remover is very simple and very effective. It requires a little time to master a technique, once you I had it the results were quick and obvious. There some discomfort involved.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I use it almost every day. For me, it is pretty painful to use on upper lip, so I generally wax first, and then use this to catch the strays. Works great and nearly painless for the fine hairs on chin and \\&quot;unibrow\\&quot; area. I even use it on my nose - little tiny blond hairs that show up when the light hits you just right. Has no trouble grabbing those and pulling them out. Had this one for 3 years and it&#x27;s still just as effective as the first day I used it. Love it.</li>
            <li> This little torture device is the best thing ever... Yes, I said BEST. THING. EVER. So addicting and gets every little hair. Tip: use at night before going to bed, because your skin WILL be bright red after using it, so you might want to stay in until the redness subsides to avoid any strange looks in public. :)</li>
            <li> Okay ladies you need to try this if you&#x27;ve exhausted all other possibilities! I am convinced I have the worlds most sensitive skin so I did experience redness, a little puffiness and now I&#x27;m breaking out around my lips BUT I&#x27;ve never yanked the hair out from there before, only trimmed, so I&#x27;m hoping it will not be a constant. Otherwise, it really does work. My jawline has never been so fuzz-less! Keep your tweezers handy in case there are some strays though, it does take a little bit of experimenting to get it to work at different angles.&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited that I no longer look like a cat in the sun!!</li>
            <li> It works really well but it makes me want to cry when I try to use it. If you are used to waxing, you might be Okay.</li>
            <li> I tried the lazer hair remover for my chin and after a year the hair came back. But now when I would grow the hair out and go get it waxed the wax wasnt strong enough to pull the hair out. It was like the lazer made my hair or skin tougher and the hair just would not come out. So I did some research, and I found the REM. I have to say it is amazing. Yes it does hurt a little bit more, but the results are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chin is now hairless and I dont have to worry about stubble when my boyfriend grabs my chin to kiss me. I feel normal and beautiful again. For me, it even gets tiny little hairs. I had been shaving my chin and when I got the Rem it hand only been 24hrs since I had shaved my chin. I went ahead and used it because it was new and it got all the hair out! It was amazing and I recommend this to any and everyone. I read the reviews so I knew how to work it. On the little hairs I find I have to bend it more U shaped and hold it with my fingers twisting actually on the spring real close to the U. For bigger longer hairs I can hold the ends and barely bend it. I guess you just have to figure out what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;Love IT!</li>
            <li> This really works wonders on your entire face. I received it yesterday and found it really useful. I don&#x27;t need to use any more hair removing creams and get wax done on my face any more..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were many similar products but I opted this as some one mentioned that she has read it in Oprah&#x27;s O Magazine and I just love Oprah and I&#x27;m more than happy for choosing the right product..</li>
            <li> Facial hair stinks. Being a woman and trying to \\&quot;look your best\\&quot; seems to lead to the oddest of stories. At one point with a wax mishap the skin on my upper lip  wound up lifting up with the wax and the strip. What developed after is what I refer to as my \\&quot;scab &#x27;stache\\&quot;. So now at this point of having suffered chemical burns from products that claim they are as gentile as a feather. (Don&#x27;t believe it)&lt;br /&gt;I still want to try and keep a groomed appearance and what girl doesn&#x27;t want to feel pretty? I decided to try this product even reading all the reviews noting how painful this can be.&lt;br /&gt;The more hair the more painful... if you are able to wax and then do this as follow up you will have less pain. The cost of the spring pays for itself very quickly in not having to pay for salon services or creams that are toxic and not good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Getting used to the motion to utilize the device takes a little dexterity but is pretty basic all in all.&lt;br /&gt;It is also a small tool that doesn&#x27;t take much room so putting it in your medicine cabinet or makeup area is easy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought one because of the video review from Becky of Nola.  It didn&#x27;t hurt me as much as she indicated.  I started on less sensitive areas. You can stop moving your fingers at any moment to stop pulling out hairs if it is hurting more than you&#x27;d like.  What I love about it is that you don&#x27;t have to see the hairs to get them out.  With tweezing, for example, I&#x27;m peering into a magnifying mirror and trying to coordinate my tweezers and often missing the hair.  This spring is so fast and easy.  It is an inexpensive, efficient way to go.&lt;br /&gt;Later--the little pouch it comes with left a blue stain on the damp counter.  Throw away the pouch, it&#x27;s not important.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after getting fed up with tweezers and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  I was even able to rip out a row of mustache hair with little effort!  Sadly I have been banned from using it again so I&#x27;ll have to get my own.</li>
            <li> I have a small amount of very dark upper lip hair.  Every hair removal method I&#x27;ve tried (waxing, salon waxing, threading) always leaves tiny white bumps the next day.  Not this.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  However, anyone who says it isn&#x27;t painful is insane.  It HURTS just as much as any other hair removal method.  It&#x27;s totally worth the money.  It pays itself off since it costs as much as a salon waxing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of threading but the problem is, threading is tough to do on your own.I bought this to remove the few facial hairs that seem to plague me (around 1-3 every 2 weeks),in between my usual threading sessions for the eyebrows.The coils are tight wound and picks up hair strands in the exact same manner as threading does,too bad it can&#x27;t do eyebrows. Husband tried this after he saw me use it but he said it&#x27;s too painful.It&#x27;s not painful at all-maybe coz I&#x27;m used to the sensations already.Better alternative,less messy and cheap in the long run than say,waxing for facial hair.</li>
            <li> Now, I will say that I am still fairly new at using this thing as I have only used it a couple of times, but i can say that,if you can get through the first session (made my eyes water), it&#x27;s not nearly as bad after that. The instructions are simple and  brief, but I followed them and it worked well. You have to get a little creative with it around the curves of your chin, but other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use on the more flat surfaces. It&#x27;s better than any shavers, it&#x27;s better than hair removal creams, it&#x27;s better than plucking each one.... it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Im 50 years old and frankly between the fine hairs and the occassional &amp;#34;whisker&amp;#34; its just too involved to get them all. This device does a pretty nice job and you dont really need to watch yourself in a mirror to do it. Once you get it down you can do this while watching TV and when it stops plucking your done. I was impressed enough when I used it by the 3rd use I was buying them and shipping directly to my 2 older sisters. They love theirs too! Yes it takes a nack..... but soo worth it and it doesnt want a tip $$. Saving me money, time and the humiliation of walking around with a red stash all day after having my lip waxed. No redness. I do like to follow with an astrigent to clean well where to hairs been plucked and avoid a blemish (got one the first time and I learned). So worth the $15 I spent on it. I&#x27;ve done my cheeks, jaw line, neck, lip, chin. Ive never been so clean and smooth. Even improves how my make up goes on.</li>
            <li> Love it and it should be sold by amazon.com.  Have used other brands but this is the best!</li>
            <li> I like this hair remover. I bought it only for removing my facial hair and it does work! At first, I was skeptical of buying this apparatus. But now, I don&#x27;t regretted! I had this spring for three years and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t rusted and it is easy to clean up. It&#x27;s made of stainless steel. The way I clean this spring is with a damp paper towel and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;It is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the spring for a month now, and I love it, but it took a while to get in the groove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the box and got to work on my upper lip, which I have been bleaching lately (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have always gone back and forth between bleaching and waxing).  It took me a while to figure out how it works. You need to roll the ends so that the open side of the flexed spring rolls closed, thus trapping and yanking out the hair. Let no one fool you...this HURTS!!! It is yanks out dozens of hairs by the roots at the same time.  I wanted to quit and just WAX and get it over with, but I made myself finish the job.  It worked great. No wax residue and the redness went away after an hour or two. If you can&#x27;t handle it, just to a little bit each session,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I used it a few days later, it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, because there weren&#x27;t as many hairs to pull. There were a few very short stragglers that I grabbed with my tweezers.  After a month, my hairs must be used to getting pulled out, because it hurts far less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this spring is that it is SO CONVENIENT. You can use it anywhere and it is not messy. After a few days, I decided to *try* to do my sideburns so that I could be free of bleach forever. I don&#x27;t actually mind having fuzz on my jaw line, but since it&#x27;s dark, I usually bleach.  I knew it would hurt like crazy, so I decided just to tackle it a little bit every day. After a few days, I had cleared the whole area, and I&#x27;m not nearly as afraid to just run the spring over my jawline ever few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this spring has simplified my life. My hubby, who is admirably supportive with whatever I decide to do with facial hair, said he liked the results.  Hope this works for you!!</li>
            <li> Works, there&#x27;s a learning curve.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me. It was painful and I can&#x27;t imagine using it in sensitive areas like the upper lip. Tweezers definitely work better for me. It also would take too long to do all the facial hair. It&#x27;s like Chinese water torture to use this thing.</li>
            <li> i think you have to let the facial hair grow lots or you have to be really, really, really patient.......I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product available for hair removal on your face!  No more waxing or shaving!  It&#x27;s a miracle....easy to use and relativly painless!  Love love love this.....have bought many for friends and family members!</li>
            <li> works like threading basically. the instructions are so small that i had to use my own intuition to get it work right. will update if have time...thank you for this tool!</li>
            <li> I ordered this March 11, 2013 and received on the 13th. Fast shipping and I am not a Prime member..yet. So to me that was a good sign :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin but did not get any little red bumps. This could be due to the fact I always use Moisturizer both for cleaning and tinted for makeup use. I took this out and already knew the basis of using after reading all the reviews. Put it on my face in the U shape and started twisting the ends each going the opposite way of the other. Felt the usual sensation due to having hair pulled out. Yes, it does hurt but it&#x27;s so quick it&#x27;s nothing to deter from. On my upper lip it&#x27;s better for me to let the spring be more of a frown vs a U. I do think for good results just like waxing or tweezing the longer the hair the better to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was looking up the Oil of Olay Hair Remover when this came up. I really hate using chemicals, waxing, etc. I&#x27;m really glad I order this and took a chance.  My face is smooth and there is no telltale sign that I have recently removed any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to remember to put my hair all up as it will easily grab a stray long hair ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the key steps for this to work is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Coarse hair will have to be longer just like with waxing/tweezing to get the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;2. Go all different ways. Right, Left, Up, Down, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t be afraid to veer from the U shape a bit. Sometimes having it a bit straighter works better.&lt;br /&gt;4. For my Neck and Chin it was better for me to look up. This resulted in my neck being pulled tighter and this helped grabbed hairs. So find whatever position to work the spring better on not so straight areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck :)</li>
            <li> I just received it today, and already I&#x27;m a pro! Well, not really, but I didn&#x27;t find this too difficult to master. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t figure it out, but it&#x27;s just a coil spring that you roll around the areas of your face. In doing so, this thing rips off every little hair, but never pinches the skin. My method is just to roll between your fingers in a back and forth motion, and sideways, left to right. North south, east west. The quicker I go, the less pain and more hair I take off. I widen and narrow the U shape while doing so. It nips a bit in the beginning, but I was expecting this to be more painful than waxing, which it is not. I sat and watched a movie and rolled away, without wincing. And I am a big baby who can hardly handle a flu shot. I would have given 5 stars, but I&#x27;ll agree that I think this is a little pricey. But for the money (and bruising) I&#x27;ll save from not waxing, I&#x27;m glad I got this!</li>
            <li> This thing is so weird, but it is the best!! Uh, yes, it hurts! So does waxing, chemicals, plucking, etc. This thing is effective, and the results last a long time, 3 to 4 weeks for me. It is easy enough to do once you have it down, you can just sit in front of the TV and space it. I carry it around with me all the time. It really is the best solution out there for lip hair. FYI: It does say on the package don&#x27;t try to use it on your eyebrows because your eyelashes will get caught in it. I read that and was like, yeah, if your reallllly dumb that would happen. I am a CPA after all. College grad and whatnot. First time I tried it on my eyebrows, it works its ninja magic and yes, my eyelashes got caught in it. I will never know how since my main priority was keeping them out of it, but it happened. So really don&#x27;t try that.</li>
            <li> Re: REM Spring Facial Hair Remover,--Have not used this product excessively yet, but agree with viewers who said It hurt from the aspect of the pinching sensation.  However, not a lot worse than tweezing but also not a lot better than just tweezing. This product, so far, does not stand out from many others tried.  Anyone dealing with facial hair problems would agree we all try a number of products just hoping for one that &amp;#34;fits the bill&amp;#34; or  one we can trust.  Too many of these products prey on those of us who are willing to try just about anything if we believe it will really work, especially for a problem we find embarrassing.  Originally, I chose this product based on reviews, the price, and also that the particular one I was buying stated &amp;#34;no shipping charge.&amp;#34;  However, when I clicked for final sale I was charged for shipping.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know why this product is relatively unknown. I would highly recommend it, it works so well.</li>
            <li> But ouch! It gets easier after using it a few times. It goes with the saying that it can be painful to look beautiful!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get  use to the pain with this little device.  it seems to hurt a lot more than waxing  which is odd based on the &#x27;painless&#x27; reviews i read, posted by some users.  While it may work for some, i definitely will not be using this product.  I&#x27;d rather wax then to go through this pain.</li>
            <li> This is advertised for women with excess facial hair.  As a male, I wanted to be able to remove hair near my ear.  It works reasonably well to remove most of that hair.</li>
            <li> Works great.! I first thought this isn&#x27;t going to work. I had to turn the right handle clockwise and the left counterclockwise. I removes the hair and leaves skin smooth. It turned a little red but went away in a few minutes. I think waxing is more painful. I use it about once a week to get all the little hairs, since hair grows at different levels</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this product. Sure, it was painful, but all hair removal is. I used it The first day and loved the results, until a few hours later when my face broke out. I am apparently allergic to this :( too bad because it worked quite well.</li>
            <li> tweezers are way better this is painful difficult and doesn&#x27;t work well it is a gimmick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this is awesome.  I have never waxed before, afraid that I&#x27;d get dark regrowth.  I was on the verge of trying the Olay hair moval system.  Then I saw this in a magazine.  I absolutely love it. Very easy to use and effective!  I am thrilled with this purchase.  The only thing I&#x27;d mention is that I find it works better if you just twist both ends and roll over area that you want to move hair.  This works better than bending in half.  I would strongly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. I am really fair, with dark hair. I get fine fuzz on  my upper lip that I have been either bleaching or waxing since I was a teenager. I came across this by accident when buying some face wax strips from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem at all figuring out how to use it. However, I did watch some youtube videos about the spring before I decided to buy it. Yes . . . It hurts, but it pulls out all the little fine hairs really well. If you can handle tweezing or waxing, the discomfort this causes shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin with dark hair so my upper lip has always been a problem for me.  I also have really sensitive skin so waxing just makes it worse since my skin will react like crazy and I end up walking around with a red irritated blistered upper lip instead, same goes for the bleaches and hair removal creams.  This little thing is so effective. It takes a while to get the hang of it, but it is idiot proof, you just need to try it out and figure it out.  Warning, it will HURT the first time (obviously, if you are doing it on a full area of hair), but after that it is totally bearable and SO WORTH IT.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed if your skin gets a little irritated and flaky the first time you use it on a full area of of peach fuzz.  I will be using this for the rest of my life!!!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this hair remover and were unable to use it.  I should have listened to the other reviews and kept on looking.  This was an absolute waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing!  I love it way better than waxing and creams.  It&#x27;s a bit painful (kind of like tweezing a bunch of hairs at a time on your lip) but the final result is perfect!  It&#x27;s so much faster than using chemical infused creams and waxing.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Works great! There is a little discomfort, but if you&#x27;ve had your lip threaded it&#x27;s the same type of feeling.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome! I am pregnant so my skin is ultra sensitive so i can&#x27;t wax. I bought this and i don&#x27;t think i will ever wax again!</li>
            <li> Tried to go with the knock off at first....don&#x27;t do it!!! This tool is much more effective and gets way better results. Very pleased that I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Product is great! It was delivered fast and private. The spring works very well, yes it does hurt a bit but have to remember it is being pulled from the root of the hair. It feels like using tweezers but faster because it pulls more than one hair at a time. I love it! And I reccommend it for those that have a few hairs that need to go!</li>
            <li> An ingenious device. I&#x27;m having to buy another one because my grandmother liked mine so well and gave me puppy dog eyes and I ended up giving it to her. She showed my cousin who had never heard of this either and was impressed as well and asked why  I&#x27;ve been holding out on her. She&#x27;s going to buy one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performing, it does the job as it should. Pain is to be expected. You&#x27;re talking about ripping hair out of your skin and your face (at least for me) no less. I have PCOS so I hair under my chin and it&#x27;s embarrassing. It&#x27;s not all that dark but I feel self conscience and rather it not be there. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this removing thick hairs or thin peach fuzz type. It gets both just fine.</li>
            <li> a pretty amazing simple product....it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs, esp, the tough white ones, but overall..i would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter, after she begged me to get it for her.  After trying to use it over and over, she never really got the hang of how to use it (neither did I, although I wasn&#x27;t trying so hard).  Maybe it is more appropriate for an adult, or maybe it was just my daughter, but she hated it and ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> the only thing that was wrong with this product is one of the ends was missing and I could not get another one so amazon gave me $5 back instead of just sending me another one. The product works great but it was slightly defective and I think that it should be replaced.</li>
            <li> but wont remove tough white hair or black hair that has been tweezed for yrs.  Bunch of  wuzzes who say it is so painful.  enables getting the tough old hair out easier using this first.  really like this product</li>
            <li> This sometimes works and mostly doesnt.  I run it over hair and it may or maynot grab the hair, mostly it gets the very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot.  Did what I wanted it to do.  I would recommend it. Cheaper than waxing and a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works great to remove the fine hairs but left me with a hundred tiny bloody scabs on my face!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would clean up some of the peach fuzz. It&#x27;s so painful and leaves my skin red. I noticed more blackheads after using this too.</li>
            <li> Painful as crap.. Has to be an easier way to remove facial hair or I&#x27;ll just keep on plucking. yuck.</li>
            <li> Caused significant irritation, as if I broke out into a severe rash. Will never use again.</li>
            <li> I use the REM about once a week and it is amazing! I personally was the type of person who would have to go get my upper lip and chin area threaded or I plucked it myself, the only bad thing is that alot of thin hairs were left behind. But not with the rem i use it and it looks clean and as if I had shaved so I love this product. Yes it a little painful the first minute but Im quite use to the pain from threading and plucking so I dont mind at all. I have and will recommend this product because it does work. Also it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use I think that&#x27;s the best part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a gazillion reviews and tried every which way, but I still can&#x27;t figure out why it pulls some hairs and leaves others. Also, sometimes it feels like it feels like the hair has been ripped out but it hasn&#x27;t. Do yourself a favor and check out the off-brands available on Amazon- they are MUCH cheaper and just as well reviewed.</li>
            <li> What a great invention! I hate the mess and bother of trying to wax or thread myself and don&#x27;t like having to go to a salon (or mall) to get it done, so this little gadget is awesome! I will say that the &amp;#34;tingling sensation&amp;#34; mentioned in the directions is known in layman&#x27;s terms as &amp;#34;extreme pain.&amp;#34; There&#x27;s no getting around pain when you&#x27;re ripping sensitive facial hair out by the roots. I used a bit of ice to numb things a bit and it did the job. I did hope that I wouldn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs from this, but unfortunately my very sensitive skin apparently reacts that way to all hair removal attempts. Regardless, the tool itself is fantastic and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product really solves the purpose..it removes hair really well but definitely not painless. You will feel a pinching pain similar to what you would experience with a tweezer. Very easy to use and efficient. Love it!!(hope it was less painful)..</li>
            <li> I have PCOS, so this does wonders, I do not know how long it will last, but I will probably replace in 6 months.  This is better than shaving, so I use this and the tweezers now, totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, I found that it really does the job on my facial hair.  It definitely works better on the more fine hairs that grow in a single direction.  It removed the hair from my top lip with ease.  I have a few hairs on my chin that are more coarse than the others and tend to grow from different angles; it wasn&#x27;t able to remove those at all.  I had to resort to my trusty tweezers.  For the most part, I think this is a fine product that does the job as advertised.  Unfortunately, I have a fair amount of facial hair which always made me very self conscious.  Part of my regular routine every morning was to stand in front of the bathroom mirror and painstakingly tweeze out any visible hairs.  I use this on the weekends and my face stays smooth all week.  The pain is intense for the first few uses but eventually it gets more bearable.  One other thing to note, though.  I have noticed some redness and irritation after I use it.  Aloe helps.</li>
            <li> 100%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! awesome! Does a great job! Hurts but not too bad. Use all the time!!  If you are looking for something easy then search not further.</li>
            <li> After reading the great review on how to use this hair remover, I tried with little success.  Finally, I figured out that the problem was with the angle in which I was holding the Spring onto my face while twisting and rolling.  I laid the Spring over my face and rolled it with my fingers atop the Spring.  Viola!  Success.  Doing it this way is faster and easier than trying to twist the ends while moving the Spring.  Just roll it over your face like you would roll dough on a surface to make it long and skinny.  The Spring will grab every hair in the area where you roll it.  I use fingers on both hands to roll it.  By the way, I don&#x27;t think it really hurts.</li>
            <li> for the thick hairs you want to pull this item is too weak,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for those tiny ones you dont want to pull and no one can see this item picks at every one of them and doesnt pull them either</li>
            <li> This seemed like a good idea. I&#x27;ve heard of &#x27;threading&#x27; and would way rather remove facial hair with out chemicals or a trip to a salon. I am one of the fortunate who don&#x27;t have an obvious facial hair issue. Light colored facial hair. But, this was a pain and I felt stupid using it and didn&#x27;t feel like it was really working. Will try again but, think this is a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Great product. Took me some time to figure out how to use it. Its relatively painless, quick and efficient. Have already recommended it  to others</li>
            <li> This gets the job done. However, it hurts A LOT!!!!  Seriously...I have a high tolerance for pain and this made my eyes water. I find that it&#x27;s easy to use when you hold it in the U shape like they say in the instructions and then roll upwards. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to use initially but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s great. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t irritated my skin. I broke out in clusters the next day after using it. Which was weird because I do not have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m not the kind that breaks out (if anyone has tips on how to avoid this I&#x27;d appreciate it!). Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> Works, painful because you take multiple hairs at once. Irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to work, but it is painful. I would recommend this to anyone that has waxed in the past and can handle the hair being removed.</li>
            <li> Just received the R.E.M. Spring yesterday and I love it! I have very sensitive skin and lots of hair on my chin and upper lip. It does hurt- especially on the upper lip but no more than having it waxed and much less than tweezing individually.  It took a few tries but I quickly figured it out- just change the direction you twist until you feel it working. After doing my entire face there was some hair in the coils (gross!) but a quick wash with soap and water followed by pulling apart the coils while the water ran full blast and they came out. I used an alcohol swab on it before I used it. My face looks better then when I&#x27;ve gotten it threaded and as good as when I&#x27;ve gotten it waxed, but this is so much better on the budget. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re quite hairy this is not the product for you.  It is really hard to maneuver.  It doesnt completely rip the hair from its roots.  Its good for removing hair on your upper lip.  Anything else will be a struggle.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, yes it hurts some but not that bad. It dose not make skin so red like waxing. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about using this because it seemed too good to be true. But, due to the abundantly high number of good  reviews I decided to give it a whirl. Number one: The shipping was EXTREMELY  fast I received it next day. Number 2: The ease of you use was actually much easier  than I expected. It DOES hurt, ALOT. But, I know that when you&#x27;re using something that extracts hair directly from the follicle it is going to be painful. I suffer from excessive hair under and on my chin. Most of it being peach fuzz while some hairs being dark and course. I am also pale so the dark hairs stand out even more. This is definitely a hormonal issue that I either have to live with or eventually go to someone that can naturally elevate my levels of estrogen without using going through hormone therapy. Nonetheless, I am very pleased with this little device. The only downside is that you do have to go over areas more than once and I did have to use a tweezer on some stray hairs, but it was much less than waxing or any other method I&#x27;ve used to remove hair. I have been so self conscious about my excess hair and would fret about it daily. I used this device 2 days ago and the hair on my face hasnt grown back. I am hoping I dont have to repeat this process but once a week.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle! I will order again, I am very pleased and happy with my product, it does works!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This hair remover works fantastic.  Be prepared for pain.  It hurts to be beautiful.  Works better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am 60, very fair and have always had a white blonde mustache and lots of stray chin hairs.  Because it is all fair, I&#x27;ve not been a candidate for laser, etc.  and have used tweezers.  Recently I began to research epilady products, and stumbled on this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy use, and as another reviewer mentioned, the secret is going back and forth in several directions, while twisting the device with your hands in opposite directions (maintaining the more or less U shape recommended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very well: the discomfort is inconsequential, the results fantastic.  Although one should definitely not use on eyebrows, I have used it in the peach fuzz like hair in between my eyebrows.  Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I am SO excited about this little guy.  I have fine blond peach fuzz on my upper lip and jawline so I don&#x27;t know about how it would work on coarser hairs, but for me it&#x27;s awesome. I hate shaving it. Comes right back and is stubbly.  And this spring really only hurt/stung the first time I used it -- and like everybody has said, especially over the lip owwwww!  But now after that first time there&#x27;s just a little &#x27;prickly&#x27; feel.  Not even uncomfortable.  Also as a side note, my skin feels so smooooth and my makeup looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it, I just held the two ends like the picture, formed a \\&quot;u\\&quot; with it, placed it below the hairs, and then spun or twisted my fingers and both ends at the same time back toward me as I moved up or across the hairs.  I also worked across the fuzz in several directions.  And as other reviewers have said, youtube has some great videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so grateful for all the reviews that helped me decide to try this awesome little Spring! though now I think I&#x27;m addicted to it :) Thank you guys! :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan 26, 2013: Follow up note on the \\&quot;painless\\&quot; part -- I&#x27;ve had this gizmo a few days now and I&#x27;ve discovered that if I use it every day there really IS no pain.  Not even the prickly feel.  So I guess the way to the no pain part is to keep up with the growth and not let it grow back in the first place.  Honest -- there&#x27;s no discomfort at all now.</li>
            <li> One of the best inventions ever.  No joke.  Its cheap, discreet, small, painless and most importantly IT WORKS!! After spending more time &amp; money than I&#x27;d like to remember on 2  seperate 8-sesh  laser hair removal rounds on my face, the $90 Emjoi Emagine epilator (don&#x27;t even think about that) and trying &amp; looking for other methods, I finally found the one.  It&#x27;s a life changer and every woman should have one. (Unless you&#x27;re one of those bitches who don&#x27;t have a hair on their facial region)</li>
            <li> I like it because it could grab my fine hair. Though I must say that it mimics the threading-style pain but it&#x27;sworth it. Plus it is made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> No messy wax, and you can do this at home. I bought this years ago, and didn&#x27;t like it, so I stuck it in a draw. I tried to use a battery operated elpilator, and it really didn&#x27;t work well. I found this item again, and found it worked well this time. It is not as effective as waxing, but it works well enough that I am bothering to write this review.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this at all....but it is a great substitute for shaving my chin every day. My problem hair is not all over but on the chin area......some fine &amp; some thick. It&#x27;s awkward to get them but they stay off for quite awhile before I have to do it again. The shaving had to be done everyday &amp; even then it didn&#x27;t get close enough for me......still felt something there. Really am going to like this.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?? Get ready to save a ton of time and money from not having to wax anymore. Hallelujah. It took me a few tries to really get it down - there&#x27;s definitely a technique to it - but once I did I was hooked. I have sensitive but not super sensitive skin, a mixture of fine and course hair, and so far the spring has done everything it&#x27;s advertised and nothing it hasn&#x27;t. It takes out all the hairs from the root, and hasn&#x27;t cause any irritation or rashes. As ridiculous as it may look, puffing your face out really helps in grabbing all obnoxious little buggers, and I&#x27;ve found that creating a tighter &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; helps in pulling out especially fine hairs. Obviously it&#x27;s going to hurt - you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your face - but the pain diminishes the more you use it, so just go to your happy place and stick with it. Don&#x27;t forget to pat your face, smile, and wink at yourself in the mirror when you&#x27;re done you gorgeous goddess, you!</li>
            <li> Very well made product. No more threading,waxing or trimming. Just spring it and go! Hurts a bit but then what doesn&#x27;t on face? I would say worth the pain.</li>
            <li> Wow, amazing product.  As a matter of fact, after I showed my friends, I ended up order 15 more!  It works really well after a little bit of practice.  I was raised with threading by my mom, but am too uncoordinated to do it myself!  This is much better and easier.  I just carry it around in my purse and when I am at a stop light, I can pluck away.  If you have a low tolerance for pain, you might think its painful at first attempts because there are so many hairs, but after regular use, it becomes common place...another little pain in life that is worth it!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, just love it!  After years of using those nasty-smelling hair removal creams, now I use only this R.E.M.  Sure, it can sting a tad bit....but it is a very quick and easy way to get rid of those unwanted facial hairs.  Every time I see a few, I just grab this and get to work.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Very good product, good quality materials. Once you find the way to use it, is fantastic. Forget about waxing or other stuff.</li>
            <li> I like  this spring a lot. It was easy to get the hang of using. It was so painful the first time I used it, that I had to continually give myself pep talks to continue. I tried numbing my upper lip with an ice cube to see if that would help with the pain--didn&#x27;t work. It made using the spring actually very difficult. So, learn from my mistake and don&#x27;t use an ice cube before. I had redness for about 2 hours after using the spring. So, consider that when you decide to use it. I now use it at night once ever two to three weeks. The second time was less painful than the first, which was encouraging. I have only used it twice and I am very satisfied with the results. Again though, it hurts!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tool of this kind and found over 700 reviews with over 95% raving about it.  I got the R.E.M. Spring (Spring) and learned how to use it in less than a minute.  It is FANTASTIC!!!  It paid for itself with the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to pay $32 to have my brows, upper lip and side threaded; $40 for the whole face.  While you can not do the brows with this tool, I did do the rest of my face and save $28 right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you that when I first put it on my face and twirled the Spring slowly it hurt a lot.  But I got smarter with the next move and twirled it between my fingers fast - and it hurt much less.  In less than 4 minutes I had the technique down pat and it hardly hurt at all!  Like others who have reviewed this product, I would recommend you first use it on your chin where you might not be as sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my initial threading, I used it again in a few days to pick up new hairs and it did not hurt at all since the hairs were new, short and not well rooted - no pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for a friend and another friend I told I told also bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tool, a real money saver!</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works, but will still grab tweezers. Does what it says, but is expensive($20!) so shop catalogs for a better price.</li>
            <li> doesnt work for me at least and it was pretty painful.. Waste of time &amp; money smh i do not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Can I just use one word? Ugh.  Hurts like the dickens.  Ugn, again.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for me.  I have very fine hair.  Followed instructions with a some tweaking.</li>
            <li> Works great! Faster than tweezers for those pesky facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine facial hair which makes my face look shady.I have been meaning to get the hair removed but was too scared that it would come back thicker.Anyway after doing some research I decided to go for it and got myself this spring.The first time I used it I dint take any precautions and touched my face all over coz it felt so smooth and nice.As a result I had the worst breakout of acne and pimples which took a good month to resolve.The marks are slowly disappearing.The next time I did it right.I followed one review written in the product reviews and washed my face clean and then epilated in the morning after bath.I put an ice pack after that and then I smeared my face with an antibiotic lotion and let it be that way the whole day.I dint touch it at all.I washed it before going to bed and then again applied the lotion and went to bed.I dint have any breakout after the second try.  The pain is terrible though.It hurts real bad.So I take my own sweet time while at it.I do it in patches and stop when the pain is a bit too much to bear.It IS very painful.Hence the four stars.I will try it again next week and write my second review.</li>
            <li> Great facial hair remover.  It may take some time to get used to it, but well worth it.  It is also MUCH better than the cheaper models out there.  Definitely a must if you&#x27;re menopausal :-)</li>
            <li> What a handy little thing!  It took a few minutes (not long) to figure out the right &#x27;twisting&#x27; motion, but after that....this works like a charm.  I&#x27;m not a fan of pain, and this was only &#x27;mildly&#x27; uncomfortable, if that.  Wish I would have bought one months ago.  Easy to travel with too.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The first time I used it, I missed a lot of hairs, but every time after that I got everything.  I use it every few days for about five minutes.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt much.  I wish I would have known about this product sooner!  The only reason I found it was because I was on Amazon looking at another hair removal product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this thing! My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase it a long time ago.  I&#x27;m having a problem with an excessive amount of hair growth on my chin due to changing hormones.  Tweezing was a problem because of the huge amount of hairs that needed plucking and using my Emjoi Gently gold Caress wasn&#x27;t working properly either because both methods produced major issues with ingrown hairs. The R.E.M. Spring totally removes the hairs at the root! It is definitely a little painful, especially when removing hair along the upper lip and along the sides of the mouth but thus far, no ingrown hairs! Some chin hairs are more stubborn than others but multiple passes with the spring over the course of a few days usually gets those hairs out as well.  I ordered the Hair Nix Facial Hair Growth Inhibitor weeks before ordering the R.E.M. Spring but using the two products together seems to work really well. Hairs grow at different rates of speed so the key to completely eradicating my problem will be consistency.</li>
            <li> The hard part is catching hairs that are in weird directions. I don&#x27;t need to shave again as long as I keep using this spring. Shaving has left scars on my face and this is a cheap yet effective alternative. It leaves my face smooth and soft. I love this spring and i will keep buying replacements when lost (2 so far). The spring is \\&quot;intended for women only\\&quot; but that wont stop me.</li>
            <li> I wrote this review 20 min after receiving it! It sorta hurt at first, but it hurts LESS than tweezing did! after a min or two I got use to it and I am wondering why I even bleached to begin with. The redness is already gone unlike bleaching. I am SO impressed with this. I will never have to wax or tweeze or bleach again! I am going to save so much money!</li>
            <li> Doesnt work in all areas. If you have lot of hair, may work, but if you have that one tiny strand of hair, doesnt work, Doesnt seem that it takes from cuticle. Felt like it was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how women are happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget for removing hair on the upper lip, lower lip, and chin area. It is painful but the pain can be minimized if you moisturize the skin right before. I personally use Jojoba Oil on my face as a moisturizer and find it helps prevent irritation during the hair removal process. Just be sure to wipe off any excess oil/moisture from the skin so the spring can roll easily. Also be sure to turn the handles of the spring clockwise and counterclockwise as you move the spring in an up and down motion. You will need to widen the spring and move it sideways and such to get all the hair depending on the direction of the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on other parts of my face but I found it to be too painful and not as effective. This is still a 5 star product in my book since it clears my upper lip and chin better than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It will hurt quite a bit the first time but if you keep at it every few days to keep the are free of hair, it will hurt less since you are only ripping a little bit of hair at that point verses the whole lip and chin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why everyone loves it so much. It hurts like hell!! Maybe it gets better the more you do it, but it hurts too much to get to that point! Yes, it works, if you can tolerate ripping hair out of your face.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it and followed the instructions it gave me, and although I could feel it tugging at my hairs, nothing came off. Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> I found this tool harder to use then I thought it to be after reading reviews. It does hurt the first few times the most but instill found it difficult to pull all the hairs. I also experienced a couple small breakouts after use.</li>
            <li> We all know that Michael &amp; co haven&#x27;t particularly been cranking out new material in the last decade or two; but in the good old days, artists could at least fall back on existing album sales for a decent retirement. Every once in a while, when the itch to \\&quot;live large\\&quot; needs a scratch, hey, get the band back together and hit the road for another \\&quot;greatest hits\\&quot; tour, supporting another \\&quot;greatest hits\\&quot; album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, all was fine and good until digital media upset the Apple cart. Now with the kids sharing their Bit-Torrent files across the web in their iTunes programs, nobody&#x27;s selling units anymore. And every pimply teen with an iPad has every greatest hits compilation you could ever make. Now the only time the gravy train rolls into the station for elderly and burned out artists is a new tour. Watching these codgers drag themselves across the stage at your local highly-flammible nightclub borders on the inhumane. Instead of treasuring the music of your childhood, now you have to see it fumbled out from the arthritic fingers of your idols of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all to give a little background to the sad story of REM and their latest merchandising play. While branching out like this is an ingenious way to avoid leaving the house (getting prescription refills for your hypertension and high cholesterol is such a pain on tour! And forget about dealing with the insurance coverage), I have to say that branding a nose hair remover with the previously solid \\&quot;Alternative\\&quot; brand of REM might have been a mis-step. I am sure that the band members love the product (when you get old, hair comes out of your nose, ears and other unexpected holes) but maybe they could have held out for a classier product- I mean, even that rapist Vince guy has the Slap Chop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sure the REM Nose Hair Pulling Spring is great; but don&#x27;t expect it to bring you back to the magic teen years like listening to \\&quot;Document\\&quot; does.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with trying to eliminate facial hair, as I cannot stand to discover that I missed a dark, coarse one after I come home and know that I was out and about like that!  I am a fanatic about it. In fact, when I was hospitalized with a serious illness, I was driven mad with worry that I was sprouting it like wild weeds or something hahaha.  As sick as I was, that was still worrying the heck out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this device has freed up chunks of time from my grooming routine. It&#x27;s so quick and so efficient. Over the upper lip does hurt a bit, but I suppose I am desensitized to the pain due to all the years of plucking the suckers out. My daughter found it quite painful, but I barely bat an eye -- so the pain level is an individual thing that can vary greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain aside, I don&#x27;t see how anyone could argue against the fact that the thing really works. I consider my  fifteen bucks well spent.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my friend for her birthday and she like it but she said it hurts when it goes ups and down.</li>
            <li> this thing is a waste of money. it only catches very long hair. it doesnt catch all of them. and you really have to work it to pull it out. it would be faster and less painful to pull them out one by one with tweezers!</li>
            <li> Works really well at removing hair from the roots.  It just hurts a bit but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Wish I had this years earlier!!!</li>
            <li> I love this tool!  I have been waxing for years and this is so much better and portable to boot. I didn&#x27;t have any bumps - just a bit of redness. For people that have issues with bumps I would recommend steaming your face first and using a very small amount of jasmine oil.</li>
            <li> Works and it hurts, so be prepared and have some wine before you start!</li>
            <li> I returned this item.  No matter how hard i tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it to remove anything from my face.  Maybe it&#x27;s me, but what good is it if it&#x27;s not going to work for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter because I think this is the best way to remove facial hair. Yes, the first time you use it, it hurts. You&#x27;re pulling hair out by the roots. But after that first initial hair removal, use every other day and you&#x27;re good to go. Shaving and cream removers leave a shadow, with this method there is no shadow. Also, you&#x27;re not risking chemical burn.</li>
            <li> I have been using the REM for a month and so far I like it. It is supposed to be used on the face only. The hair comes back every two weeks so far but I&#x27;m sure that with continuance usage, the time in between will lessen. If you&#x27;re wondering how painful it is, I would give it a five. I use it mainly on the upper lip and the chin areas. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my upper lip area. I usually use tweeze it or I get it waxed. I thought this would be easier and i wanted to give it a shot. I read all the reviews about it being painful. But i didn&#x27;t think it would be that sinful because i tweeze and wax. i didn&#x27;t think it could be worse than tweezing. Oh well... i was wrong. it&#x27;s extremely painful. worse than tweezing combined with waxing.  i normally can tolerate pain but i couldn&#x27;t tolerate this. I gave it a 3 star because it was shipped fast and the product was same as the description</li>
            <li> I actually kinda love this product! I mean, it hurts like hell, but the results, uncomparable! Wish I would have purchased a more cheaper one, but non the less, I am SATISFIED. Any tips on how to not make it hurt as much?? LOL &lt;3</li>
            <li> So excited to have a product that works great at removing the fine upper lip hair that I have had trouble waxing. A little tricky at first to figure out the proper technique but once you get the hang of it you will have a silky smooth face. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this thing more than anything in the world. I had been ripping off my skin with wax for YEARS... SO GLAD I FOUND THIS. I bought one for my sisters, and my mom. They love it too! Not that tricky to use, and you can use it however often you deem necessary!  Seriously my favorite purchase ever.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product! Does remove hair but peach fuzz and fine light hairs will grow back as very thick hair so when you could hardly see the hair before, you are stuck with a man&#x60;s beard after. Do not recommend at all!</li>
            <li> This thing is da bomb!  I don&#x27;t know why everyone seems to be having such a hard time figuring out how to use it with the instructions it comes with.  I read the instructions and immediately ripped out my mustache.  Read the instructions people!  Anyway, this is pretty much the same as plucking only with less effort because it gets them all with a twist of the spring.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail and used it today. AH-FREAKIN-MAZING! Seriously. I&#x27;m tempted to buy 5 more just in case I lose it and they stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m part Italian, but instead of having skin that tans easily in the summer, I was blessed with hair... lots and lots of hair. I mean, hair on my legs, hair on my stomach, hair on my arms and yes, hair on my face. I&#x27;ve tried bleaching, shaving, tweezing, waxing and asking nicely for the hair to depart from my upper lip, but alas, I remained unsatisfied. So needless to say, when I learned about this spring thing I was kind of excited. I read all of the reviews and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely hurts, I mean, obviously- you&#x27;re pulling hair out of your face. For me, it didn&#x27;t hurt so much on my chin, but the upper lip and the sides/cheeks are a bit rough at the start. But I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, especially if it promises a smoother upper lip. The pain doesn&#x27;t last long though. And I don&#x27;t know the whole science behind it but after you do it a few times- it doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad. Besides, it was all over in less than 5 minutes (probably more like 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started out with a pretty hairy stash (I let it go a bit knowing this thing was coming in the mail... good thing I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere, haha!) and now I&#x27;ve got nothing under the nose. I also did my chin- things are a lot better off there too. After I was done I still had a few short thick hairs left, but I&#x27;m willing to tweeze those out if this spring thing will do the rest. On that same note- there were a few stragglers after I was finished, but I just plucked those out- no big deal After all that, I started on my cheeks, but I was sort of tired by then, so I gave up. It definitely works though. And I am SO EXCITED about my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m serious people- ladies- TRY THIS! I know what it&#x27;s like- the constant battle of the man hair. It makes you feel so not feminine. So I say it again - TRY THIS THING!</li>
            <li> I may have missed it, but most reviews are from women.  As a guy, I have very thick facial hair, very dark, and densely populated.  I have a 5pm shadow by noon.  That said, a number of years ago, I had most of my facial hair lasered off with reasonable results - my skin was sensitive to shaving, which made it bothersome and results not ideal.  Except for the chin (corner of mouth to corner of mouth area), most of the hair is gone or very fine.  i.e. from 10 thick hairs per 2mm square area, to 10 fine ones per sq inch.  My chin, while some areas were light, just never really responded to the laser treatment.  So you know what I&#x27;m starting with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt....YES.  About the same as tweezing (which I hate, given the number required for visable results with the pain), but for the same amount of pain, you get many many more hairs.  The first time is a.....lets just call it an experience.  I found it hurts less in the evening....don&#x27;t know why, so one might try a different time of day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people have reasonable directions on use, and suggest reading those.  i.e. bend the thing, twirl the correct way, and move up your face.....which given which way the hair grows, you might have to change directions. If the hair is not laying in an ideal direction, it may pull the hair, but not actually remove it....basically, the pain without the result.  BTW,  I have not decided if tightening the skin surface is better or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the density of my facial hair, the spring looks like something wrapped around an axle, but pulling 20-30+ hairs at a single twist is pretty good.  I can&#x27;t do the zippy thing they show in videos and desc of twisting in and out as you move up the face.  I think in part, the hairs are thick and many of them in a small area.  Though, once thinned out, it goes much better - hairs kinda flick around btw, the spring twangs when I use it in dense areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, after some painful experimentation, I cleared a 1 in sq area in a rather dense area on the point of my chin, with some blood, as it is ripping the hairs out.  Took only a few minutes, but I had had enough for that go around....I was very pleased with the results.  When I did get around to a second round...given how I feel afterwards, I&#x27;m calling them rounds...anyway, the second round resulted in at least 66% of my chin hair being removed - say, a 4 sq inch area.  My skin is sensitive for about 24hrs after, so maybe in a week I will do round 3.  At which time I would expect to only have maint at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sides of my face, and under my chin, the hairs run in all directions, so some experimentation will be needed to work this - something to consider after my chin.  The hairs are also finer there from the laser removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair length doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  I had stubble that I could just barely tweez(one days growth), and I also let it grow out for a few days. Similar results I think, though, the longer hair does allow one to see which way the hairs are growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that do not know, hair folicals have growth period, followed by a holding period (if i remember correctly), followed by release, then a dormant period.  What this all means, is that you will see hairs grow back in an area recently mowed as the dormant folicals that missed your deforestation begin to grow again.red a 1 in sq area in a rather dense area on the point of my chin, with some blood, as it is ripping the hairs out.

            <li> I&#x27; m so glad I tried this product! It is easy to use, not messy like waxes and does the job on the lip and chin. Wish I could use on the eyebrows, but i&#x27;ll head the warning on the box about removing my eyelashes, and skip this area. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It was a toss up for me to choose 2 stars or 3 stars. The spring works, but it takes a really long time to work it, and it is awful painful. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a way that makes it any less painful. If wax didn&#x27;t burn my skin, I&#x27;d rather do that because at least it&#x27;s over quickly. Even though this hurts, I didn&#x27;t have any redness or skin irritation after using it. Bottom line is that I probably won&#x27;t keep trying to use it, but instead look for an epilator designed for the face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this at all useful.  I have been using an electric hair removal device on my face for years, and am used to the discomfort of pulling hair out by the roots.  You need to leave a wide margin near brows when using it, and I hoped the REM spring would be useful to do that area, but it just didn&#x27;t grab the hair and I tried it on all areas of my face, even on my leg, just to give it a fair chance.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool to remove facial hair. It is neat and very efficient i use it while chatting with my sister of watching Downton Abbey ! Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> I bought this but can&#x27;t stand to use it. I&#x27;ll stick to waxing my upper lip, thanks. At least waxing is quick. The Rem Spring works...it will pluck your unwanted hairs out...one.at.a.time. Slowly, agonizingly this little spring will rip those hairs from your sensitive upper lip as you twirl it between your fingers. I gave birth to 2 children without any pain medication and I can&#x27;t stand to use the Rem spring.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t come up much in conversations, but when it does I highly recommend this Spring Facial Hair Remover.  I howled when my friend used one for the first time - her facial expressions!</li>
            <li> This spring did nothing for me. It does not pull small hairs either and It was painful to use. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> At first I was iffy about buying this product, but decided to try it. I definitely made a good decision because I love it and I use it all of the time. It&#x27;s easy to use and only painful around the lip. It&#x27;s a great way to speed up the process of basic tweezers as it pulls out many hairs at a time. It&#x27;s great for touch ups or for a fast treatment. I would recommend it to anyone who has tried everything and needs a new solution for hair removal! I will definitely keep using this product for many years to come, especially since it&#x27;s of great durable quality.</li>
            <li> No more going after every little hair! I&#x27;ve got those pesky dark or stiff hairs popping up here and there on my chin and get so embarrassed.  This gadget is so simple and quick. I absolutely love it. I had one of those follicle hair electricuters and it was a pain and never worked, always left little red burn marks for the next day. This shows nothing and is so fast. You&#x27;re not killing hairs, but if I remember you only have x amount of hair that came come out of one follicle so persistence will pay off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for coarse chin hair as well as facial hair in general. It got some of the finer chin hair but definitely not the chin hair. I can&#x27;t use it on my lips, it hurts way too much.</li>
            <li> leaves more to be desired for under chin areas.  I still have to bother with tweezers afterwards.  Would like a device to fully remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> What an awesome invention.  I love it so far.  Much quicker than plucking and lasts longer than shaving. It only stings a little when using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent little tool. It takes a little getting used to but you figure it out with trial and error. By far, the best solution you can find, at any price. No wonder so many people give it great reviews!</li>
            <li> this product is nice and good . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Just received my R.E.M. this week, and already like it.  It didn&#x27;t remove my tougher chin hairs, but made up for it in getting all the rest.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  I&#x27;m anxious to see how it works over time.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It&#x27;s really easy to use and you will know if you use it correctly (when you feel the hair coming out). It does hurt, but it&#x27;s something you get used to, or you don&#x27;t. For me, it beats plucking because that is time consuming and you need a mirror. Waxing isn&#x27;t always effective for me, and shaving feels like a waste of time since my hair grows quickly.</li>
            <li> The lady in the picture is smiling as the pulls those hairs off her upper lip, but not me. I found that this worked great for my chin but my upper lip was just too sensitive! I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with break outs, which was a huge plus, but after a few days just the thought of using this on my lip made me cringe. I guess it comes down to how much pain you&#x27;re able to stand for the end result.</li>
            <li> Received in time! Unfortunately the product was not what I expected: it doesn&#x27;t work if you hold the remover on the bases. It works better if you hold it ON the spring...</li>
            <li> This facial hair remover does what it is suppose to do, is it painful yes, especially the first few time you use it, but it become less painful the longer you have it.  For the price it&#x27;s probably the best thing I have found to use to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased on of these. Works great on my mostly peach fuzz. I do however, have a warning. After several months of using this product, I started to experience pain and stiffness in the saddle joint (muscles around where the hand and thumb meet).  For a while, it only bothered me when I was driving so thought it was maybe the way I was holding the steering wheel.  Finally figured out it was the twisting motion.  Discuss this with the chiropractor and he confirmed that the twisting motion torks (muscles moving in opposite directions) the muscles of the saddle joint.  Really painful. Too painful to be adjusted.  Quit using it.  Be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I use to put Sally Hansen hair remover on my face and I am so glad I purchased this item.  With chemicals being in the hair remover, I knew over time it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to continue using it.  I was looking for an alternative and was hesitate about purchasing this item, but glad I did.  If you use it correctly you would definitely remove all of the hair.  However on occasion sometimes I notice I will have a few course stray hairs and I just use a Tweezer for those.  By then my skin is already numb.  It does hurt a bit, like getting waxed, but after awhile you get use it.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was concerned it would be extremely painful or that I wouldn&#x27;t get the hang of it. It is very easy to use and very effective.  It hurt a little bit, but not too bad, and there was no redness afterwards.  Works much better than the creams.</li>
            <li> I like the tool but the little handles would be far more comfortable if they were rubber covered.  The spring is flexible and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is a little painful at first but wouldn&#x27;t mind that so much if it pulled out the hair instead of breaking it off.</li>
            <li> This HURTS so bad.  Maybe I am a wimp but I cannot use it, complete waste of money.  I gave it two stars because it does yank hair out, so in that respect it does work I suppose, but I couldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> This is the vest little invention.  I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face red and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  I don&#x27;t usually have to bend it; if I just hold it slightly curved and turn it upward, and then come back downward, while twisting in the same direction with both hands, it does a great job.  My face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s after I was finished.  The more hair you have to remove, the more you will feel it pull and that stings a little.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to get used to.  The ends are slippery and would be better if they had a rougher surface texture.  Otherwise, it works.</li>
            <li> It just did not work.... and I tried it on many different types of hair follicles..... nothing happened.  I kinda wish I could get a rebate!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, doesn&#x27;t get under your chin very well.  Don&#x27;t throw your tweezers away. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This actually works quite well; but it does hurt. It is basically ripping the hairs out so of course it is going to be painful. I suggest watching a couple of YouTube videos to get the hang of how to use it. I find that trying to do large sections of the face works best. I hate waxing so this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li> It works great. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that much to me cuz I&#x27;m really used to the threading. It&#x27;s not as bad as the ant bite. But I still need to use a tweezer for some short hair. I wonder how I can clean it.. Cuz the hair is like stuck in the spring,,.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beyond painful to use and so hard to get the hand of it. It does pull the hair but I just prefer to thread.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is quite painful compared to threading or waxing. Could not tolerate it and returned it.</li>
            <li> Its kewl but stings.  I tried it I had to play with it until I figued it out I tried it on my mom she liked it too.  Since the price when up I ordered a different brand for 8 bucks for my mom and sis. Better than tweezing</li>
            <li> Bellabe is better.  The REM is too flimsy, in my opinion.  The concept is great though, and they really work.</li>
            <li> I have had PCOS for over 20 years and have a lot of facial hair. The REM spring does exactly what it says it will. It grabs all my thick black hairs from the root and makes my face soft as can be. This is the only thing I have ever used that works. It&#x27;s even better then laser hair removal! I am so grateful to have found this. I couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> Some things in life just need to be shared. When a product actually does what it claims, I believe it deserves a shout out. The first time I twirled this spring around on my face, it&#x27;s true...I winced more than a few times. But it just didn&#x27;t hurt enough to scare me away. A few weeks later I&#x27;m an old pro, and my face is baby smooth and hairless. I&#x27;ll never put a chemical hair removal product on my skin again.</li>
            <li> The price was right.  It is a little hard to use.  I did seem to get more breakouts when I used it.  May be that I&#x27;m not using it right???</li>
            <li> At first I wondered how this could possibly work, but I was tired of fine facial hair, and waxing is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is literally roll this along your skin (see the directions) and it pulls all the hairs out, the finest of hairs too, at the root. When it got to be a little painful in tender spots I did small areas, stopped and started alot, and altering direction as you need to go against the direction of hair growth. I like it better than waxing, or hair epilators. Yes it hurts a little, but I think not as much as other methods. Try it!</li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and unfortunately have the facial hair that goes along with it.  I had been visiting the salon every 2 weeks for the past several years just to get my moustache waxed.  And then my lip would only be hair free for about a week before I would have to try to hide it again, waiting for it to grow enough to wax.  Not only was I paying frequently for the waxing procedure itself, I live quite a ways away from the nearest salon so it got to be a lot of extra driving as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this spring, which only costs about the price of one waxing, I haven&#x27;t had my moustache waxed in several months!  I now take care of it in the privacy of my own home as frequently as I need to.  I have so much more self confidence in how I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt?  Sure, somewhat.  But then, so does waxing.  I don&#x27;t think its anymore painful than having your lip waxed.  The only benefit to waxing is someone else does it.  I think it can be a little harder to cause pain to yourself.  But, its definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> This spring actually works really well. It&#x27;s a tad bit painful but DUH, it&#x27;s ripping your HAIR OUT OF YOUR FACE! The only downside is that it does take some time to roll this thing all over your face so be prepared.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It does not hurt to use, and I am now freed from tweezers!  Try it, and you will not be disappointed--you sometimes have to go over an area more than once, but it does work, and the best part is, you can use it in the dark!</li>
            <li> i use to thread my upper lip 3 times a month going every time to parlour was time taking . then i came across these product immediately i placed an order i was really excited about these product finally today i get to try and i was amazed with the results .problem with threading was because my hair is thick  the artist use to cut my skin and now i can see some blemishing near that area.....any way i definetly recommend these product worth every penny.look beautiful and flawless</li>
            <li> Been looking for a facial hair remover for some time now.  I would say the REM does work, however it is a bit painful when you first start using it!</li>
            <li> Great product for removing fine facial hair.  For me, no skin irritation.  So far, it&#x27;s the only facial hair removal product that works.  Cream hair removals are irritating, not this.</li>
            <li> I hated the hairy signs of post menopause and of course it happens at the same time that your magnifying mirror isn&#x27;t magnifying enough!  Read the other reviews and figured the only thing I had to lose was the joy of sitting around with a Santa Claus beard of hair remover.  This is a fantastic product that works!  Use it frequently and it may sting a little but that is just a reminder that it is working. Love it and will save money on the creams that I won&#x27;t be buying!</li>
            <li> I was willing to take a chance on this product,  I&#x27;m glad that I did.  I had to kind of play around with the bending of the tool, then I got the hang of it and it works really well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt!  It does get all the little white, peach-fuzz hairs off your face and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m presentable again.  I still have to pluck the little black hairs, but it is MUCH MUCH less expensive than laser fees.  Recommend this product for sure.  I did have to play with the arch of the spring to get the best use - just use patience to figure out your best angle.</li>
            <li> I find threading to hurt my fingers. The ridiculous plastic contraption that is sold here to help with that, seems cumbersome.  This tool is perfect.  I have bleached, but it&#x27;s time consuming.  Waxing is always still an option, but also time consuming. This little spring coil is quick. Works great and feels like good quality.  Not some cheap plastic gimmick that will fall apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just not doing it correctly or what, but this thing doesn&#x27;t work for me. It pulls the hair, but doesn&#x27;t pull it out.  I&#x27;ve watched the video review, I&#x27;ve talked with friends who use it (and love it) and as far as I can tell I&#x27;m using the correct technique but it just doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> It hurts but works. Read the directions to work it.  Pulls out many fine hairs but not course hairs. Ouch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it indeed gets the job done. Ofcourse there is a little pain to bear.. but its worth it for the results. Its quick &amp; easy, mess free. My facial hair is very light and thin. That could be why I find my results to be better.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly to remove hair around my lips. I have light hair that you can only see up close, but I still prefer to get rid of it so that makeup goes on easier and my face feels smoother. This tool makes hair removal very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I would get rid of the hair by threading. This is much faster than threading for me and event slightly less painful. There is still pain however--you&#x27;re pulling hairs off your face! I am impressed by how effective it is. It gets a very good grip on the hairs and can pull a lot out at once.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave feedback unless I&#x27;m dissatisfied but I felt compelled to tell about how great this product is. I have been seeing this \\&quot;spring\\&quot; thingy for awhile and had it in my cart but couldn&#x27;t bring my self to spend $20 to get it. But it is the best $20 I have ever spent. Before I received the REM Spring I threaded my upper lip and thought that I had removed all of the hairs but apparently not. This thing found so many small fine hairs, as well as some larger ones that I missed. I read all of the bad reviews and saw where people said this doesn&#x27;t work but they were wrong. This thing is awesome! I really like that this is made of stainless steel and I like the handles and how they are shaped. They roll in between your fingers very easy. I never realized how much hair I had on my face until I received this thing! I love it! Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> One of the many products I&#x27;ve tried, this one by far is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Fast, efficient it does what it says it does, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews on Amazon for tips on using. It works really well. I have sensitive skin so the first time did hurt (like waxing or threading does), but after the first time it didn&#x27;t hurt so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!!! I want to buy one for all my family members!</li>
            <li> I found that it wasn&#x27;t really as painful as people had made it out to be- it may take a little bit of getting used to but it was quite alright after a while! It is true that it is a bit hard to control exactly which hairs you want to pluck, but overall if you just want to get rid of hair above the lip it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have been using a facial cream hair removal product and it was tiresome to use as well as time consuming. This product is fast and quick. I can&#x27;t see waxing or using any other hair removal product again. This product is perfect. It does take some practice, but once I got the hang of it, I was good. If you are frustrated with the traditional facial hair removal products as I was, you will be very happy to find this simple effective tool. There is also a very brave woman who did a &#x27;how to&amp;#34; video on Amazon comments. She really is a delight and shows you how to use this tool. Not only is she extremely helpful, but you will get a belly laugh just watching her video!</li>
            <li> Cheapest and most efficient way of removing hair without any side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;Bit painful initially. But no gain without pain! lol</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever attempted to tweeze hair around your mouth and chin, then you know exactly what this contraption feels like.  At first, until you get the hang of it, you will likely tell yourself that it&#x27;s just too painful and decide to never use it again.  But then you might reconsider because you don&#x27;t want to be a wimp or because you don&#x27;t want to throw your money down the drain.  We are not quite out of the throws of the recession and unemployment rates are still high, the cost of things is higher still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying, I recommend watching a few YouTube testimonials and the review from Becky Gardens.  She is honest and shows the correct way to maneuver the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezing my brows is nothing because I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.  I remember though, how painful it was at first.  Over time, it will become less so.  I think in about a month with regular use, this will not hurt and be only discomfort.  In about 2 months, I&#x27;ll probably be down to no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never tried using baby orajel or the like myself, but I read this years ago that it would help those starting out with tweezing hair removal methods.  I think it would probably work in this instance as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this on the hair around my mouth was quick and easy.  I&#x27;m still working on the chin hairs, as it requires trying different positions to get those hairs if you have many and not just 1 0r 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend not trying to remove it all at once.  Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day and you&#x27;ll likely be more successful taking your time by spreading it out, a little every day or every other day.  Once you get the hang of it (took me 20 minutes), as painful as it is, you may be tempted to finish the job.  I say resist the urge if you can because if you overdo it, you may never pick up the device again, whereas if you do it little by little, you will love the results so much you&#x27;ll stick with it and with each session, the sensation of pain really does go away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend keeping up with it, doing maintenance while the hairs are very short and barely visible.  The longer the hair, the more pain.</li>
            <li> Great hair removal tool.</li>
            <li> This is not very realistic to use if you don&#x27;t have the time and patience. As I should have expected, it just rips out the hair. Waxing or electrolysis would be a better investment.</li>
            <li> Just received my R.E.M. spring. Within 5 minutes my upper lips was hair free - 3 of those minutes were trying to get the hang of it. Once you do, it is very easy. I bought some numbing solution just in case it hurt badly, but it really does not hurt any worse than waxing or threading. I honestly do not know how or why I have lived this long without one. Worth every penny (an will now save me $$ as I do not have to pay to get it removed!) The only thing now is to wait and see if I have any breakouts, which I tend to with waxing but not threading. If I do I will update, if not, you know I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  it takes a little getting used to in order to get the cirrect motion down, but once you do it&#x27;s easy.  sometimes it hurts a bit on the over the lip area, but most times its just an odd tingling feeling (not pleasant but not too umpleasant either).  you have to take your time and i rdcommend using it often, but it&#x27;s worth it.  no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, prickly feel, stray hairs that only seem to show when you&#x27;re in the car.</li>
            <li> it hurts, so you need a big pain threshold, but it works pretty well.  not good for someone who has a lot of hair on their face.</li>
            <li> I rarely give any product just one star.  But I really hated this one.  I did get the hang of it by reading another customer review.  But even doing it correctly, it doesn&#x27;t get enough hair out per pass and it really hurts.  The pain would be worth it if it was quick but going over a spot several times is just not tolerable.  I&#x27;ll stick to waxing.</li>
            <li> Amazing hair remover. Its a little tricky at first to use. It took me a while to figure it out. But when you do figure it out it is a time saver. You get multiple hairs at once rather than one or two while plucking. Its painful at first but you build up a tolerance for the pain over time.</li>
            <li> Does the hair grow back thicker if I use this????</li>
            <li> Catches all the fine hairs, and after you let some of the coarse ones grow in longer, you can snag them up rather easily.  Only thing is that you can&#x27;t get the really short hairs, but it&#x27;s a lot better than tweezing.</li>
            <li> I have waxed;  I have shaved; I have tweezed;  I have threaded; i have used creams.  It works very good,  YES IT HURTS!!!!  I does not cause and irritation to my skin.  No bleeding or redness.  It did make my skin break out where i used it though, which i find quite odd.  But it works!!! I am hoping to by another one to keep in my car just in case.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered this a year ago when I first saw it while researching NoNo! (glad I didn&#x27;t buy that product). This does take a few tries to really figure out how to get it to work, but boy does it! I have very fair sensitive skin that even gentle waxes would make me break out, no to mention the monthly cost and I would still have about a week of bad growth before I would be able to make it back to the salon. I love this, so much easier than tweezing. As other reviewers have said you can do this while watching tv! It hurts a little, but no more than waxing or tweezing. I would definitely recomend this.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things to get rid of facial hair...  Electrolysis,waxing,laser etc. Electrolysis is expensive and time consuming.  Laser leaves all the fine hairs to shine in the sun.waxing takes off a few layers of my skin,leaving me with open wounds,enough said about that. So I thought I would try this. Worked like a dream. Who would have thought that a spring could be so useful.Now no trouble with the fine fuzzies. Makeup looks great and I feel confident. So try it out and enjoy.Not painless but pretty close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and I use this to remove the little hair on my ears! It&#x27;s easy to use, not painful and very effective!</li>
            <li> Very good. Initially took some time to figure out how to use it. Roll slowly against the hair growth. But not sure about long term effect. Will update...</li>
            <li> Bought this over a year ago, tried it then put it aside. Just came across this page again and thought, don&#x27;t I have that? Yes. Tried it again and realized that yes this thing really does work, especially on coarse hairs. You can tell by stretching it out after use -- all the hairs get stuck in there. The one downside is that you have to wait until each hair grows out a bit before the coils can grab it. Sometimes I want to get it out before it comes out, but you can&#x27;t do that because that&#x27;s how marks can form. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something scientific, but it seems like direct tweezing causes hairs to grow back faster stronger and thicker. If you&#x27;re tired of tweezers, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> The primary reason I purchased this item is because at my age (75), it&#x27;s not that easy to focus and aim directly at a single stiff chin hair with a tweezer.  Since the R.E.M. covers a wide area, I figured it would capture many in one swoop.  However -- this product really requires steady hands, great coordination and the ability to apply pressure all simultaneously. So, keep that in mind.  If you have problems with dexterity, this may not work well for you.</li>
            <li> It certainly works to rip out your facial hair without chemicals, but it is painful and does take a lot of coordination, what with the twirling and moving.  Some people said it gets easier to rip outyour facial hair, but it still hurts me and I dread pulling it out of the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and not cleared all of the hairs yet from my upper lip, but with more practice I&#x27;m sure I will do a better job. Some reviews made it seem tricky to use, but the instructions in the box seemed clear enough and it&#x27;s just down to getting used to using it, finding your technique. It does hurt a little, of course, but then you get used to the pain and it only lasts a couple of seconds. I think this is a really good product and I like it&#x27;s plucking method better than any other hair removing or bleaching methods for my face.</li>
            <li> This little thing is a MIRACLE!  I wish I had this years ago! So easy, so incredibly effective. I used to pay a lady $70 to thread my face every 2 weeks. Now I do it myself while sitting on my couch watching movies.  So awesome. Buy this TODAY.</li>
            <li> Amazing, but huts bad at first</li>
            <li> Yes the first time hurt like hell. I fell in love and will not turn back! The second time is virtually painless. Suck it up the first time and you too will fall in love with this little darling. One word of advice: it is extremely easy to lose so be careful where you put it. It rolls around. Learn to twist the spring and from then on just be amazed.</li>
            <li> This low-tech device changed my life! No more struggles with wax, depilatories, etc., which were very hard on my delicate skin.  I use this daily and it keeps mustache hair at bay. The more you use it the better you get at it. Also with frequency there is ltitle to no pain because there isn&#x27;t as much hair there. The first time I used it was the most painful but after that there is minimal pain as long as I keep it up (and I do). A consistently clean upper lip for the first time in my life makes this one of my best purchases of all time.</li>
            <li> Great tool and it works. I use it when I read a book or watch television. It is really easy to learn and to handle and so much better (and cheaper) than waxing and threading.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial epilator I have ever used. The pain is minimal and it removes hair easily, and the price is extremely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, there is one flaw; I cannot recommend its use on assigned-male-at-birth trans people. It only seems to be good for fine hairs, not the thicker, coarser, terminal hairs of a beard, as a trans female friend and I discovered while experimenting with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled, it just gets caught and tugs the skin painfully. Unless your beard hair is naturally very fine, I would not bother with this if you are trans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that particular flaw, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Ok. Wow.  I just received this item for $19.95 and no shipping fees.  Used it for the first time and it removed the hair from my upper lip in a brief period of &amp;#34;tweaky-ouchy&amp;#34; encounter. The spring remover did a fine job. I would normally drive 12 minutes each way, pay 50 cents to a meter, a six dollar waxing fee and two dollar tip for the removal of the same hair. So basically after using this 2.5 times I&#x27;m in the plus plus column.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> It effectively does the job and can cover large areas while doing so.  A few minutes every day and your excess hair is gone.  After a little practice, you don&#x27;t even need a mirror, so you can use it while watching TV..</li>
            <li> Removes hairs fast! Much better than plucking them out one by one with a tweezer, but you will still need a tweezer for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this item from the beginning, but purchased it because I was too lazy to go to a salon..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that it&#x27;s here, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Not only is this device so simple, it works remarkably! I had quite a bit of hair on my face and this just ripped it all out! This will save you that large sum of money you&#x27;d spend at the salon!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!  As soon as it arrived I took it out of the box and gave it a try.  It works really well and the results are amazing.  I used to pluck, pluck, pluck out every individual hair, taking up so much time every day.  Now I just roll this over my chin and it picks up loads of hairs at a time.  For me it doesn&#x27;t hurt (maybe as I was used to the plucking), I just roll it in various directions to make sure I get all the unwanted hair out.  I have had no rash or soreness after using it.  I would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Like my title says, this product works.  It&#x27;s basically a do-it-yourself threading kit. I&#x27;ve never had my eyebrows threaded, so I&#x27;m not going near them, but I have used this on my sideburns and upper lip. It is about the same level of pain as threading, but much faster.  A normal threading session at the salon would take about 15 minutes to get all my hair removed.  Using this product, I was done in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it, at first I coiled it up tight and then \\&quot;let go\\&quot; so it could capture the hair.  Once I realized that I just had to spin it with each hand going a different a direction, I started doing it that way. It&#x27;s very, very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually rush to write a review on this site, but for a product that makes me happy (threading cost me $20/visit, this thing cost about $15 and I can use it over and over), I will jump on amazon and write a good review as soon as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would suggest to the new user - get your facial hair threaded once and watch what the technician does.  It will make using this product simple.</li>
            <li> This simple device, no batteries, no plugging in... It&#x27;s amazing! I actually bought this a year ago and just never decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I thought, oh I&#x27;ll just tweeze those stray dark hairs away. Well those few hairs seemed to be more and more often so I started looking into that&lt;br /&gt;No No Pro thing.... very expensive and didn&#x27;t sound like something I&#x27;d like to use. Then I remembered the R.E.M. facial hair thing that I had.&lt;br /&gt;I found it again and spent just a couple of minutes working on how to use it. Voila! It worked terrifically! Fast and efficient! Didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;really hurt any more than tweezing!  I love it!</li>
            <li> The only things I&#x27;ve ever waxed were my eyebrows and bikini line--and those were only once each.  And they hurt like hell. After spotting numerous black hairs on my face (of mostly blonde hair) in my late-20s, I got tired of randomly plucking and said \\&quot;to hell with it\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ll break it down in points, because, well, my thoughts happen like this in my head, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Does it hurt? Given that my waxing experiences are pretty much non-existent, I&#x27;ll make this simple. YES!  You can&#x27;t rip hair out from the roots (especially fine hair on sensitive areas of the face) without pain.  Now, if you&#x27;ve waxed before, and more than my meager attempts, it may not be so bad.  Do you get used to it?  Yes, but it takes time.  The upper lip was far more painful.  Chin and forehead, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Where can I use it? I did use it around my eyebrows, but not on the brow itself.  The middle area where people tend to get unibrows was an easy area to clean up.  It can be used anywhere on the face, but won&#x27;t pick up extremely fine baby hairs, as many have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Breaking out.  You are rubbing a metal surface on your face, it will pick up oil and dirt from other areas, so you may be more prone to breaking out.  To avoid this, wash the face before or after, and also use a cotton ball of rubbing alcohol on the spring after (or something to clean it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Ease of use.  It takes 30 seconds to get use to it.  You don&#x27;t have to bend it, it just makes it easier for certain areas as there is less surface area.  Roll your fingers in the same direction.  If it hurts and you want to chicken out before ripping your hairs out, roll them in the opposite direction (for example, if turning away from your face pulls, turn toward your face to release).  Pull your skin taut to prevent excessive tugging on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  After effects?  I only started using it, so I&#x27;ll let you know, but I expect the hair will stay gone for days-weeks and will return asit always does. *sigh*  I also expect it may eventually come in finer over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that this little bugger is a good investment if you can deal with a little pain for she sake of beauty/vanity.</li>
            <li> If you give this product some practice it really works.  Very good on fine hair is does not always completely remove the more course hair but does pull it out enough that the tweezers easily finish the task.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months back. I had no trouble learning to use it. I used to go and get threaded but this is a great alternative. I hate going to have this done at a threading salon. I am so happy to have something that can be used in the privacy of my bathroom. Highly recommended for face with the exception of eyebrows. I was afraid of taking off half an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> This product worked as advertised, and I expected the discomfort with the initial hair removal.  The problem was in the days afterwards, when I developed bumps and whiteheads in the areas this product had been used.</li>
            <li> This device is a godsend! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a teenager with very pale skin, and if I don&#x27;t pluck the coarse dark hair above my upper lip, it becomes a fairly noticeable mustache. I have spent many a night tweezing that hair for a good 1-2 hours, globbing on morturizer to help ease the pain, and after a year of doing this nonsense, I decided to finally try out this so-called \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; hair remover...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you...IT IS AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will hurt like hell at first (especially if you&#x27;re not used to tweezing), but it gets the job done WAY more efficiently and effectively than plucking individual hairs. If you use the spring every few days, it gets much easier and less painful. So far I&#x27;ve used it on my upper lip, cheeks, and even on my toes! I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(HELPFUL TIP BEFORE USING: Read some of the top reviews here for proper usage, because the instructions on the packaging are quite vague. Just experiment for a few minutes, moving against the grain in the U-shape, and don&#x27;t give up, &#x27;cause it works wonders!)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this device,the price really sold me, but I rolled it all over my face, and each time it only snatched out 1 or 2 hairs. Just brought it tried over and over again and still nothing, it&#x27;s a piece of garbage don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I have lot of facial hair especially the moustache :( as I have dark hairs this is clearly visible. I used to go for threading every other week which costs a lot! REM Spring really helps remove the hair with less pain. Its just a twitch which is bearable :) For anyone who is struggling to get a hang of how to use it, watch this video: [...]</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these one for my friend and one for me, she saw them on tv at first it was her who asked me to order it for her, i didnt want it, but after thining about my peach fuzz (even though i dont have much) i still need this... shaving grows the hair after few days but this one doesnt~ I lvoe it evne though it hurts XD</li>
            <li> I am WOWED by this thing. I have struggled with a lot of fine, pale facial hair for awhile. Very  embarrassing tho u could only see it in bright light (I hope). Waxing helped but hairs grow out at different rates so in between I still walked around hairy sometimes.  Products like Nair dried my skin, didn&#x27;t get all the hairs and the results didn&#x27;t last long. It bugged me every single day and I was tempted but terrified to start to shave. Thought about laser hair removal but that only works on dark hair and most of this hair is very pale.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is quick and effective. You could use it every day if you had to. As others have said, it  takes a minute to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s simple enough. Stings a little for a split second but I&#x27;ve caused myself more discomfort trying to get \\&quot;that last little hair\\&quot; with tweezers, along with an infected hair follicle. Besides tweezers take forever and you never come close to getting it all.&lt;br /&gt;If I were stranded on a desert island this is one beauty item I would want to have if I had to pick only one.&lt;br /&gt;This little gadget is a God-send. Wish I would have found it years ago. I tweezed and fretted for a very long time. No more embarrassing facial hair. YAAAAY!!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best home care hair remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands on amazon and trust me they&#x27;re not worth what you pay for.  This grabs onto all my hair (no matter the length), and pulls it out easily.  It&#x27;s also very easy to use.  Once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature and you don&#x27;t even need a mirror, to help you see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> It does the job but takes time to figure out how it works, it would help to have better instructions. Saved many trips to threading place.</li>
            <li> It is the best invention for facial hair remover. It thins out your hairs and eventually grows back slower. I would recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing or using creams for a long time and this is by far the best facial hair remover I&#x27;ve every used. It&#x27;s true that some of the coarser hairs won&#x27;t come out, but I don&#x27;t mind tweezing a couple of hairs and it beats how dry my skin was getting from the creams and wax. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Either I don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;right touch&amp;#34; or this thing is useless. Complete waste of money. I wish I hadn&#x27;t fallen for the hype.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to use the crazy thing. It looks easy enough but no hair comes off for me.</li>
            <li> Truly this product works as expected. No problem on delivery and package. I was happy with it. Can&#x27;t say I have used it as much as I would like, but it is a good buy if looking for another alternative to hair removal.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good solution to unwanted facial hair.  I watched a YouTube video how to use and it&#x27;s easy.  It&#x27;s not really painful, but irritating and if you have a lot of peach fuzz, it&#x27;s hard to get it all at one time.  It&#x27;s a so-so remedy, still looking for the something better.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake recently of looking in a magnifying mirror at a local store - is that stubble on my chin?  Fuzz on my cheeks?  I bought the mirror, so I would not forget, and started researching hair removal options.  I had been tweezing and shaving, but that was starting to take all day, and the shaved hairs grew back so quickly.  After looking at more expensive electric versions, based on reviews, i decided to give this item a try.  I did consider going to my local hardware store and buying a spring to make my own, but glad i took the plunge and bought the REM.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  it works and i had no problem getting the hang of using it;  my skin feels great&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  it can be painful, esp on the upper lip, but it beats one by one tweezing;  and it is a bit difficult to get the under chin hairs, just based on the jaw angles</li>
            <li> I bought the R.E.M. Spring for my 90 yr old mother. Her vision is compromised but she was still aggravated by the facial hairs that grew along her jaw line.  She likes the Spring because she does not need to see in a mirror to use it, and it&#x27;s simple to use. However, she says there is an undeniable &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; factor and the face does sting considerably longer than the enclosed literature suggests.  But her smooth, hairless face from the use of the R.E.M. Spring is worth it.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as the same concept as threading but was able to do this myself at home. It was easy to do once you get the hang of it. There are even videos you can search for on the internet if you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it works but more painful than expected. After a few sessions. I ended up doing a little icing of my face prior. This was so I could do it thoroughly and in one setting. However, It was not unbearable without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said I have discontinued using this because after my fifth time using it resulted in little pimple-like infected hair spots where I had yanked the hairs out. I do have sensitive skin and I am acne prone so you may have no difficulty with this. I did try and use my sensitive face toner after use of spring , but it did not help.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is quicker and more efficient then tweezers. People who think this is too painful, have never had waxing IMHO. Yes, this was uncomfortable at first, but I was also removing quite a bit of peach fuzz from a large area. Now that the initial treatment is over I can see each subsequent use becoming easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to other ladies in my life!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  It takes a bit to figure out, but once you get the hang of it you can get a very clean look pretty fast--and it actually wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected.  I think the key to minimizing the pain is keeping your motions small and controlled, especially when you&#x27;re first starting.  Don&#x27;t get impatient and start making fast long twists...you&#x27;ll hit the sweet spot unexpectedly and regret it, lol.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that this worked. It pulls out the hairs well with a minimum of pain and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. Had such high hopes for this product.  It&#x27;s very hard to use. Maybe thats why I wasn&#x27;t thrilled. Oh and it  removed only a few hairs. For the same pain but MUCH better finish I got the Emjoi EpiSlim. Needs batteries.  Has a motor so there is a lil noise, if u are concerned about privacy. BUT its WORKS like a dream. And its about the same price as this R.E.M. Springy thingy.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a cheap brand. The cheap brand was worthless... This at least gets a lot of the hair, but it does seem to work better for the fine baby hairs and not quite as a good for the course ones. Oh did I mention ouch! Tolerable but if you have a LOT of baby hairs... Ouch!</li>
            <li> The instructions is not clear on how to use it and how to clean it; it&#x27;s more or less figure it out yourself. I agree with the others just play around with it and you&#x27;ll eventually know how to twist it, move it and turn it around. The tool does rip &amp; pull facial hair, but sometimes it breaks the hair and not pull it out completely from it&#x27;s root. You can tell when it&#x27;s taking the complete hair out by feeling it, and also seeing the white tip at the end of the hair. I do use it as it&#x27;s faster than tweezers, and it targets facial hair that you can&#x27;t see. For the hairs that is still visible and left on my face after using the REM, I just grab my tweezers and do a quick clean up, so that my face can be completely smooth and clear of unwanted facial hair. I don&#x27;t regret buying this tool, but I personally believe that with the help of my tweezers it completes the job. The only difference with my tweezers and REM it pulls out more hair at one time, so I see it more of a convenience of saving time. I would have given this tool a 5 star if it 100% always pulled my facial hair by it&#x27;s root. To clean the tool I use a dry white face cloth because I like to see the results.</li>
            <li> The product is great for the price but takes long time and also it pains while using it.so if you have patience its a good product. It tweeds the hair well..</li>
            <li> Holy Mother it hurts! You get used to it? Seriously??? I&#x27;m not really sure if it pulls(rips) out the hair or breaks them off.I will say it works, but I have to bite a bullet to use it!</li>
            <li> works great! I like that I can do it while watching Tv on my me day! Been looking for something that works well for fine facial hairs.</li>
            <li> holy cow, this thing really works. i will be honest it stings a bit more than expected. i pluck my eyebrows all the time so i was like, big deal. but, this does have a little bite to it, but OMG it works well.</li>
            <li> it does hurt cuz your pulling out your hair, but it works too...good price for this item since its only a spring</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It&#x27;s not difficult to get the hang of it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing. I used it a couple months ago &amp; I just noticed the other day that the &amp;#34;facial fuzz&amp;#34; is coming back so I used the R.E.M. again last night &amp; the hair is gone again. I didn&#x27;t even use a mirror - just did it while watching t.v. I can&#x27;t see why anyone would be disappointed with the results. Try this product first before spending any money on expensive hair removal methods!</li>
            <li> Yes, it will likely take you some time to get the hang of using this, but it&#x27;s worth that time. Although it tends to leave behind finer hairs, the R.E.M. spring is great for pesky areas like the chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Conceptually, you should expect pain. You are ripping hair out of your face. This does the trick - fast! It&#x27;s a very affordable little tool, and comes with a little sleeve. I saw a lot of reviews that it was hard to figure out how to use, as far as twisting technique and bending. I found it pretty intuitive just through trial and error. You&#x27;ll know the difference between when it&#x27;s working, and when it&#x27;s not. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> For the price I guess it&#x27;s alright, my only complaint is that most of the time it wouldn&#x27;t pull the hairs out by the roots.  I don&#x27;t use it anymore, I just stick with waxing.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I was not exactly sure how to make it work, but my sister had one and demonstrated exactly how to make it work. If there is a You Tube demo of it, I would highly recommend seeing how it works before you ever get discouraged about how to use it. It does the job!</li>
            <li> It really works well and is really easy to use.  What I like about it is the control that you have, especially in sensitive area. You can&#x27;t beat it for removing ear hairs.  Other touchup is great too.  It is better than the battery-operated facial epilators, because those tend to cut the hair and aren&#x27;t strong enough to pull most hair out.  This R.E.M. spring, however, does not cut hair and it does a nice job (almost perfect) of pulling out hairs.  A nice find.</li>
            <li> Some people complain that it doesn&#x27;t work, but you just need to figure out the right moves. I had the same problem, but now I can use it without any problems. It hurts quite a bit the first times, but it gets better the more you use it. I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s a must-have.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I have coarse chin hair and it did not work for me and I found it would pinch my skin.  It would also break off the hair instead of pulling it out thus causing ingrown hair.  I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esther</li>
            <li> The only hairs this got were the near invisible peach fuzz around my face and neck- unfortunately for me I get embarrassing dark course hairs around my neck and jawline. I was hoping this would work but it&#x27;s just another gadget at the bottom of the drawer. I even tried to see if I was doing it wrong and tried it on my husbands arm hair and nothing came out.</li>
            <li> This works well to remove hair. Good alternative to threading and much cheaper on Amazon than other websites. I highly recommend, and bought this as gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> OK, first thought upon using this--they should use it to extract info from unsavory characters!! It does sting but you get used to it. Second thought--who knew I had so much peach-fuzzy facial hair? I&#x27;m slightly embarassed! The best thing about this contraption is that IT WORKS! That&#x27;s all there is to it. Glad I got it although I don&#x27;t smile when using it like the lady in the picture!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product but wow it works great and it wasn&#x27;t hard to use like some others have said. Very easy to use and effective. No more long white hairs on my face!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this. It does the job really well for my upper lip. I still don&#x27;t have the guts to use it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving, I bought this because the girl was smiling as she did it. It is false advertising. I would like to see other people sending in pictures of themselves doing this and smiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the product works. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the manual, there is a good comment in there \\&quot;Don&#x27;t share\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this product only a month ago (it seems like so much longer because I have grown to love and rely on it so much!) and it has really changed my life! That may sound silly or like an exaggeration but as a fair skinned young woman who has always had dark hair above my lip I have felt the pain and embarrassment of having facial hair as a female.  I have been on my way to class or work or a date even in my car, looked up in the mirror and with the sunlight seen all of the hairs I missed plucking my upper lip. This product has completely changed that! I have some dark hairs and also a lot of peach fuzz usually as my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; and this completely takes care of that in an instant! You don&#x27;t need a mirror and once you get the hang of it you can do it so fast and in any position- I usually do it in bed every night before going to sleep as my hair grows pretty fast and this deals with them quick.  I have been tweezing the upper lip area for maybe 5-6 years (I am 21 now) and my upper lip area is so used to the hair tugging so I feel virtually no pain using this product.  I have used it on my whole face (which I also love to get an extra smooth face as it greatly reduces my peace fuzz) and the only spots that truly hurt me are my chin area directly under my lower lip and my sideburn-ish area near my ears (the peach fuzz is extra dense there so I think that makes it hurt more).  I never have to worry about my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or missed hairs or people noticing the dark hairs and peach fuzz in good lighting and now I am so much more confident. I wish I had this in my teenage years as it would have saved me a lot of heartbreaking embarrassment that facial hair gave me.  I can&#x27;t wait to use this product and I actually got a little addicted to the smooth feeling.  I definitely recommend it, I hope this type of product is on the market for the longterm because it is incredible and I know I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> i am typical south indian girl with thick facial hair.... i was scared of all types of facial hair removal methods because it might make them even thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i saw the reviews in amazon n tot i would give a chance. When the product arrived i was scared to try this as its with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at last 1 night i tried it. first it was painful and could not do it properly but with in 10 minutes u will learn it yourself and also u will get numb to the pain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally i removed all the hair from my face.. it removed most of it and remaining i tweezed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i completely recommend this product to all the girl like me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now i feel more girly.... &lt;3</li>
            <li> I got the R.E.M as a gift from my sister-in-law. She swore by it! So the first time I tried it I wasn&#x27;t too successful! If you have the same problem the first time, keep trying. I finally figured out what works best depending on which area I am aiming for. You literally just have to bend (like the picture shows) and twist one side then the other. The upper lip hurt but was completely doable! We are woman, we can handle the pain :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R.E.M removes all HAIR! To the tiniest baby hair to the stubborn darker hair. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a smooth face. My boyfriend mentioned the difference after I used it along with friends and other family members. That should speaks volume when someone notices a difference :)&lt;br /&gt;I also use this device on the top of my eyebrows, uni-brow, and sides of my eyebrows. Just be very careful if you decide to use the R.E.M around your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS ITEM AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT FOREVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> very nice it works it didnt take me awhile how use it.thinking bout getting one again the prize was alright its worth it</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this and used it immediately (after disinfecting it and my face with alcohol).  It took a few minutes to get the hang of using it, but it was relatively easy and was not as painful as I had anticipated. It removed my dark facial hair quite well, and in fact I could maneuver it around to catch hairs I otherwise would miss.  One of the reasons I purchased this was because I had been using an electric epilator on my face which was causing huge breakouts (again, despite disinfecting it and my face before hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The R.E.M., while successfully removing my dark facial hair, would not grasp the white hairs (which are coming in more frequently as I age).  So I ended up trying to tweeze or shave which did not make sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ugly:&lt;br /&gt;My face broke out just as much using the R.E.M as it did using the epilator.  I almost gave up on an epilator, but I finally found one that works very well, and which does not make me break out.  I&#x27;ll review that separately.</li>
            <li> A few days ago I went a searching on Amazon for something to help with facial hair removal and came up with this product.  Reading about it and then reading the reviews, I felt pretty sure this would be a good investment.  I was wrong - it was a GREAT investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased I cannot even begin to express myself.  Yes, there is a slight learning curve in terms of how to use it.  To be honest, after reading some of the reviews (take it like this, do it this way, etc.), I thought it was going to be really difficult to use.  Nope, not at all!  First let me say this even if it is obvious!  Keep your head hair out of the way!  I&#x27;m sure you can figure out how I learned that one!  Next, play with it!  Don&#x27;t make it too serious of an event.  You will quickly figure out how it works and then refine your skills.  As far as pain is concerned, I&#x27;m sure it is all relative and quite subjective.  To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t hurt me.  Yes, it tingles a bit once I&#x27;m done but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Everyone is different.  One little secret - keep it moving faster rather than slower.  It is sort of like removing a band-aid in that respect - the slower you go, the more uncomfortable it will be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results - fantabulous!  It didn&#x27;t take all that long and my whole face feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  All the tweezing in the world will never accomplish that!  Are there other effective ways to remove facial hair?  Probably but do any of them only cost $12.99 for multiple uses?  Not that I&#x27;m aware of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t be afraid of this little sucker!  The learning curve really is relatively small, especially if you play at it, and the discomfort is minimal and doesn&#x27;t last long.  How I wished I had found this 15 years ago before all the electrolysis and the emotional pain I went through as a result of my ever increasing facial hair!  Yep, I&#x27;m one happy camper now!</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these because a friend recommended the &amp;#34;little springy thing that leaves your face smooth&amp;#34;.  She failed to tell me that it would  make my eyes water, my nose run and send me into a sneezing fit.  But it does work and keeps the hair off much longer than shaving.  Mastering the technique takes several uses, I&#x27;m still working on it and have to shave a few areas of my face that I can&#x27;t do the rolling motion on.  I would advise getting someone to help you because it works best when the skin is taunt and it&#x27;s impossible to hold the skin and roll with both hands at the same time.  My friend and I have decided we&#x27;re going to do each other next time, after a nice glass of wine!  Bottom line is that it works beautifully and hurts like *(#!!.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it does what it is suppose to do; removes hair without removing a layer of skin. Of course, its painful but that means its working.</li>
            <li> Spring works great.  The key to making it work is remembering to twist each end in the opposite direction so it can pull and remove the facial hair.  It&#x27;s slightly more painful than threading but not much more.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this, easy to use and so effective! No mess, no pain once you&#x27;re used to it, a perfect product, grabs it all. Very convenient and quick. Highly recommended. Worth paying a slightly higher price for something high quality that will no doubt last for years and years.</li>
            <li> This is a joke. You have to turn the ends back and forth and bend the arc in order to get it to pull the hairs out. If it isn&#x27;t just perfect, it doesn&#x27;t work. I twist and turn and turn and twist and rarely can I get it to do what it is supposed to. I end up giving up and getting the tweezers. It looks nice sitting on the shelf!</li>
            <li> I am almost satisfied with the product. It works kind of well, if that makes sense. It gets most hairs on my upper lip, but does not grab the fine thin ones. On the other hand, the hairs that grow back seem to be growing back lighter and thinner.</li>
            <li> This did pull hair out, but it sure did hurt.  Hard to get all the small hairs with this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it now and then.</li>
            <li> My cousin told me she was using a new &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; type item instead of tweezers for facial hair removal.  I decided to look for the item and found it on Amazon.  This works extremely well on those areas we ladies don&#x27;t really talk about, but spend a lot of time grooming.  I tried threading once and was red and swollen for hours afterwards - not to mention how my face felt a burning sensation that ice didn&#x27;t help.  No more!  This device is great for chin and upper lip area.  The first use is a little uncomfortable, but it gets better with use and the results really last.  I still use tweezers for my eyebrows, but those other areas are treated with the Spring!  If you find the video review of this product on Amazon from a first time user, you&#x27;ll be in stitches for days - it&#x27;s hilarious!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had never purchased this product.  No matter how much I twist the ends, no hair is removed from either my lip or chin.  This was a total waste of my money and I wish I could have returned it but I had already tried on numerous occasions to remove hair.  I thought if I kept plugging away at it that it would eventually work - but NO it did not.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m not going to lie, this product that takes a little getting used to, at first I thought this thing doesn&#x27;t work! Then I went on their website and watched the video. Then with a bit of practice I got the hang of it! It does really work well, it pinches a bit but it&#x27;s quick and easy to use..once you get past the learning curve!</li>
            <li> IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET IT TO WORK. AND IT DOES HURT IF NOT DONE RIGHT. IF YOU HAVE PATIENTS. IT WILL WORK FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  I have been dealing with facial hair since Junior High.  I have peach puff on my upper lip and chin.  I&#x27;ve used waxes and creams, but both cause my sensitive skin to break out.  So, I decided to give this a try.  It does take some getting use to for it to work correctly.  The upper lip hurts the worst!  It does remove the hair but sadly, it was causing my face to break out, even after cleaning it with alcohol, as the directions indicated.  On to the next product...</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on bubzbeauty youtube channel and i&#x27;m glad she spoke about it because it makes things so much easier. It is amazing how i don&#x27;t have to worry about taking time to use my tweezers or wax to get rid of my facial hair. It is easy and less time consuming. Thank you bubzbeauty! :)</li>
            <li> It works and I&#x27;m dedicated to it now.  I also got my mom to buy one for herself.  I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I just have sensitive skin because I know this does not hurt for some people, but it still hurts for me.  But&#x27;s it bearable and worth it... I recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to buy this because I am so tired of things that do not work. I am skeptical. Also, another rater said she almost gave up on using it because it did not work for her at first. She had a hard time figuring out how to twirl it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. It does not seem to pull out the tougher darker hairs, but all the peach fuzz, yes. And what it does not pull out completely of the dark hairs...it pulls them out some so identifying them and grabbing them with tweezers is made easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get much less stubble than with a razor. It does hurt somewhat. The more I use it the less it seems to hurt.  I would get it again. And might get it for some friends. I have yet to find it in local stores. But, I seldom go to specialty stores. A little costly for its simplicity. But, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 y/o and I&#x27;ve been struggling with facial hair since puberty... I&#x27;m constantly forgetting to pluck and never having enough time since I have at least 30 thick black hairs on my chin/neck.  This spring is amazing! It not only took care of the thick hairs (roots and all), it picked up my long peach fuzz as well! My face have NEVER felt this smooth before.  I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product and I can save the thousands $$ on laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> This really works but hurts a little.  You must use it correctly or it doesn&#x27;t work.  Make sure you twist one end counter-clockwise and the other clockwise.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair remover for the first time. Its a very handy product which you can carry anywhere during travel. The remover works perfect for me. I takes very less time to do the job. Initially  I wasn&#x27;t sure about how to use it. Please refer youtube video tutorial for it. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Uhhhh....I&#x27;m reviewing this for a friend, because I totally don&#x27;t have any facial hair, but...ummmm, she maybe has a little bit of peach fuzz that&#x27;s detectable because she&#x27;s got dark hair and fair skin, and it makes her really self-conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my friend says this works quite well. While it&#x27;s maybe a bit more painful than waxing, it&#x27;s a million times less messy, and you don&#x27;t end up picking bits of wax off your face for an hour. I&#x27;m not sure how it works on coarse hair, but for those baby fine little hairs that are too small to tweeze, this is a quick and easy way to 86 them.</li>
            <li> I really like the spring facial remover but it definitely takes some practice and getting used to it. I watched a few YouTube videos to help me out but I really do think it depends on the area where you are trying to remove the hair. I bought it to remove some unwanted side burn hair and it works but if you aren&#x27;t careful you will rip out your real hair. Practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> It works... I can say that much.. but yes it does hurt! (why wouldn&#x27;t it? you&#x27;re pulling hair out of the root!) but it&#x27;s not unbearable pain.. I love it because if there&#x27;s a random couple of suckers on my upperlip before I have to head out somewhere I can easily &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; them off multiple at the time rather than sit and pluck each one. Also it takes out the fuzz which tweezers can&#x27;t do..</li>
            <li> It works fine if you have an hour to spend just getting the hairs on your upper lip! I twisted and turned and finally gave up and got out the razor! Waste of money! Worse thing I&#x27;ve gotten on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am a 59 year old woman and was blonde before I went gray. A few years ago I started growing blond hairs above my lips. I really wanted to try the No No, but after reading the reviews, decided to look for an alternative solution. I found the R.E.M. On Amazon and everyone seemed to like it. I had never heard of this, but the price was very low, so I thought &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;. I am so glad I did. I can&#x27;t believe that I almost forked out $300 for a No No. That would have been a mistake. This simple spring does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stings a little, but it&#x27;s not overly painful. In fact, that&#x27;s how you know you are twisting it correctly. It only took a couple of minutes to figure out the best angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used ths on my face. It takes both hands to use, so it wouldn&#x27;t be useful for underarm hair. I personally haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs because that is just too large of an area for me to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for use on the face. It takes a little bit of time, but you don&#x27;t really need a mirror and you can do a pretty good job while you watch TV. I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for over a year and it must work for a long time because it seems like I barely ever have to use it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and try it. It&#x27;s cheap enough so if you decide you don&#x27;t like it later on, it&#x27;s no big deal. But I think you will like it and kep it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with this product.  The quality is very nice.  The one down side is that it really hurts the first few times you do it, but I was expecting that.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this item away after giving it a good try.  It hurts way more than tweezing or waxing and is a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  It works better than a $3 cheapo one that I also got and tried out.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the money. It works pretty well - it&#x27;s good for the majority of hairs, but I still have to go back over and get the stubborn ones with tweezers. Overall, I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product...I really did, but it was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me, and it made my face break out horribly. I think I was allergic to the material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> I use this for my facial hair and it is better than I had expected. Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> Good product. It&#x27;s great if you have facial hair. Not for brows though. I like it. Really does the job.</li>
            <li> Best product for lip.  I no longer need to wax and burn my skin or discolor it.  You can use it every few days.  The first time will hurt, but after that it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! I have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), which causes abnormal facial hair in women. I have struggled with it for many years and I have used and tried everything out there, including several thousand dollars of laser hair removal, which did nothing but temporarily remove the hair and cause ingrown hairs. But, I have finally found the next best thing to true permanent hair removal (which just doesn&#x27;t exist yet). I&#x27;ll be honest, the first time I used it, the sensation was almost too much. But, if you keep up with it, you&#x27;ll never have to remove so many hairs at a time ever again. This results in a much less painful experience, in fact, I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the feeling because I know it&#x27;s working. Previously, my main concern was only the dark, coarse hairs on my face and not the peach fuzz, but this baby gets everything, leaving my face smoother and softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt it in my life. And, this is all accomplished without ANY irritation,... Read more</li>
            <li> I usually wax my upper lip, but then i camt go out of thebhouse for a few hours because my lips is all red. So, i caught this on a good deal and wanted to give it a try. The first few rolls were very painful! I suggest starting somewhere less painful until you get the hang out it, maybe bottom of your lip, or chin. After I got the hang of it, it really wasn&#x27;t bad at all. I just sat and watched tv, while I rolled it along my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;This is great too, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, so you can use it every day if you wanted. With waxing, you have to let your hairs grow a little too long before you can wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine this would work well for any fine hairs, like the lip, chin, sideburns, even arm hair  (although it would take forever and you can&#x27;t do it one handed).</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this tool would for my upper lip hair, but it was ineffective. I felt it grab the longer hair, but overall it pulled out less than 10% of it. My lip hair is mostly short. Maybe that was the problem, but I don&#x27;t want to wait for the hair to get long so I threw the spring in the trash after a couple of tries. I&#x27;ll just stick with threading.</li>
            <li> Painful but totally convenient. Easy to use.Ripping your hair out is always going to hurt but this saves getting the wax out. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle on my upper lip. I have bleached and waxed my upper lip. Bleaching is annoying to keep up with and still leaves blonde, visible hair. I someone skip waxes because I have to muster up too much courage to go through that terrible pain, even if the pain only lasts for a little while. In either case, I was getting tired of replenishing my supply of hair removal products. I wanted one product that would not need to be replaced for at least a year, something I can use without electricity, and something that will not be potentially dangerous for my body (like hair bleach). Using it on my upper lip is less painless than waxing. It is more subtle and does NOT pull on the skin. It only rips out the hairs. At times, it almost felt rewarding to roll the spring up and down because I was so confident it was working. And it did. It got rid of all the prominent hair on my upper lip (side note here: when I wax my upper lip, it removes every bit of hair and it actually makes me look weird... like a naked mole rat or something. This product makes my skin there look natural. The product definitely provides for hairless skin, but idk.. it just looks and feels more of a subtle change than the drastic red hairless skin you get from waxing). My skin was red for about 20 minutes; I just put a little vitamin E oil on a cotton ball and patted it on my upper lip right after using the spring. That&#x27;s it. So simple and so happy! However, if you do not use this product with swift hand movements, I can see how it might not be effective and possibly more painful. Try it out, practice a little, get comfortable with it, and I think it&#x27;ll be a great purchase for anyone. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have yet to try it on some other areas. I have tried it on my happy- trail and it was more painful/ not as effective as on the upper lip. I may just need to practice more. Good luck to all!</li>
            <li> I believe Oprah talked about this product, and I was excited to try it after the good reviews. All I know is I would rather pluck, wax or thread rather than use this product. It hurts. Like a b*tch. Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> At first, I was not going to review this product because there were already so many truthful, positive reviews; now I know firsthand that those who say the spring works well are correct! However, there is one warning I feel the need to share. The company claims that the spring will not cause irritation, but if you have very sensitive skin like I do, it DEFINITELY will. My face was red after using it. I had peach fuzz all over my face that was noticeably longer than most people&#x27;s, but due to my sensitive skin I was not willing to wax (or shave, for obvious reasons). So, since I had a large area to remove hair from, my skin was very irritated by the time I was through. It definitely smarts a lot, but it&#x27;s bearable enough to finish the task. Anyways, the redness went away by the next day, and I was so happy with the results! I had a smooth, hairless face and felt confident, no longer conscious of walking into bright light that illuminates blonde hairs. The spring is a DREAM in this sense. However, the trouble came a few days later when I started breaking out. I have acne-prone skin and even though  I cleaned the spring before I used it, with my pores all being open after the hairs were ripped out, I had TONS of tiny pimples all over my face. Days after that, I even had a few large ones as well. My face was a mess! Now that the breakout is done and gone, I have to say I still do not regret using the spring, because it DID do a very good job of tweezing out all the long vellus hairs on my face, chin and neck. The spring grabs even the tiniest of hairs--you just might have to experiment to find the right angle to grab them. Overall, I would DEFINITElY recommend the R.E.M. Spring.</li>
            <li> Removes unwanted hair painlessly.</li>
            <li> I should give it five stars, but I can&#x27;t love something that hurts :( It works very well. I suggest a glass or two of wine first, and an aspirin to kill the owies. The benefit is smooth, peerless skin - don&#x27;t forget to use an astringent before and after, and wash the wire.</li>
            <li> What can I say. I love the R.E.M. Spring. I am literally smitten with this low tech gadget. I keep looking for people to recommend it to! I have tried everything. This is a wonder tool.</li>
            <li> use it correctly and it will get all those hairs out of the way. it is a little painful at first but you will get use to it. waxing on the upper lip always makes my skin break out.. well not anymore with this baby!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine and the lightest colour of hairs so waxing and laser are not an option for me due to neither being able to pick up the hairs.  Cremes/gels just burnt my sensitive skin and always contain nut oils (I&#x27;m allergic to nuts) and tweezing always leaves me with a few ingrown hairs on my eyebrows as the hairs break rather than come out completely.  So i tried this...  And it is AMAZING!  So, it doesn&#x27;t grab the short, tiny hairs but if it is more than 2mm, then it is gone.  Hardly any pain.  In fact i found it fun each time i felt the little &#x27;pull/pluck&#x27; as i was just learning how to use it.  Watch a few youtube videos to get an idea and away you go....  You will NOT regret this thing.  If you can handle the pain felt from a standard Bikini wax, then there i no reason why you would find this painful on any part of your face.</li>
            <li> Came across this on Amazon one day &amp; thought I would give it a try.  This is one amazing product.  I will never need waxing or threading again.  It takes a while to master but once you do you will never go back to any type of hair removal again.  I do it about once a week &amp; that&#x27;s enough.  You don&#x27;t even need a mirror to use it!</li>
            <li> Using it hurts very much,it does yank the hair out but not always on the first, second or third try.  I am back to using depilatory cream again.</li>
            <li> I rated the Spring 4 stars because, while it does a great job removing most facial hair, it doesn&#x27;t do real well with coarse or very fine hair.  It also causes pain, especially the first few times it&#x27;s used.  Seems like, after the first few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  All in all, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for facial hair removal.  MUCH better than trying to tweeze them all away!</li>
            <li> This is so great! Received it last night but was too tired to open it (but was excited to get it).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to the pain because I have used the Emjoi epilator before! What I really like about this is that you can feel it taking the hair from the root! Unlike the epilator, that one just feels like a trim.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really know how to use it and the directions were confusing (the one that came with the box).&lt;br /&gt;I just experimented, moved the spring back and forth, up down while twisting the ends, and *bravo.&lt;br /&gt;You can take out a lot of hairs at the same time leaving your skin smooth! My skin is very sensitive and I usually get bumps with the epilator I used to use, it was time for a change. I did not get any bumps (at least not yet) and did not get red either.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to find this product by accident!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars because of the size, the fact that you don&#x27;t need batteries, and the flexibility of the spring. Awesome</li>
            <li> It hurts worse than threading, and makes your fingers sort of tired, but it does actually work. I went after my mom with this little device, but she wasn&#x27;t having it. She says it&#x27;s far too painful and would rather stick with professional threading. I know how to thread, but I&#x27;m by no means a professional. I thread well enough for my own purposes, but it hurts a little more than going to a professional lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hurts a lot more than threading for some reason. I presume that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s grabbing more little peach fuzz over a larger surface area. Threading on the other hand is more controlled. So, if you don&#x27;t know how to thread or find threading irritating, you might find this product useful. For me, it was actually less irritating to my skin than threading, which was great... and ironic since it hurts more! More pain and less irritation sounds paradoxical, but that&#x27;s the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out to be something that I won&#x27;t be likely to use. But, if you can grin and bear it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find this more helpful than waxing and the like at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this one because it was cheaper, and I just wanted to test the concept. Maybe at some point in the future I&#x27;ll try a more expensive version to see if it hurts any less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a little while to figure out how to use it, and in the process my fingers got pretty tired. If you have larger hands or arthritis, this might be sort of annoying to use. The spring is pretty short, yet you have to keep it bent and twist the ends when you use it. Cumbersome and painful, but it&#x27;s still pretty effective.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to remove upper lip hair. My skin is too sensitive to bleach, I dislike waxing, and tweezing the individual hairs is too time consuming. Before this product, I would lightly razor the area...with my boyfriend&#x27;s razor. This is exactly what I needed! It&#x27;s easy to use and of a simple concept, is fast and effective at hair removal, AND extremely cost effective in the long run. My only qualm is since you are pulling out hairs from a sensitive area, it can be kind of painful. I recommend icing the area beforehand. Otherwise, it&#x27;s over quickly and does a good job so that you don&#x27;t have to use it all that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. It seems kind of fragile to me...if you have a child rooting through your makeup bag or bathroom drawers, take care that they don&#x27;t play with it and stretch out the coil or you may have to order a new one</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews, yet kept putting off the purchase.  I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am now that I finally bought it.  I use it a few times a week and it works as promised, removing 99.99% of facial hair.  I pluck the occasional stray.  I only wish I had invented this unique tool and was banking the well-deserved money earned.  This is the must-have item in your beauty kit!&lt;br /&gt;PBH, Maui, Hawaii</li>
            <li> It works but it takes forever and my pain tolerance is low. I&#x27;d have to use it everyday to eliminate the &#x27;stache. and I do not have the time or dedication for it.</li>
            <li> best invention ever. Instead of going somewhere to get it &amp;#34;profesionally&amp;#34; done, I use the REM spring. I really think this is the greatest thing ever created! lol. It pulls the hair from the root and it does not hurt. I do not need to pay $10 to get my hair removed. I wish they created something like this for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have fine but dark hairs that grow on my upper lip, and it&#x27;s kind of painfully tedious to try and pluck the hairs individually.  The REM Spring Facial Hair Remover makes it much easier to take care of more area at once.  I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it still hurts, but it&#x27;s effective, and let&#x27;s face it, it was gonna hurt either way.  At least this way you aren&#x27;t risking a chemical reaction or burn and having an embarrassingly reddened upper lip for a few days while the skin heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to use this, do note that you have to be twisting your fingers in opposite directions - one clockwise, one counterclockwise, to tighten the spring.  Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy and a great, quick way to take care of those embarrassing, pesky hairs!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is way better than using tweezers and or paying for threading. I only use it on my lip area.</li>
            <li> This takes way too long to do,and the results are minimal. I bought it because I thought it would be a little easier than threading my own face but unfortunately I was wrong. It hurts much more than threading or waxing and takes significantly longer cuz you have to go over the same spot again and again. Also, it won&#x27;t remove coarse hair , just cuts it some how so it will still need to be tweezed.  Bottom line is waste your time or money on this  garbage</li>
            <li> I could not get it to work properly...I would pass on this product if i were you.&lt;br /&gt;Did not like it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is such a simple yet, great idea.  It get s a big tricky using it sometimes...but well worth it.</li>
            <li> After reading the postive reviews, I decided to give the R.E.M. a try. It worked so well, my mom stoled it from me. It does exactly what it says. However, the only problem I have, is taking out hairs that are in an angle. Maybe, after more practice I can nail it down. Thus far, it is very helpful in taking out thick hairs that are annoying and bothersome in unwanted areas.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out above your upper lip when it&#x27;s angled right, and when you&#x27;re tensing your upper lip tight against your teeth. However, when you move to your chin, where you don&#x27;t have as hard a surface as teeth underneath, to tense your skin against, it becomes more laborious, and time consuming, producing little results. It worsens when you move to other facial areas that don&#x27;t have a hard area (like teeth) underneath to provide a hard base to tense the skin on. It might be ok for young people who have really tight skin. But, for those of us with looser skin, this product is a waste of time, and does little. Bottom line: You need to be able to tense your skin (stretch it tight, distorting your face) tightly against a hard surface to achieve results. If you can stretch your skin to a very tight point and hold it there, this product might be good for you. I found out the hard way that the only spot it was good for, for me, was my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I considered several items before purchasing the R.E.M. spring.  I considered a laser and an expensive epilator to name a few.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have dark hair that shows up on my chin and under my jaw bone.  I&#x27;m very self conscious.  I was spending 30 minutes a day plucking the little hairs that would magically appear over night.  I decided to go with this product.  I figured for the small price what do I have to lose.  I have been using if for several days now and I could tell a difference the very next day.  I wasn&#x27;t standing in front of the mirror trying to get every single little hair with tweezers.  When I received I followed the directions precisely and it worked like a charm.  It was only painful in a few places but I&#x27;m use to plucking everyday.  I highly recommend this product especially if you have normal hair growth and don&#x27;t have to pluck  everyday.  Even if you do, it&#x27;s worth it.  You just replace the plucking with a faster process.  All in all it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> I only saw a customer video and tried it without reading the instructions. Very easy to use, got rid of most hair in a few minutes. Almost no pain, more like burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Does work!!!  Hurts at first, but pulls out many hairs&lt;br /&gt;instead of one at a time!!!  Small, portable!  I am&lt;br /&gt;ordering another to carry in my suitcase, and another&lt;br /&gt;to keep in our RV!!!</li>
            <li> Hello girls.. this product is the best I ever bought.. Yes it is slightly painful.. but then it is much less than when you wax or thread...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of facial hair (no thanks to my dad!!!) and  really soft skin (thanks to my mom!!!) which burns easily on waxing and the marks of wax burn takes forever to heal.. So I always dreaded waxing.., I love threading, but not many places do it and you have to sit with them for a while to remove if you have a lot of facial hair. It was a pain in the neck to find such a saloon and go there every 3 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the solution online and I love this product... wow.. I use this when I watch youtube or see some movies online and you do not have to use any oil or cream before using it.. and it is so easy.. you forget the pain when you are watching something funny or cute online....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not do it over eyebrows... You can pluck them or just go to a salon if you do not know... but chin and upperlips and cheeks and jawline works just beautifully.. (I love you REM :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously it is the best investment I made and I recommend this to all of you girls who have soft skin and facial hair problem..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is getting those tiny hair out of the loops to clean this spring is really tough... But somehow I manage it.. I have been using the same spring for more than 8 months and it is still awesome...</li>
            <li> first off i bought this on ebay because honestly i dont like paying for shipping and i dont want to pay extra money on shipping for just a spring even if it does works, its still a spring. I like that its stainless steel so its very durable and will last a long time and durability is a very important thing to me when im spending money for something. It does remove all hair and i used to do my eyebrows and it removed most of the hair in one go except like one very fine hair and for some reason it couldnt grab that,maybe it depends on how tightly you twist the spring or maybe it just wasnt thick enough to grab? idk but i tried going different directions but instead went and pulled the last one out with my tweezers. it does pull out hair and it does its job, it pulls out sections at a time which i like because its faster and less painful than a pair of tweezers and not messy like waxing. i think that it works best on medium to thick hair or long hair(the long peach fuzz kind, but it doesnt seem to work to well on very very very fine hair thats short). i do also like the fact that its made so durable and cheaper than the bellabe kind which has plastic handles or maybe its rubber? either way i just cant figure out why one that is so durable would be cheaper than one that doesnt look so durable? oh well ive never tried the bellabe one but im just guessing so who knows but im not complaining!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase from Amazon.com.  Great price and does what it says it will do.  Easy to use.  I use the REM together with Vaniqua (applied twice daily to slow down hair regrowth) and am very happy.  Would highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to control facial hair.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this product.  It does take some getting use to (the motions necessary for it to be effective) but once I nailed it down I was happy and hairless.  This really does remove from the root, and somehow was more comfortable to use than the epilators that I&#x27;ve tried.  I also didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation or bumps like I get after I use my epilator.  I was so excited about it that I bought my mother one the same day that I received mine, and I am now her favorite daughter (at least for a couple weeks).</li>
            <li> I purchased this months ago and it did not come with any instruction.  I decided to to come back to this website to see if any had been added and see if maybe out of dumb luck I had been using this right---so off I go--to read.</li>
            <li> Every now &amp; then a product comes along where you want to share the news with all your girlfriends.  This is one.  I could not believe a little spring could easily remove the fuzzy hair from my upper lip so quickly and efficiently.  I had no problem figuring out how to use this.  It tooks me seconds.  My upper lip was hairless within 5 minutes.  I hated waxing.  Did it one time and swore never again.  I am thrilled I have found this tool.  I shoud add that the hair on my lip was peach fuzz and very fair.  I never gave it a thought in my younger years but as I got older and approached that big milestone birthday, I wasn&#x27;t loving the fuzz staring back at me in the mirror.  It&#x27;s all gone now, thanks to this little spring.  Was not painful either.  So much better than waxing and no worse than plucking.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I have olive skin and I grow an uncomfortable amount of dark facial hair on my face that requires I routinely wax. This keeps the hairs shorter for a longer period of time and is not quite as inconvenient as waxing/threading, etc. The hardest part was learning how to spin it, but once you get going... boy are you set! A miracle product -- the next time I order, I will buy two. I am terrified of them ever discontinuing such a fabulous item! All women should have one! (or two!!)</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work. I stalked it on Amazon, even asking pertinent questions of another prominent reviewer of it. Her glowing recommendation gave me hope that this might be the solution to a problem I&#x27;ve struggled with since puberty: a light layer of dark hair all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first inkling that this wasn&#x27;t the miracle I was seeking was the fact that it just plain didn&#x27;t work on my normally shaved face, even though before starting I&#x27;d let the hair grow in much more than I&#x27;d ever want to be caught in public with. The other reviewer assured me that after letting the hair grow in for about a week it would do fine, so I hid out in my house and allowed the hairs to reach a suitable length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point, yes, the product did start working. I had to go over my face hundreds of times over the course of several days to get it all, but eventually I was satisfied with the results. Tweezers took care of the sporadic hairs the REM just refused to pull out, and my face was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was over the moon and then, as hairs are wont to do, all of them started growing back. And because they all started growing back at the exact same time, I was back to square one, having to either go back to shaving them, or hide out in my house for another week while they got long enough to REM again. Forget that. I&#x27;d rather live my life and returned to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, this product might work well for someone with only a few stray hairs or someone who has light facial hair that isn&#x27;t so noticeable. For someone like me who is cursed with dark full-face fuzz, however, it proved a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very easy, very fast hair removal.  I&#x27;m a blonde and have a ton of very fine blonde hairs on my face.  This thing can find hairs I can&#x27;t see.  Easy and fast, very convenient.  I keep mine in my car to use while I&#x27;m stuck at a light.  A few twists and, voila, little white hairs are gone.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This really works! It was a little hard to figure out how to use it, but once I got the hang of it...wow, it works great.  Had lots of very fine upper lip hair that was so difficult to remove... not anymore!!</li>
            <li> Really impressed with how easy this is, as shown in the picture.  Hurts to pull out hair, no matter how, but this works quite well and I sort of got used to it.</li>
            <li> You would never guess this small spring could do so much! It took just a short amount of time to get the hang of it.  All facial hair can be removed easily and fast leaving my skin feeling smooth.  I won&#x27;t be without one! Goodbye to waxes and creams.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t but tell everyone about this awesome product,ve been looking for a product that will remove my facial hair for long,wen I saw the number of the reviews on dis product,I had to give it a try too,and oh my God,I love love love it,am so pleased of the result am getting using dis product,It hurts me wen am using it,like dey say \\&quot;no pain no gain\\&quot;,but as u use it more often u kind of get used to it. It would be selfish of me not to write dis review for others out there looking for a great product to remove their hair,I had to join the over 360 customers who wrote the reviews on dis product,if u r still in doubt about if it works,see the numbers of the reviews,and u&#x27;ll believe,numbers not lie.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a hard time getting used to the tool, but I had help from the previous reviewers. I tried a couple times twirling in different ways, and I got the hang of it quickly. If you are getting frustrated that you can&#x27;t get all the hairs, make sure that you are moving the spring in the opposite direction of the hair growth. This is important. You will not be able to capture as many if you are not angling to spring correctly. I wanted to be able to use it in my eyebrow area, but unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think I can angle it correctly to do that. Overall - a great tool for your upper lip area.</li>
            <li> Its working well on upper lips. Pain - means it works! I think my trips to saloon for upper lips can be considered 0 from now on!</li>
            <li> I love this product... When they say it is painless, they are lying a little bit. I mean once you get the hang of it, it isn&#x27;t too bad but when you first start using it... you might as well be ripping hair out with a couch coil.</li>
            <li> It pinches a little, but it actually works!!  I do have trouble getting it to catch onto really short hair but all in all, I don&#x27;t regret buying it...</li>
            <li> I just got my R.E.M Spring Hair Remover today and I was very impressed because&lt;br /&gt;It only took one full day to get to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a dilemma, I was not up on my hair removal like I should be. I hate the mess&lt;br /&gt;of my fancy and expensive wax machine. I just can&#x27;t make it through a wax session&lt;br /&gt;without tacky fingers and a mess of popsicle sticks in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The thought of putting a spring to your face and ripping hair off seemed a bit goofy to me, but&lt;br /&gt;reading the reviews swayed me to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple yet very useful beauty tool. You can use&lt;br /&gt;it while multitasking. Imagine that, hair removal while watching over the children or just watching T.V.&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s my kind of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you waxers out there here is the good news:&lt;br /&gt;when done properly you can get that upper lip as smooth as silk it is very effective!</li>
            <li> very difficult to use, kind of painful if you can get it to work, easier to use of the mustach than on the neck or chin</li>
            <li> I have very course and dark chin hairs I have tried laser, electrolysis, waxing, shaving, creams. R.E.M has worked the best so far. It was painful as heck first time but it does what it says. My only issue is it does sometimes break the hairs so now that my dark hair are starting to grow back in they are not long enough for it to grab them and it breaks them, but I was using it every day too. I am going to try to use it on all part of my face except where the dark hairs are coming in and let them grow out a little. Make up covers them up enough until they get too long. Overall the best product I have found and with everything there is always a little drawback and figuring how to use it best for you.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding.. this thing is amazing for facial hair. So much better than No No which is fab for legs. I recommend this for everyone. I still can&#x27;t figure out how to do the chin part but I&#x27;m sure I will soon. Fabulous. I&#x27;m giving these as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this could help me when I travel and can&#x27;t see fine hairs as well as when I use my magnifying mirror at home. This worked pretty well--at first. After a time or two though, it seemed to lose it&#x27;s grip. If you spread the coils a bit and blow on it that helps. It didn&#x27;t hurt as badly as others have said, maybe because my hairs are really fine. It didn&#x27;t grab some of the most noticeable ones, however--no matter how many different angles I approached them from. Still having to use tweezers. :/</li>
            <li> PERFECT all around !  Quality, ship time, price !!</li>
            <li> For a deceptively simple looking device, this works remarkably well. First of all, painful, not painful? What I felt was a tiny pinch, even directly under my nose. IMHO, it was not painful. Second,is it hard to us we? Well, to be honest, I&#x27;m remarkably uncoordinated, so I can&#x27;t consistently twist the&amp;#34;right counterclockwise, left clockwise&amp;#34; , but that&#x27;s more me than the device. Oddly, I found it easier to do it  away from a mirror, just lying in bed. Finally, does the end effect what I want?.  Yes, yes, yes. Unlike wax strips, depilatories, or the hand-held hair removal devices, this does not leave a dark shadow along the hair line. No six o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;This really works.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this product but it worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Yes it does!  However, it sure does the trick in removing those hard to get hairs from your face.  The manufacturer needs to include a copy of the review on Amazon.com that gives instructions on twisting each end of the coil in opposite directions because the instructions that were enclosed did not quite describe how to use it very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still going to use it even though it hurts. I will let you know about how quickly the hair comes back as soon as I have used it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the product because I am not putting chemicals on my face or exposing myself to unknown and possibly harmful  radiation (for lack of a better word).  It seems that if something can zap a hair follicle and kill it, what is it doing to my skin?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have tried everything in the past from smelly chemicals, bleaching, waxing, threading, etc, and nothing seems to work entirely. Now, keep in mind, this product is not a miracle product that just poofs your unwanted hair away. You have to be ballsy enough to take the plunge and put it against your face and let it rip the hair out. Did that scare you?&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this product I was so scared to use it because of all the comments that this is too painful. So I waited, and waited, and waited. One night I was bored and I attempted to use it. Yep, it hurt. I started with my upper lip which I have waxed before. This spring didn&#x27;t hurt more than waxing, but it hurts in a different way. With waxing, your skin gets warm and you can pull the hair out with one quick swipe. With this spring, it took a while for me to get the hang of it so I could feel each tiny hair being pulled out. But I don&#x27;t care. The truth is... it was pulling each tiny hair out! When I was finished with my upper lip, the spring had pulled out both tiny fuzzy hairs, and the larger thicker hairs. The best part is that there was no shadow on my skin or irritation as bad as I get from using chemicals. Also, after a couple minutes of using this, my skin became almost numb and it was much easier to use. It&#x27;s just those first few pulls that don&#x27;t feel too good.&lt;br /&gt;A few days later I tried this on my cheeks. My cheeks aren&#x27;t too hairy but have tiny little peach fuzz that starts fairly close to my sideburns. I figured, why not? This did great on my upper lip. WOW. My skin looks so soft and smooth after using this on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I use this about once a week and that&#x27;s enough for upkeep. If I did it more frequently it probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt as much each time because my skin would be more adapted to using this.&lt;br /&gt;I also took advice I read in some other comments - I wash my face really well and use a toner before using the spring. I also drown the spring in rubbing alcohol before and after using it. I&#x27;ve found if I do this I don&#x27;t break out nearly as much.</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair removal tool. The other reviews are all correct, I was glad I read them because I was just about to spend the $200 on another product. It does hurt for a second but lets face it, it is pulling out hair! I couldn&#x27;t find any product or service that would get rid of the very fine blonde fuzz on my face, now I have :).</li>
            <li> I was a natural blond (now I&#x27;m gray) so I have a lot of white peach fuzz on my face. I&#x27;m now a post-menopausal woman so I also have some dark thick whiskers.  The REM Spring works great on my peach fuzz and the hairs don&#x27;t have to be all that long to be removed.  I have never felt such smooth skin on my face.  The REM Spring also works well on the whiskers when they are long enough.  Unfortunately, as soon as I feel the hard little whiskers above my skin I want them removed and I end up using the tweezers to remove them.  If I were able to leave them alone and let them grow long enough I&#x27;m sure the REM Spring would be able to pull them out.</li>
            <li> After bleaching, plucking, waxing, etc. for years and feeling discouraged now I just sit in front of the television in the evening and use this great product.  This works best on the fine hairs but with a little practice you can remove those pesky chin hairs as well. I bought this for my daughter who uses it for her mustache (she is young and does not have the OTHER hairs yet!)</li>
            <li> Okay, so I wasn&#x27;t very sure I should buy this little spring when I saw it here on Amazon.  My problem areas are my &amp;#34;female sideburns&amp;#34; and there was pretty much only one review out of 500+ reviews about someone using this on that area.  But I&#x27;m so glad I bought it because this is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please disregard all negative reviews because those people either don&#x27;t use it right or they have only used it once.  THE FIRST TIME HURTS but you can deal with it!  I&#x27;m pretty sure the sideburn area has much thicker hair (at least for me), and it did hurt a lot the first time.  But you suck it up and bear it.  After the first time, it&#x27;s been absolutely wonderful and barely hurts.  This is way less painful and a lot less time consuming than plucking with tweezers (which is what I have done for the past 2 years...not fun).  Because my hair grows rather quickly, I use the spring every 2-3 days and it takes me probably no more than 5 minutes to use.  I cannot recommend this highly enough, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Great! Removes hair perfectly, doesn&#x27;t hurt much and, the best, it takes a lot of time for the hair to grow again! Best purchase lately! I recommend!</li>
            <li> Bit tricky to use,but once you get the hang of it its really terrific, removes the hair and the regrowth is low. Does not really hurt either. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> does not do its job. Have not used it for a single time. Find this item useless I&#x27;d rather go with waxing</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  It does what it says it will and isn&#x27;t anymore painful than other methods. It&#x27;s easy to use, take care of and store.</li>
            <li> This product is great and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.  You do have to mess with it to get it to work correctly.  And please, clean it with alcohol before EACH use, not just once a month as the unhelpful directions suggest.</li>
            <li> i love this item was very easy to use. the instructions are easy to follow. although the process is somewhat painful its easier and less expensive then waxing...also u don&#x27;t get that thick hair regrowth as you would with waxing. it took me about five minutes to do my entire upper lip as it was the first time i was using the product. once you get the hang of it will only take a min. to do. quick and easy. great product.</li>
            <li> Love this. It stings a bit first use but my upper lip is free of hair. Inexpensive, efficient. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea, I think I also easily learned how to make it work but every time I removed my facial hair with it, I got many small pimples along the jaw line and occasional break outs. Very uncomfortable side effect which made me give up using this product after 4-5 attempts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4.5 because it just can&#x27;t get every hair. You have to pluck. I will say I do love this and choose over waxing any day. This gets hairs that I didn&#x27;t even know existed. It can hurt but it&#x27;s worth it. Be careful and wash your face before using and then use an astringent after because you do not want to break out! Over the course of a few days if I use the tool each night before bed I can get everything. This tool accomplishes what thread on can do but with less pain.</li>
            <li> Neat little contraption for facial hair removal!  I&#x27;m still trying to perfect the technique to get the most hairs removed, but it&#x27;s definitely easy to use and I&#x27;m getting better each time.  I&#x27;ll use the R.E.M. any day over waxing- no red face, very little pain and no sticky mess.</li>
            <li> The whole inverted U thing? While rolling and pushing up and down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this seriously doesn&#x27;t work. For one thing, it&#x27;s wide open when it&#x27;s at this position meaning it doesn&#x27;t pull much of anything. I also found it way too awkward to use this way.  What seemed to work was expanding and collapsed (basically squeezing hairs) and rolling. This was at a straight line rather than a U, and I can try places that are supposedly off limits like the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less painful and time-consuming than tweezing (which I won&#x27;t even try), but not very effective, and the learning curb is too steep. I&#x27;m sticking with my electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin women&#x27;s hair, this may be different. But I&#x27;m a guy, trying to get a solution to mangy body (and especially neck) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I originally planned to give this 3 stars. But after trying the same patch I only got a few hairs plucked out with a Norelco electric razor. Within five minutes, I got more hairs close enough for my liking with almost no pain. I&#x27;ll try this again when my neck hairs grow out again, but this seems like I wasted money.</li>
            <li> It does a good job on the &#x27;stache. It  is very painful though.  I thought I was used to hair removal pain, but oh mama! This hurt! It got some chin hair. It did not get the corse ones.  In short I was able to ditch the razor, but not the tweezers. Not having to use a razor on your face is a plus for any girl!</li>
            <li> I have gone through lots of different hair removal products - creams, wax, sugar, epilators. All of them are bothersome in some way (creams kill my skin, wax is a pain and messy, sugar doesn&#x27;t always work, epilators are slow). So why not try the REM spring?! I really didn&#x27;t think this would work, but boy it does. I have found this the easiest way to remove facial hair. Once a week I&#x27;ll roll it over the areas that need it, and that&#x27;s it. Does it hurt? Yep, in some areas, like the outer edges of my mouth. OUCH. (the lady smiling in the photo must be on drugs) Other areas it does not really hurt at all. The key is to go quickly and keep your skin taut. It only takes a few minutes to get the hang of it the first time you use it, after that it&#x27;s a piece of cake. Like any hair removal product that takes hair out at the root, you will have a bit of redness after you use it, but it clears up quickly, and there&#x27;s no residue from wax, no drying out from creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the simplest and easiest solution for facial hair removal out there.</li>
            <li> Its a little weird to use and it seems to hurt more than when I go have it done professionally.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2, one for a gift.  It is good alternative to plucking, saves a lot of time and virtually pain free.</li>
            <li> Just got the R.E.M. to day and used it right away. I have peach fuzz and a little mustache plus a few stray coarse hairs on my face. The R.E.M. got rid of the peach fuzz and the mustache hairs but was hit and miss on the coarse hairs, but I have to really pull at those with my tweezers sometimes (thankfully there are only a very few of them). Once I got used to the hand motion needed to make The R.E.M. work it was very simple and easy to remove hair. I bent the R.E.M. in a gentle inverted U shape and moved it up and down my skin at the same time rolling the handles in and out (left hand going counter clockwise and the right going clockwise on the out motion and the reverse on the in motion). After I got the rhythm going it didn&#x27;t take long to do my entire face. I get my eyebrows threaded and on occasion get my upper lip and face threaded also. While I will continue to have my eyebrows professionally done I will now do my face and upper lip at home and save myself 25.00 a pop. The R.E.M. has already paid for itself! As for the discomfort, as I said earlier I get threaded and it feels the same. The face, tingling and the upper lip, all I will say is OUCH! I was flirting with the idea of getting a NONO but the price (250+) and the  reviews (mostly 1 star on every site it is sold) made me decide to try the R.E.M. and I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover after I read others comments &amp; reading the comments on one that cost over $200. I gave it a 4 because it does pull the hair but not enough to stop using it. It does work, you need to read others comments on how to hold &amp; turn the spring and for the great price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much on this item, bought it for my sister...now she believes I never loved her. She advises that it&#x27;s like tearing out your hair...I guess that one way for hair removal ! She said the next morning her upper lip was in a lot of pain after trying it the first time...but says she will attempt it again, before calling it quits.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent consumer of hair removal products.  I actually was reading over a review I wrote on here in 2010 for a wax hair remover I have used relatively happily for years and have come to prefer for its cost, comfort and general effectiveness over other even professional methods such as laser and electrolysis.  This little item, I think rivals if not surpasses the ease of use and practicality, not to mention the cost, of the wax strips and I hope to continue to learn to use the REM Spring as effectively as possible.  It is not as you might imagine as easy as this smiling face makes it look, and especially on the upper lip!  If you have a lot of hair, like me, you are never going to find a product that will eliminate all the unwanted hair, but I think with continued practice, I can eliminate a good amount of it with this, and then wax the rest.  It is also practical to use because I actually keep it in my car and use it while stopped at a traffic light or in the parking lot before going into work!</li>
            <li> I recently had my face threaded not for the first time but after a long time, and it was awesome. So I bought this based on the good reviews since I was hoping to find  something that would spare me the expense and hassle of getting to the salon.  It didn&#x27;t have to be perfect, just close. This came close, but not close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with the REM spring is most of the time instead of pulling out the hairs, it just breaks them off. So while your skin may feel smooth, you&#x27;re left with a dark root -  ie a five o&#x27;clock shadow. A part of this is because the spring is wiggly (duh, it&#x27;s a spring) and doesn&#x27;t really allow for a firm enough grip for the user nor is it stable enough to roll over and grip the hair and pull it out from the root. It grabs what it grabs and moves one. The equivalent of shaving with a razor really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also misses hairs, both fine and coarse. Seems to work best where hairs are grouped together. If you&#x27;re someone one prone to random stray hairs, forget it. I went over one area dozens of times and it still didn&#x27;t get one particular hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, my face felt smooth (temporarily) but in some areas didn&#x27;t really look it (fair skin, dark hair). In at least one area, it felt smooth after I used the REM Sping, but a couple of hours later, I could feel them growing back in.  (Yes, my hair goes very quickly.) After threading, I lasted 4 days before I could feel them growing back in. Over a week before I could see anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing. Will work in a pinch, but not a replacement for better methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, yes it&#x27;s somewhat painful, but it&#x27;s no worse than being plucked, threaded or waxed.</li>
            <li> I only write product reviews if I really has something to say.  What this means is that I&#x27;m only going to write something if I absolutely hated the product or I absolutely loved the product.  This is a definite &amp;#34;LOVED IT&amp;#34; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!  I am a woman who has tried EVERYTHING (tweezing, threading, shaving, waxing, Nad&#x27;s and Nair) to get rid of the fine (but long) dark hair on my face.  I was about to purchase the No! No! and read several reviews which frightened me... and then I was directed to the R.E.M. Spring.  Review after review after review spouting nothing but fantastic comments.  It was $5. I was willing to lose $5 if it didn&#x27;t work.  So I bought it.  Let me tell you, this is the best money (of ANY amount) that I have ever spent.  The product is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely takes a little trial and error, but after about 2-3 days you will be an absolute expert.  As with many of the other reviewers, I will also say that it is not painless.  The first time is the absolute worst, but it gets better from there.  I use it daily (just to keep completely smooth).  No redness, no chemical burns, no breakouts from products, no awful smells, no sensitivity. Try it and I swear you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s bumped sliced bread right out of its coveted &amp;#34;Best Invention&amp;#34; spot.</li>
            <li> I used this product several times to remove the hair around my chin area and lip. The hair grew back the same thickness and consistency (contrary to popular beliefs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hair around my chin grew back the same speed (give or take 1-2 weeks) as shaving. I rather shave twice a month than use this painful product once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lip area, I find that an inexpensive eyebrow razor works extremely well over this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t mind using this product if it kept the hair from growing back longer. Since it didn&#x27;t, it wasn&#x27;t worth the time or pain to me.</li>
            <li> this is the best hair remover ever!</li>
            <li> Works great. No worse pain than plucking. Great to do while watching tv. Easy. Watch You Tube videos for instructions.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it is painless but it is great at removing the tougher hairs.  I prefer not to use it in the most delicate areas like below my nose but it does do the job.</li>
            <li> Yes at first it is painful but you have to keep using it until you get used to it. Hang in there, it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end because it really does work and I love it so much!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on groupon one day and actually laughed at it. Thought who would buy such a dumb invention.. then i read the reviews and realized that not only does it work it would save me a lot of money vs going to the rude lady at the mall who does threading for about 40 bucks each time and does a terrible job in comparison. So needless to say I&#x27;m a fan and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and had absolutely no problem using this product right away!!! Removed the chin hair that I have hated for years. There was no irritation and hurt less than waxing. H&lt;br /&gt;I highly encourage any skeptics to try it. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing, threading, and plucking for years and was skeptical of this product.  Only bought it because my sister has one and recommended it to me. I have to say, I&#x27;m really impressed with the results.  It&#x27;s fast and easy (I got the hang of it after a minute or two).  The pain level is about the same as waxing but I prefer not having to deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> Ladies...I ask you this...Why is something that hurts us so much so addicting?  I admit, I&#x27;m a novice hair remover.  Never attempted any device for removing facial hair in my 35 years.  Let me just echo the rest of ya&#x27;ll....ouchie mama!!!!  But, I can&#x27;t stop!  I can&#x27;t belive how much hair is on my face that I can&#x27;t even see.  This device works!  It takes both some getting used to and some finesse in how to use it.  Definitely worth the purchase if you&#x27;re looking for something that will pull every single tiny blonde hair right off your face without any compasion whatsoever.  Still not really sure why I&#x27;ve done this.  Enjoy...!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t hard to use and it quickly removes fine hairs. I bought it based on the good reviews on here!</li>
            <li> This definitely does the job it&#x27;s intended for. I prefer it over waxing, but I still use my tweezer to get the hairs that this spring can&#x27;t get to.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better brands of the spring type hair removers that I&#x27;ve tried. It takes a bit of getting used to especially if you&#x27;ve never used one before just because of the stinging sensation, but that seemed to improve quickly. Very convenient to use, you can use it while watching TV. You really get your money&#x27;s worth with this product. Mine seem to work really well for at least six months.</li>
            <li> TTTTThid definitely has a learning curve to it... First time I used it it took about an hour... Maybe I don&#x27;t have good dexterity... But it works.  Unlike the video I watched on Amazon.. I didn&#x27;t yell scream or cry... It doesn&#x27;t feel much different from tweezers.</li>
            <li> Soooo I&#x27;m Italian and hairy.  Enough said.  This is a cool appliance - I like it because you don&#x27;t have to use hot wax and risk damaging your skin.  It just grabs on to your hairs.  It kind of hurts but it&#x27;s more of a stinging and to be honest I&#x27;ve felt worse.  You kind of have to go over the same spot a few times and I can see how it would take a while for people with a ton of hair.  But it&#x27;s cheap, reusable and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the people who said it made them break out - think of it like this:  you are pulling hairs out and leaving a small hole, which is a potential space for dirt and bacteria.  So before you use this device, wash it and your face.  After you use, just wash your face and use an astringent to close the pores.  It&#x27;s just a matter of keeping your skin really clean.</li>
            <li> It hurts like the dickens, but it definitely gets the hair! I&#x27;m having a little trouble getting a few of the thinner, shorter hairs currently, but the majority is being pulled right out! Did I mention it stings? lol!</li>
            <li> Removing facial hair is an ordeal. I&#x27;m always hesitant to try something new, because, more often than not, they don&#x27;t work. This product is not one of the failures. I just got my spring today and was eager to try it out. Based on all the review reading I did I kind of knew what to expect. Yeah it hurts, no one is lying about that. I had to do a small patch and then come back and try again. I&#x27;m sure in time I&#x27;ll get used to it in time but the pain is with it. The hair is gone and its so easy to use, you just have to find the best way to roll the spring over your skin. I&#x27;ll probably use this every other day if not every day. I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance on something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this item four stars because it does take some getting used to and it will take some finesse to get all the hair but I&#x27;m sure this will be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> For those of you that have the problem of facial hair, this is your answer!  I read the wonderful reviews and could not wait to try it.  I tore the box open at work and used it at my desk.  It stings, but hurts less than waxing and you can do this yourself instead of having a perky 20 something pull your hair out with wax.  I am telling everyone I know.  And to top it off, this is not even made in China or India.  Very happy customer :)</li>
            <li> This is the best facial remover ever!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it , it does work hurt a little at first but you&#x27;ll get used to it ...even hairs in my chin that i thought  i didn&#x27;t have it pulls all the hair away all in one .I have sensitive skin and it works really good on me I love it . I read a lot of the reviews before buying it and I&#x27;m glad i did my face feels so smooth and the best hairless!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but figured it was worth a $20 gamble. It works really well on fine, &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; facial hair -- chin, lip, etc.  It&#x27;s not recommended for eyebrows, but i did use it successfully on the area between brows.  It took a few tries to get the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of using it, but you&#x27;ll know it when you do because .... OUCH! Yep, there&#x27;s nothing painless about snatching out a dozen or so hairs all at once, but it&#x27;s no worse than plucking, and I think it was less painful than waxing. (Plus, quicker and no mess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing doesn&#x27;t work on thick, course hairs, (those nasty little wiry things that pop up out of nowhere!) but it grabs all those fine hairs that are missed by tweezers and sometimes even missed by waxing.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Hard to use. Ineffective.</li>
            <li> Must have! Save on waxing the upper lip!</li>
            <li> We got this for my mom, who was ready to spend quite a bit on a home laser hair removal system but we saw this and the positive reviews and for the price, thought what the heck? So we got it and she LOVES it. Easy to use, she doesnt need a mirror to try to find each hair, and she can just do it while watching tv or whatever. I can see a noticeable difference. It gets all the peach fuzz that she could never get with tweezers, since it gets everything that comes across the coils, and her face looks younger and smoother because of that. What a great solution!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just awesome :)&lt;br /&gt;it helps me a lot...very easy in use and gives god results .&lt;br /&gt;i think we all need it :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product and still am somewhat. However, I was looking for a way to remove facial hair without waxing because waxing always causes irritation and bumps on my skin. This item does the same thing. Also, it takes a lot of work to get rid of the hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and still have a long way to go. I&#x27;m assuming once you get where you want to be that maintenance is easier than the initial use. The final verdict is still out.</li>
            <li> It hurts to use, but it is simple enough. It beats standing at the mirror using tweezers for a long time, and is cheaper than waxing. it even picked up the shorter hairs, just had to stretch the skin a bit. For it to work follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it a few time. My main complaint about it is that the instructions were not clear on how to use it. Thanks God for YouTube. Once you get the hang of how to use it it does work. It does hurt when pulling out the really fine hairs especially around the lip and right above the lip, but the key is it does work.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and it is very easy to use. Definitely not pain free like most reviews stated but it works wonders! So much better than shaving or waxing your facial hair.</li>
            <li> Received my R.E.M. Spring a few days ago, used it for the first time today. Based on my first use, I love it. I have gotten my upper lip threaded in the past, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to continue doing it. I attempted to thread myself at home (and wax), which did not work at all. This product is a perfect substitute. It grabs the hairs well. So long as you can handle inflicting the slight bit of pain it causes on yourself (which will improve as you continue to use it, as your hair will grow in more fine/thin), it works great! I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a cost efficient alternative to threading.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first.  I watched videos online about how to use it which helped a lot.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than tweezing.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you find yourself plucking or waxing to get rid of unwanted hair, this is definitely your product. First, minor but true, you don&#x27;t get the hand cramps you do using a tweezers. Second, this catches multiple hairs in one swoop, and you don&#x27;t need to be looking in a mirror to use it. It saves hassle, time, and you can use it anywhere you are (vs sitting in front of a mirror or holding one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it takes a bit of experimenting to get the right angles and get the most out of it, but you&#x27;ll figure it out, it&#x27;s not rocket science. The key trick is to rotate the handles or the spring to &#x27;catch&#x27; or &#x27;grab&#x27; hairs right off the skin. Often simply rolling it at an angle along the skin will grab hairs, but you&#x27;ll learn quickly how to get the most out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old woman going through &amp;#34;the change&amp;#34; and we all know that means more facial hair!  Up a couple of months ago, I was bleaching, but I could still notice the significant &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34;  I have tried waxing over the years and breakouts were the result.  Also creme hair removal doesn&#x27;t last at all.  I am olive-tone skinned and have pigment issues so I have not and will not try laser due to possibility of irreparable pigment damage in such an obvious place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the results.  Best product for lip hair removal I have used.  Warning.... the first time I used this product it took some practice and second, it took some getting used to the pinching of hair pulling (not like waxing), especially the first time when you have the most dense amount of hair to remove.  Thicker hairs are more difficult  to grab than thinner ones as will the ones at the lip. Some tweezing will be required for the occasional thick hair and strays.  BUT, honestly, maintenance is like plucking eyebrows but faster. Oh, and I recommend you use this at night before bed as with waxing, there may be some associated redness (normal) that may take some time to abate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The info below is at your own risk and it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will say I have developed a routine that for those who breakout like I do after any kind of hair removal has worked with REM Spring.  First, don&#x27;t wash you face with soap before.... just wipe gently with warm water to cleanse and open pores.  Use the product area by area.  Then on a cotton ball, gently apply some astringent or clarifier to close pores (will sting a bit).  The, I take Neosporin spray (not creme or gel) and spray the area cleared.  This disinfects the pores and I have had very few pimples from the process.</li>
            <li> Well there is better detailed reviews on how to use it but as far as it working it works! I am a believer and will never go back to tweezing. Try it!</li>
            <li> This thing has so helped my self esteem. the older I have gotten the more dang facial hair I have gotten. I have struggled for a long time to try and keep up with having it removed, but for one it gets expensive!! This little gadget works great it quick and easy. As for the pain I won&#x27;t lie the first time I used it it hurt n I put it down...so I tried it again the next day and didn&#x27;t seem as bad, really no worse than waxing and pretty much just like getting it done by the \\&quot;string lady at the mall\\&quot;  I go nowhere without this little gadget. The REM is a great product an will save you so much money in the long run!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had your eyebrows waxed, the sensation is similar when using this.  Easy to use and clean.  Does a great job!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does not work.  My family were all having &#x27;goes&#x27; at it and it just damages your skin. It is now somewhere in the recycling system.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my R.E.M. spring. I read a lot of the reviews and was nervous about how the pain people complained about but once I tried it, it was no big deal. It doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore then threading or waxing. I could see how some might not reap the benefits of it because if you can&#x27;t handle pain at all then trying to make yourself twist the spring could be mentally difficult.  I have had the product for about a month and use it maybe once a week (I must have slow hair growth?). I used it a lot when I first got it because I had a lot of &amp;#34;cleaning up&amp;#34; to do but after that initial week I&#x27;m down to once a week. There is minimal redness! Honestly, most the time I use it without any redness. When redness does occur, it only last for about 30 minutes. I told my mom and sister about it and they both purchased one and love it as much as I do. My sister was looking for a more cost effective hair removal method since she just graduated  college and wants to conserve her cash. My only concern (and this is for the future) is that in order to clean it properly you are supposed to gently pull the spring apart to separate the coils. Then you blow on it to clear out any hair. I think when excessive cleaning the spring might stretch and not be as effective in pulling hair out. I guess I will have to see as time passes. Even if that is the case, this product is so affordable it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to buy a new one every year/ two years/ whatever it ends up being. Great Product!!! Love it! Wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this gadget works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Removes the fine hair above my lip and those sneaky random hairs on my chin that shock me when I finally notice them in the mirror. Takes a little getting used to--you need to keep it bent as shown in the picture, keep turning the end pieces, and move in different directions--and it does sting just a bit as the hairs are removed--but the results are worth it. Also, works best when your skin is completely dry. Good price too compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be even better than threading at getting the hairs, without leaving the area raw or prone to acne (I would typically break out after a threading session).  Fantastic little tool - hurts like a son-of-a-gun the first time, but gets better after that, since you&#x27;re just maintaining.  Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It works on the little hairs.  I have to go over the same area multiple times to get darker hairs.  The problem is that I think it causes me to break out and has caused an in-grown hair.</li>
            <li> Whoever invented this thing is a genius!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few minutes to learn to use it effectively ... and I do recommend one reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to place your hands closer together than indicated by the handles. Works best for me when there&#x27;s only about two (maybe 3) inches of spring between my hands. And some areas you need to go over several times from different angles ... like around corners of mouth. It does help to push your tongue out underneath this area to make the skin taut. Yes, it pulls a bit, but, after all, you ARE pulling your hair out; you&#x27;d have to have nerve damage not to feel it. But if you&#x27;re working on a sensitive area, you have the control to go bit by bit and not rip it all out at once. I use it about once a week over most of my face for about an hour while watching TV. You kind of get into a zone with it and you stop noticing the pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll never use cream hair remover on my face again.</li>
            <li> It works well, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and is surprisingly easy to use. I&#x27;ve used it to get rid of my fine upper-lip hairs (i.e., mustache) as well as the hairs between my eyebrows and on my chinnie-chin-chin. I&#x27;m not especially adept with these kinds of instruments, so if I can use it, just about anyone can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the rave reviews and tried using it as instructed, and every way that was suggested in the reviews.  It picks a stray hair here and there, but would take forever to use for clean removal. UPDATE 4/8/15 Read the instructions for use by the first &amp;#34;most helpful&amp;#34; reviewer.  I was not twirling it the right way and was getting nothing.  It works VERY well if you do it properly.  I have light and sensitive skin and it was only red temporarily.  I use Johnson&#x27;s antibacterial wash and that numbs it as well as keeps the inflamation in check.</li>
            <li> My son saw me using this and tried it.  He said it works, but he felt the little accompanying sting.  I bought mine,&lt;br /&gt;used it sporadically and set it aside.  One day I started using it again as I admired the smoothness in my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;I use it when watching TV or the computer.  I still have to use tweezers on the thicker hairs, but the fine,&lt;br /&gt;difficult to remove hairs are gone with this marvelous device.  I use it twice a week and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I rapidly got used to how it feels and I would not go without this wonder.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked me to order a good product for facial hair removal. I searched and found this. I showed to my daughter and she did not want this product, need to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Love these things.  Especially this one.  Easy hair removal.  No negatives at all. Hurts a bit, but just a bit. No mess No fuss.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this product.  This is do quit and easy to use!!! I recommend this for the person that has those hairs that are annoying around the mouth.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing I have ever owned!!  Where has this been all my life!!  I read some of the reviews before I purchased and could not wait to try it.  It is so easy to use, my face is as smooth as a babies butt!  It works as quickly as you can move your fingers, no mess, no smell, no skin rashes.  You can use this anytime you have a few moments to yourself.  While watching the news or waiting for your cookies to bake!  You might even have to buy another one, if your daughter keeps borrowing yours.  Why pay several hundred dollars for the NoNo?  This works great and is affordable!</li>
            <li> I order this thingy to stop waxing. I have done it for years and now I have bad sun spots on my upper lip. I love how easy it is to use and how effective. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t discover this tool much earlier. It&#x27;s inexpensive, very easy to use, and it does great job very quickly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great for removal and control of chin hair growth.  Would recommend to any and all who have such needs</li>
            <li> Because I have some problem areas with facial hair. This thing pulls some out but misses a lot too and I can&#x27;t seem to use it without aid from my epilator and some tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love the R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover.  It does remove the facial hair in minutes.  It does not leave your face red nor does it have an unpleasant odor that you get with the creams.  However, it does  take a little getting use to.  It is a little uncomfortable the first time you use it but, it is not unbearable.  My daughter bought me this as a gift.  I, in return, bought one for my sister-in-law.  I would definitely  recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item!  I was not able to spend $50-100 on something to remove facial hair, so this item was just what I needed.  Hurts like heck when trying to get some of those stubborn facial hairs, but worth it!  Have recommended this product to many people.  Tip:  Use every other day so you don&#x27;t get a build up of a lot of hair.  This way, only a few are grabbed each time and it is not as painful.  Warning: The first time will make your eyes water if you have a lot of hair to remove.  It does get better, and using every few days keeps the pain to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work well, but you don&#x27;t have to put chemicals into your pores, and smell that artificial smell of cream or wax all day.  Waxing to me is too expensive and too painful.  The creams leave my skin pretty sensitive and red, and I am embarrassed to go out of the house for a day.  This is really nice, as you can do bits at a time really quick.  A plus:  it is made in Israel not China!!!  I also got the cheaper one they sell with the pink on the two ends.  That works okay, but not nearly as well as this one.  I got the cheap one to have in the car.  Definitely recommend this one.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This tool is much beter than the alternative waxing or plucking one by one.  It is not as painful (at least for me) as some reviews would make it seem.  Good for the upper lip, but there is a lot of realstate when you go beyond that.  It takes some time to get all the little hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had laser hair removal, so I must say I am a little bias, but this is actually a good tool. I prefer laser, but since I am watching my budget, I decided to try this. It is tricky to use, but you Will know when you are doing it correctly. When you feel it working, stay in that area until you don&#x27;t feel it grabbing anything else. Then move to the next area. It takes a little time, but it is worth it. It can be painful at first, but this will become tolerable as you use it more. I used ice cubes to slight numb an area before use.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of how to roll the spring along my skin, this product worked great!!  Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have never seen anything like this before. This is just so good I can&#x27;t describe how happy I am to have this! This is one of the most convenient way of removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong I tried a few methods before putting it away. It works great on the hair underneath the nose but don&#x27;t have much luck using it on the sides of my face near the chin. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me or the hairs are too short which I don&#x27;t think so. If you don&#x27;t have any patient on finding how to use the product correctly then save your money.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the product didn&#x27;t work.  Also, when I received the package the case was missing which make me believe that I was sent a used product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing! It saves me tons of time and is much easier than trying to look in the mirror and catch the right light to pluck each hair one by one. At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it was working, but then I was able to figure it out and it was catching hairs. It caught all the fine hairs, and the more course ones as well. It caught all the little hairs, not just the crazy ones that want to grow long. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to remove the hairs that weren&#x27;t a problem, but in the long run, this spring saves me a ton of time trying to eyeball the ones I want to remove, and I feel confident when I leave the house that no one is seeing any missed hairs. My face is completely smooth and I wish I had bought this years ago. You really can just use it while watching t.v., I keep it in my purse and if I feel any hairs coming in, I can quickly remove them. I like it so much I want to buy another one, because if I lose it, I won&#x27;t be able to live without it. I bought the R.E.M. spring after reading many reviews on just about every facial hair removal spring. I based my decision to buy this spring by reading other reviews and because it was the only one that states it is made of stainless steel. The others are steel that are covered with an anti allergenic coating. Stainless steel is hypo allergenic, and able to be  cleaned with rubbing alcohol, without worrying the coating is going to come off.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use straight out of the box, and I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this thing. It&#x27;s awesome. Buy it.</li>
            <li> yes great product  use it all the time</li>
            <li> I hate it.  Too hard to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Hurts slightly, yet works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and product was as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange to rate this 4-stars which Amazon equates to &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; because I certainly do not like the pain it inflicts on me. However, it does work at removing facial fuzz. But I don&#x27;t use it much as it hurts way more than tweezer plucking or facial threading. In fact, sometimes I&#x27;m not sure if it only removes facial hair. For the amount of pain it inflicts, I have a feeling it also removes some of my skin, or at least pinches it each time.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t work. I was pleasantly surprised. I sought this out because razors leave stubble, epilators are expensive, I don&#x27;t want strange hair removing chemicals on my face and my skin is too tan to bleach the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out while watching a movie. By the time the movie was over 99% of the hair above my lip was gone. It definitely takes practice though. I had to pause the movie and check my face out in the mirror for a bit. It&#x27;s great that this gadget can remove tiny and fine hairs! I just held it in the u-shape, twisted it and moved it up and down over the area. Make certain that the hair is pulled out and not simply tugged on by twisting in full movements rather than short and rapid movements. All in all this product is fantastic! This is so much better than shaving my face and getting razor cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use it everywhere on my face, because I&#x27;m pretty hairy. I use it on my chin, upper lip, cheeks and neck area. It is good at getting the fine hairs- I save the more wiry hairs for the tweezers. This is quicker than tweezers, but also pulling out multiple hairs makes the pain more tolerable. Keep it mind that sometimes it does not get every single hair- so use a razor or a pair of tweezers afterwards if you miss any. This is not the one tool for every single hair, but it&#x27;s definitely worth owning and using regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not hurt- the pain is not even as bad as a pin prick. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for removing the hair. If the pain bothers you- try a pain reliever. I took two ibuprofen before doing my entire face.</li>
            <li> this really works. after all these years of tweezing, bleaching, scissoring, etc. i had my doubts. after reading all the reviews decided it was worth the try. if u can put up with the stinging, u will love it.</li>
            <li> I got this today off Amazon after a fruitless local search for a threading tool. This had such good ratings, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does hurt. Is it horrible? Nah. The only *really* sensitive area is right above the lip. Other areas I was able to continue to use it without taking a break for a breather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine blonde hair on my face, but it gets a tad too long for my liking. Waxing and epilation there has proven to be a disaster for breakouts. I used this last night, and my face barely looked red even five minutes after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little bit to get the trick down to use it, but it was very easy to use. I&#x27;m excited to continue using this cost effective hair removal solution.</li>
            <li> I have been using different methods to remove some minor facial hair (you know the long occassional hair that wants to surface once you are over 40 :) mostly tweezing and i used facial removal creme for some fluffy hairs before.&lt;br /&gt;the product will definitely work, even as I see it very time consuming, but my biggest problem is that if your hair is as short as mine, as I maintain the growth every week, the hairs seemed way to short to be grabbed by the remover. It left to many hairs that were just slightly coming through the skin and if you came really really close to my face you would have noticed them even as i am light skinned and the hair grows in very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think I maybe will try it a few more times to make sure my technique is good, but I think my main issue will be that it is very time consuming. Oh and yes it does hurt, am sure with continued use as some stated you will get more used to that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall , for the price maybe worth a try to see if it works for you</li>
            <li> This product is the biggest piece of garbage.  Dont go by any of these reviews that say it is an amazing product.  Plain and simple...it does not work.  The people selling this product must be submitting the bogus reviews.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was finally where my skin was clear and after i used this i broke out bad. I thought maybe i  ate something that did it to me so i tried it again when my face was getting better and the same thing happened. They say its hypoallergenic, but to someone with sensitive skin, its not. It does do what it says it will do, but if you are prone to break out or have sensitive skin, might want to stick with thread.</li>
            <li> Love the REM. Easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it pulles your hair. It hurts but its not too bad. I am giving it 3 stars because my upper lip hair came back within less then a week.</li>
            <li> This will pull out *some* unwanted hairs, but skips right over others even after repeated attempts to remove them. But the reason I&#x27;m giving the product so few stars isn&#x27;t only due to that. I think the spring is treated with something (perhaps an oil of some sort?) that causes raised bumps on my chin. It&#x27;s like an odd kind of acne and looks to me like an allergic reaction. Most unpleasant. (These bumps aren&#x27;t from pinching; I didn&#x27;t experience the pain that others have mentioned. Also, the spots didn&#x27;t show up immediately. There was a delay between using the spring and the bumps starting to emerge.) I would warn anyone with sensitive skin and/or allergies to look for another hair-removal product. I tossed it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I took some Benedryl for a couple days and that got rid of the skin reaction.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I do not have much facial hair; however, I am a girl and I want to get rid of any hair on the upper lip area. So I bought this and it works like a charm. It tears me up as it removes the hair, but soon you get used to the pain for you to finish rest of the procedure. I usually do this (once every 2 weeks) after I wash my face at night (to remove any bacteria off my face first). After removing the hair, I lightly rinse out the upper lip with warm water and pat it dry. Then I place a thin layer of aloe vera gel on the upper lip to calm down the skin and prevent possible infection.</li>
            <li> I love it. its cheap but does the job. At first, it&#x27;s kinda tricky to use but you will learn how to use it after a while. Now you don&#x27;t need to buy an expensive epilator, or electronic hair remover. I totally recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;But note that this is good for facial hair only.</li>
            <li> No more creams or waxes for me.  Once you get the hang of it this product is so easy to use and it pulls out a lot of hair at one time.  It does sting when using it but that&#x27;s what happens when you&#x27;re plucking multiple hairs at one time.  And the price is awesome...it&#x27;s saving me time and money</li>
            <li> Who knew that this little strange looking tool would actually work! But, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. You kind of have to get the hang of it, but once you do, it works great. I wish I would have found this 20 years ago.  All the great reviews on Amazon always help me in my decision when purchasing anything.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is a keeper!! I have tried several products to eliminate embarrassing facial hair and I finally found what I have been looking for. Who knew - just a simple spring!! Don&#x27;t be afraid of reviews about the pain - yes, it is a little uncomfortable in certain areas, but trust me it is NOT PAINFUL! But most of all, IT WORKS!!As far as tips for technique... what worked best for me was to slightly bend the spring, place it below where I want to begin hair removal and then twist the ends back and forth as I slowly moved it up my skin. Some have stated to move the ends counter-clockwise of each other - if that works for you, great, but this is what I found is easiest and best results for me. Also, for those tight places, such as the sides of the face against the ear... I found that still bending the spring but putting one side of the spring against where you want the hair removed worked the best. Even the side of the spring will remove the hair. As far as cleaning or getting those hairs out of the spring - I found that if I held on to both ends and quickly pulled the spring apart and snapped it back together quickly removed the hair - in addition, pull the spring apart and blow on it very hard. That&#x27;s all it took! If you have facial hair you want to get rid of - get this product!!</li>
            <li> This product is really easy to use and is very efficient. I love that it pulls the hair from the roots. Other than hurting a little if you&#x27;re using it for the first time it&#x27;s great! I would imagine less pain with frequent use. Also, it looks like it&#x27;s easy to clean. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use any chemicals to remove unwanted facial hair!</li>
            <li> Good for sideburns where you have room,  not so good in tight spaces.  Ended up going back to waxing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the number of reviews here. I actually started looking for a facial hair shaver when I came across this. I was so curious and doubtful if it really works but I gave it a try and bought it. Threading is not something new to me but i want to try if I can do it by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You will be frustrated at first but when you get the hang of it, this product really works. I loved it and wish I had discovered this years ago. One just needs to master the \\&quot;art\\&quot; of turning the side ends to make it work.</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome.It is so handy and easy to clean and store.It is so small you can take it with you on your trips.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. It&#x27;s small and efficient. It works really well. It&#x27;s just like threading (so you can try to understand the pain level). It will hurt but it is worth it. There are cheaper versions of this out there, I am not sure how similar they are but I think I will try purchasing one of those too to see. The spring is made of stainless steel and you can easily carry it in your purse (Great for when you catch some hairs looking in the car mirror!)</li>
            <li> Lol...so I may be overstating a bit but this thing is the answer to my facial hair problems. I have been searching high and low for a hair(and I had a lot of it) removal system/device for over a year and  I&#x27;m not gonna bore you with my story because you probably already know it. This gadget is amazing. A little painful but I numbed my face with ice first and barely felt a thing(I&#x27;m a wuss). But a low cost semi painful experience is so worth the result of smooth(yes smooth) skin. At less than 20 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, yeah it hurts the worst the first time...but this thing still hurts like the dickens every time I use it!  but it WORKS!  I recommend fully...I also recommend twirling your fingers as fast as possible to just yank out the hairs and not slowly plucking them out hahaha...they need to make a hand held automatic one of these....that spun fast and you could just get it over with quickly hahah I love this though woowoo!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this but found that it doesn&#x27;t work. At all. It may have pulled out the odd hair or two, but in NO WAY did do what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li> This little tool is easy to use, easy to keep with you in your makeup kit and I have decided I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> It really is a good product and very timely in delivery. I am still trying to get the proper technique, but it will come soon. Glad something so simple like this exist.</li>
            <li> As I got older, my moustache became more noticable.  Even when I bleached it, the hairs were still noticable and the bleach job never lasted very long.  The other reviews of this product were very helpful.  It does take a little bit of practice to get the correct curve and twisting motion, but once you &amp;#34;get it&amp;#34;, it really does pull the hair off and leave your skin smooth.  There are still  a couple of spots where I just haven&#x27;t figured out the perfect contour, but overall this item has worked wonderfully.  I only wish I would have ordered this a long time ago and not spent so many years with an ugly lipline.</li>
            <li> After trying wax strips for the first time 4 weeks ago, I still have a patch of red skin. I think some of the wax stayed on and my skin was weeping and really painful for about 10 days. So I decided to look for something else and came across this little device. First few times I used it I wasn&#x27;t getting much hair, but I persevered and now I&#x27;ve got the hang of it. I use it a little every day for a few minutes and I really love the way it gets rid of the peach fuzz and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated. There is a little minor pain, less than tweezing and a little redness. I just rinse after with cold water and my skin looks great. I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> The R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover is easy to use and does the job.  Better than tweezing and waxing by far!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  But it worked! Yes it pinches purchasing its better than harsh creams and expensive salon waxes. It will be well worth the the money. Should pay for itself itself in a couple months.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of buying hair removing products, this is for you. It saves time and money, and is really easy to use. My face was a little red after the first few uses (like it would be with waxing) but it faded quickly. This product is a must-buy!</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product years ago. I BURNED my face every time I used cream remover and I&#x27;ve tried every brand. Waxing and threading scare me, especially upper lip. I used the REM as soon as it arrived and am very pleased. There is minimal discomfort, and a little bit of finagling in order to find the best hand position at first , but it WORKS. And no redness or irritation. Within minutes I was able to watch tv and use at the same time. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hard to maneuver initially, but once you get the hang of it...piece of cake! Also, doesn&#x27;t get all hairs, but reduces tweezing significantly.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for facial hair:  bleaching, depilatory cream, shaving, wax.  It worked easily, quickly, and thoroughly. It was very slightly uncomfortable, but I have used wax which probably toughened the area.  Also, this spring didn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all like waxing or dipilatory.  I had developed a darkening at the mustache area and after researching it found it could be do to irritating hair removal products.  It was pretty embarrassing and took about a year to get it to lighten with prescription cream.  I have heard that some companies falsely rate their own products and I can assure you that I am thrilled with this item.  Gotta tell my mom and sister!  Try it you will like it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the REM Spring Facial Hair Remover from the seller. The item did not arrive with the velvet pouch that this should come in. I contacted the seller regarding the issue but there is no reply yet on the replacement. I&#x27;m assuming that they have sent me a previously returned product because the box opening flaps were worn out like it has been opened before. I did end up with little red bumps all over my face. The product does work as advertised. Do not use on the eyebrows. After using this product, I&#x27;m ambivalent about the justification of spending $20 on this. You&#x27;re going to want to buy some rubbing alcohol so that the spring can be cleaned out after each use. It is painful and it&#x27;s a time consuming process since the spring wont grab all the hair at once. However the process is much more pleasant than individually plucking the hairs out.</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;ve been suffering with facial hair since a teenager. I&#x27;ve tweezed, waxed, hair cream removers. You name it I&#x27;ve  done it. The downside to my facial hair is I always developed severe acne in the area where I removed the hair. And only it that Area. So I realized the acne was coming from my hair removal method! The spring works quick no irritation. And I&#x27;m not developing the usual bumps. As far as painful I guess because I pluck so often my face is use to it so it wasn&#x27;t painful. Keep in mind this is a early review I will up date my review in 2 weeks!!! HAPPY HAIR REMOVAL!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works like a charm.  Your face will be smooth!  It&#x27;s ouchie around the nose/upper lip area, cheeks not so bad.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face felt the next day when I washed.  I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about it and ...Wow!  This device is small, handy, easily stored and effective and inexpensive for what it can do.  Get it.</li>
