            <li> Love elf! Good makeup</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. All of the powders were intact. The matte colors are very pigmented and the shimmery colors are very nice as accent colors. Most of the neutral colors are matte and the vibrant colors are shimmery. Definitely would recommend.</li>

            <li> Got for a friend and it cane in plenty of time and the colors are beautiful. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Goes on nicely. I like that there are matte and shimmer colors.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, hence the festive everyday label. I think it&#x27;s pretty great and you can mix all sorts of colors. The quality is really pretty good for the price!</li>
            <li> Love e.l.f. and this was a cute set! I can&#x27;t remember what I paid, but I am willing to bet I could have got it cheaper at the store.</li>

Unfortunately, their multi-color make-up book was a promo product.  I was disappointed but determined to buy something that I liked for travel as well as the application and color selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure if I would like anything else but thought I would give this e.l.f. product a try...and I am so glad I did.  The price and the quality was wonderful.  The colors are smooth and easy to apply...no clumping or running and blend easily.  I keep my 48 piece eye makeup book in my to-go travel bag at all times...the size is just right.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 9 year old daughter to play make up.  She loves all the colors.</li>
            <li> I love these colors! They last ALL day through.</li>
            <li> I love this for travel. It closes up nicely and fits in my toiletry bag.</li>
