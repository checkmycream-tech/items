            <li>I had the expectation that it would be good for the Summer, but the expiration date is August 1, 3 1/2 months from purchase date.</li>
            <li>The powder seems good though.</li>

            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I have incredibly fair skin</li>
            <li>This is the best hands free stuff I have found.  </li>

            <li>I love this powder!  </li>
            <li>I just use this as a powder on top of my foundation and go!</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 of these for travel, home and for my daughter to keep in her PE locker at school and we love them!</li>
            <li>Feels light and great and</li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic with great coverage, but it&#x27;s the brush that will prevent me from reordering.  </li>
            <li>The powder finishes liquid makeup nicely or used alone keeps my oily face from ...</li>
            <li>This fits the bill really nicely.</li>
            <li>I pour the powder in my own dispenser brush.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and burn easily</li>
            <li>It is very good at absorbing oil on my face giving me a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the design, but the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply, has no color, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and goes nicely over my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love all things PeterThomasRoth</li>
            <li>so your powder doesn&#x27;t spill out.  :)</li>
            <li>You must check to make sure it&#x27;s blended in or</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>It probably would be better with some tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;That said I will continue to use this as I am satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth products.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is fantastic!</li>
            <li>was expecting something lighter- more translucent</li>
            <li>I am sure I lost some product during this exercise.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product is a powdered form of spf.</li>
            <li>will be buying more stuff from them</li>
            <li>Love it, gave it a  4 since the powder comes out and goes all over the place</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but I don&#x27;t understand why it can&#x27;t just be a powder.</li>
            <li>Sure it may work, but it dumps a ton out at once.</li>
            <li>I buy a bottle of this EVERY summer and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the conceptualization of this product.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but PTR executes it flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Instead of a tube of chapstick, it more resembles a syringe, not convenient at all.</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like is the bristles break off on my skin, and when you try to brush them off with the brush more break off.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>If you get really sweaty you will need to reapply but it works great.</li>
            <li>I believe this may have been a good product, but the applicator is confusing at best.  </li>
            <li>I would order it again based on what I have experienced thus far.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to sunscreen on your face, this will probably be a great product to try.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I think the powder is really good.  </li>
            <li>The packaging makes it really easy to just throw it in your purse and go.</li>
            <li>It also allows me to reapply easily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>They are also so easy to use on my kids.</li>
            <li>it supposed to be easy to use, after makeup just put it on and re-apply whenever you need.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use, and so convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to put on</li>
            <li>I like to keep it with me in my bag for easy application any time the sun comes out and surprises me</li>
            <li>This seems to do a better job with super oily summer skin and the 30 spf</li>
            <li>Not only the price is great, it is so easy to use and so practical.</li>
            <li>My skin also didn&#x27;t break out, which is a huge problem for me with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The coverage is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great for ears and the back of the neck</li>
            <li>The sunscreen works great, but getting the cap back on is a bugger.</li>
            <li>they are cruelty free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t affect makeup at all.  </li>
            <li>Use this daily... so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunblock for my face--doesn&#x27;t gum up my pores, easy to apply/reapply, works as soon as you put it on (unlike liquid sunblock that leaves you unprotected for the first 15 minutes you have it on).  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this can&#x27;t be applied without a mirror and excellent lighting, so it kind of defeats the purpose of it being a quick touch</li>
            <li>I have tried this twice so far and have really liked it.</li>
            <li>I am not always sure how much I am getting on at each use.</li>
            <li>am fair, yet even so I have to be careful to apply it lightly.</li>
            <li>I can quickly dust my son&#x27;s face before he darts.  </li>
            <li>it ran out quickly.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really make sense if you are trying to protect your skin from the sun!!</li>
            <li>i love it, it so simple and easy to use</li>
            <li>Now if you are going to be able to be by your self when you apply multiple times a day, then fine.</li>
            <li>I really like this its so light</li>
            <li>It works great for the scalp, but I did put it on my face for a few days, and it severely clogged my pores on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It really does a fantastic job eliminating shine.  </li>
            <li>Its just ok, I don&#x27;t feel enough powder comes out to do a good enough job.</li>
            <li>The brush is rough and doesn&#x27;t feel good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural job of protecting my face from the sun since it was caked on in no time &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Sunscreen should not contain Retinyl Palmitate, it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>and it cracked pretty quickly causing the power to leak</li>
            <li>I say this because it states right on the package that if you don&#x27;t see powder coming out, to tap the brush.</li>
            <li>but this is a great additional go to at the last minute or in general.</li>
            <li>It would be more environmentally responsible to make a refill rather than purchase a new brush every time.</li>
            <li>I am healing my face from past sun damage and this works great in terms of sunscreen because it allows me to protect my skin while wearing make up.</li>
            <li>Makes me much more likely to use sunscreen when I leave the house.</li>
            <li>For the price, the packaging should be higher quality.</li>
            <li>A good product, but not if it runs out after a few days.</li>
            <li>The brush is a bit cheap as other people have stated but not annoyingly so.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use this product, just tap it against your hand or solid surface.  </li>
            <li>and this seemed to cut down on the shine and was very easy to use midday to cover any unwanted shine that I did have.</li>
            <li>I actually think it gives light coverage as well.</li>
            <li>It really did not work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>How can you give a product review if the stuff won&#x27;t even come out of the package?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while following instructions and &#x27;pressing bristles lightly against skin,&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that said bristles are falling out and landing all over my face.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t tell is</li>
            <li>this pricey product is really accomplishing anything on my face.  </li>
            <li>I manged to pull the whole lot off, all the powders gone everywhere in bathroom.</li>
            <li>Be careful with the end that it&#x27;s secure!</li>
            <li>Also, no matter how much I rub it around my face, nothing comes out.  </li>
            <li>My skin becomes very oily after a 1/2 hour so dosent work for me</li>
            <li>Very practical thing</li>
            <li>But the ease of application and gentleness on sensitive skin are worth the costs.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li>I have very oily and greasy face.  </li>
            <li>I love using it without feeling oily afterwards, which I am used to with other spf products</li>
            <li>Not only did it keep my skin matte and fabulous all day in the water, but my super white skin didn&#x27;t burn...which never happens.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice long lasting matte surface.  </li>
            <li>great product, arrived earlier than expected, will use the site in the future.</li>
            <li>We have had all 3 for quite some time and they still have plenty of powder in each, and since we live in Florida, we use them A LOT!</li>
            <li>Meh, I bought because I live in a very humid climate, and reviews said it stopped your face from getting all greasy and shiny in the humidity.</li>
            <li>I use another daily SPF but love to put this in my purse when I&#x27;m going to be outside all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to secure it</li>
            <li>While the Colorscience was more expensive, it was worth the extra $$ Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It also come with two little face masks that were amazing and buying the cream later on.</li>
            <li>This product also arrived with free samples of other Roth products .</li>
            <li>Not only does this provide instant almost all natural sun protection it absorbs excess oil and makes your skin look smooth.</li>
            <li>As a general rule, I love PTR products, but this was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, dirt works better...and makes you look super tan too!</li>
            <li>just pull the bottom straight out to replace the cap and then push the brush back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 9 year old sun has sensitive skin and eczema and this product does not irritate him at all</li>
            <li>Second, it really didn&#x27;t take away any shine as I hoped it would.  </li>
            <li>I could never tell how much was actually coming out.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>Yet alone the embarrassment of having to reapply in the bush it looks like you are using enough powder to cover your whole body.</li>
            <li>As I was trying to figure this out, a good size quantity of the rather expensive product was lost.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product, but I have a few gripes about it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone especially oily and acne problem skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have purchased this same product at the local beauty store nearby and it lasted a much longer time.</li>
            <li>The major appeal was the design when I purchased it</li>
            <li>you can barely feel it.  </li>
            <li>I am using this for summer instead of bare escentuals mineral veil.  </li>
            <li>For the price I expected much better quality, at least something that won&#x27;t fall apart and get my eyes.</li>

            <li> The sunscreen works great, but getting the cap back on is a bugger.</li>
            <li> they are cruelty free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t affect makeup at all.  </li>
            <li> Use this daily... so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunblock for my face--doesn&#x27;t gum up my pores, easy to apply/reapply, works as soon as you put it on (unlike liquid sunblock that leaves you unprotected for the first 15 minutes you have it on).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this can&#x27;t be applied without a mirror and excellent lighting, so it kind of defeats the purpose of it being a quick touch</li>
            <li> I have tried this twice so far and have really liked it.</li>
            <li> I am not always sure how much I am getting on at each use.</li>
            <li> am fair, yet even so I have to be careful to apply it lightly.</li>
            <li> I can quickly dust my son&#x27;s face before he darts.  </li>
            <li> it ran out quickly.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really make sense if you are trying to protect your skin from the sun!!</li>
            <li> i love it, it so simple and easy to use</li>
            <li> Now if you are going to be able to be by your self when you apply multiple times a day, then fine.</li>
            <li> I really like this its so light</li>
            <li> It works great for the scalp, but I did put it on my face for a few days, and it severely clogged my pores on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It really does a fantastic job eliminating shine.  </li>
            <li> Its just ok, I don&#x27;t feel enough powder comes out to do a good enough job.</li>
            <li> The brush is rough and doesn&#x27;t feel good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural job of protecting my face from the sun since it was caked on in no time &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Sunscreen should not contain Retinyl Palmitate, it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> and it cracked pretty quickly causing the power to leak</li>
            <li> I say this because it states right on the package that if you don&#x27;t see powder coming out, to tap the brush.</li>
            <li> but this is a great additional go to at the last minute or in general.</li>
            <li> It would be more environmentally responsible to make a refill rather than purchase a new brush every time.</li>
            <li> I am healing my face from past sun damage and this works great in terms of sunscreen because it allows me to protect my skin while wearing make up.</li>
            <li> Makes me much more likely to use sunscreen when I leave the house.</li>
            <li> For the price, the packaging should be higher quality.</li>
            <li> A good product, but not if it runs out after a few days.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit cheap as other people have stated but not annoyingly so.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use this product, just tap it against your hand or solid surface.  </li>
            <li> and this seemed to cut down on the shine and was very easy to use midday to cover any unwanted shine that I did have.</li>
            <li> I actually think it gives light coverage as well.</li>
            <li> It really did not work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> How can you give a product review if the stuff won&#x27;t even come out of the package?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while following instructions and &#x27;pressing bristles lightly against skin,&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that said bristles are falling out and landing all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t tell is</li>
            <li> this pricey product is really accomplishing anything on my face.  </li>
            <li> I manged to pull the whole lot off, all the powders gone everywhere in bathroom.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the end that it&#x27;s secure!</li>
            <li> Also, no matter how much I rub it around my face, nothing comes out.  </li>
            <li> My skin becomes very oily after a 1/2 hour so dosent work for me</li>
            <li> Very practical thing</li>
            <li> But the ease of application and gentleness on sensitive skin are worth the costs.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li> I have very oily and greasy face.  </li>
            <li> I love using it without feeling oily afterwards, which I am used to with other spf products</li>
            <li> Not only did it keep my skin matte and fabulous all day in the water, but my super white skin didn&#x27;t burn...which never happens.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice long lasting matte surface.  </li>
            <li> great product, arrived earlier than expected, will use the site in the future.</li>
            <li> We have had all 3 for quite some time and they still have plenty of powder in each, and since we live in Florida, we use them A LOT!</li>
            <li> Meh, I bought because I live in a very humid climate, and reviews said it stopped your face from getting all greasy and shiny in the humidity.</li>
            <li> I use another daily SPF but love to put this in my purse when I&#x27;m going to be outside all day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to secure it</li>
            <li> While the Colorscience was more expensive, it was worth the extra $$ Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It also come with two little face masks that were amazing and buying the cream later on.</li>
            <li> This product also arrived with free samples of other Roth products .</li>
            <li> Not only does this provide instant almost all natural sun protection it absorbs excess oil and makes your skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> As a general rule, I love PTR products, but this was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, dirt works better...and makes you look super tan too!</li>
            <li> just pull the bottom straight out to replace the cap and then push the brush back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 9 year old sun has sensitive skin and eczema and this product does not irritate him at all</li>
            <li> Second, it really didn&#x27;t take away any shine as I hoped it would.  </li>
            <li> I could never tell how much was actually coming out.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> Yet alone the embarrassment of having to reapply in the bush it looks like you are using enough powder to cover your whole body.</li>
            <li> As I was trying to figure this out, a good size quantity of the rather expensive product was lost.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product, but I have a few gripes about it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone especially oily and acne problem skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have purchased this same product at the local beauty store nearby and it lasted a much longer time.</li>
            <li> The major appeal was the design when I purchased it</li>
            <li> you can barely feel it.  </li>
            <li> I am using this for summer instead of bare escentuals mineral veil.  </li>
            <li> For the price I expected much better quality, at least something that won&#x27;t fall apart and get my eyes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint but minor is that it can be a bit messy due to packaging other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> but let&#x27;s see how long it will last - 0.15 Ounce only.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 3 stars since it seems the product did not last very long</li>
            <li> I have dark brown skin that is sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li> Also this products lasts a long time considering how often I use it.</li>
            <li> But in a situation that you are outside and can&#x27;t just run off and privately powder an entire room with one tap, you are going to make a few people choke.</li>
            <li> It is so much quicker &amp; less messy than making them sit still while I rub cream on every crevice of their faces, necks, ears, etc.</li>
            <li> sure the bottom is twisted on tightly and didn&#x27;t become loose during shipping</li>
            <li> the bristles fell off on my face and stuck to it every single time I used it.</li>
            <li> I had to rub it really hard across the back of my hand several times to finally see something come out</li>
            <li> only negative really is that if you throw it in a purse or makeup bag the plastic lid always breaks, not a huge issue for me because I use it at home.</li>
            <li> It is not quite translucent and if not careful leaves your face unevenly colored.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever have problems with acne or easily get clogged pores, so this was disappointing.</li>
            <li> , I was sad to read that a reviewer actually questioned the legitimacy of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because the brush is rough but it was a problem for my skin.</li>
            <li> The brush does not really retract into the packaging</li>
            <li> The brush was low quality and kept leaving little black hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the other reviewers who made negative comments about the packaging, and I am highly skeptical of all those positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but I probably will look into other products to try instead.  </li>
            <li> I have extreme oily skin</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> so if you are wearing black , be careful.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the brush back in the cap holder ...</li>
            <li> However, like some other reviewers pointed out, the  brush leaves dark black hairs on your face.  </li>
            <li> One thing that kinda sucks is that when you close it sometimes that actually opens the bottom of the product and all the powder comes out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to actually see it when applied so</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t check in a mirror I end up walking around with black hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have little, dark hairs floating on your face, or elsewhere, for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> what a mess.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, but sometimes it can get a little messy and puff out product when you put it away.</li>
            <li> The bristles are harsh and scratchy and they break off leaving little bits of bristle all over your face and in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be to rough or hard.</li>
            <li> Finally, I was not impressed at how rough the bristles felt.  </li>
            <li> My husband refs and has one on him to apply in just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> It provides coverage without being heavy.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> /sweat off, as it&#x27;s just powder, and it&#x27;s not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the brush is a little stiff, but it is a small price to pay to not have to fuss with creams and lotions that make me break out.</li>
            <li> The brush is really course, which makes it unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> The product makes it very difficult for you to control how much powder you want to apply so it seems like you get nothing</li>
            <li> or you get so much product that you get a cloud of dust everywhere (a very expensive dust, might I add).</li>
            <li> so I am not sure why some reviews says that it does.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I stopped using it, and let the African dirt do</li>
            <li> Not sure why they don&#x27;t have that on this...</li>
            <li> It just occasionally leaves broken bits of brush behind.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it lasts all day at school but at least he starts out with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> While I am sorry others haven&#x27;t had the same experience as I have had, I am hoping that some of the problems have been due to defective units and that people are not just giving bad reviews due to user-error.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but the brush is AWFUL!</li>
            <li> but this thing is so hard to pull.</li>
            <li> It is such an uncomfortably, scratchy bristle brush, and it leaves bits of bristles behind on your face.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to reapply your sunscreen every few hours, but since I wear makeup it makes it difficult to apply a liquid throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> however, this product was a waste of money and a severe disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the seller got a bad lot shipment or</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can also have a weird scent.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush seems to clog.</li>
            <li> It takes effort to get the powder out and difficult to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li> cap is very thin plastic</li>
            <li> I am a soccer mom living in Michigan and hate to reapply a cream sunscreen when its so humid.  </li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never use this because the design of the brush and lid are awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this powder!  I love all things PeterThomasRoth and this is no exception.  The powder finishes liquid makeup nicely or used alone keeps my oily face from ...well being too oily.  Feels light and great and the witch hazel is great for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the bottom is twisted on tightly and didn&#x27;t become loose during shipping so your powder doesn&#x27;t spill out.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also just pull the bottom straight out to replace the cap and then push the brush back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative really is that if you throw it in a purse or makeup bag the plastic lid always breaks, not a huge issue for me because I use it at home.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my car and it&#x27;s convenient and works.  You must check to make sure it&#x27;s blended in or it shows.  I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I am a soccer mom living in Michigan and hate to reapply a cream sunscreen when its so humid.  I also use this on my scalp where my hair parts.  My husband refs and has one on him to apply in just a few seconds.  My 9 year old sun has sensitive skin and eczema and this product does not irritate him at all so I am not sure why some reviews says that it does.  Soccer kids line up for me to apply this sunscreen.  Also this products lasts a long time considering how often I use it.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me. It provides coverage without being heavy. I use it over my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I am fair, yet even so I have to be careful to apply it lightly. It probably would be better with some tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;That said I will continue to use this as I am satisfied with the result. And since it&#x27;s convenient to carry I can reapply for continuous sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 3 stars since it seems the product did not last very long and I have purchased this same product at the local beauty store nearby and it lasted a much longer time. Not sure if the seller got a bad lot shipment or what but I probably will look into other products to try instead.  I do like the fact it has an SPF30 but do not like you cannot take the brush off and wash it 1x a week as I do w/any of my make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.. its so convenient to have sunscreen, thats also mineral coverage.  I really like this its so light you can barely feel it.  I love Peter Thomas Roth products.  I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I needed something to put over the sunscreen I put around my eyes that would keep me from sweating. This fits the bill really nicely. I don&#x27;t wear it as sunscreen by itself, but I do like to put it over my sunscreen to have a smoother finish.</li>
            <li> great product, arrived earlier than expected, will use the site in the future. This product also arrived with free samples of other Roth products .</li>
            <li> Hard to get the brush back in the cap holder ... No retractable brush.  Powder flies all over.</li>
            <li> I am using this for summer instead of bare escentuals mineral veil.  This seems to do a better job with super oily summer skin and the 30 spf is an added bonus.  It has a luminescent quality to it and does mattify the skin.  I was having some breakouts and they seem to be under control with the help of this.</li>
            <li> item came damaged powder all spilt all over looked used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with oily skin and doesn&#x27;t leave the ashy look that some SPF powders cause for darker-skinned people. I actually think it gives light coverage as well. The packaging makes it really easy to just throw it in your purse and go. It defintely leaves a nice matte finish, great over foundation or sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It really did not work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This was the best purchase. Not only did it keep my skin matte and fabulous all day in the water, but my super white skin didn&#x27;t burn...which never happens. My skin also didn&#x27;t break out, which is a huge problem for me with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use another daily SPF but love to put this in my purse when I&#x27;m going to be outside all day. Works well.</li>
            <li> As a general rule, I love PTR products, but this was a complete waste of my money. I completely agree with the other reviewers who made negative comments about the packaging, and I am highly skeptical of all those positive reviews. How can you give a product review if the stuff won&#x27;t even come out of the package?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while following instructions and &#x27;pressing bristles lightly against skin,&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that said bristles are falling out and landing all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried this twice so far and have really liked it. I have very oily skin and this seemed to cut down on the shine and was very easy to use midday to cover any unwanted shine that I did have. I would order it again based on what I have experienced thus far.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product, but I have a few gripes about it.  It is not quite translucent and if not careful leaves your face unevenly colored.  Second, it really didn&#x27;t take away any shine as I hoped it would.  Sometimes it can also have a weird scent.  Finally, I was not impressed at how rough the bristles felt.  I can&#x27;t see myself buying this again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t follow the directions NOT to twist it and it broke.</li>
            <li> Just like from Sephora, only cheaper!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is fantastic! I have dark brown skin that is sensitive and acne prone. This product is the solution to keep oil at bay and protect from the sun. Also does not leave me ashy looking.  Yay!</li>
            <li> was expecting something lighter- more translucent</li>
            <li> I recommend this product! I have extreme oily skin and I can&#x27;t take.&lt;br /&gt;And this as both to control, it controls the oil on my face and has SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use this product, just tap it against your hand or solid surface.  I like it because it keeps shine away.</li>
            <li> The brushes from this product broke me out. I don&#x27;t know if it is because the brush is rough but it was a problem for my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush seems to clog. I suppose you could use a spray brush cleaner, but I prefer to actually wash my brushes. I needed to remove the powder and store it, wash the brush and then return the powder to the handle. I am sure I lost some product during this exercise.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, but sometimes it can get a little messy and puff out product when you put it away.</li>
            <li> I am healing my face from past sun damage and this works great in terms of sunscreen because it allows me to protect my skin while wearing make up. It also allows me to reapply easily throughout the day. Total thumbs up. I just use this as a powder on top of my foundation and go!</li>
            <li> Not only does this provide instant almost all natural sun protection it absorbs excess oil and makes your skin look smooth. I would choose this over liquid sunscreen any day.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is a powdered form of spf. Makes me much more likely to use sunscreen when I leave the house. Plus it acts as a concealer and is supposed to help with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is sunblock. I had the expectation that it would be good for the Summer, but the expiration date is August 1, 3 1/2 months from purchase date. I plan to return it.</li>
            <li> awesome she loves them! I could not find anything like these anywhere else. will be buying more stuff from them</li>
            <li> on my skin and I really can&#x27;t tell is this pricey product is really accomplishing anything on my face.  Don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these for travel, home and for my daughter to keep in her PE locker at school and we love them! We have had all 3 for quite some time and they still have plenty of powder in each, and since we live in Florida, we use them A LOT! Yes, the brush is a little stiff, but it is a small price to pay to not have to fuss with creams and lotions that make me break out. They are also so easy to use on my kids. It is so much quicker &amp; less messy than making them sit still while I rub cream on every crevice of their faces, necks, ears, etc. and then having sunscreen all over my hands, in between my fingers and under my wedding ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was sad to read that a reviewer actually questioned the legitimacy of the positive reviews. While I am sorry others haven&#x27;t had the same experience as I have had, I am hoping that some of the problems have been due to defective units and that people are not just giving bad reviews due to user-error. I say this because it states right on the package that if you don&#x27;t see powder coming out, to tap the brush. I have been doing this from the start and have had no problems at all. I just tap the tube against the back of my hand and when I see powder coming out, I apply. Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> So the portability is great and it works as it should. My only complaint but minor is that it can be a bit messy due to packaging other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I think the powder is really good.  I use it as a last touch after I apply my makeup.  It provides a nice long lasting matte surface.  BUT the applicator is a mystery. It has a lot of moving parts (\\&quot;don&#x27;t twist, just push pull, shake...\\&quot;).  It takes effort to get the powder out and difficult to apply evenly.  The powder seems good though.</li>
            <li> I could never tell how much was actually coming out.  There was no satisfaction in using this product because I couldn&#x27;t see if it was actually being applied onto my face.</li>
            <li> it supposed to be easy to use, after makeup just put it on and re-apply whenever you need. but this thing is so hard to pull. I manged to pull the whole lot off, all the powders gone everywhere in bathroom. what a mess.</li>
            <li> I received one of these as a gift a couple of years ago and I really loved it and it lasted for months. Then I ordered a couple for myself, and there was almost nothing in them. A good product, but not if it runs out after a few days.</li>
            <li> Its just ok, I don&#x27;t feel enough powder comes out to do a good enough job.</li>
            <li> Great product for on the run! Be careful with the end that it&#x27;s secure!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers.  The brush is rough and doesn&#x27;t feel good on my skin.  Also, no matter how much I rub it around my face, nothing comes out.  I had to rub it really hard across the back of my hand several times to finally see something come out and then it was chalky looking.  This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> My skin becomes very oily after a 1/2 hour so dosent work for me</li>
            <li> Very practical thing but let&#x27;s see how long it will last - 0.15 Ounce only. So far I like it; I appreciate that it&#x27;s colourless too.</li>
            <li> Great product to use in the afternoon when your face gets oily, takes away shine and also provides sunscreen, two in one. Love it, gave it a  4 since the powder comes out and goes all over the place so if you are wearing black , be careful.</li>
            <li> cap is very thin plastic and it cracked pretty quickly causing the power to leak</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but I don&#x27;t understand why it can&#x27;t just be a powder. The brush was low quality and kept leaving little black hairs on my face. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to dispense enough of the p</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use, and so convenient. If you are sensitive to sunscreen on your face, this will probably be a great product to try. Just feels like make-up.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but the brush is AWFUL! The bristles are harsh and scratchy and they break off leaving little bits of bristle all over your face and in your eyes. So annoying/irritating. For the price I expected much better quality, at least something that won&#x27;t fall apart and get my eyes.</li>
            <li> Sure it may work, but it dumps a ton out at once. Now if you are going to be able to be by your self when you apply multiple times a day, then fine. But in a situation that you are outside and can&#x27;t just run off and privately powder an entire room with one tap, you are going to make a few people choke. I had to share a room with a group in Africa and putting this on was a nightmare. Yet alone the embarrassment of having to reapply in the bush it looks like you are using enough powder to cover your whole body. Needless to say I stopped using it, and let the African dirt do it&#x27;s natural job of protecting my face from the sun since it was caked on in no time &#x3D;) Don&#x27;t waste your money, dirt works better...and makes you look super tan too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunblock for my face--doesn&#x27;t gum up my pores, easy to apply/reapply, works as soon as you put it on (unlike liquid sunblock that leaves you unprotected for the first 15 minutes you have it on).  Of course it does wash/sweat off, as it&#x27;s just powder, and it&#x27;s not cheap.  But the ease of application and gentleness on sensitive skin are worth the costs.</li>
            <li> Meh, I bought because I live in a very humid climate, and reviews said it stopped your face from getting all greasy and shiny in the humidity. Doesn&#x27;t really do that. I just use it as added sunscreen now, ontop of my makeup. Good I guess if you want suncreen but not the greesy lotion stuff or smell of sunscreen</li>
            <li> I buy a bottle of this EVERY summer and love it.  I have incredibly fair skin and I NEVER burn when I use this powder.  It&#x27;s so easy to put on and it&#x27;s so convenient, especially when you have sandy hands from being on the beach.  It&#x27;s great for your ears, too...  The coverage is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This works, but it cam apart in my handbag, so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.  For the price, the packaging should be higher quality. That said, I did repurchase this because it&#x27;s convenient.  I have fair skin and burn easily so I have to reapply sun screen regularly.  This is the best hands free stuff I have found.  Just be careful to secure it well if it&#x27;s in your handbag!</li>
            <li> This is a very good touch up powder. I&#x27;m not crazy about the design, but the product itself is great. I prefer a twist open/close container. It is very good at absorbing oil on my face giving me a matte finish. While applying the powder to your face is does seem to fly around everywhere, but hey it works.</li>
            <li> The brush is really course, which makes it unpleasant to use. The powder is good.</li>
            <li> I love the conceptualization of this product. Not only that, but PTR executes it flawlessly. It&#x27;s perfect to brush on at the beach or pool side to provide LIGHT coverage and SPF. I like to keep it with me in my bag for easy application any time the sun comes out and surprises me</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product. It works great for the scalp, but I did put it on my face for a few days, and it severely clogged my pores on my forehead. I don&#x27;t ever have problems with acne or easily get clogged pores, so this was disappointing. If you&#x27;re buying for use on your scalp, I suggest sticking with that.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Not only the price is great, it is so easy to use and so practical. It also come with two little face masks that were amazing and buying the cream later on.</li>
            <li> I never use this because the design of the brush and lid are awful. You can never get the brush back in and it gets damaged.</li>
            <li> Living in the sun this is a must.  I can quickly dust my son&#x27;s face before he darts.  Not sure if it lasts all day at school but at least he starts out with sunscreen.  I like it as well over my .makeup.  Great for ears and the back of the neck</li>
            <li> Finally no breakouts from my sunscreen! The only problem is the brush, pieces of it break off during use. I pour the powder in my own dispenser brush.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works great, but getting the cap back on is a bugger. I carry it in my purse so I NEED the cap on. I&#x27;ve had brushes similar to this where there&#x27;s a piece that slides up over the bristles to keep them in place, and then you put the cap on. Not sure why they don&#x27;t have that on this...</li>
            <li> I like Peter Thomas Roth products. they are cruelty free and hypoallergenic. however, this product was a waste of money and a severe disappointment.  it ran out quickly. the bristles fell off on my face and stuck to it every single time I used it.</li>
            <li> This product did not help get rid of my oily face.</li>
            <li> i love it, it so simple and easy to use</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely. It&#x27;s a little hard to actually see it when applied so I am not always sure how much I am getting on at each use. It has a pleasant scent. Smells sorta of like the candy smarties. The brush is a bit cheap as other people have stated but not annoyingly so.  I don&#x27;t find it to be to rough or hard. It just occasionally leaves broken bits of brush behind.</li>
            <li> The mineral powder itself is wonderful.  It really does a fantastic job eliminating shine.  However, like some other reviewers pointed out, the  brush leaves dark black hairs on your face.  Unfortunately, this can&#x27;t be applied without a mirror and excellent lighting, so it kind of defeats the purpose of it being a quick touch up.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this and Colorscience Sunforgettable.  While the Colorscience was more expensive, it was worth the extra $$ Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Works at the beach or on the mountain skiing. I love using it without feeling oily afterwards, which I am used to with other spf products</li>
            <li> I have very oily and greasy face.  After applying this powder, my skin stay matte all day and without drying.  In addition to that, I don&#x27;t see any breakouts from using it.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone especially oily and acne problem skin.  However, you don&#x27;t have to have oily skin to use it.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen should not contain Retinyl Palmitate, it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. This doesn&#x27;t really make sense if you are trying to protect your skin from the sun!!</li>
            <li> A must for got to sunscreen. We just moved to FL and I apply sunscreen in the am but this is a great additional go to at the last minute or in general. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> will be keep purchase this again and again and again!!! also makes my skin looks glowing after applying it about 1 hour!</li>
            <li> The major appeal was the design when I purchased it but I was very disappointed. The product makes it very difficult for you to control how much powder you want to apply so it seems like you get nothing or you get so much product that you get a cloud of dust everywhere (a very expensive dust, might I add). The brush does not really retract into the packaging like I thought. You pull the bottom of the container (in the photo, the white part below the blue label) and it retracts until the brush disappears. Instead of a tube of chapstick, it more resembles a syringe, not convenient at all.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have fair, oily skin and I&#x27;m outside a lot.  You&#x27;re supposed to reapply your sunscreen every few hours, but since I wear makeup it makes it difficult to apply a liquid throughout the day.  This is easy to apply, has no color, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and goes nicely over my makeup.  The thing I don&#x27;t like is the bristles break off on my skin, and when you try to brush them off with the brush more break off.  If I don&#x27;t check in a mirror I end up walking around with black hairs on my face.  Also, I wish the brush was removable to wash.  It would be more environmentally responsible to make a refill rather than purchase a new brush every time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Goes on light and doesn&#x27;t affect makeup at all.  Provides great protection, absorbs oil, and works as advertised.  If you get really sweaty you will need to reapply but it works great.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic with great coverage, but it&#x27;s the brush that will prevent me from reordering.  It is such an uncomfortably, scratchy bristle brush, and it leaves bits of bristles behind on your face.  You&#x27;ll have little, dark hairs floating on your face, or elsewhere, for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Use this daily... so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> Great product for practical use. One thing that kinda sucks is that when you close it sometimes that actually opens the bottom of the product and all the powder comes out.</li>
            <li> I believe this may have been a good product, but the applicator is confusing at best.  There are no directions of how to get the powder onto the brush.  As I was trying to figure this out, a good size quantity of the rather expensive product was lost.</li>
