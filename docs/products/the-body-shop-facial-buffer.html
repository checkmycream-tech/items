            <li>I&#x27;m really very happy with this facial buffer.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this buffer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know it, but 3 came the order and made it better deal.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face scrubber.</li>
            <li>So how you use it and with what pressure is really up to you, but, I can vouch for this product, that it&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
            <li>Works great, if your skin is sensitive I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for the face.</li>
            <li>Nice useful product but overpriced.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more Eco friendly</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine the happy bacteria living in a moist sponge waiting to contaminate my pores.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels incredibly smooth after.</li>
            <li>Works great with just water, so I can save a lot of money by not having to buy extra products!</li>
            <li>It is a nice size, rinses clean easily, and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>and I have a clean feeling after it is done.</li>
            <li>Great buffer for dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li>my nose is sparkling clean :</li>
            <li>this buffer for a day, and then skip it for two days, and travel out - then also my nose is sparkling clean :</li>
            <li>Cleans my skin so good makes it look super fresh clean and clear</li>
            <li>I have used from the normal to those high end products, including clinique and estee lauder, they are good in their own rights, but when you have this buffer, their is no need for those high end scrubs and cleansers and face wash etc..</li>
            <li>Its not to rough and feels great.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t found a natural sponge that I liked.</li>
            <li>love this sponge so far !!!</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I was always concerned of carrying that extra bottle of scrub and those products, but with this - I can easily ditch the scrub!</li>
            <li>I love this facial buffer!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>First time I purchased off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>Exactly as featured in pic.</li>
            <li>first time I ever tried one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much into natural things and didn&#x27;t want to use a synthetic sponge to clean my face.</li>
            <li>When I saw this, I figured it was worth a try, and no harsh ingredients to worry about.  </li>
            <li>I just wash my skin with my choice of cleanser and scrub gently in circular motion.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans your pores.</li>
            <li>So much nicer to have an exfoliation buff than having to buy costly cream washes, I think between the two since this lasts longer</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes this a lot.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea, and hesitate to use the scrubbing creams available due to possible irritation.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because one has to be careful not to get too energetic with the scrubbing or skin</li>
            <li>I use this buffer every other day and my skin is smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li>It is just WOW!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face super soft and buffer itself isn&#x27;t rough at all.</li>
            <li>just what I wanted - something soft yet exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Even if I do, I would only use the scrub once in a week, bcoz just using this buffer with a normal facewash, works wonders!</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of texture to remove make-up and scrub my face, without being rough.</li>
            <li>, becoz now not only is my face clean, but there are no blackheads on my nose anymore - something which would only go, if I maintained scrubbing daily.</li>
            <li>I wet it first, then</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast as long as you dry it outside the shower where it&#x27;s away from moisture.</li>
            <li>Lasts long and gentle enough on my face.</li>
            <li>No need to waste so much money on those products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a facial pad that is soft but has the grip to really wash it well.</li>

            <li> I do not like the fact that one must wet it before use.</li>
            <li> I would like to mention that some people might alternately wanna use this buffer once or twice a week, becoz you may feel, it&#x27;s too harsh -</li>
            <li> it every other day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s manageable</li>
            <li> The seam at the back of the sponge shows signs of wear, so I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is...</li>
            <li> The surface is like the surface of the non scratch pot scrubbers so like other bath sponges that I have purchased, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pill\\&quot;</li>
            <li> its white so washing off my make up makes it very hard to get it back to its orginal color</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s not, its actually cleaning off the grime off of your face, and you control how hard you rub it on your face, so</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is...</li>
            <li> Very small and will probably only use 2 fingers to hold the thing.  </li>
            <li> This tiny little thing came in a box with a bunch of air padding, which was ridiculous - should have come in an envelope.</li>
            <li> either dried my skin or irritated it.  </li>
            <li> Scrubs but not to harsh on her skin.</li>
            <li> Because it removes even the slightest trace of dirt and dead skin from your face.</li>
            <li> I know to some, it might feel as if it&#x27;s too harsh on your skin</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s helping firm my face too, but</li>
            <li> I use expensive cleansers, and none compare to&lt;br /&gt;this little sponge.</li>

            <li> I have mild rosacea, and hesitate to use the scrubbing creams available due to possible irritation.  When I saw this, I figured it was worth a try, and no harsh ingredients to worry about.  I keep this hanging in the shower and use it several times a week with my regular facial cleanser.  It works GREAT, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have irritated my skin at all.  I doubt that I&#x27;ll ever use an exfoliating cream again!</li>
            <li> I us it every other day and I love how it polishes my skin and I have a clean feeling after it is done.</li>
            <li> I like it. Reorder again.</li>
            <li> Cleans my skin so good makes it look super fresh clean and clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much into natural things and didn&#x27;t want to use a synthetic sponge to clean my face. However, I haven&#x27;t found a natural sponge that I liked. Loofah can be rough. The Japanese bamboo fiber sponge disintegrates after a few uses. Sea sponge is either too rough or too soft for my skin. So I decided to give the Body Shop Facial Buffer a try. I&#x27;ve been using it daily (with organic facial cleaning lotion, not soap) for over a month and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. It&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s manageable and it does a good job at both cleaning and exfoliating. The seam at the back of the sponge shows signs of wear, so I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is... will report later if needed.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for what it is. It does have a strap that works well for hanging, and it looks nicer in the shower than a wash cloth. One review said it was 2 sponges so I was hoping...but no, as described it was just the one. I can do as well with a wash cloth and have the option of washing it in my HE machine.</li>
            <li> it works well but my wash cloth can do the same thing. im concerned that it doesnt dry out and am concerned with it growing mold.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and all exfoliates I&#x27;ve used in the past either dried my skin or irritated it.  I use this buffer every other day and my skin is smooth and clear.  I love it.  I just wash my skin with my choice of cleanser and scrub gently in circular motion.  Then I rinse this buffer and hang dry it outside the shower.  It dries pretty fast as long as you dry it outside the shower where it&#x27;s away from moisture.</li>
            <li> A wonderful exfoliater. Really cleans your pores. I use  it daily. I use expensive cleansers, and none compare to&lt;br /&gt;this little sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a facial pad that is soft but has the grip to really wash it well. I boil it in hot water every week at least to get rid of bacteria. Ordering another one today.</li>
            <li> I love this facial buffer! Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Nice useful product but overpriced. They probably make this for .50 cents and are charging $6.</li>
            <li> Very nice, and works great, ergonomically.  For someone who has injury to hand.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads for several years. First time I purchased off of Amazon. Last for many months and feels wonderful on face.</li>
            <li> So much nicer to have an exfoliation buff than having to buy costly cream washes, I think between the two since this lasts longer it&#x27;s more Eco friendly</li>
            <li> love this sponge so far !!!</li>
            <li> Works well will exfoliation product.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted - something soft yet exfoliating.  This tiny little thing came in a box with a bunch of air padding, which was ridiculous - should have come in an envelope.</li>
            <li> Im going to need some more. Its not to rough and feels great. The only thing that sucks is...its white so washing off my make up makes it very hard to get it back to its orginal color</li>
            <li> Great buffer for dry patches on my face. I am menopausal and my skin is trippin out.lol Dry patches, bumps that aren&#x27;t pickable. Whiteheads, the list goes on.I love this I wet it first, then and my cleanser onto the buffer, then use it in a circular motion. Works great, if your skin is sensitive I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for the face.</li>
            <li> Exactly as featured in pic. Great buffer.. first time I ever tried one. Great for removing skin. Can be used sorta as face brush. I do not like the fact that one must wet it before use. I can only imagine the happy bacteria living in a moist sponge waiting to contaminate my pores. Great price . I do not use mine often anymore..</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this a lot. Scrubs but not to harsh on her skin.</li>
            <li> I got this from a body shop store yesterday! It is just WOW! I cannot recommend this enough! I don&#x27;t think I will ever need any of those scrubs anymore! Even if I do, I would only use the scrub once in a week, bcoz just using this buffer with a normal facewash, works wonders! My face has never felt cleaner - not even after looong facial care regime! I have used from the normal to those high end products, including clinique and estee lauder, they are good in their own rights, but when you have this buffer, their is no need for those high end scrubs and cleansers and face wash etc..No need to waste so much money on those products! Because it removes even the slightest trace of dirt and dead skin from your face. I know to some, it might feel as if it&#x27;s too harsh on your skin but I feel that really depends on how hard you rub it against your skin! Just 2-3 rounds of rub across the face does it for me! So how you use it and with what pressure is really up to you, but, I can vouch for this product, that it&#x27;s just amazing! It&#x27;s great for travel too, I can put it in my travel makeup kit and off we go! I was always concerned of carrying that extra bottle of scrub and those products, but with this - I can easily ditch the scrub! Atleast for my travels! Otherwise, once in a week, scrubing the face is now enough for me, when previously, I would scrub atleast three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I would like to mention that some people might alternately wanna use this buffer once or twice a week, becoz you may feel, it&#x27;s too harsh - well it&#x27;s not, its actually cleaning off the grime off of your face, and you control how hard you rub it on your face, so I dont think that should ever be an issue! Infact, you will love how your skin breathes after you try this buffer, even if just once! I personally like to use it daily, becoz now not only is my face clean, but there are no blackheads on my nose anymore - something which would only go, if I maintained scrubbing daily. But now even if I use this buffer for a day, and then skip it for two days, and travel out - then also my nose is sparkling clean :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I could go on and on about this - but take my word for this - for this price - you can&#x27;t get such an AWESOME PRODUCT! TRY IT! YOU WILL just LOVE IT :)this buffer for a day, and then skip it for two days, and travel out - then also my nose is sparkling clean :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I could go on and on about this - but take my word for this - for this price - you can&#x27;t get such an AWESOME PRODUCT!

            <li> I use this every day when I&#x27;m massaging my face with a Philosophy facial cleanser and my skin feels incredibly smooth after. I feel like it&#x27;s helping firm my face too, but maybe I&#x27;m just dreaming  about that aspect.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Very happy.</li>
            <li> We both love this buy this one and it will serve you just the way you wanted it to... buy two as we all use it.</li>
            <li> I love this! A great replacement for buying liquid face scrubs. Works great with just water, so I can save a lot of money by not having to buy extra products! Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this facial sponge.  It has just the right amount of texture to remove make-up and scrub my face, without being rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really very happy with this facial buffer.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because one has to be careful not to get too energetic with the scrubbing or skin could come off!  It is a nice size, rinses clean easily, and dries fast.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super soft and buffer itself isn&#x27;t rough at all.</li>
            <li> Very small and will probably only use 2 fingers to hold the thing.  I can&#x27;t believe I paid $4 for it.  GEEZ!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this buffer. It is quite course and I feel like all of the dead skin cells have been removed from my face but without taking a whole layer of skin at the same time. They are the perfect size for cleaning the face, they rinse of the soap easily and it dries quickly. I didn&#x27;t know it, but 3 came the order and made it better deal. The surface is like the surface of the non scratch pot scrubbers so like other bath sponges that I have purchased, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pill\\&quot; and I have no doubt that they will last a very long time</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face scrubber. Lasts long and gentle enough on my face.</li>
