            <li>Perfect transaction and product</li>
            <li>lol Works well for trimming and/or shaving.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s performance is great, but it stopped working after two uses.</li>
            <li>Not as happy as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>Bikini line is smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom, feels lovely!! ^_^</li>
            <li>Good trim, but stopped working.</li>
            <li>if you need a trimmer it works its not a shaver but a trimmer good price for that NH Customer</li>
            <li>A good trimmer should never cut the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked great the first time, but it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on after that.</li>
            <li>I had one for many years</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t turn on any more after one use.  </li>
            <li>Once I found a better trimmer, I threw this one away.</li>
            <li>I think they have better trimmers out there by connair.</li>
            <li>this wasnt my favorite.</li>
            <li>I had to put up one star to be able to write a review when in fact they don&#x27;t even deserve the one star.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very easy to use and is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and it worked out great until it finally died on me, probably after 8 years.  </li>
            <li>great for trimming multiple body areas</li>
            <li>It does a great job and trims hair VERY short.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on the battery life, but it has run great so far.</li>
            <li>I had paid full price for this, I would return it.</li>
            <li>and they quickly replied.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more safety protection with this kind of intimate personal trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Works out great because of the small head.  </li>
            <li>It worked for me once - and it doesn&#x27;t really oscillate fast enough to do a good job shaving either - and then shut off and will not turn on again.</li>
            <li>Does the job nicely though some contortion may be necessary to reach, erm, certain areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit.</li>
            <li>A good little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>For some reason it has to be turned on with the cap off first for it to work.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband to trim his beard on body and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>For the price especially this trimmer is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I did everything I had done with the first one, and IT STILL DIDN&#x27;T EVEN TURN ON.</li>
            <li>I think this is a lovely product for someone who has experienced ingrown hair issues due to traditional shaving such as myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to spend a little more to make sure I get one that will last this time!</li>
            <li>This worked really well until it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Of course once used, can&#x27;t really return it.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>When I got the first one in the mail, I immediately ripped it out of the packaging and put in a BRAND NEW AA battery.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviews state, this product won&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll quickly get used to it, especially since it&#x27;s not going to inflict any real damage.</li>
            <li>I was unsure what to expect at first when I received this Bikini Trimmer but upon using, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I had one a few years ago nearly the same exact thing that I loved.  </li>
            <li>so I went out and bought new batteries</li>
            <li>I got a small pinch once or twice because I didn&#x27;t do that at first but nothing huge to worry about.</li>
            <li>Okay so I just picked one of these up at my local cvs store for $10.49 and I must say I am shocked that it&#x27;s not being sold for more money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the item I bought was replaced with a new item that also does not function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one is cheap and the blade is dull.</li>
            <li>The next day I put in a different BRAND NEW AA BATTERY, and still, nothing happened.</li>
            <li>find it hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I too only used it a total of 1 time, and then a week later, found that it would not work, even with a new battery.  </li>

            <li> As far as it&#x27;s longevity i&#x27;m not sure yet, I will do an update in  the future.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> buzzing noise does sound a bit scary to be using \\&quot;down there\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Not much use.  </li>
            <li> It is just too rough and unwieldy for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> but after going through a few different batteries I realized that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful I only wasted around 20 bucks in the end, but 20 bucks is still 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I tried other batteries that worked in other products and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on either.</li>
            <li> I was afraid from reading the reviews and very cautious when initially using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and used it approximately five times before it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Shave is not super close/smooth but that was what I was looking for anyways.</li>
            <li> It also does not trim as close leaving longer stubble than the previous Conair we owned.</li>
            <li> This is not worth it!</li>
            <li> but after drawing (a little) blood., this unit is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> And, the battery contact is inconstant, so sometimes the power weakens or it takes a little while to start up.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t work as well not sure about the other as I gave it away as a gift.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer works fantastically and for the money, can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> After that, it was dead.  </li>
            <li> what a waste</li>
            <li> Not quite so discouraged, I checked every single part I could take apart, but nothing was obviously broken or needed repairing.</li>
            <li> A few weeks aster I threw that one out, I bought yet another one, seriously hoping the first was just a bad seed or whatever.</li>
            <li> Got into very tight and delicate spots with no problem</li>
            <li> Not happy about that since I got at least 7 uses out of the other one I bought.</li>
            <li> like that it has a thick handle, and that it uses AA batteries, but there are other trimmers that do that without cutting me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i read the reviews that were not good, but i thought i would try it.</li>
            <li> Even scrubbing it out with a brush leaves some hair behind.  </li>
            <li> This is a sign of poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am girl and they are relatively thin hairs, i think its a performance issue.</li>
            <li> Now I was starting to get doubtful.</li>
            <li> So, deciding that there was no hope, I smashed it to see if I could look at the \\&quot;insides\\&quot; to see if THAT was broken.</li>
            <li> I typically use this for my arms after I let my hair on my arms grow out a bit, and it was a bit painful as the hairs got stuck on the machine.</li>
            <li> disappointing to say the least</li>
            <li> What a waste of money :-(</li>
            <li> i bought this product at a local drug store and was very disappointed at the quality.</li>
            <li> the battery operation failed.  </li>
            <li> Worse trimmer ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has very poor design in that some batteries are almost impossible to put in.</li>
            <li> Definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very, very, VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is the worst trimmer ever.</li>

            <li> I had one for many years and it worked out great until it finally died on me, probably after 8 years.  So I decided to get a similar one as a replacement.  Works out great because of the small head.  Got into very tight and delicate spots with no problem</li>
            <li> It never worked since I bought it.  I out in the batteries and it never came on.  Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Good trim, but stopped working. I discovered that you have to take the cap off, then turn the machine on, and then stick the cap on. For some reason it has to be turned on with the cap off first for it to work.</li>
            <li> I was unsure what to expect at first when I received this Bikini Trimmer but upon using, I was pleasantly surprised. Does the job nicely though some contortion may be necessary to reach, erm, certain areas. lol Works well for trimming and/or shaving. Shave is not super close/smooth but that was what I was looking for anyways. Would definately buy again should this one fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A word of caution though, try to pull skin taught when using. I got a small pinch once or twice because I didn&#x27;t do that at first but nothing huge to worry about. I like that there&#x27;s no way to knick or cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buzzing noise does sound a bit scary to be using \\&quot;down there\\&quot; but you&#x27;ll quickly get used to it, especially since it&#x27;s not going to inflict any real damage. I&#x27;d recommend this to all my girl friends!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very easy to use and is exactly what I was looking for.  Great price and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> this is the worst trimmer ever. i used twice, and it broke. the battery operation failed.  don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This worked ONCE.  After that, it was dead.  I tried replacing the battery thinking that could have been the issue, but it didn&#x27;t fix it.  This is not worth it!</li>
            <li> The product did not work at all. I thought that the issue was the battery so I went out and bought new batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work. 😔</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t turn on any more after one use.  Worse trimmer ever!</li>
            <li> This trimmer lacks power and speed. Both my wife and I found it to catch hair and pull it often. It also does not trim as close leaving longer stubble than the previous Conair we owned.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more safety protection with this kind of intimate personal trimmer.  I find that i pinch myself repeatedly with a traditional upper thigh touch up, something that doesn&#x27;t happen with a traditional stick trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I figured i&#x27;d learn to use it but after drawing (a little) blood., this unit is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I received the product and immediately wanted to try it out. I put in batteries and it wouldn&#x27;t switch on. I tried other batteries that worked in other products and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on either. I returned this item without using it even once. It is totally defective.</li>
            <li> if you need a trimmer it works its not a shaver but a trimmer good price for that NH Customer</li>
            <li> i read the reviews that were not good, but i thought i would try it. very disappointing. will buy something else.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to trim his beard on body and he really likes it!</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these that I have used and I would buy another...great for trimming multiple body areas</li>
            <li> This never worked. From day one wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> This worked really well until it stopped working. I thought it was just the battery, but after replacing it several times, it still wouldn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m going to have to spend a little more to make sure I get one that will last this time!</li>
            <li> ive had a Conair before, like it.. this one is cheap and the blade is dull. disappointing to say the least</li>
            <li> I bought this because I lost the one I bought in the store. It&#x27;s performance is great, but it stopped working after two uses. Not happy about that since I got at least 7 uses out of the other one I bought. I changed batteries three times but nothing got it working again.</li>
            <li> For the price especially this trimmer is fabulous! It does a great job and trims hair VERY short. I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in July it is now December and I went to turn on and nothng! Changed abttery and still nothing!Cannot use &amp; out my money what a waste</li>
            <li> Once I received this put the batteries in and it never ever turned on or worked. I would NEVER buy this again.</li>
            <li> I think there is a manufactoring defect with this product:  I too only used it a total of 1 time, and then a week later, found that it would not work, even with a new battery.  The motor will still run if the blade attachement is removed though.... Not much use.  Of course once used, can&#x27;t really return it. What a waste of money :-(</li>
            <li> I bought this item and used it approximately five times before it stopped working completely. I e-mailed conair customer service and they quickly replied. After requesting my information the replacement model arrived in about two weeks. Although the shipping package and packaged trimmers appeared to be undamaged, the product did not work out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the item I bought was replaced with a new item that also does not function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D O  N O T  B U Y.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a trimmer for use before shaving with my [[ASIN:B00141DE48 ES412 Cleancut Personal Shaver]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does trim, yes, but it also cuts the skin and pulls hair. A good trimmer should never cut the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has a thick handle, and that it uses AA batteries, but there are other trimmers that do that without cutting me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard to clean. Even scrubbing it out with a brush leaves some hair behind.  And, the battery contact is inconstant, so sometimes the power weakens or it takes a little while to start up. This is a sign of poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had paid full price for this, I would return it. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. It is just too rough and unwieldy for the bikini area. Once I found a better trimmer, I threw this one away.</li>
            <li> i bought this product at a local drug store and was very disappointed at the quality. It worked for me once - and it doesn&#x27;t really oscillate fast enough to do a good job shaving either - and then shut off and will not turn on again.</li>
            <li> I bought 2. I had one a few years ago nearly the same exact thing that I loved.  This one doesn&#x27;t work as well not sure about the other as I gave it away as a gift.  Not as happy as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> I typically use this for my arms after I let my hair on my arms grow out a bit, and it was a bit painful as the hairs got stuck on the machine. I am girl and they are relatively thin hairs, i think its a performance issue. i had a blue conair trimmer and it worked wonders (till i lost it). I think they have better trimmers out there by connair. this wasnt my favorite.</li>
            <li> I had to put up one star to be able to write a review when in fact they don&#x27;t even deserve the one star. Like many of the other reviews state, this product won&#x27;t even turn on. Conair needs to stop making this. Complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction and product</li>
            <li> Okay so I just picked one of these up at my local cvs store for $10.49 and I must say I am shocked that it&#x27;s not being sold for more money. I wish I could show a before and after photo! I think this is a lovely product for someone who has experienced ingrown hair issues due to traditional shaving such as myself. I am so glad I bought this. As far as it&#x27;s longevity i&#x27;m not sure yet, I will do an update in  the future. But the initial response I have for this is A+! It&#x27;s very gentle, doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit. I was afraid from reading the reviews and very cautious when initially using it. But it was a breeze! Need I say more? I love it. Bikini line is smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom, feels lovely!! ^_^</li>
            <li> After just 4 uses it stopped working. I figured it was just the battery but after going through a few different batteries I realized that wasn&#x27;t the case. Definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> A good little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very, very, VERY disappointed. When I got the first one in the mail, I immediately ripped it out of the packaging and put in a BRAND NEW AA battery. As I turned it on, nothing happened. At all. No buzzing, no moving of any part, nada. Not quite so discouraged, I checked every single part I could take apart, but nothing was obviously broken or needed repairing. Now I was starting to get doubtful. The next day I put in a different BRAND NEW AA BATTERY, and still, nothing happened. So, deciding that there was no hope, I smashed it to see if I could look at the \\&quot;insides\\&quot; to see if THAT was broken. Nope, everything was a-okay. A few weeks aster I threw that one out, I bought yet another one, seriously hoping the first was just a bad seed or whatever. Nope. This one didn&#x27;t work either! I did everything I had done with the first one, and IT STILL DIDN&#x27;T EVEN TURN ON. Really? Oh well. I&#x27;m grateful I only wasted around 20 bucks in the end, but 20 bucks is still 20 bucks. Sigh.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great the first time, but it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on after that. Tried different batteries, nothing!&lt;br /&gt;It also has very poor design in that some batteries are almost impossible to put in.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer works fantastically and for the money, can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks so I can&#x27;t really comment on the battery life, but it has run great so far. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
