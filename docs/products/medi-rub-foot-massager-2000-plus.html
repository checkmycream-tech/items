            <li>I bought this for myself based on the good reviews</li>
            <li>just he will be getting good use out of it.</li>
            <li>We use this twice a day and feel soooo good after the 20 min.</li>
            <li>This feels so good.  </li>
            <li>After using it for about 5 minutes and stopping, I can feel my feet continue to pulsate, like its improving circulation, so it should be good for diabetics.  </li>
            <li>good product that met expectations</li>
            <li>It feels so good to come home &amp; feel the vibration on the bottoms of my feet.</li>
            <li>It helps me that I can say, my brother &amp; sisterinlaw also tryed it &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>Good for circulation.</li>
            <li>Has improved my circulation and, surprisingly, reduced the acrocyanosis in my feet.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for someone else, he loved it.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>not as good as my friends.  </li>
            <li>I went to a company health fair where the Medi-Rub foot and body massagers were being demonstrated.</li>
            <li>It is the most incredible massager ever.  </li>
            <li>I thought the roller effect was pretty darn wonderful until I experienced the Medi-Rub Foot Massager.</li>
            <li>I was lucky and someone showed me how to get the best results.</li>
            <li>I love this unit it works great</li>
            <li>They both are very pleased indeed with the soothing and seemingly beneficial effect it has on their feet and calves.</li>
            <li>I love this masager for my feet!</li>
            <li>5 minutes and my feet and legs feel much better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this baby!  </li>
            <li>Guests love it too!</li>
            <li>I have put my money into a great set of orthotic inserts and some very comfortable running shoes which has brought me much better relief from my foot pain than using this massager.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing for improving my circulation and I can walk with no problems or pain.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet and legs feel amazing and didn&#x27;t cost thousands or require me to keep feeding it quarters.  </li>
            <li>Be generous to yourself, in purchasing this machine for your own use.  </li>
            <li>During this time I kind of \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; about the medi rub treatments I had been giving myself.  </li>
            <li>The toe bar is handy, even works well to rest the backs of your heels on.  </li>
            <li>nice.  </li>
            <li>At the age of 59 this item will come in handy.</li>
            <li>Nice, huh?</li>
            <li>It does make your feet feel nice after using it...</li>
            <li>I bought this gizmo based on the many good reviews it&#x27;s received.</li>
            <li>also liked it when I shifted it on a slant mode</li>
            <li>A built-in timer would be nice.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it!!</li>
            <li>great, got it quick with no issues</li>
            <li>5-10 minutes works best as far as can be seen.</li>
            <li>It is simply amazing, all the nerve endings in my feet are doin much better.</li>
            <li>I have used it with great success.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be able to get relief at home when needed.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I originally tried it at a county fair but was glad I didn&#x27;t buy it there since I got a better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more helpful with my diabetic feet ...doesn&#x27;t seem to help ..would not recommend to people with diabetic problems of the feet</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and they love it and use it faithfully</li>
            <li>for a commmercial unit I thought the intensity would be greater.</li>
            <li>After using it for 30 minutes, my feet &amp; calves felt \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; &amp; tingly, but it took many times of using this for my pain to go away.  </li>
            <li>still pricey, but more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Important for me!    </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>They are more reliable.</li>
            <li>Great item, what a fantastic massage, feet and legs feel great after only 10 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to what most believe, the machine does not vibrate.  </li>
            <li>But then I settled in and started to feel significantly better.  </li>
            <li>Even my balance is better.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better foot massagers I have seen and used.</li>
            <li>but now I consider it a money saving device that has paid for its self many times over.</li>
            <li>I love it-</li>
            <li>By using a massager am able to keep numbness from spreading to the rest of my feet.</li>
            <li>It stimulates and helps to make feet and lower legs feel better.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love this machine.</li>
            <li>Love this unit and recommend to all.</li>
            <li>so,i put my shoes on and it was more tolerable.</li>
            <li>My review matches most others.  </li>
            <li>Like it like it like it love it.</li>
            <li>Great - thanks.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>The roll at the top lets you massage toes and arches.  </li>
            <li>It is very relaxing and your feet feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li>She has really enjoyed the Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000</li>
            <li>This massager makes my feet feel much better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noisy and does vibrate (the correct term is oscillation), so put it on top of a rug or towel but not a tile or hardwood floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love how my feet feel after using this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased I did.</li>
            <li>Seen it at a home show for $50.00 bucks more.</li>
            <li>Best feature is that you get the same effect with or without your shoes on.  </li>
            <li>So you can put the arch of your foot over the top lip looking part</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to massage the top of my feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a 30.00 vibrating foot massager from another well known yet more affordable brand</li>
            <li>and I am now glad that I did not purchase the medi rub massager which I was also considering.  </li>
            <li>you can get so much more use out of them.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent therapeutic device, but it&#x27;s also a superb way to get completely relaxed in the space of a few minutes.</li>
            <li>A good hand foot massage ranks higher in my book.</li>
            <li>Saw and tried this at the County Fair and found it to be much cheaper on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I asked her doctor before hand if this would be a good product (always a good idea to ask the doc, especially with the elderly).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Great natural alternative for diabetic neuropathy pain...</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time trying to establish which of the myriad of products would be best.</li>
            <li>After a good 10 minutes or so, you really feel the blood moving in your feet and lower legs.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>It could&#x27;ve been easily made in China and sold for $10.</li>
            <li>This massager is so strong and works so well, we use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting instead of the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s just that efficient.</li>
            <li>&quot; that is very strong and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It feels good while it is happening, but wears of pretty quickly (in my experience).  </li>
            <li>and I would rate it average at best.  </li>
            <li>It was working just fine for 10 min.</li>
            <li>In that light, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li>I like the machine, the design, the thoughtful rubber feet</li>
            <li>Makes the product look cheap.</li>
            <li>We got the MediRub Foot Massager to counteract the effects of neuropathy primarily in my wife&#x27;s feet as the result of chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap.  </li>
            <li>excellentt machine met my needs very well would recommend it to anyone I had problems with cramp and swelling in both legs and the improvement is amazing</li>
            <li>This is an important distinction.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone to enjoy.</li>
            <li>The low speed works great</li>
            <li>I enjoy it myself...</li>
            <li>They provide no grip on a smooth floor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposedly made in USA, but it looks cheap.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, relaxes not only your feet but your whole body.  </li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted&lt;br /&gt;After a bit it started making a loud noise when turned on</li>
            <li>I know this is a bit lengthy, but I&#x27;ve recommended medi-rub to numerous family and friends and everyone who has purchased them raves about them (it justtakes consistency and a bit of patience to see amazing results)!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I will not have leg cramps and that reduces my stress level and allows me to sleep more peacefully.  </li>
            <li>I found that just soaking my feet in a tub of hot water with some epson salts much more soothing than this massager.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great after a long day on your feet.</li>
            <li>and she was so excited to use it...</li>
            <li>I rate it good, but for the price I expected better.</li>
            <li>Very well built, powerful, and effective.</li>
            <li>Strong and powerful</li>
            <li>Wow, just an amazing way to end the day after biking/hiking/working/etc.  </li>
            <li>Kind of loud in operation,</li>
            <li>if you want some kind of \\&quot;massage\\&quot; action, do NOT get the MediRub Foot Massager</li>
            <li>2000 Plus, because I think it would do a good job as a back and shoulder massager.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product</li>
            <li>I was at a county fair soon after this, and had only been there a couple of minutes when I could not walk anymore.  </li>
            <li>I told my orthopedist and he laughed and said the effect would not last.  </li>
            <li>I read good reviews and bought at last min.</li>
            <li>Even after a full 30 minutes, my feet still hurt.</li>
            <li>they can withstand your full body weight</li>
            <li>They are very well made.:-)</li>
            <li>We both had previously tried it in person at the fair and love it.</li>
            <li>And after you have experienced it&#x27;s positive effects, be generous to a friend, if you can afford to by a 2nd one.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to any medical aspects of this machine, as far as the abilty to open up any arteries for increased blood flow, but it does feel great and prvides a great deal of relief.</li>
            <li>I do love it though enough to try and build a wood box around it to be able to adjust the angle and to keep it put under my computer desk when turned on.</li>
            <li>I also left it on for more than 10-15 minutes, more like 35 minutes.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had such good success with this one....</li>
            <li>shipped quickly and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>I think that this product is way over priced and glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full price for a new one.  </li>
            <li>My husband suggested I try one of the super powerful foot massager stations you put a couple of quarters in that they have all over the place...</li>
            <li>This is hands down the most amazing foot \\&quot;massage\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty disappointed......live and learn!  </li>
            <li>Like other types of massage, this is one of the few things in life that not only feels wonderful but is actually GOOD for you!  </li>
            <li>Said it makes his feet feel great, uses it everyday.</li>
            <li>It sure didn&#x27;t take the pain and soreness away from my feet so far.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you have the ability to pay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WE FELT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT TO TRY THIS VIBRATOR.  </li>
            <li>So, I guess at this price this item is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Fun to use, however.</li>
            <li>This gave me better results than many trips to my P. Therapist and you can only guess how much that can cost in both time and $$.     </li>
            <li>Worth what I paid.  </li>
            <li>Some of the literature about this device indicated that it might be useful for peripheral neuropathy in the feet.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love the vibrating/massaging action.  </li>
            <li>Since she is so selective, I bought a used one for trial after cleaning it with Lysol and rubbing alchohol; it&#x27;s absolutely worth the money</li>
            <li>This massager is pricy but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come right out and say it...</li>
            <li>So relaxing to keep it right under the computer desk while using the computer.</li>
            <li>right after you stop using it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty much pain free.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and simple to put away when not in use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but frequently the vibration noise is so loud I have to turn up the TV--can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s going on because sometimes the loud vibration is not there.</li>
            <li>It is very well made in USA with a 10-foot cord, unlike most of the imported cheap stuff, such as Homedic</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Would recommend for pure massage feeling without wanting to try it for am foot problem--just for pampering!</li>
            <li>I like the foot massager very much.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and they like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It vibrates very intensely which supports circulation in the feet and legs.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my feet comfortable and also in a slanted position that makes my back more comfortable at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Other than getting an actual person to massage your feet, I find that the best way to feel better is to simply stay off my feet as much as possible during my free time.</li>
            <li>In a wheelchair, so my feet really need the circulation this massager provides!</li>
            <li>I love how I feel after using this for only 5-10 mins</li>
            <li>I have tryed about 4 different foot massagers from one that I bought in a garage sale for $7.00 to my latest purchase of this Medi-Rub Foot Massager</li>
            <li>The product is built very well as others have mentioned and has a pretty powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>In fact I wish it had a higher setting.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it all that spectular or any kind of miracle cure for my sore feet either as I expected.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t do that for my first appointment and I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I cringe at the cost of this product and would have never bought it if my mother-in-law didn&#x27;t have one that I was able to use over several summer vacation trips.  </li>
            <li>My friend dropped some items off to me that she didn&#x27;t want anymore, and when I tried this for the first time I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this product at a trade show, they wanted $249,,,,ouch.</li>
            <li>Something interesting too, shoes seems to accentuate the benefits of the oscillation, especially rubber flip flops, as it amplifies the effect.  </li>
            <li>The first one we bought was to help with neuropathy.  </li>
            <li>though, the first time i used it for aprox 10mins, it made my feet feel, only slightly better.</li>
            <li>The whole family!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the thing and wanted to buy one to keep at home but didn&#x27;t have the extra $1500 bucks plus shipping.  </li>
            <li>The tingling sensation when you&#x27;re done let&#x27;s you know the blood is really flowing to your feet!</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do that for me, but we love it anyway, especially my husband does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the medical reasons for the change, but it sure has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these along with their hand-held messager about a year ago and really love both of them.  </li>
            <li>although I realize many people have tender sore feet or a medical condition that would keep them from using the high setting, it didn&#x27;t feel that powerful to me.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;running in place\\&quot; action makes my back ache, whereas the Medi-Rub Massager doesn&#x27;t require a straining posture of any kind.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product, but would definitely consider it a good medical investment.  </li>
            <li>I had just dropped 50 pounds and discovered I loved jogging, only to have my knees buckle and my orthopedist tell me my knees had no cartilidge left</li>
            <li>all reviews were positive</li>
            <li>The first 5 minutes or so were almost excrutiating pain as the cirulation in my legs got stirred up after a whole day on my feet.  </li>
            <li>Even after I turn it off, I get a good 15 minutes of relief, and I can usually fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>It has strengthen my legs so I can now walk at a more normal pace,  Walking up and done stairs is now a simple task.  </li>
            <li>(a quick, non-specific burst of reflexology is what I&#x27;m looking for during my busy schedule).</li>
            <li>It feels likes a strong vibration, but if you look closely when you turn it on and off, it actually oscillates in a circular pattern.  </li>
            <li>Hope it will make a difference with the neuropathy in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li>I took the podiatrist&#x27;s recommendation and bought new balance shoes (1123), it helped but my right rear heel still hurt like heck (plantar fasciitis).  </li>
            <li>this really works</li>
            <li>I was a type 2 diabetic until losing 127 lbs with gastric by-pass surgery 3 years ago, so with this history, I have always experienced poor circulatory issues.  </li>
            <li>Although the machine seems very well constructed, all it does is vibrate.  </li>
            <li>This has turned out to be an absolute pain-saver for a patient challenged by diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and so do we.</li>
            <li>He used it for awhile but thought it caused too much itching and tickling of his feet.  </li>
            <li>It really got my circulation going big-time.</li>
            <li>-Intense vibration/oscilation movement.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>You really need to know how to use if affectively, however.</li>
            <li>It gives a very thorough massage &amp; in the recommended 20 minutes my feet feel reinvigorated.</li>
            <li>Thanks Medi-Rub</li>
            <li>This really helps mitigate some of that discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Wife says it really helps sooth her feet and improves circulation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always at the ready.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who needs, or wants a massager for their feet.  </li>
            <li>This foot massager works very well.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything but shake.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am expecting too much.  </li>
            <li>my wife, mom, grandmother and myself agree that you feel very relax after using this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this foot massager!</li>
            <li>Whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I would need a knee replacement very soon.  </li>
            <li>I made it through the whole day by periodically using one of those machines.  </li>
            <li>it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>This has been better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Again sent in, again a fast return.  </li>
            <li>It really soothes sore and aching feet and legs.</li>
            <li>My father is a diabetic, this really helped him with the circulation in his feet &amp; leg cramps.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and invigorating...</li>
            <li>I have Plantar Faciitus and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li>This is great for tired achy feet.</li>
            <li>Great for neuropathy or just tired feet.</li>
            <li>I now have happy feet when they are soooooooooo tired.</li>
            <li>This really helps when the gout flairs up in my toes</li>
            <li>it turned out to be a real pain.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;massage\\&quot; or \\&quot;rub\\</li>
            <li>This really helps my feet at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>so I bought another one for his birthday and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting the pair together!</li>
            <li>I have diabetic neuropathy and this is very comforting.</li>
            <li>It also is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>mine gets a ton of use and after 3 years of steady daily use, is still going strong.</li>
            <li>and I spent a lot of time on the phone with their (very friendly) customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MAJOR KUDOS to Medi-Rub!!!!!</li>
            <li>After use, you can feel this bubbly, tingling feeling in your legs, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to increased circulation, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Because of this (minor) problem and the Massager&#x27;s relatively high price, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars - but I&#x27;m still glad we bought it!</li>
            <li>I have used several other massage devices but Medi-rub is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>The massage action is quite strong, even when set on low.  </li>
            <li>When mine was delivered I put it on my carpet in front of my favorite chair and sat down and picked the highest setting immediately.  </li>
            <li>By the looks of it, they could sell it for less, still make money, and a lot more people could be helped.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more mobile now and have less occurrences of stiffness in my legs.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the device is the horsey-looking graphic strip on the top front.</li>
            <li>I use it for 5-10 minutes a few times a day and it keeps me pretty much pain free.  </li>
            <li>this thing is so good I&#x27;ve even tried lying down on it for my back, but I instead bought its cousin the \\&quot;Medi-Rub Handheld Body Professional Massager\\</li>
            <li>However, for anyone else it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who likes this type of massage.</li>
            <li>After just 20 minutes in high (II) mode, she detected scratchy/itchy feelings in her feet.  </li>
            <li>the high level.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>I think the massaging action of this unit is better that other units we have had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved this little beauty to the top of my birthday</li>
            <li>If it does what it did last time, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY foot massager worth buying.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see (before I return it as being ineffective for the purpose I purchased it) after a few more days of usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some comments from others, but when you are in pain and stiff most of the day, who cares about the price.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Free shipping was quicker than expected!  </li>
            <li>bought new boots.</li>
            <li>bought new insoles.</li>
            <li>I am a late 20&#x27;s male in relatively good shape.    </li>
            <li>It is very loud, I never wear shoes with it.</li>
            <li>I used it with my bare feet, using the high setting, it felt decent but, for the price, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Might be helpful to have a higher middle section.</li>
            <li>and my feet actually get hot from standing/walking/running.</li>
            <li>The first one works well, so I bought a second one for my parents as a gift.</li>
            <li>It gets the blood flowing and actually makes me be able to go further on my daily walks!  </li>
            <li>This foot massager does not really massage--in the sense that it applies useful pressure at particular points to relax or knead muscles.</li>
            <li>I had read several reviews that said the high setting was just to much to take.  </li>
            <li>At 360lbs (at that time), with a sedentary job, I found myself becoming stiff after hours of sitting at my desk.  </li>
            <li>After a few seconds, my feet itch because the vibration is so strong.</li>
            <li>I particularly like wrapping my toes around the 1/2 round bar at the top, if completely relaxes my entire foot.  </li>
            <li>I have plantars fasciitis, I&#x27;m overweight (can be hard on the body) and am on my feet most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Both my wife and I use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I try to make sure I use this machine at least 10 minutes before bedtime as that almost gurantees</li>
            <li>I nearly quit my job (I am a teacher) because of mobility problems.  </li>
            <li>There is no \\&quot;massage\\&quot; to the action at all.  </li>
            <li>My chiropractor concurred and I went in for therapy for nearly a month.  </li>
            <li>Also the color of the feet was near normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see how it would hurt sensitive feet.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my folks (Over 65 years old).</li>
            <li>My neuropathy foot pain has been reduced considerably.</li>
            <li>loud I&#x27;m going to try and see if I can get it exchanged or returned</li>
            <li>I sent it in under warranty and got it back fast.  </li>
            <li>Now, with the unit out of warranty by 3 days, I get to pay shipping both ways to get this fixed.  </li>
            <li>Same thing just she has a much quieter one.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses it nearly every night.</li>
            <li>I think the secret is not to apply much pressure but let your feet sit on top and let the machine do its thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely consistent and now (six months later) I occasionally wonder how many surgeries could be prevented if I had simply taken a little better care of myself with products and procedures - that although available, seem expensive - until one considers the ultimate cost to the alternatives (surgery, handi-cap, disability, immobility)!!!    </li>
            <li>When I stand back up I am fine, but when I am laying down, my feet throbbed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would seem that, apart from its stated benefits, this little wonder disrupts the firing of the pain receptors, to bring immediate comfort while experiencing the onset, or full throes, of DBN pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first tried this while on vacation when I had a sharp pain in my arch which slowed everyone down (which this helped), but the price was over $400.00 very high mark up, the price directly from the website that makes these is very high also.</li>
            <li>There is a high and low speed of vibration.  </li>
            <li>but there is a swith for low and high....</li>
            <li>I have high arches and the pain in my back shoots into my arches of my feet.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as well as checking with local chiropractors to see which ones are expanding their practices to include treatment for neurological imbalances.</li>
            <li>I know it is because of the sensations I get that are different than my normal foot and leg that I also treat on the machine.  </li>
            <li>When they received it, I was called and they said it was the same problem but that they would replace my unit with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li>Very portable and not only massages his feet and heels but also the calves at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The company was good about sending me a return label and replacing the flawed one with the one I actually ordered.  </li>
            <li>did some research for major foot discomfort relief.</li>
            <li>This works fine and does help, however, it isn&#x27;t as hard on feet as I thought it might be.  </li>
            <li>It is very hard to walk and most of the time I have to get a wheelchair if my family goes shopping.</li>
            <li>i use it barefoot or with socks on, but it works with shoes on too.it has two settings, although i&#x27;ve only used the higher one a few times, and it&#x27;s  pretty quiet and portable...</li>
            <li>but you do have to think about how to secure it on a hard service floor.</li>
            <li>Even on \\&quot;low\\&quot; (there are only two speeds - high and low)</li>
            <li>I can feel the vibration not only in the feet, but in the legs clear up to the thighs.  </li>
            <li>My old foot massager worked only on bare feet</li>
            <li>i took a pic of it and sent it to my hubby at work  since he shops a lot on amazon and 2 weeks later, he surprised me with it.i use it every day</li>
            <li>This is the third, and most expensive, foot \\&quot;massager\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve tried over the years, but I can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Her swelling has gone down on her first day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The past few days I have experienced less ankle pain than I have in 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Medi-Rub is also more comfortable and less awkward.</li>
            <li>So far, nothing has changed with my regular use of it for about ten days.</li>
            <li>I went to the chiropractor #rather than the doctor) because my fall just didn&#x27;t seem substantial enough to cause any major injury.  </li>
            <li>I also thought it was a little pricey at first</li>
            <li>use a wooden footsie roller at home for a general tonic effect on my feet</li>
            <li>-Upper \\&quot;bar\\&quot; is not ergonomic to the shape of your bare foot arch.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I do not own this (yet) but only b/c I have to save up for it.  </li>
            <li>This is so not worth the high price tag</li>
            <li>The only thing that kept me from 5 stars, was the low setting was a little fast for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product, very pleased</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself based on the good reviews</li>
            <li> just he will be getting good use out of it.</li>
            <li> We use this twice a day and feel soooo good after the 20 min.</li>
            <li> This feels so good.  </li>
            <li> After using it for about 5 minutes and stopping, I can feel my feet continue to pulsate, like its improving circulation, so it should be good for diabetics.  </li>
            <li> good product that met expectations</li>
            <li> It feels so good to come home &amp; feel the vibration on the bottoms of my feet.</li>

            <li> Good for circulation.</li>

            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone else, he loved it.  </li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> not as good as my friends.  </li>
            <li> I went to a company health fair where the Medi-Rub foot and body massagers were being demonstrated.</li>
            <li> It is the most incredible massager ever.  </li>
            <li> I thought the roller effect was pretty darn wonderful until I experienced the Medi-Rub Foot Massager.</li>
            <li> I was lucky and someone showed me how to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I love this unit it works great</li>
            <li> They both are very pleased indeed with the soothing and seemingly beneficial effect it has on their feet and calves.</li>
            <li> I love this masager for my feet!</li>
            <li> 5 minutes and my feet and legs feel much better!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this baby!  </li>
            <li> Guests love it too!</li>
            <li> I have put my money into a great set of orthotic inserts and some very comfortable running shoes which has brought me much better relief from my foot pain than using this massager.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing for improving my circulation and I can walk with no problems or pain.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet and legs feel amazing and didn&#x27;t cost thousands or require me to keep feeding it quarters.  </li>
            <li> Be generous to yourself, in purchasing this machine for your own use.  </li>
            <li> During this time I kind of \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; about the medi rub treatments I had been giving myself.  </li>
            <li> The toe bar is handy, even works well to rest the backs of your heels on.  </li>
            <li> nice.  </li>
            <li> At the age of 59 this item will come in handy.</li>
            <li> Nice, huh?</li>
            <li> It does make your feet feel nice after using it...</li>
            <li> I bought this gizmo based on the many good reviews it&#x27;s received.</li>
            <li> also liked it when I shifted it on a slant mode</li>
            <li> A built-in timer would be nice.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!!</li>
            <li> great, got it quick with no issues</li>
            <li> 5-10 minutes works best as far as can be seen.</li>
            <li> It is simply amazing, all the nerve endings in my feet are doin much better.</li>
            <li> I have used it with great success.  </li>
            <li> Nice to be able to get relief at home when needed.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I originally tried it at a county fair but was glad I didn&#x27;t buy it there since I got a better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more helpful with my diabetic feet ...doesn&#x27;t seem to help ..would not recommend to people with diabetic problems of the feet</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and they love it and use it faithfully</li>
            <li> for a commmercial unit I thought the intensity would be greater.</li>
            <li> After using it for 30 minutes, my feet &amp; calves felt \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; &amp; tingly, but it took many times of using this for my pain to go away.  </li>
            <li> still pricey, but more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Important for me!    </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> They are more reliable.</li>
            <li> Great item, what a fantastic massage, feet and legs feel great after only 10 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to what most believe, the machine does not vibrate.  </li>
            <li> But then I settled in and started to feel significantly better.  </li>
            <li> Even my balance is better.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better foot massagers I have seen and used.</li>
            <li> but now I consider it a money saving device that has paid for its self many times over.</li>
            <li> I love it-</li>
            <li> By using a massager am able to keep numbness from spreading to the rest of my feet.</li>
            <li> It stimulates and helps to make feet and lower legs feel better.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I love this machine.</li>
            <li> Love this unit and recommend to all.</li>
            <li> so,i put my shoes on and it was more tolerable.</li>
            <li> My review matches most others.  </li>
            <li> Like it like it like it love it.</li>
            <li> Great - thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> The roll at the top lets you massage toes and arches.  </li>
            <li> It is very relaxing and your feet feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> She has really enjoyed the Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000</li>
            <li> This massager makes my feet feel much better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy and does vibrate (the correct term is oscillation), so put it on top of a rug or towel but not a tile or hardwood floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how my feet feel after using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased I did.</li>
            <li> Seen it at a home show for $50.00 bucks more.</li>
            <li> Best feature is that you get the same effect with or without your shoes on.  </li>
            <li> So you can put the arch of your foot over the top lip looking part</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to massage the top of my feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a 30.00 vibrating foot massager from another well known yet more affordable brand</li>
            <li> and I am now glad that I did not purchase the medi rub massager which I was also considering.  </li>
            <li> you can get so much more use out of them.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent therapeutic device, but it&#x27;s also a superb way to get completely relaxed in the space of a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A good hand foot massage ranks higher in my book.</li>
            <li> Saw and tried this at the County Fair and found it to be much cheaper on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I asked her doctor before hand if this would be a good product (always a good idea to ask the doc, especially with the elderly).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Great natural alternative for diabetic neuropathy pain...</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time trying to establish which of the myriad of products would be best.</li>
            <li> After a good 10 minutes or so, you really feel the blood moving in your feet and lower legs.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> It could&#x27;ve been easily made in China and sold for $10.</li>
            <li> This massager is so strong and works so well, we use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting instead of the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s just that efficient.</li>
            <li> &quot; that is very strong and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It feels good while it is happening, but wears of pretty quickly (in my experience).  </li>
            <li> and I would rate it average at best.  </li>
            <li> It was working just fine for 10 min.</li>
            <li> In that light, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I like the machine, the design, the thoughtful rubber feet</li>
            <li> Makes the product look cheap.</li>
            <li> We got the MediRub Foot Massager to counteract the effects of neuropathy primarily in my wife&#x27;s feet as the result of chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap.  </li>
            <li> excellentt machine met my needs very well would recommend it to anyone I had problems with cramp and swelling in both legs and the improvement is amazing</li>
            <li> This is an important distinction.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone to enjoy.</li>
            <li> The low speed works great</li>
            <li> I enjoy it myself...</li>
            <li> They provide no grip on a smooth floor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposedly made in USA, but it looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, relaxes not only your feet but your whole body.  </li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted&lt;br /&gt;After a bit it started making a loud noise when turned on</li>
            <li> I know this is a bit lengthy, but I&#x27;ve recommended medi-rub to numerous family and friends and everyone who has purchased them raves about them (it justtakes consistency and a bit of patience to see amazing results)!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I will not have leg cramps and that reduces my stress level and allows me to sleep more peacefully.  </li>
            <li> I found that just soaking my feet in a tub of hot water with some epson salts much more soothing than this massager.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great after a long day on your feet.</li>
            <li> and she was so excited to use it...</li>
            <li> I rate it good, but for the price I expected better.</li>
            <li> Very well built, powerful, and effective.</li>
            <li> Strong and powerful</li>
            <li> Wow, just an amazing way to end the day after biking/hiking/working/etc.  </li>
            <li> Kind of loud in operation,</li>
            <li> if you want some kind of \\&quot;massage\\&quot; action, do NOT get the MediRub Foot Massager</li>
            <li> 2000 Plus, because I think it would do a good job as a back and shoulder massager.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product</li>
            <li> I was at a county fair soon after this, and had only been there a couple of minutes when I could not walk anymore.  </li>
            <li> I told my orthopedist and he laughed and said the effect would not last.  </li>
            <li> I read good reviews and bought at last min.</li>
            <li> Even after a full 30 minutes, my feet still hurt.</li>
            <li> they can withstand your full body weight</li>
            <li> They are very well made.:-)</li>
            <li> We both had previously tried it in person at the fair and love it.</li>
            <li> And after you have experienced it&#x27;s positive effects, be generous to a friend, if you can afford to by a 2nd one.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to any medical aspects of this machine, as far as the abilty to open up any arteries for increased blood flow, but it does feel great and prvides a great deal of relief.</li>
            <li> I do love it though enough to try and build a wood box around it to be able to adjust the angle and to keep it put under my computer desk when turned on.</li>
            <li> I also left it on for more than 10-15 minutes, more like 35 minutes.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had such good success with this one....</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I think that this product is way over priced and glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full price for a new one.  </li>
            <li> My husband suggested I try one of the super powerful foot massager stations you put a couple of quarters in that they have all over the place...</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most amazing foot \\&quot;massage\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed......live and learn!  </li>
            <li> Like other types of massage, this is one of the few things in life that not only feels wonderful but is actually GOOD for you!  </li>
            <li> Said it makes his feet feel great, uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> It sure didn&#x27;t take the pain and soreness away from my feet so far.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you have the ability to pay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WE FELT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT TO TRY THIS VIBRATOR.  </li>
            <li> So, I guess at this price this item is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Fun to use, however.</li>
            <li> This gave me better results than many trips to my P. Therapist and you can only guess how much that can cost in both time and $$.     </li>
            <li> Worth what I paid.  </li>
            <li> Some of the literature about this device indicated that it might be useful for peripheral neuropathy in the feet.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the vibrating/massaging action.  </li>
            <li> Since she is so selective, I bought a used one for trial after cleaning it with Lysol and rubbing alchohol; it&#x27;s absolutely worth the money</li>
            <li> This massager is pricy but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come right out and say it...</li>
            <li> So relaxing to keep it right under the computer desk while using the computer.</li>
            <li> right after you stop using it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty much pain free.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and simple to put away when not in use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but frequently the vibration noise is so loud I have to turn up the TV--can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s going on because sometimes the loud vibration is not there.</li>
            <li> It is very well made in USA with a 10-foot cord, unlike most of the imported cheap stuff, such as Homedic</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Would recommend for pure massage feeling without wanting to try it for am foot problem--just for pampering!</li>
            <li> I like the foot massager very much.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and they like it very much.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates very intensely which supports circulation in the feet and legs.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my feet comfortable and also in a slanted position that makes my back more comfortable at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Other than getting an actual person to massage your feet, I find that the best way to feel better is to simply stay off my feet as much as possible during my free time.</li>
            <li> In a wheelchair, so my feet really need the circulation this massager provides!</li>
            <li> I love how I feel after using this for only 5-10 mins</li>
            <li> I have tryed about 4 different foot massagers from one that I bought in a garage sale for $7.00 to my latest purchase of this Medi-Rub Foot Massager</li>
            <li> The product is built very well as others have mentioned and has a pretty powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> In fact I wish it had a higher setting.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it all that spectular or any kind of miracle cure for my sore feet either as I expected.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t do that for my first appointment and I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I cringe at the cost of this product and would have never bought it if my mother-in-law didn&#x27;t have one that I was able to use over several summer vacation trips.  </li>
            <li> My friend dropped some items off to me that she didn&#x27;t want anymore, and when I tried this for the first time I was amazed.  </li>
            <li> I first saw this product at a trade show, they wanted $249,,,,ouch.</li>
            <li> Something interesting too, shoes seems to accentuate the benefits of the oscillation, especially rubber flip flops, as it amplifies the effect.  </li>
            <li> The first one we bought was to help with neuropathy.  </li>
            <li> though, the first time i used it for aprox 10mins, it made my feet feel, only slightly better.</li>
            <li> The whole family!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the thing and wanted to buy one to keep at home but didn&#x27;t have the extra $1500 bucks plus shipping.  </li>
            <li> The tingling sensation when you&#x27;re done let&#x27;s you know the blood is really flowing to your feet!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do that for me, but we love it anyway, especially my husband does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the medical reasons for the change, but it sure has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these along with their hand-held messager about a year ago and really love both of them.  </li>
            <li> although I realize many people have tender sore feet or a medical condition that would keep them from using the high setting, it didn&#x27;t feel that powerful to me.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;running in place\\&quot; action makes my back ache, whereas the Medi-Rub Massager doesn&#x27;t require a straining posture of any kind.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product, but would definitely consider it a good medical investment.  </li>
            <li> I had just dropped 50 pounds and discovered I loved jogging, only to have my knees buckle and my orthopedist tell me my knees had no cartilidge left</li>
            <li> all reviews were positive</li>
            <li> The first 5 minutes or so were almost excrutiating pain as the cirulation in my legs got stirred up after a whole day on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Even after I turn it off, I get a good 15 minutes of relief, and I can usually fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> It has strengthen my legs so I can now walk at a more normal pace,  Walking up and done stairs is now a simple task.  </li>
            <li> (a quick, non-specific burst of reflexology is what I&#x27;m looking for during my busy schedule).</li>
            <li> It feels likes a strong vibration, but if you look closely when you turn it on and off, it actually oscillates in a circular pattern.  </li>
            <li> Hope it will make a difference with the neuropathy in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> I took the podiatrist&#x27;s recommendation and bought new balance shoes (1123), it helped but my right rear heel still hurt like heck (plantar fasciitis).  </li>
            <li> this really works</li>
            <li> I was a type 2 diabetic until losing 127 lbs with gastric by-pass surgery 3 years ago, so with this history, I have always experienced poor circulatory issues.  </li>
            <li> Although the machine seems very well constructed, all it does is vibrate.  </li>
            <li> This has turned out to be an absolute pain-saver for a patient challenged by diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and so do we.</li>
            <li> He used it for awhile but thought it caused too much itching and tickling of his feet.  </li>
            <li> It really got my circulation going big-time.</li>
            <li> -Intense vibration/oscilation movement.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> You really need to know how to use if affectively, however.</li>
            <li> It gives a very thorough massage &amp; in the recommended 20 minutes my feet feel reinvigorated.</li>
            <li> Thanks Medi-Rub</li>
            <li> This really helps mitigate some of that discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Wife says it really helps sooth her feet and improves circulation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always at the ready.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who needs, or wants a massager for their feet.  </li>
            <li> This foot massager works very well.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything but shake.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> my wife, mom, grandmother and myself agree that you feel very relax after using this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this foot massager!</li>
            <li> Whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I would need a knee replacement very soon.  </li>
            <li> I made it through the whole day by periodically using one of those machines.  </li>
            <li> it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This has been better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Again sent in, again a fast return.  </li>
            <li> It really soothes sore and aching feet and legs.</li>
            <li> My father is a diabetic, this really helped him with the circulation in his feet &amp; leg cramps.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and invigorating...</li>
            <li> I have Plantar Faciitus and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li> This is great for tired achy feet.</li>
            <li> Great for neuropathy or just tired feet.</li>
            <li> I now have happy feet when they are soooooooooo tired.</li>
            <li> This really helps when the gout flairs up in my toes</li>
            <li> it turned out to be a real pain.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;massage\\&quot; or \\&quot;rub\\</li>
            <li> This really helps my feet at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> so I bought another one for his birthday and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting the pair together!</li>
            <li> I have diabetic neuropathy and this is very comforting.</li>
            <li> It also is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> mine gets a ton of use and after 3 years of steady daily use, is still going strong.</li>
            <li> and I spent a lot of time on the phone with their (very friendly) customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MAJOR KUDOS to Medi-Rub!!!!!</li>
            <li> After use, you can feel this bubbly, tingling feeling in your legs, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to increased circulation, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Because of this (minor) problem and the Massager&#x27;s relatively high price, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars - but I&#x27;m still glad we bought it!</li>
            <li> I have used several other massage devices but Medi-rub is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> The massage action is quite strong, even when set on low.  </li>
            <li> When mine was delivered I put it on my carpet in front of my favorite chair and sat down and picked the highest setting immediately.  </li>
            <li> By the looks of it, they could sell it for less, still make money, and a lot more people could be helped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more mobile now and have less occurrences of stiffness in my legs.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the device is the horsey-looking graphic strip on the top front.</li>
            <li> I use it for 5-10 minutes a few times a day and it keeps me pretty much pain free.  </li>
            <li> this thing is so good I&#x27;ve even tried lying down on it for my back, but I instead bought its cousin the \\&quot;Medi-Rub Handheld Body Professional Massager\\</li>
            <li> However, for anyone else it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who likes this type of massage.</li>
            <li> After just 20 minutes in high (II) mode, she detected scratchy/itchy feelings in her feet.  </li>
            <li> the high level.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> I think the massaging action of this unit is better that other units we have had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved this little beauty to the top of my birthday</li>
            <li> If it does what it did last time, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY foot massager worth buying.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see (before I return it as being ineffective for the purpose I purchased it) after a few more days of usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some comments from others, but when you are in pain and stiff most of the day, who cares about the price.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Free shipping was quicker than expected!  </li>
            <li> bought new boots.</li>
            <li> bought new insoles.</li>
            <li> I am a late 20&#x27;s male in relatively good shape.    </li>
            <li> It is very loud, I never wear shoes with it.</li>
            <li> I used it with my bare feet, using the high setting, it felt decent but, for the price, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Might be helpful to have a higher middle section.</li>
            <li> and my feet actually get hot from standing/walking/running.</li>
            <li> The first one works well, so I bought a second one for my parents as a gift.</li>
            <li> It gets the blood flowing and actually makes me be able to go further on my daily walks!  </li>
            <li> This foot massager does not really massage--in the sense that it applies useful pressure at particular points to relax or knead muscles.</li>
            <li> I had read several reviews that said the high setting was just to much to take.  </li>
            <li> At 360lbs (at that time), with a sedentary job, I found myself becoming stiff after hours of sitting at my desk.  </li>
            <li> After a few seconds, my feet itch because the vibration is so strong.</li>
            <li> I particularly like wrapping my toes around the 1/2 round bar at the top, if completely relaxes my entire foot.  </li>
            <li> I have plantars fasciitis, I&#x27;m overweight (can be hard on the body) and am on my feet most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Both my wife and I use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li> I try to make sure I use this machine at least 10 minutes before bedtime as that almost gurantees</li>
            <li> I nearly quit my job (I am a teacher) because of mobility problems.  </li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;massage\\&quot; to the action at all.  </li>
            <li> My chiropractor concurred and I went in for therapy for nearly a month.  </li>
            <li> Also the color of the feet was near normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see how it would hurt sensitive feet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my folks (Over 65 years old).</li>
            <li> My neuropathy foot pain has been reduced considerably.</li>
            <li> loud I&#x27;m going to try and see if I can get it exchanged or returned</li>
            <li> I sent it in under warranty and got it back fast.  </li>
            <li> Now, with the unit out of warranty by 3 days, I get to pay shipping both ways to get this fixed.  </li>
            <li> Same thing just she has a much quieter one.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it nearly every night.</li>
            <li> I think the secret is not to apply much pressure but let your feet sit on top and let the machine do its thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely consistent and now (six months later) I occasionally wonder how many surgeries could be prevented if I had simply taken a little better care of myself with products and procedures - that although available, seem expensive - until one considers the ultimate cost to the alternatives (surgery, handi-cap, disability, immobility)!!!    </li>
            <li> When I stand back up I am fine, but when I am laying down, my feet throbbed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would seem that, apart from its stated benefits, this little wonder disrupts the firing of the pain receptors, to bring immediate comfort while experiencing the onset, or full throes, of DBN pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first tried this while on vacation when I had a sharp pain in my arch which slowed everyone down (which this helped), but the price was over $400.00 very high mark up, the price directly from the website that makes these is very high also.</li>
            <li> There is a high and low speed of vibration.  </li>
            <li> but there is a swith for low and high....</li>
            <li> I have high arches and the pain in my back shoots into my arches of my feet.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product as well as checking with local chiropractors to see which ones are expanding their practices to include treatment for neurological imbalances.</li>
            <li> I know it is because of the sensations I get that are different than my normal foot and leg that I also treat on the machine.  </li>
            <li> When they received it, I was called and they said it was the same problem but that they would replace my unit with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li> Very portable and not only massages his feet and heels but also the calves at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The company was good about sending me a return label and replacing the flawed one with the one I actually ordered.  </li>
            <li> did some research for major foot discomfort relief.</li>
            <li> This works fine and does help, however, it isn&#x27;t as hard on feet as I thought it might be.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to walk and most of the time I have to get a wheelchair if my family goes shopping.</li>
            <li> i use it barefoot or with socks on, but it works with shoes on too.it has two settings, although i&#x27;ve only used the higher one a few times, and it&#x27;s  pretty quiet and portable...</li>
            <li> but you do have to think about how to secure it on a hard service floor.</li>
            <li> Even on \\&quot;low\\&quot; (there are only two speeds - high and low)</li>
            <li> I can feel the vibration not only in the feet, but in the legs clear up to the thighs.  </li>
            <li> My old foot massager worked only on bare feet</li>
            <li> i took a pic of it and sent it to my hubby at work  since he shops a lot on amazon and 2 weeks later, he surprised me with it.i use it every day</li>
            <li> This is the third, and most expensive, foot \\&quot;massager\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve tried over the years, but I can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Her swelling has gone down on her first day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The past few days I have experienced less ankle pain than I have in 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Medi-Rub is also more comfortable and less awkward.</li>
            <li> So far, nothing has changed with my regular use of it for about ten days.</li>
            <li> I went to the chiropractor #rather than the doctor) because my fall just didn&#x27;t seem substantial enough to cause any major injury.  </li>
            <li> I also thought it was a little pricey at first</li>
            <li> use a wooden footsie roller at home for a general tonic effect on my feet</li>
            <li> -Upper \\&quot;bar\\&quot; is not ergonomic to the shape of your bare foot arch.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I do not own this (yet) but only b/c I have to save up for it.  </li>
            <li> This is so not worth the high price tag</li>
            <li> The only thing that kept me from 5 stars, was the low setting was a little fast for me.</li>
            <li> The Medi Rub really helps sore feet after a round of golf or a long walk.</li>
            <li> It does make an unfortunate amount of noise on our hardwood floors, but as long as we put something underneath it, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> My mobility is limited these days due to MS, &amp; pedal edema is a new Sx I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
            <li> My family said it was usually too intense for them &amp; according to some of the reviews...</li>
            <li> to not leave it running for too long as that can cause stiffening of the muscles, and later cramping of the feet.  </li>
            <li> I have had RLS for quite a long time, and was on a number of different medications over the years to address it.  </li>
            <li> They sat behind the sofa for a year or so...until I had a pretty traumatic accident that precluded sciatica and finally two back surgeries.  </li>
            <li> but it vibrates so much its hard to keep in one place.</li>
            <li> I have bad ankles since birth , this product is amazing .</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m desperate, I put a pillow on top of it and lay my neck on it-</li>
            <li> blood circulation was restricted to vital body parts (due to lack of Oxygen) and his feet started swelling and turning purple due to the varicose veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> The bumpy surface may keep your feet from slipping off, but it has no independent effect on the feet at all.  </li>
            <li> and I am on my feet all night long.  </li>
            <li> -Long, 10 foot cord.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the long cord, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> minor issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After purchasing it, I was elated because it was just what the doctor ordered after a long day at work.  </li>
            <li> Minor miracle.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I have had a condition where my feet ache at night.</li>
            <li> I had been getting sore calf muscles after long walks or workouts and</li>
            <li> I certainly would never have purchased this item if I had known in advance about this ridiculous return policy.</li>
            <li> My father&#x27;s circulation was restricted due to being in the final stages of COPD (</li>
            <li> I do not have any other medical problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My MIL actually likes this among all her other gadgets.  </li>
            <li> I was exhibiting, too, so I was standing and walking around my booth on concrete flooring in hard soled dress shoes.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for any kind of deeper massage you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The dial came loose after one day (used twice).</li>
            <li> The price has gone down since I last looked it up...</li>
            <li> However, if you have achy feet or just like to sit back and have a foot massage that leaves you tingling from the knees down for 10 minutes then this is for you.    </li>
            <li> I thought long and hard before spending nearly 300 bucks for this item.  </li>
            <li> both of these massagers is that they come with a very long cords!  </li>
            <li> I have had the unit back less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have severe Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), and I&#x27;m pregnant, unable to use medication to treat the RLS symptoms.  </li>
            <li> The osscilation, in contrast, moves your foot in a tight circle, which gives momentum/inertia (or whatever) to the fluid in your feet.  </li>
            <li> this machine puts my humble footsie roller in the shade within 15 seconds when it comes to sheer</li>
            <li> Dad has since died, however for his final few weeks, this helped his comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> few of my digital TV channels are affected by the machine&#x27;s frequency.  </li>
            <li> And I am not employed by this company - I just carefully read all the literature.  </li>
            <li> (A pity the manufacturer hasn&#x27;t come up with something attached to the Massager itself to solve this problem.)  </li>
            <li> but has not really helped the plantar fasciitis in my heel.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves to use it to get relief for those tired, sore feet and legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too rough, and just shook and shook.</li>
            <li> Medi-Rub brought them back to life with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not modern looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was told the problem was with the bearings slipping.  </li>
            <li> It does everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> my parents did not want to take the trouble shipping it back.</li>
            <li> &quot;  If you have ever spent all day walking around a theme park or zoo and then treated yourself to the experience</li>
            <li> There was not much in the way of a manuel....</li>
            <li> This was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful who you buy from.</li>
            <li> After a few treatments to legs, back and both shoulders, I could sleep through the night with minimal pain.  </li>
            <li> WE DID NOT EXPECT AN INSTANT MIRACLE, BUT WE BOTH FEEL A VERY SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR LEGS.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products that were a scam .</li>
            <li> It is a pretty expensive apparatus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I believe the company is deliberately trying to get rid of the flawed foot massagers instead of sending the Medi*Rub Massage that I (and others) ordered in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase their other machine also</li>
            <li> It does nothing other than vibrate  </li>
            <li> This made a simple 15 step walk to the copier a long and slow process as I would have to wait until the feelings returned to my legs after standing-up, after a few days using this and a few desk exercises, and a month later, I no longer require to have the massager at work anymore.  </li>
            <li> I would Recommend it to others please purchase one you will not be disappointed at all:)</li>
            <li> 3x/day (she can go extreme) for starter.  </li>
            <li> , the high speed is serious!  </li>
            <li> A little heavier than expected</li>
            <li> Well, 3 years later, I have not had his stupid injections all that time, and I use my massager faithfully...and unless I really overdo it on something physical...</li>
            <li> But, that cosmetic disappointment aside, this thing is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> only negative is that it is a bit pricy.  </li>
            <li> But Please shop around.......for the $279...or on some sites over $300.00 it is not worth the cost in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is, no heat function.</li>
            <li> so I found this baby on amazon for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Quite often, she will spend a half of an hour with a book on her lap and her feet on the device.</li>
            <li> After experiencing foot massage with this machine, patients report improved sleep and less reliance on pain relief products.  </li>
            <li> the swelling decreased to barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> The unit is louder than other units we have had, but isn&#x27;t so loud to be disturbing.</li>
            <li> (The one at the chiro office was worn down a bit with heavy use.)    </li>
            <li> The next morning my shoulders hurt and my mobility was poor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting stronger and healthier everyday</li>
            <li> Poor guy finally gets a break!  </li>
            <li> show a few months ago.</li>
            <li> so he won&#x27;t get carpal tunnel from  constantly massaging my tired feet.</li>
            <li> And the feeling didn&#x27;t wear off after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> At close to $200.00 it&#x27;s not cheap, but does the job &amp; seems well built.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND HAS VARICOSE VEINS AND POOR CIRCULATION IN HIS FEET (ESPECIALLY THE TOES).  </li>
            <li> feet felt like they were dead no matter what i tried.</li>
            <li> I was desperate and in pain, unable to walk for more than a few minutes before I could not walk anymore.  </li>
            <li> Very disapointing for an expensive massager!</li>
            <li> We bought BOTH medi rub units (as a set it&#x27;s less expensive# at a trade show a few years back.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone that suffers from foot pain.</li>
            <li> NO MORE CRAMPING</li>
            <li> AT NIGHT AND NO MORE NUMBNESS IN HER LEGS..  </li>
            <li> This thing should sell for no more than $49.00......tops.  </li>
            <li> This past winter I fell and threw my arms up in the air as I plunged toward the ground.  </li>
            <li> get the wrong message, this does not cure or treat the COPD, however it helps the patient - in the final stages - to put on their shoes and walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They initially sent me the wrong machine.  </li>
            <li> I am the third customer who received the wrong machine, read the reviews.</li>
            <li> As for the Foot Massager \\&quot;running away\\&quot; from the user on a hardwood or laminate floor, yes, we had that problem too, but then tried putting an ordinary bathtub/shower mat underneath it.  </li>
            <li> Within another 3 months, the unit failed again, same characteristics.  </li>
            <li> Four months later, it failed again</li>
            <li> The rubber feet are too slick.</li>
            <li> My feet usually have sore places from exercise and aerobic dancing.</li>
            <li> I have had this item in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would purchase again if I thought about it.</li>
            <li> Oh, and this is one tough well built little machine...</li>
            <li> I am very overweight and that causes poor circulation in my legs and makes climbing stairs a really painful experience.  </li>
            <li> i stand up for over 8 hours at work every day and lately my ankles have been swelling.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least four times a week.  </li>
            <li> I have extreme diabetes foot pain, and this thing makes it all GO AWAY!!!!</li>
            <li> We usually put a pillow behind it and use the coffee table to keep it from running away.</li>
            <li> You can lean on it with your back, but its very uncomfortable and almost feel like your teeth are chattering.</li>
            <li> 6 months later I looked it up online and was shocked at the price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this massager for my 87 year old aunt, who suffers from leg cramps so bad that they wake her up at night.  </li>
            <li> She is a heart patient, so even though she is thin, she has some restricted circulation problems.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just what the doctor ordered for tired achy feet.</li>
            <li> WE HAVE BEEN USING IT NOW FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH.  </li>
            <li> Decreased taking Tramadol tablets for pain....  </li>
            <li> I use it when i feel tired.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s out of Amazon&#x27;s return window, this company WILL NOT stand behind their product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and there is numbness behind my toes.  </li>
            <li> the sensation travels up the legs and reenergizes tired feet and legs.  </li>
            <li> If you want a massager for tired feet, look for something else.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with tired feet.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this for tired feet-stand all day on job-, numbness in toes,heels, and balls.  </li>
            <li> For about the past 2 months it has been so painful</li>
            <li> This seems expensive, but consider what a trip to, say, the podiatrist for an ingrown toenail costs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I threw the box away after we opened it</li>
            <li> The product photo is absurd - anyone using this machine while wearing business shoes is a looney</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s an expensive foot massager.  </li>
            <li> It is a flawed design.</li>
            <li> After a mere 15 minutes, I got up, and - no exagerrating, I promise - my feet did not hurt.  </li>
            <li> It is absurdly expensive.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, though...</li>
            <li> and today it has once again failed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product with lousy quality control.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something that won&#x27;t incessantly fail.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but to me</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift for a family member who suffers from neuropathy in the feet.  </li>
            <li> I no longer get up and feel afraid to walk because I can now feel my feet on the floor.  </li>
            <li> Looks weird, but my fiancee loves the way it works!  </li>
            <li> My feet hurt so badly, I had stopped moving just to try to take stress off them.  </li>
            <li> As the show was wrapping up, I was talking to the Medi-rub guy, and I thought, what the heck, my feet are as bad as they&#x27;ll ever be, let&#x27;s put this thing to the test.      </li>
            <li> If you get one that goes bad, BEWARE.  </li>
            <li> Then my knees went bad...</li>
            <li> So bad that I did not test it before I shipped it to my parents and</li>
            <li> Might also help if a person has bad circulation in their feet.</li>
            <li> However, they didn&#x27;t have a painful heel spur with plantar fasciitis like I did.  </li>
            <li> And no kidding, I have not had one night of painful feet since.</li>
            <li> But you will not be disappointed in its performance.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had one, used it for years until the motor burnt out!! HAD to have another one!! In a wheelchair, so my feet really need the circulation this massager provides! And the the pain relief!! Wow! Love, Love, Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have had feet circulation problems for years. This product is absolutely amazing for improving my circulation and I can walk with no problems or pain.</li>
            <li> The Medi Rub really helps sore feet after a round of golf or a long walk. It relaxes the sore points and stimulates blood flow. Both my wife and I use it nearly every day. A great value for a product of this quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself based on the good reviews and I was not disappointed.  I am very overweight and that causes poor circulation in my legs and makes climbing stairs a really painful experience.  This machine has done wonders for me.  It has strengthen my legs so I can now walk at a more normal pace,  Walking up and done stairs is now a simple task.  I try to make sure I use this machine at least 10 minutes before bedtime as that almost gurantees I will not have leg cramps and that reduces my stress level and allows me to sleep more peacefully.  I have just purchased a 2nd one for a friend, who I know cannot afford it, but walks in a way, that I am just he will be getting good use out of it. Be generous to yourself, in purchasing this machine for your own use.  And after you have experienced it&#x27;s positive effects, be generous to a friend, if you can afford to by a 2nd one.</li>
            <li> I love how I feel after using this for only 5-10 mins but I dont like how it moves around, how I cannot adjust the angle. I do love it though enough to try and build a wood box around it to be able to adjust the angle and to keep it put under my computer desk when turned on.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more helpful with my diabetic feet ...doesn&#x27;t seem to help ..would not recommend to people with diabetic problems of the feet</li>
            <li> I have bad ankles since birth , this product is amazing . I have tried other products that were a scam . this really works I only wish I had it 30 years ago</li>
            <li> This seems expensive, but consider what a trip to, say, the podiatrist for an ingrown toenail costs. In that light, this is a bargain. I like the machine, the design, the thoughtful rubber feet (so it won&#x27;t creep off while running). The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the device is the horsey-looking graphic strip on the top front. Just use Helvetica, you know? Keep it simple. Hire a graphic designer. Do not try and cobble it together if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Makes the product look cheap. But, that cosmetic disappointment aside, this thing is worth its weight in gold. Kind of loud in operation, but you&#x27;ll be so blissed-out you won&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> Dad is a diabetic.  Hoping this relives some of his problems</li>
            <li> I had Polio as a child (9 mos.) and had an ankle fusion at 18 years of age.  I was a type 2 diabetic until losing 127 lbs with gastric by-pass surgery 3 years ago, so with this history, I have always experienced poor circulatory issues.  I was advised last year by two Orthopedic surgeons to have my foot amputated because of circulation and arthritic pain in my ankle.  For about the past 2 months it has been so painful I nearly quit my job (I am a teacher) because of mobility problems.  Anyway, I received this machine about one week ago and have been using it every night and morning.  The past few days I have experienced less ankle pain than I have in 20 years.  This machine is causing my circulation to increase.  I know it is because of the sensations I get that are different than my normal foot and leg that I also treat on the machine.  This is a God send for me.  Do not hesitate at the price as it is priceless.</li>
            <li> I love this masager for my feet! 5 minutes and my feet and legs feel much better!</li>
            <li> I bought this massager for my 87 year old aunt, who suffers from leg cramps so bad that they wake her up at night.  She is a heart patient, so even though she is thin, she has some restricted circulation problems.  I asked her doctor before hand if this would be a good product (always a good idea to ask the doc, especially with the elderly).  Any way, he said it couldn&#x27;t hurt, so I got it.  &lt;br /&gt;SHE LOVES IT....NO MORE CRAMPING AT NIGHT AND NO MORE NUMBNESS IN HER LEGS..  She is one happy camper. &lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it is a bit pricy.  By the looks of it, they could sell it for less, still make money, and a lot more people could be helped.  I thought long and hard before spending nearly 300 bucks for this item.  &lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line...If you can afford it, buy it..It&#x27;s great..</li>
            <li> We got the MediRub Foot Massager to counteract the effects of neuropathy primarily in my wife&#x27;s feet as the result of chemotherapy.  Although the machine seems very well constructed, all it does is vibrate.  There is no \\&quot;massage\\&quot; to the action at all.  The bumpy surface may keep your feet from slipping off, but it has no independent effect on the feet at all.  Unfortunately, I threw the box away after we opened it or I would have sent the item back for a refund.  It is a pretty expensive apparatus.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  if you want some kind of \\&quot;massage\\&quot; action, do NOT get the MediRub Foot Massager</li>
            <li> This has turned out to be an absolute pain-saver for a patient challenged by diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&lt;br /&gt;It would seem that, apart from its stated benefits, this little wonder disrupts the firing of the pain receptors, to bring immediate comfort while experiencing the onset, or full throes, of DBN pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Care to not leave it running for too long as that can cause stiffening of the muscles, and later cramping of the feet.  5-10 minutes works best as far as can be seen.</li>
            <li> I work the over night shift and I am on my feet all night long.  I have tryed about 4 different foot massagers from one that I bought in a garage sale for $7.00 to my latest purchase of this Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000 Plus.  I purchased mine on Ebay for $130.00.  The product is built very well as others have mentioned and has a pretty powerful motor.  When mine was delivered I put it on my carpet in front of my favorite chair and sat down and picked the highest setting immediately.  I had read several reviews that said the high setting was just to much to take.  I disagree, although I realize many people have tender sore feet or a medical condition that would keep them from using the high setting, it didn&#x27;t feel that powerful to me.  In fact I wish it had a higher setting.  I didn&#x27;t find it all that spectular or any kind of miracle cure for my sore feet either as I expected.  I also left it on for more than 10-15 minutes, more like 35 minutes.  You can feel it in your calfs as others have mentioned.  It sure didn&#x27;t take the pain and soreness away from my feet so far.  I have used it several times after work and I would rate it average at best.  A good hand foot massage ranks higher in my book. I think that this product is way over priced and glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full price for a new one.  The $7.00 massager I got at a garage sale performs almost as well as this Medi-Rub at a fraction of the cost.  For those who have found it to be a miracle cure for their feet......good for you and it might work for others too. But Please shop around.......for the $279...or on some sites over $300.00 it is not worth the cost in my opinion.  This thing should sell for no more than $49.00......tops.  When your feet hurt it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s made in the USA or at The North Pole, you just want relief.  I found that just soaking my feet in a tub of hot water with some epson salts much more soothing than this massager.  I have put my money into a great set of orthotic inserts and some very comfortable running shoes which has brought me much better relief from my foot pain than using this massager.  I was pretty disappointed......live and learn!  Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> We use this twice a day and feel soooo good after the 20 min. massages.  Love it.  Bought one for our daughter and husband and they love it and use it faithfully</li>
            <li> Excellent... I call it &amp;#34;My Foot Heroin&amp;#34; so relaxing ... Works great with shoes on or off</li>
            <li> This feels so good.  Works great.  I originally tried it at a county fair but was glad I didn&#x27;t buy it there since I got a better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> for a commmercial unit I thought the intensity would be greater. I rate it good, but for the price I expected better.</li>
            <li> We purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law.  Mom has diabetes and this massager stimulates circulation in her feet and legs.  She absolutely loves it and so do we.</li>
            <li> My husband has neuropathy in his legs and feet.  We bought BOTH medi rub units (as a set it&#x27;s less expensive# at a trade show a few years back.  He used it for awhile but thought it caused too much itching and tickling of his feet.  They sat behind the sofa for a year or so...until I had a pretty traumatic accident that precluded sciatica and finally two back surgeries.  I started using the med-rubs for my feet, legs and hips, and I was amazed at the difference in my pain levels! This past winter I fell and threw my arms up in the air as I plunged toward the ground.  The next morning my shoulders hurt and my mobility was poor.  I went to the chiropractor #rather than the doctor) because my fall just didn&#x27;t seem substantial enough to cause any major injury.  My chiropractor concurred and I went in for therapy for nearly a month.  During this time I kind of \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; about the medi rub treatments I had been giving myself.  My back started hurting and my legs started getting cramps and aches and pains.  My shoulders didn&#x27;t seem to be responding well to the chiropractic either.  I felt great for ONE day after each treatment.  I had family come to town and couldn&#x27;t get in to see the chiropractor so I decided to give the medi rubs a try and it was AMAZING!  After a few treatments to legs, back and both shoulders, I could sleep through the night with minimal pain.  I&#x27;ve been extremely consistent and now (six months later) I occasionally wonder how many surgeries could be prevented if I had simply taken a little better care of myself with products and procedures - that although available, seem expensive - until one considers the ultimate cost to the alternatives (surgery, handi-cap, disability, immobility)!!!    I&#x27;m getting stronger and healthier everyday and I use both products(my goal is 3-4 10 minute sessions each day).  I know this is a bit lengthy, but I&#x27;ve recommended medi-rub to numerous family and friends and everyone who has purchased them raves about them (it justtakes consistency and a bit of patience to see amazing results)!</li>
            <li> After experiencing this machine at my foot reflexologist&#x27;s office today, I came to this page to check the price. If it was affordable I would buy one this instant. (It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you have the ability to pay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reflexologist put me on the Medi-Rub machine to get me warmed up for my treatment. She didn&#x27;t do that for my first appointment and I could tell the difference. It really got my circulation going big-time. The reflexology treatment then seemed to \\&quot;follow\\&quot; the increased circulation up my legs and into my pelvis. It also increased the relaxation aspect of the treatment considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a wooden footsie roller at home for a general tonic effect on my feet (a quick, non-specific burst of reflexology is what I&#x27;m looking for during my busy schedule). This now seems like a caveman tool. I thought the roller effect was pretty darn wonderful until I experienced the Medi-Rub Foot Massager. Even on \\&quot;low\\&quot; (there are only two speeds - high and low) this machine puts my humble footsie roller in the shade within 15 seconds when it comes to sheer stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Medi-Rub is also more comfortable and less awkward. I can sit back in an armchair and allow the tilt of the footpad to support me, instead of perching on the edge of a chair and running in place on the rollers. The \\&quot;running in place\\&quot; action makes my back ache, whereas the Medi-Rub Massager doesn&#x27;t require a straining posture of any kind. You don&#x27;t have to do anything but close your eyes and let the bliss happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent therapeutic device, but it&#x27;s also a superb way to get completely relaxed in the space of a few minutes. I&#x27;ve moved this little beauty to the top of my birthday wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The product photo is absurd - anyone using this machine while wearing business shoes is a looney toon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S. I take that back! I visited the manufacturer&#x27;s Website (medirub.com in Texas) and found out you can use it either while wearing shoes or barefoot.ile wearing shoes or barefoot.</li>
            <li> My father&#x27;s circulation was restricted due to being in the final stages of COPD (emphysema).&lt;br /&gt;The blood circulation was restricted to vital body parts (due to lack of Oxygen) and his feet started swelling and turning purple due to the varicose veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got him a MediRub and the swelling decreased to barely noticeable. Also the color of the feet was near normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get the wrong message, this does not cure or treat the COPD, however it helps the patient - in the final stages - to put on their shoes and walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad has since died, however for his final few weeks, this helped his comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check w/your doctor before using (if similar conditions exists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary, I give this product thumbs up (approve) - it is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Free shipping was quicker than expected!  My feet thank you, Amazon!  6 years ago, at a chiropractic office, I tried this machine &amp; LOVED IT!  My family said it was usually too intense for them &amp; according to some of the reviews...I guess they have company.  However, they didn&#x27;t have a painful heel spur with plantar fasciitis like I did.  After using it for 30 minutes, my feet &amp; calves felt \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; &amp; tingly, but it took many times of using this for my pain to go away.  Eventually it did &amp; we stopped going to the Chiro.  It&#x27;s been about 5 yrs &amp; the pain has returned.......&amp; that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve returned to get my very own.  The price has gone down since I last looked it up...still pricey, but more manageable.  If it does what it did last time, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I also don&#x27;t need to rely on my husband to massage my feet all the time.  Poor guy finally gets a break!  I found that it&#x27;s helpful to move my feet around in different positions to continue to feel the massage because my feet get used to the vibrations.   I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product, but would definitely consider it a good medical investment.  Pros:      -Intense vibration/oscilation movement.  Gets the fluids moving.    -Long, 10 foot cord.  Important for me!    -Quality product.  If it can stand the abuse of being in a chiropractor&#x27;s waiting room....it should hold up for household use.    -Don&#x27;t need to wait for someone to massage your feet!  :)  Cons:      -Only 2 speeds.  The newer (pricier) model has 11, but couldn&#x27;t justify the extra $70 just for that.    -A few of my digital TV channels are affected by the machine&#x27;s frequency.  I rely on digital airwaves - no cable.    -Would have preferred \\&quot;nubs\\&quot; (like on a massage ball) instead of squares on the footbed.  It matters when you are barefoot or in socks.  (The one at the chiro office was worn down a bit with heavy use.)    -Still pricey.    -Upper \\&quot;bar\\&quot; is not ergonomic to the shape of your bare foot arch.  Might be helpful to have a higher middle section.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s an expensive foot massager.  However, if you have achy feet or just like to sit back and have a foot massage that leaves you tingling from the knees down for 10 minutes then this is for you.    I&#x27;ll come right out and say it... I&#x27;m cheap.  I cringe at the cost of this product and would have never bought it if my mother-in-law didn&#x27;t have one that I was able to use over several summer vacation trips.  Wow, just an amazing way to end the day after biking/hiking/working/etc.  I particularly like wrapping my toes around the 1/2 round bar at the top, if completely relaxes my entire foot.  My wife places her heels on the bar as well and says it&#x27;s great relief for her recurring heel pain.    The massage action is quite strong, even when set on low.  I can see how it would hurt sensitive feet.  However, for anyone else it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The ONLY foot massager worth buying.  No podiatrist needed now.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have severe Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), and I&#x27;m pregnant, unable to use medication to treat the RLS symptoms.  I have had RLS for quite a long time, and was on a number of different medications over the years to address it.  Of course, none of them are greatly paired with pregnancy, so I just have to suffer.  This massager helps distract the discomfort of RLS.  Even after I turn it off, I get a good 15 minutes of relief, and I can usually fall asleep.  Combined with some heat therapy and compression stockings, and I&#x27;m feeling alright.</li>
            <li> excellentt machine met my needs very well would recommend it to anyone I had problems with cramp and swelling in both legs and the improvement is amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Paterson</li>
            <li> I would not buy from this vendor, The Buying Group, again even though I like the foot massager.  They initially sent me the wrong machine.  I am the third customer who received the wrong machine, read the reviews. The one I received had a dial that stuck up instead of a switch.  The dial came loose after one day (used twice). It is a flawed design. The company was good about sending me a return label and replacing the flawed one with the one I actually ordered.  However, I believe the company is deliberately trying to get rid of the flawed foot massagers instead of sending the Medi*Rub Massage that I (and others) ordered in the first place. Buy from Amazon instead.  They are more reliable.</li>
            <li> Great item, what a fantastic massage, feet and legs feel great after only 10 minutes of use.  After use, you can feel this bubbly, tingling feeling in your legs, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to increased circulation, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i stand up for over 8 hours at work every day and lately my ankles have been swelling.  i saw this massager on the wendy williams show a few months ago. i took a pic of it and sent it to my hubby at work  since he shops a lot on amazon and 2 weeks later, he surprised me with it.i use it every day so he won&#x27;t get carpal tunnel from  constantly massaging my tired feet. it&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny!! i use it barefoot or with socks on, but it works with shoes on too.it has two settings, although i&#x27;ve only used the higher one a few times, and it&#x27;s  pretty quiet and portable...it&#x27;s just what the doctor ordered for tired achy feet.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I do not own this (yet) but only b/c I have to save up for it.  I am almost there.  And I am not employed by this company - I just carefully read all the literature.  I am a late 20&#x27;s male in relatively good shape.    I WILL be buying this, however, and here is why  (UPDATE: I did buy it, and I still like it).  This is hands down the most amazing foot \\&quot;massage\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I put massage in quotes because I feel that terming it a massage is sort of a half-truth.  Contrary to what most believe, the machine does not vibrate.  It osscilates (i.e. it moves in a circle - not back and forth).  This is an important distinction.  Vibrating just shakes your feet back in forth rapidly to stir up the body fluids in your foot.  It feels good while it is happening, but wears of pretty quickly (in my experience).  The osscilation, in contrast, moves your foot in a tight circle, which gives momentum/inertia (or whatever) to the fluid in your feet.  It has the effect of &#x27;pushing&#x27; the blood through your foot and back up your leg.      I encountered this thing as a trade show.  I immediately thought it was a gimmick at a booth (veg-o-matic, anyone?).  I was exhibiting, too, so I was standing and walking around my booth on concrete flooring in hard soled dress shoes.  From 6 am to about 3 pm, this was my day.  My feet hurt so badly, I had stopped moving just to try to take stress off them.  As the show was wrapping up, I was talking to the Medi-rub guy, and I thought, what the heck, my feet are as bad as they&#x27;ll ever be, let&#x27;s put this thing to the test.      The first 5 minutes or so were almost excrutiating pain as the cirulation in my legs got stirred up after a whole day on my feet.  But then I settled in and started to feel significantly better.  After a mere 15 minutes, I got up, and - no exagerrating, I promise - my feet did not hurt.  At all.  It felt like I had just gotten out of bed.  And the feeling didn&#x27;t wear off after a few minutes.  I was sold then and there.      But it cost $300, so I couldn&#x27;t impulse buy that.    Oh, and wear your shoes.  It&#x27;s more comfortable.  Since it works by osscilation, your feet still get the momentum transfer from the machine, unlike a vibrating machine where your shoes eat all the vibration.    If you wear dress shoes, if you&#x27;re on your feet all day, heck if you walk 18 holes of golf - 15 minutes on this thing at the end of your day will feel like heaven on earth.      It is absurdly expensive.  But you will not be disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of massager at a health care providers offfice before, I did not think about buying one until I came across it online. It is simply amazing, all the nerve endings in my feet are doin much better. Even my balance is better. You really need to know how to use if affectively, however. I was lucky and someone showed me how to get the best results.</li>
            <li> Like other types of massage, this is one of the few things in life that not only feels wonderful but is actually GOOD for you!  How often can we say that?  (If these were the only considerations, I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars.)  As for the Foot Massager \\&quot;running away\\&quot; from the user on a hardwood or laminate floor, yes, we had that problem too, but then tried putting an ordinary bathtub/shower mat underneath it.  The shower mat grips the floor and has solved the problem.  (A pity the manufacturer hasn&#x27;t come up with something attached to the Massager itself to solve this problem.)  Because of this (minor) problem and the Massager&#x27;s relatively high price, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars - but I&#x27;m still glad we bought it!</li>
            <li> great product, very pleased</li>
            <li> Actually ran into this device in a car wash, went home &amp; ordered. It gives a very thorough massage &amp; in the recommended 20 minutes my feet feel reinvigorated. At close to $200.00 it&#x27;s not cheap, but does the job &amp; seems well built.</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED BY OUR DR.  MY HUSBAND HAS VARICOSE VEINS AND POOR CIRCULATION IN HIS FEET (ESPECIALLY THE TOES).  AFTER A HIP REPLACEMENT I STILL HAVE SWELLING IN MY LEGS.  WE FELT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT TO TRY THIS VIBRATOR.  WE HAVE BEEN USING IT NOW FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH.  WE DID NOT EXPECT AN INSTANT MIRACLE, BUT WE BOTH FEEL A VERY SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR LEGS.  WE ARE HOPING,  OVER A  PERIOD OF TIME THAT THIS WILL HELP US.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve EVER MADE!!!! I have extreme diabetes foot pain, and this thing makes it all GO AWAY!!!! I&#x27;m going to purchase their other machine also, I&#x27;ve had such good success with this one.... MAJOR KUDOS to Medi-Rub!!!!! I&#x27;m 110% satisfied and flippin&#x27; thrilled to death!!!!!</li>
            <li> I stand all day at work so my feet hurt.  I took the podiatrist&#x27;s recommendation and bought new balance shoes (1123), it helped but my right rear heel still hurt like heck (plantar fasciitis).  So I took a shot and bought this.  While using the medirub I feel immediate relief, I wear house shoes with it.  After using it for about 5 minutes and stopping, I can feel my feet continue to pulsate, like its improving circulation, so it should be good for diabetics.  It feels likes a strong vibration, but if you look closely when you turn it on and off, it actually oscillates in a circular pattern.  I think the secret is not to apply much pressure but let your feet sit on top and let the machine do its thing.  I&#x27;m temped to try the Medirub Body Massager 2000 Plus, because I think it would do a good job as a back and shoulder massager.</li>
            <li> I have used several other massage devices but Medi-rub is hands down the best! Very easy to use and simple to put away when not in use. I am currently using it 2-3 times a day on low, have NOT had any feet cramps. Hope it will make a difference with the neuropathy in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> This is one of the better foot massagers I have seen and used. It helps me with my nerve pain. I use it a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my folks (Over 65 years old). They say it gives them relief for a while. So, I guess at this price this item is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, relaxes not only your feet but your whole body.  Anyone with diabetic foot problems or anyone with circulation problems should consider this machine.</li>
            <li> Works well....but has not really helped the plantar fasciitis in my heel. Fun to use, however.</li>
            <li> I like the foot massager very much. I use it twice per day. I recommend this product for anyone to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I had back surgery last year and suffered from numbness in my left foot and leg. After using this massager I can feel a big improvement in both my leg and my foot. This gave me better results than many trips to my P. Therapist and you can only guess how much that can cost in both time and $$.     I also thought it was a little pricey at first but now I consider it a money saving device that has paid for its self many times over. I plan on sending one to my Mom and Dad as a Easter gift.      Thanks Medi-Rub</li>
            <li> good product that met expectations</li>
            <li> I have it under my desk as my footstool and with a flick of a toe I can get a foot massage anytime. Strong and powerful and it shakes the muscles all the way up to the calfs.</li>
            <li> Greatest foot rub ever. I now have 2  one for each location</li>
            <li> About me-  I have plantars fasciitis, I&#x27;m overweight (can be hard on the body) and am on my feet most of the day.  I do not have any other medical problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does- Literally all it does is vibrate, but for that&#x27;s enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love it- Within 5 minutes my feet and legs tingle and I feel instant relief.  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived all 29 years of my life without it. When I&#x27;m desperate, I put a pillow on top of it and lay my neck on it- it&#x27;s great for my tension headaches!  I appreciate the long cord, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I came to have one- My friend dropped some items off to me that she didn&#x27;t want anymore, and when I tried this for the first time I was amazed.  6 months later I looked it up online and was shocked at the price.  But considering the relief it gives me, if this one ever craps out, I will probably save up for another.</li>
            <li> makes the feet and leg feel refreshed</li>
            <li> My father in-law has one and my wife tried it and wanted one for herself.  She loves the product.  She had surgery on her foot a while back and often has pain in her feet.  This really helps mitigate some of that discomfort.  Plus for me is that I don&#x27;t have to give her daily foot massages.</li>
            <li> Great natural alternative for diabetic neuropathy pain... Decreased taking Tramadol tablets for pain....  People with diabetic should have this massager with them....</li>
            <li> I spend hours on my feet - AT ALTITUDE- and my feet actually get hot from standing/walking/running. This makes my job tolerable!</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it when i feel tired. I am an operating room nurse and on my feet a lot, and having medi-rub is so helpful..</li>
            <li> I bought this massager for my wife. She is a waitress and feet get sore. I first saw this product at a trade show, they wanted $249,,,,ouch. I did some research all reviews were positive so I found this baby on amazon for less than half the price. Wife says it really helps sooth her feet and improves circulation.</li>
            <li> Husband has problems with his feet and this seems to help.  I would recommend this product - it doesn&#x27;t have heat but it has two speed settings.</li>
            <li> I used this device at a Neuropathy clinic ( along with a TENSUnit and a supplement) .  This was the last thing added to my treatment and made quite a difference in the way my feet felt.  I use it 3 times a week ( although was told I could use it daily) as part of my at home treatment and am maintaining the improvement I made at the clinic. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this baby!  I keep it in my office under my desk, so it&#x27;s always at the ready.  Well built - in the USA of course!  The low speed works great, the high speed is serious!  The toe bar is handy, even works well to rest the backs of your heels on.  Either curl your toes over the bar, or bump the fronts of your toes against it - either way, nice.  Something interesting too, shoes seems to accentuate the benefits of the oscillation, especially rubber flip flops, as it amplifies the effect.  After a good 10 minutes or so, you really feel the blood moving in your feet and lower legs.</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations.  I think the massaging action of this unit is better that other units we have had. I can feel the vibration not only in the feet, but in the legs clear up to the thighs.  The machine is well built, sturdy, and putting pressure on it does not cause the motor to lug. The unit is louder than other units we have had, but isn&#x27;t so loud to be disturbing. I recommend this to anyone who needs, or wants a massager for their feet.  I&#x27;m diabetic with numbness in my toes. By using a massager am able to keep numbness from spreading to the rest of my feet. This is a great machine.</li>
            <li> This foot massager works very well.  The first one we bought was to help with neuropathy.  It stimulates and helps to make feet and lower legs feel better.  We bought another one for a family member who stands all day at work.  The whole family loves to use it to get relief for those tired, sore feet and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Massages/shakes your feet so well that you can feel it up to your knees. So relaxing to keep it right under the computer desk while using the computer. Afterwards, it feels like you don&#x27;t have any feet and that you are simply floating.</li>
            <li> I have had some vein issues and edema.  this item is well built.  Vibration is just enough.  Makes your feet tingle.  Worth what I paid.  At the age of 59 this item will come in handy.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a simple foot massager. This isn&#x27;t the one for me! Too rough, and just shook and shook. Didn&#x27;t really do anything but shake.</li>
            <li> If you get one that goes bad, BEWARE.  If it&#x27;s out of Amazon&#x27;s return window, this company WILL NOT stand behind their product.  They suggested that I have Amazon repair it.  Nice, huh?</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this machine. It helps with his varicose veins. Expensive, though...</li>
            <li> Some of the literature about this device indicated that it might be useful for peripheral neuropathy in the feet. So far, nothing has changed with my regular use of it for about ten days. Maybe I am expecting too much.  We&#x27;ll see (before I return it as being ineffective for the purpose I purchased it) after a few more days of usage.</li>
            <li> Exceeded our expectations, commercial quality</li>
            <li> THANX  FOR THE GREAT &amp; GOOD DEAL !!!!!!....NKF</li>
            <li> did some research for major foot discomfort relief. I wear work boots averaging 12 hours a day. bought new boots. bought new insoles. bought custom orthotics. feet felt like they were dead no matter what i tried. Medi-Rub brought them back to life with just a few uses. when foot discomfort returns, a relaxing 15 minute massage gets me walking painlessly. Love this unit and recommend to all.</li>
            <li> My wife and I had been wanting to buy this massager for awhile now. The price is what kept us away from doing so. We both had previously tried it in person at the fair and love it. This is why when i saw it for $177 and not the regular $299 price we both knew it was a done deal. It works great my wife, mom, grandmother and myself agree that you feel very relax after using this product. It&#x27;s great for over all blood circulation.</li>
            <li> This is a very good buy.  The only thing that kept me from 5 stars, was the low setting was a little fast for me.</li>
            <li> i only tried this medirub for 2 days...but that was enough for me to know that this wasnt the foot massager for me. when i placed my feet on the medirub without shoes, it felt like i had my feet on a bag of wasps. i then put it on low and that felt like a bag of mosquitoes. so,i put my shoes on and it was more tolerable. but the medirub was on a tiled floor and kept moving away from my body. i ended up sending it back. though, the first time i used it for aprox 10mins, it made my feet feel, only slightly better. like from a 3 to a 2.25(even thought im not supposed to use fractions/decimals)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this foot massager! After work I use it and find almost instant relief from achy feet after walking on them nonstop!</li>
            <li> My review matches most others.  It does dance on the floor and, therefore, I&#x27;ll need to make something to hold it in place.  It does nothing other than vibrate  but that is what it said it would do so that is acceptable.  The motor should be shielded as it creates noise on my computer....minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made, comes packed well and seems to work which is what I bought it for.  Overall, a good product but you do have to think about how to secure it on a hard service floor.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and they like it very much.  Sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is helping my feet and hands.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations.  My neuropathy foot pain has been reduced considerably. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This is the  third one I&#x27;ve bought this month I like it!  Like it like it like it love it.</li>
            <li> Great - thanks. Love this item. Best massager I&#x27;ve ever found.Definately worth the price. Whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li> We love it. Makes your feet feel real good and hands too.</li>
            <li> So, I have owned this massager for YEARS...it sat in my closet in the box for probably 3 years,,,untouched.  Then my knees went bad...I had just dropped 50 pounds and discovered I loved jogging, only to have my knees buckle and my orthopedist tell me my knees had no cartilidge left and I would never run again.  Oh, and I would need a knee replacement very soon.  Until then, he gave me cortizone shots, and then hydraluronic acid injectons in my knees, which did not work.  I was desperate and in pain, unable to walk for more than a few minutes before I could not walk anymore.  My knees popped, crunched, locked up....you name it.  I was at a county fair soon after this, and had only been there a couple of minutes when I could not walk anymore.  My husband suggested I try one of the super powerful foot massager stations you put a couple of quarters in that they have all over the place...and I did...and the pain went away.  I made it through the whole day by periodically using one of those machines.  I came home and took this massager out of my closet and put it below my desk.  I use it for 5-10 minutes a few times a day and it keeps me pretty much pain free.  No, I can&#x27;t jog still, but I can do almost anything else that I want to.  This machine has quite literally saved my life and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough for anyone with knee pain.  I told my orthopedist and he laughed and said the effect would not last.  Well, 3 years later, I have not had his stupid injections all that time, and I use my massager faithfully...and unless I really overdo it on something physical...I am pretty much pain free.  I would say the joke is on him. Oh, and this is one tough well built little machine...mine gets a ton of use and after 3 years of steady daily use, is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Looks weird, but my fiancee loves the way it works!  It does make an unfortunate amount of noise on our hardwood floors, but as long as we put something underneath it, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day my feet and legs are sore from standing all day.  15 minutes on this massager and I feel great.  It vibrates very intensely which supports circulation in the feet and legs.  It works great.</li>
            <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s and has feet swelling.  I bought the foot massager for him based on the reviews.  You just plug it in and dial &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; settings.  The roll at the top lets you massage toes and arches.  He massages his feet every evening and I have begun to do so also.  It is very relaxing and your feet feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> My wife went through eighteen chemo treatments and suffered from Peripheral Neuropathy which is numbness of the extremities as a result. She has really enjoyed the Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000 Plus as a therapeutic device for treating this disorder. Quite often, she will spend a half of an hour with a book on her lap and her feet on the device.</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted&lt;br /&gt;After a bit it started making a loud noise when turned on&lt;br /&gt;So loud I&#x27;m going to try and see if I can get it exchanged or returned</li>
            <li> I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and decided to purchase Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000 Plus for use in my practice because several clients are coping with neuropathy.  This machine is an oscillator and can be used with or without shoes.  I have used it with great success.  Even clients with intermittent numbness report feeling in their legs and feet after several minutes of usage.  I incorporate the use of this machine with ionic foot baths and reflexology treatments.  Clients report that it  greatly alleviates leg and foot pain and helps with restless leg syndrome.  After experiencing foot massage with this machine, patients report improved sleep and less reliance on pain relief products.  I enjoy it myself...it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds, my feet itch because the vibration is so strong. Also, it is not modern looking. It looks like a Lego box. I am uncertain if I will keep it or return it.</li>
            <li> My mobility is limited these days due to MS, &amp; pedal edema is a new Sx I&#x27;m experiencing. I hoped the massager would reduce it, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This has been better than I expected. It does make your feet feel nice after using it...</li>
            <li> I purchased this a year and three days ago.  It feels absolutely wonderful on sore feet.  After purchasing it, I was elated because it was just what the doctor ordered after a long day at work.  Within 5 months, the unit failed--the motor was going but not vibrating the footplate.  I sent it in under warranty and got it back fast.  Within another 3 months, the unit failed again, same characteristics.  Again sent in, again a fast return.  Four months later, it failed again and I spent a lot of time on the phone with their (very friendly) customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told the problem was with the bearings slipping.  So I needed to once again send it in.  When they received it, I was called and they said it was the same problem but that they would replace my unit with a brand new one.  Since I only had 2 weeks left in the warranty, I purchased an additional one.  I have had the unit back less than 2 weeks and today it has once again failed.  Now, with the unit out of warranty by 3 days, I get to pay shipping both ways to get this fixed.  There goes another $34.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product with lousy quality control.  Save your money and buy something that won&#x27;t incessantly fail.</li>
            <li> This foot massager does not really massage--in the sense that it applies useful pressure at particular points to relax or knead muscles. It simply vibrates, tingling the feet and ankles with vibration. If this is what you are looking for you might like it. If you are looking for any kind of deeper massage you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A great adjunct to the care I receive at the clinic. Nice to be able to get relief at home when needed.</li>
            <li> We have had the Medi-rub for over a year now and still use it daily. The whole family! It really soothes sore and aching feet and legs. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to any medical aspects of this machine, as far as the abilty to open up any arteries for increased blood flow, but it does feel great and prvides a great deal of relief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and there is numbness behind my toes.  This massager makes my feet feel much better.  I use it at least four times a week.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because at the end of an 8 hr shift my feet hurt. It feels so good to come home &amp; feel the vibration on the bottoms of my feet. It helps me that I can say, my brother &amp; sisterinlaw also tryed it &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li> I used this as a way to keep my circulation going thru out the day, after workouts and at night time before going to bed. At 360lbs (at that time), with a sedentary job, I found myself becoming stiff after hours of sitting at my desk.  This made a simple 15 step walk to the copier a long and slow process as I would have to wait until the feelings returned to my legs after standing-up, after a few days using this and a few desk exercises, and a month later, I no longer require to have the massager at work anymore.  I&#x27;m more mobile now and have less occurrences of stiffness in my legs.  this thing is so good I&#x27;ve even tried lying down on it for my back, but I instead bought its cousin the \\&quot;Medi-Rub Handheld Body Professional Massager\\&quot; that is very strong and well worth the cost. Another plus for both of these massagers is that they come with a very long cords!  I&#x27;ve read some comments from others, but when you are in pain and stiff most of the day, who cares about the price.  After using these machines, I no longer require the $50 to $100 massages anymore....</li>
            <li> My father is a diabetic, this really helped him with the circulation in his feet &amp; leg cramps. Best gift I could have purchased for him. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift for a family member who suffers from neuropathy in the feet.  It is very soothing and invigorating...the sensation travels up the legs and reenergizes tired feet and legs.  The effects can be felt for quite awhile after using, and I would recommend using a couple of times daily.</li>
            <li> It does everything I expected.  I have Plantar Faciitus and it has really helped.  If you have foot pain you need this!!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought. The first one works well, so I bought a second one for my parents as a gift. However, it doesn&#x27;t work at all. So bad that I did not test it before I shipped it to my parents and my parents did not want to take the trouble shipping it back. 200 dollars got nothing.</li>
            <li> This is great for tired achy feet.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I ever made</li>
            <li> Good for circulation. Easy to operate.  A little heavier than expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but frequently the vibration noise is so loud I have to turn up the TV--can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s going on because sometimes the loud vibration is not there. Guests love it too!</li>
            <li> I love this unit it works great I would Recommend it to others please purchase one you will not be disappointed at all:)</li>
            <li> great, got it quick with no issues</li>
            <li> Great machine for aching feet. Highly recommend to anyone who likes this type of massage. Only negative is, no heat function.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use! Great product!</li>
            <li> I was recently on vacation in California and tried out one of those commercial foot massagers at the San Diego Zoo called \\&quot;footsie wootsie.\\&quot;  If you have ever spent all day walking around a theme park or zoo and then treated yourself to the experience you know what I am talking about.  I fell in love with the thing and wanted to buy one to keep at home but didn&#x27;t have the extra $1500 bucks plus shipping.  After some research I decided to try this one out as a possible substitute.  PERFECT CHOICE!  I love the vibrating/massaging action.  It makes my feet and legs feel amazing and didn&#x27;t cost thousands or require me to keep feeding it quarters.  Yay Medi-Rub!</li>
            <li> I bought this gizmo based on the many good reviews it&#x27;s received. After trying it out for about 5 minutes, my feet felt as if they had ants running around inside of them! Also, the vibration makes the machine move around. The rubber feet are too slick. They provide no grip on a smooth floor. It is marketed as a &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34;, yet it does not do any massaging. It vibrates. That&#x27;s it! It&#x27;s supposedly made in USA, but it looks cheap. It could&#x27;ve been easily made in China and sold for $10. Unless you think you can benefit from vibration on your feet, don&#x27;t buy this thing. If you want a massager for tired feet, look for something else. This machine is obviously not for that purpose.</li>
            <li> My husband is diabetic with hypertension and always has a lot of swelling in his legs and ankles and feet. His circulation isn&#x27;t what it used to be. This massager is so strong and works so well, we use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting instead of the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s just that efficient. It&#x27;s great after a long day on your feet. The tingling sensation when you&#x27;re done let&#x27;s you know the blood is really flowing to your feet!</li>
            <li> It did not help my neuropathy</li>
            <li> Very well built, powerful, and effective. Has improved my circulation and, surprisingly, reduced the acrocyanosis in my feet.</li>
            <li> Minor miracle.  My MIL actually likes this among all her other gadgets.  Since she is so selective, I bought a used one for trial after cleaning it with Lysol and rubbing alchohol; it&#x27;s absolutely worth the money but $230 is a bit steep.  It is very well made in USA with a 10-foot cord, unlike most of the imported cheap stuff, such as Homedic variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has severe diabetes and leg swelling.  After just 20 minutes in high (II) mode, she detected scratchy/itchy feelings in her feet.  I advised her to do it 3x/day (she can go extreme) for starter.  Her swelling has gone down on her first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also liked it when I shifted it on a slant mode so she could do her lower calves.  Its a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion for improvement: one of the competitors has variable speed, not just 2-speed.  A built-in timer would be nice.  It&#x27;s noisy and does vibrate (the correct term is oscillation), so put it on top of a rug or towel but not a tile or hardwood floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar products made by the same manufacturer are: Jeanie Rub, Maxi Rub and Medi Massager.</li>
            <li> Love how my feet feel after using this.  It tends to move as it vibrates, so had to put a non-slip pad underneath it.</li>
            <li> Great for neuropathy or just tired feet.</li>
            <li> I use it sometimes. It was great. Good job!</li>
            <li> Great machine.  I now have happy feet when they are soooooooooo tired. I would recommend this to anyone with tired feet.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone else, he loved it.  Said it makes his feet feel great, uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!  Very portable and not only massages his feet and heels but also the calves at the same time.  There is a high and low speed of vibration.  Might also help if a person has bad circulation in their feet.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews and bought at last min. for my fiance for Christmas.  I paid a lot for freight and she was so excited to use it... There was not much in the way of a manuel.... but there is a swith for low and high.... so we just plugged it in and started using it.  It was working just fine for 10 min. then it stopped... Very disapointing for an expensive massager!</li>
            <li> This really helps when the gout flairs up in my toes but it vibrates so much its hard to keep in one place. We usually put a pillow behind it and use the coffee table to keep it from running away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my elderly dad who is suffering circulation issues in his foot and for my diabetic sister who is suffering the same. They both are very pleased indeed with the soothing and seemingly beneficial effect it has on their feet and calves. I spent a lot of time trying to establish which of the myriad of products would be best. I settled on the 2000 Plus even though it is quite a lot more expensive. I&#x27;m pleased I did. It is ideal that one can leave one&#x27;s shoes or slippers one and the 2 speed vibrations are very effective.</li>
            <li> Gift to a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome power....medical grade for sure. Feet and calves will feel rejuvinated. Seen it at a home show for $50.00 bucks more.</li>
            <li> I keep this under my desk and use it often during the day while I am at the computer.  Keeps my feet comfortable and also in a slanted position that makes my back more comfortable at the same time.  Best feature is that you get the same effect with or without your shoes on.  My old foot massager worked only on bare feet and I found I didn&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> This was not what I had expected. When I tried to return it after only 24hours I was told that once the box was opened it could not be returned. I can&#x27;t believe such a policy exists today. I certainly would never have purchased this item if I had known in advance about this ridiculous return policy.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia w bulging disks in my back and chronic foot pain. It is very hard to walk and most of the time I have to get a wheelchair if my family goes shopping. I bought this is June 2011 thru Amazon, I never had any problems with it. It is alot of vibrating that vibrates thru your legs and feet and you feel it vibrating still right after you stop using it. I first tried this while on vacation when I had a sharp pain in my arch which slowed everyone down (which this helped), but the price was over $400.00 very high mark up, the price directly from the website that makes these is very high also. I do feel like I got the best deal from Amazon. So you can put the arch of your foot over the top lip looking part and I put my arch on the edge of the lip looking part. It is very loud, I never wear shoes with it. You can lean on it with your back, but its very uncomfortable and almost feel like your teeth are chattering. I have high arches and the pain in my back shoots into my arches of my feet. I would recommend this product, but only if you can deal or like lots and lots of vibrations.</li>
            <li> Relieves tension in the muscles.&lt;br /&gt;Time saver  - 15 minutes will do&lt;br /&gt;the trick.&lt;br /&gt;ends to not stay stationary when&lt;br /&gt;on the high level.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me with my neuropathy and when I got it and tried it our it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place it turned out to be a real pain. I returned it and they kept $20.00 for there restocking plus it cost me $27.00 to ship it back. Be careful who you buy from.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;massage\\&quot; or \\&quot;rub\\&quot; you feet, it simply vibrates. It says you can use it with your shoes on, but I can&#x27;t imagine why you&#x27;d want to. I used it with my bare feet, using the high setting, it felt decent but, for the price, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hope. Even after a full 30 minutes, my feet still hurt. I&#x27;m on my feet all day @ work, 5 days a week. This is the third, and most expensive, foot \\&quot;massager\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve tried over the years, but I can&#x27;t really recommend it. Other than getting an actual person to massage your feet, I find that the best way to feel better is to simply stay off my feet as much as possible during my free time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to go to get massages. This really helps my feet at the end of the day. My feet usually have sore places from exercise and aerobic dancing. I wish there was a way to massage the top of my feet. One thing to realize, this is a vibrator even though the company uses the word massage in their item name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a 30.00 vibrating foot massager from another well known yet more affordable brand and it had a stronger vibration than this.  This is so not worth the high price tag and I am now glad that I did not purchase the medi rub massager which I was also considering.  If you&#x27;re looking for foot and leg vibration I recommend purchasing a vibrating exercise machine.  They have portable ones which are around the same price as this unit yet they can withstand your full body weight you can get so much more use out of them.</li>
            <li> not as good as my friends.  Same thing just she has a much quieter one.  The use of her unit was why I ordered it.  It is gathering dust so I will sell it in a garage sell.</li>
            <li> Both my sisters had one if these claimed it helped to control there RLS and also Muscle Cramps .. it didn&#x27;t do that for me, but we love it anyway, especially my husband does. They are very well made.:-)</li>
            <li> For a long time I have had a condition where my feet ache at night. When I stand back up I am fine, but when I am laying down, my feet throbbed. I would wake up several timed during the night with my feet aching and put Gold Bond Menthol lotion on my feet and that would help a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to a company health fair where the Medi-Rub foot and body massagers were being demonstrated. I sat in the chair and the sales rep massaged my feet, back and neck. When I went to bed that night, no foot problems. I slept through the night. I bought the Medi-Rub foot massager and now I put my feet on it every night and every morning. And no kidding, I have not had one night of painful feet since. I sleep through the night like I haven&#x27;t in years. I don&#x27;t know the medical reasons for the change, but it sure has worked wonders for me. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having used a similar massager in my chiropractor’s office.  I am going to him because I thought I had neuropathy type numbness in my toes and feet.  Turns out he is doing a series of eight weeks of spinal decompression and nerve rebuilding (using a electronic nerve stimulator) and that therapy combined with the foot massager that I use every evening has helped.  Specifically, the massager stimulates blood flow that continues throughout the night as I sleep.  I no longer get up and feel afraid to walk because I can now feel my feet on the floor.  I would highly recommend this product as well as checking with local chiropractors to see which ones are expanding their practices to include treatment for neurological imbalances.</li>
            <li> This massager is pricy but worth every penny.  This is a medical grade foot massager.  My doctor had my use it for my neuropathy, so bought one for home.  My husband uses it nearly every night.</li>
            <li> I have had this item in the past.  It is the most incredible massager ever.  It got rid of my Diabetic neuropathy.  I recommend it highly.  Also, you cannot beat this price.  It is a wonderful machine.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This works fine and does help, however, it isn&#x27;t as hard on feet as I thought it might be.  Not sure I would purchase again if I thought about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about ten days since I got it.  It is all I hoped it would be!  I go back to work tomorrow, after having the Christmas holidays off.  I&#x27;m looking forward to finding out how it relaxes my feet after I&#x27;ve been on them for several hours.  So far, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these along with their hand-held messager about a year ago and really love both of them.  I had been getting sore calf muscles after long walks or workouts and the foot messager was just the thing to take care of them.  My dad started complaining about soreness in his legs and feet recently (he&#x27;s diabetic) so I bought another one for his birthday and he absolutely loves it.  And it&#x27;s made in the USA!!!</li>
            <li> Saw and tried this at the County Fair and found it to be much cheaper on Amazon!  I use the foot massager in combination with my Medi-rub Massagers Body Massager 2000 Plus and use it daily! It gets the blood flowing and actually makes me be able to go further on my daily walks!  I highly recommend getting the pair together!</li>
            <li> I walk a minimum of five miles a day and my feet always ache by the time I get home. 10 to 15 minutes on this massager and my feet feel great. I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone that suffers from foot pain. It is expensive but to me it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this for tired feet-stand all day on job-, numbness in toes,heels, and balls.  Am  already feeling results.  Feel the massage all the way up to my tailbone. Would recommend for pure massage feeling without wanting to try it for am foot problem--just for pampering!</li>
            <li> I have diabetic neuropathy and this is very comforting. It also is very relaxing. everyone should have one.</li>
