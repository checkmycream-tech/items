            <li>Now they both have their own shaving kits and they can bring that stuff to their rooms to store and bring it with them to the bathroom in the morning.</li>
            <li>The quality is nice for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight and compact</li>
            <li>It is very light and seems to be made of a water resistant material.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought these bags (and I bought many,) were going to be great.  </li>
            <li>Material is some kind of vinyl and will do quite fine amidst the leaky contains</li>

            <li>It holds all my toiletries and more.  </li>
            <li>6 more for the wildfire pack.</li>
            <li>Service from the first order was good.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that it was able to be flattened to that extent, but I wanted a flexible bag for my husband&#x27;s travel toiletry kit, so this was fine.  </li>
            <li>so you have weight for more important thing in your luggage.  </li>
            <li>This is just the right size to hold all of his toiletries and fits nicely in his luggage.</li>
            <li>Zipper works fine.</li>
            <li>and it is still holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>Zipper seems to work fine</li>
            <li>RED color was excellent, to hold my FIRST AID bandages which did not need protection.</li>
            <li>fine for the price.</li>
            <li>He has not used it for the intended purpose as yet, but the zippers seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li>Fine for the gym</li>
            <li>This bag served ,for what I wanted and at a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Given the number of times I have wrenched this bag from its snug fit in an overloaded backpack</li>
            <li>I filled these for Christmas for a homeless ministry in my area.</li>
            <li>Cheap but serves its purpose as a cosmetic case for my husband to take to the gym.</li>
            <li>But try to get free shipping on it, that&#x27;ll make it an even sweeter deal.</li>
            <li>it in i can fit almost anything in it anyways.</li>
            <li>This bag is lightweight and feels sorta cheap.</li>
            <li>and it is just the right size for all his toiletries and more.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the main compartment was divided into two, but for under $10, this bag is a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but everything I needed.</li>
            <li>water protected, doesn&#x27;t tare if you put a lot more stuff than it really intended.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Clearly labeled on the top of the bags, makes it easy for anyone on the team to pull the correct one.</li>
            <li>It is super durable and I have had zero problems with it, including no problems at all with the zipper or with the handle getting tears or fraying.</li>
            <li>Inside this cosmetics bag, I can fit a pretty hefty &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; (</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $9 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>thiis was so worth the money.</li>
            <li>it comes in unless pretty full).</li>
            <li>and I fell was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>, that is just the exact right size and shape.</li>
            <li>But the grab handle on the top allows me to pull it out of my backpack whenever I need to carry &amp;#34;just my purse.&amp;#34; (For example, when I stop by Walgreen&#x27;s on my way home from school and don&#x27;t want the store security to look askance at me entering their store with a giant backpack on.)</li>
            <li>He really seemed to like it -- a bonus for the grandparents!</li>
            <li>Holds first aid, tools, cooking gear, clothing and pancho&#x27;s, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Buying</li>
            <li>A reasonably well made basic toiletries bag that works better than expected - fits in more stuff that I had originally anticipated.</li>
            <li>NOT SURE I PAID A GOOD PRICE BC</li>
            <li>the loop, it&#x27;ll be easy and convenient to hang it somewhere during our next hotel stay.</li>
            <li>Flexible fabric but still reasonably sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my very unfashionable (and thus not noticeable to thieves)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t comment on durability because I haven&#x27;t put it through much travel, but at this price, does it even matter?</li>
            <li>The bag has enough storage space to fit basic toiletries for a family of four, depending on what you need to fit in here.</li>
            <li>I can comfortably fit in a shaving foam, toothbrush/paste, hair brush, and cream, with enough room to spare.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this if you are going to really fill the bag up.</li>
            <li>I think it will suit their needs very well because they don&#x27;t travel all the time.  </li>
            <li>I usually would like it, seems like a nice toiletry bag, but was very suprised it was damaged, because never had any issues with amazon products before!</li>
            <li>^very.&lt;br /&gt;not too big, not too small, flexible, very nicely put together.</li>
            <li>This was an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; gift for our 14 yr old grandson who is soon to be going on his first band competition in Disney.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting my son a better one from Walmart in their luggage section---for so much less.  </li>
            <li>Spacious, but soft enough to fit into a carry-on.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you are a frequent traveller, you may want to pay a little more for a sturdier bag.  </li>
            <li>Pretty standard size.</li>
            <li>This bag is the exact right size and shape to hold all my &amp;#34;purse items&amp;#34; inside my backpack all week long, when I essentially use my backpack as my purse.  </li>
            <li>I can easily wipe this material down and have it ready for the next trip in minutes.</li>
            <li>I own two black ones, a red and a blue.</li>
            <li>I have had the bag for nearly a year now, it is held up very well with daily use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it does not have two compartments like my old one, it makes up for in terms of the volume and amount of stuff it can hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use these bags as gifts to the young men i mentor.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my husband, who frequently travels on business.  </li>
            <li>case is roomy and can fit the usual shampoo, shaver, toothpaste, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought for the gym, should fit small to medium sized bottles of shampoo/conditioner/comb/flowersponge..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent quality, but it&#x27;s also cheap, so not surprising.</li>
            <li>Expected something a little better quality,</li>
            <li>The front pocket is pretty small, and the bag overall isn&#x27;t super sturdy (will collapse back in to the folded condition</li>
            <li>My old toiletries bag began falling apart several years ago.</li>
            <li>Bigger than my old one.</li>
            <li>It is dumpy, small, and will not hold very much.</li>

            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long they last.</li>
            <li> The bag arrived on time in a flat envelope.  </li>
            <li> Expected bigger.</li>
            <li> I used these for groom gifts at my wedding recently and stored all of the other goodies inside of the bag.</li>
            <li> bag has limited use.  </li>
            <li> I would not suggest purchasing this if you travel frequently because I don&#x27;t think it will hold up well to excessive travel.</li>
            <li> The bag is not high quality</li>
            <li> Only now, with this bag from BAGS FOR LESS am I addressing this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Bag is what I expected.</li>
            <li> The materials on this were not very durable, which you need for traveling.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for as a travel case for small, personal items.  </li>
            <li> The strap broke in less than two months.</li>
            <li> The black bag shows no dirt from getting tossed around.</li>
            <li> It is a basic thin bag, no frills and was just what was expected and works for our needs.</li>
            <li> This bag looks large in the picture, but it can only hold a few items, I tried putting my son&#x27;s toiletry in it for college and was very disappointed it hardly held much.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I have now been carrying this bag as my purse, with plenty of heavy items in it, for *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with the zipper, either--the usual vulnerability in an item like this.</li>
            <li> not much more though.</li>
            <li> But, they are very thinly made of a vinyl polyester which can only be used to store items, and NOT protect them.  </li>
            <li> Expensive and did not work for my purposes for long.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bag was not good.</li>
            <li> There is a front zippered compartment that can be used for thin items.</li>
            <li> This item had a ripped pocket and the zipper was broken!</li>
            <li> It is very thin.</li>

            <li> Needed Toiletry bag  for trip,nothing fancy just servicable.Didn&#x27;t care if the bag took a beating.This bag served ,for what I wanted and at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for as a travel case for small, personal items.  Flexible fabric but still reasonably sturdy.  Zipper works fine.</li>
            <li> This bag is very basic but worked for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but everything I needed. I suggest it.</li>
            <li> This bag is the exact right size and shape to hold all my &amp;#34;purse items&amp;#34; inside my backpack all week long, when I essentially use my backpack as my purse.  Inside this cosmetics bag, I can fit a pretty hefty &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; (Leica D-Lux 6) digital camera, an over-stuffed wallet, a cell phone about the size and shape of a Snickers bar, sanitary supplies, pens, pencils, facial tissues, three lipstick tubes, lip balm, mini hand sanitizer, change for parking meters, several flash drives, and a miniature stapler. I wouldn&#x27;t call the bag fashionable to look at. But the grab handle on the top allows me to pull it out of my backpack whenever I need to carry &amp;#34;just my purse.&amp;#34; (For example, when I stop by Walgreen&#x27;s on my way home from school and don&#x27;t want the store security to look askance at me entering their store with a giant backpack on.) Given the number of times I have wrenched this bag from its snug fit in an overloaded backpack, I would say it seems fairly durable to me. It has shown no signs of fraying or tearing. And it seems it&#x27;s even water-resistant. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the zipper, either--the usual vulnerability in an item like this. I own two black ones, a red and a blue. I like this bag a *lot*.  UPDATE: I have now been carrying this bag as my purse, with plenty of heavy items in it, for ***over a year*** and it is still holding up just fine. It is super durable and I have had zero problems with it, including no problems at all with the zipper or with the handle getting tears or fraying. I repeat--no problems whatsover. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my very unfashionable (and thus not noticeable to thieves) purse, that is just the exact right size and shape. Happiness!!!!</li>
            <li> My old toiletries bag began falling apart several years ago. Only now, with this bag from BAGS FOR LESS am I addressing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is roomy and can fit the usual shampoo, shaver, toothpaste, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does not have two compartments like my old one, it makes up for in terms of the volume and amount of stuff it can hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the loop, it&#x27;ll be easy and convenient to hang it somewhere during our next hotel stay. Material is some kind of vinyl and will do quite fine amidst the leaky contains I will soon hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided in exchange for unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;∞ PositiveLogic</li>
            <li> I filled these for Christmas for a homeless ministry in my area. They were perfect...</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.  its a toiletries bag.</li>
            <li> I bought it to hold my electric shavers and attachments.  It has room for that and more.  Definitely worth the $9 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Solid material.</li>
            <li> had to send it back. Cheap!</li>
            <li> Cheap but serves its purpose as a cosmetic case for my husband to take to the gym. No frills and not the best quality but why would you need that for the gym? Zipper seems to work fine and we haven&#x27;t had any complaints yet.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Can&#x27;t comment on durability because I haven&#x27;t put it through much travel, but at this price, does it even matter?</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8241a0600cdfeee0c1441de738845a62]] A reasonably well made basic toiletries bag that works better than expected - fits in more stuff that I had originally anticipated. The bag has enough storage space to fit basic toiletries for a family of four, depending on what you need to fit in here. I can comfortably fit in a shaving foam, toothbrush/paste, hair brush, and cream, with enough room to spare. There is a front zippered compartment that can be used for thin items. I do wish the main compartment was divided into two, but for under $10, this bag is a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A GOOD QUALITY BAG I GUESS, NOT SURE I PAID A GOOD PRICE BC I SEEN IT CHEAPER IN TARGET. BUT OH WELL, I STILL LIKE IT, I USE TO KEEP ALL MY BATHROOM MUST HAVES IN.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and compact so you have weight for more important thing in your luggage.  Looks durable</li>
            <li> This is not what I thought it would be. It is dumpy, small, and will not hold very much. Expected bigger.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the cheap quality for such price...should have paid few more bucks and got decent quality bag instead</li>
            <li> At first, I thought these bags (and I bought many,) were going to be great.  But, they are very thinly made of a vinyl polyester which can only be used to store items, and NOT protect them.  These bases have no protection when traveling inside a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag has limited use.  Very flimsy.  Price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RED color was excellent, to hold my FIRST AID bandages which did not need protection.</li>
            <li> Does the job for me. I would highly recommend it. For it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s not bad at all. But try to get free shipping on it, that&#x27;ll make it an even sweeter deal.</li>
            <li> Well i needed a haircut machine bag because the one i had ripped apart. so i bought one of these bags for i. yes i know thats not what its used for but who cares i don&#x27;t the bag has a lot of space it in i can fit almost anything in it anyways. thiis was so worth the money.</li>
            <li> Took the place of one i accedentally left in a hotel on a trip just last month. Bigger than my old one.</li>
            <li> Good bag for the price. I use these bags as gifts to the young men i mentor. They are well built.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good size and quality</li>
            <li> This bag looks large in the picture, but it can only hold a few items, I tried putting my son&#x27;s toiletry in it for college and was very disappointed it hardly held much.</li>
            <li> Great travel bag for the price.  Hold all the items that we needed it to do.</li>
            <li> This will replace the one I got for my son to have when he comes home for  nice quick visits very handy and lots of space and great price...</li>
            <li> Bag is what I expected. bought for the gym, should fit small to medium sized bottles of shampoo/conditioner/comb/flowersponge.. not much more though. fine for the price.</li>
            <li> The shaving kit was purchased so my boys don&#x27;t have to store toothbrushes, toothpaste, shaving cream, razors, deodorant and soaps in the bathroom they share. Now they both have their own shaving kits and they can bring that stuff to their rooms to store and bring it with them to the bathroom in the morning. For this purpost the travel bag works great. We&#x27;ll see how long they last.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest purchasing this if you travel frequently because I don&#x27;t think it will hold up well to excessive travel. It was great for my husband&#x27;s medications while we were on a three week road trip. Washes well if you get something on it.</li>
            <li> Good size and weight....love it!  It holds all my toiletries and more.  Just what I wanted in a dopp kit bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.  My husband travels for work and is at alot of dirty jobsites.  I can easily wipe this material down and have it ready for the next trip in minutes.</li>
            <li> This was an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; gift for our 14 yr old grandson who is soon to be going on his first band competition in Disney. He really seemed to like it -- a bonus for the grandparents!</li>
            <li> Great bag for products..</li>
            <li> The bag arrived on time in a flat envelope.  I was amazed that it was able to be flattened to that extent, but I wanted a flexible bag for my husband&#x27;s travel toiletry kit, so this was fine.  He has not used it for the intended purpose as yet, but the zippers seem to work fine.  It is very light and seems to be made of a water resistant material.  He was pleased with the gift and happy with the price.  I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li> The materials on this were not very durable, which you need for traveling.</li>
            <li> Expensive and did not work for my purposes for long. I would not recommend this if you are going to really fill the bag up. The strap broke in less than two months.</li>
            <li> Very pleased; price wise and size for travel. Spacious, but soft enough to fit into a carry-on.  Excellent for carrying medications and toiletries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent quality, but it&#x27;s also cheap, so not surprising. The front pocket is pretty small, and the bag overall isn&#x27;t super sturdy (will collapse back in to the folded condition it comes in unless pretty full).</li>
            <li> This bag is lightweight and feels sorta cheap. But that&#x27;s what you should expect when paying such a low price. I wound up getting a different bag for my travel needs. This one just holds extra supplies under my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I have had the bag for nearly a year now, it is held up very well with daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sons, ages 12 and 9, to use when they go for weekends at the grandparents or with the church youth group overnighters.  The quality is nice for the price you pay.  I think it will suit their needs very well because they don&#x27;t travel all the time.  If you are a frequent traveller, you may want to pay a little more for a sturdier bag.  I gave it 5 stars because it is the perfect bag for my boys.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my college age child for those trips to and from school and it is just the right size for all his toiletries and more.  The black bag shows no dirt from getting tossed around.</li>
            <li> VERY basic 2 compartment vinyl toiletry bag. Fine for the gym but that; s about it. Pretty standard size. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> ^very.&lt;br /&gt;not too big, not too small, flexible, very nicely put together. water protected, doesn&#x27;t tare if you put a lot more stuff than it really intended.</li>
            <li> I used these for groom gifts at my wedding recently and stored all of the other goodies inside of the bag. The bag is not high quality but it is a very nice price.</li>
            <li> Looked great in the pictures, but it is very cheap. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these to use in a Tech Rescue winter pack. Clearly labeled on the top of the bags, makes it easy for anyone on the team to pull the correct one. Holds first aid, tools, cooking gear, clothing and pancho&#x27;s, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Buying 6 more for the wildfire pack. Service from the first order was good.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband, who frequently travels on business.  This is just the right size to hold all of his toiletries and fits nicely in his luggage.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting my son a better one from Walmart in their luggage section---for so much less.  The Walmart one has compartments, this is just a big open space.</li>
            <li> This item had a ripped pocket and the zipper was broken! I usually would like it, seems like a nice toiletry bag, but was very suprised it was damaged, because never had any issues with amazon products before!</li>
            <li> While it is not a &#x27;top of the line&#x27; bag, it meets my needs very well and I fell was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bag was not good. It is very thin. Expected something a little better quality,</li>
            <li> This is a basic bag.  We did not purchase for cosmetics but some misc electronics.  It is a basic thin bag, no frills and was just what was expected and works for our needs.</li>
