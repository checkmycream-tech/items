            <li>OK, if you&#x27;ve been reading my reviews, I bought the &amp;#34;Navy By Dana For Women.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite.</li>
            <li>I have always love this perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will use this company again when it&#x27;s time for more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the way Fantasy smells, and always get compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to smell like I didn&#x27;t shower and just sprayed overwhelming perfume all over myself instead!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Every time I wear it, my friends compliment me, and it is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite scent of mine.</li>
            <li>Just because it said britany spears is why i was causious because she is not someone i admire, however regardless of the name i love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I love this smell from Britney Spears.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Always a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I want more...</li>
            <li>ITS NOT AN OVERWHELMING SCENT JUST A SUTLE ONE.</li>
            <li>i found it at target but was happy when i found a bigger bottle at a much better price!</li>
            <li>I went solely by reviews that said people liked this fragrance as much or more than Britney Spears Curious perfume; I think is is best to try it in a store first.</li>
            <li>This smell is so light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Not too strong no too</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, the smell is sublime, the right size, right color, and I really love the smell, I love britney spears perfum</li>
            <li>The smell is very sweet but not sickly.</li>
            <li>who knew britney spears could make such a great fragrance??</li>
            <li>Its light but seductive in smell.</li>
            <li>I have never, and probably will never, get this perfume this cheap anywhere else.</li>
            <li>it smelled so fantastic.</li>
            <li>I think the reason it was so cheap is because its a tester and they arent for sale by manufacturer?&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am a super girlie girl with a love for sweet smelling lotions an perfumes.</li>
            <li>Lots of strong sweet smells end up giving me a headache, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a sweet, warm and inviting scent, with vanilla and sugary notes (without being too much).</li>
            <li>this poduct is not the original, is not the original box.</li>
            <li>This is not the original.</li>
            <li>this was a tester sample, which I didn&#x27;t realize, and it smelled ok, but it burned my skin when first putting it on.</li>
            <li>This is not the original perfurm</li>
            <li>What are you wearing?!&amp;#34; And I have to respond &amp;#34;Britney Spears,&amp;#34; but this is clean and sweet-smelling, not cloying or overpowering.</li>
            <li>AND I THINK IT SMELLS PRETTY GOOD AND SEEMS TO LAST MOST OF THE DAY.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this perfume before and it is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>It smells so sweet an feminine.</li>
            <li>Plus very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>one of my favorite women perfum ever, i bought it because its so sweet and strong at the same time.</li>
            <li>Very disapointted!!</li>
            <li>So we disagreed on which scent is better, but this scent does have an edge and young person freshness to it.</li>
            <li>I will definatly be repurchasing this over an over again worth the price</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my niece and would have preferred the colorful pretty packaging shown.  </li>
            <li>Though i have to be careful because some cents give me headaches when they are too strong, but not this is sweet an light without overpowering.</li>
            <li>I understand how someone could find it questionable to buy a perfume by Britney Spears, because it seems like it might smell too sweet, cheap, or overwhelming, but it is actually amazing.</li>
            <li>Came super fast.</li>
            <li>Very big bottle for very cheap.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it if you like sweet, floral scents.</li>
            <li>My product came more than a month later than I ordered!  </li>
            <li>She likes the scent, and the bottle has definitely has more heft to it.</li>
            <li>The perfume arrived promptly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just admiring the scent of this perfume and it lasts the entire day.... :)</li>
            <li>thats no reason enough to give it 5 stars, I love it when she uses it.</li>
            <li>The first time i sprayed it on myself</li>
            <li>I am so glad that i finally tryed this i definatly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Sexy girlie, womanily, softly vanillaish, soft spoken sweetness, stay with you fragrance!  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal ..</li>
            <li>It is the real thing, Fantasy by Britney Spears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much talk about it</li>
            <li>the organizer&#x27;s 14 year old daughter told her she wanted it right away.</li>
            <li>BUT I WILL SAY,A LITTLE MUSK,VANILLA AND MORE ETC.</li>
            <li>just because it came in a really nice plain white box????</li>
            <li>When Britney Spears was having problems--it was difficult to say I was wearing her perfume when people would ask, but she sure knows how to create a unique scent.</li>
            <li>The first time I was given this as a present</li>
            <li>I really like Curious, but found Fantasy to be very \\&quot;young\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Cologne Spray 1.5 Oz / 44 Ml&amp;#34; for my 13 year old daughter who think it smells like an old lady.</li>
            <li>Well this 42 year old lady likes it</li>
            <li>AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DELICATE FRAGRANCE.  </li>
            <li>I have to disagree with the reviews that say this is a young girl perfume.  </li>
            <li>OLD</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling and sort of a Down South feel to it.</li>
            <li>This poduct is not the original, The box is not original TESTER NOT FOR SALE.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>

            <li> I have to disagree with the reviews that say this is a young girl perfume.  </li>
            <li> OLD</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling and sort of a Down South feel to it.</li>
            <li> This poduct is not the original, The box is not original TESTER NOT FOR SALE.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> I know other say its for young adults</li>
            <li> Definitely not recommended to other customers.</li>
            <li> You only need a few sprays, so the bottle lasts a long time, and the scent stays all day.</li>
            <li> The perfume was fine but the packaging was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> i was a bit skeptical the first time i tried this in a department store months ago</li>
            <li> Instead of Fantasy (pink bottle) it is the anniversary brand in black container.</li>
            <li> I have used Fantasy perfume for a few years now, and have ordered through Amazon before.</li>
            <li> However, the perfume arrived in a plain brown cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> This time, however, I have noticed that there is very little perfume scent to this bottle, even though it looks identical.</li>
            <li> AFTER HER FRIEND GAVE HER A SMALL BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a year and a half now, and I&#x27;m not the least bit tired of the smell.</li>
            <li> THE SCENT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY FOR ME</li>
            <li> As I said, disappointing.</li>

            <li> Yes,it did meet my expectations,thank you mazon &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive scents, but I keep coming back to Fantasy. The smell is very sweet but not sickly. Lots of strong sweet smells end up giving me a headache, but this one doesn&#x27;t. Perfume is not about age limits, it&#x27;s about what smells good on you.</li>
            <li> Very big bottle for very cheap. I have purchased this perfume before and it is my absolute favorite.  I always get complements on the way I smell and the smell stays on your clothes until washed. Plus very fast shipping! I willbdef order more once this bottle goes.</li>
            <li> My product came more than a month later than I ordered!  When I emailed them they didn&#x27;t respond until I emailed them a second time. HORRIBLE SERVICE. Definitely not recommended to other customers.</li>
            <li> OK, if you&#x27;ve been reading my reviews, I bought the &amp;#34;Navy By Dana For Women. Cologne Spray 1.5 Oz / 44 Ml&amp;#34; for my 13 year old daughter who think it smells like an old lady. Well this 42 year old lady likes it so she&#x27;s keeping that cologne.  Now this one is a keeper. She likes the scent, and the bottle has definitely has more heft to it. So we disagreed on which scent is better, but this scent does have an edge and young person freshness to it.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived promptly and was exactly as described. This is a great deal for the amount of product and the perfume smelled fantastic as always.</li>
            <li> KIDS lOVE IT! They use this perfume like water. Everyone uses it even guest coming over to my house. LOL</li>
            <li> Amazing deal on this presentation. I just love it, every day is the perfect reason for use it, This perfume is very nice</li>
            <li> Does not seem to spray at times.</li>
            <li> I love this product it smells so good i found it at target but was happy when i found a bigger bottle at a much better price!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal ..I&#x27;m just admiring the scent of this perfume and it lasts the entire day.... :)</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because it happens to be my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thats no reason enough to give it 5 stars, I love it when she uses it. Its essence is just perfect. Not too strong no too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this perfume as a great gift!</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 bottles of this for my daughter.  It&#x27;s her favorite. Even though I have noticed an increase in price from the company it&#x27;s still a good deal! Great gift too!!</li>
            <li> The picture they have up is a tad deceiving, almost made me not want to buy it. BUT the bottle is actually the BIG bottle. YAY! So happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> this poduct is not the original, is not the original box. this product is a tester, yor  box is a very ugly</li>
            <li> I have always love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells is so juicy. I will buy again once this one is done.</li>
            <li> Excelente, me llegó exactamente el producto que compré. Recomiendo a seguir comprando por ser responsables tanto en el producto como en la entrega del mismo,</li>
            <li> It is not what appeared in ad. Instead of Fantasy (pink bottle) it is the anniversary brand in black container. Doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the one&lt;br /&gt;It should be as advertised. Very disapointted!!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite women perfum ever, i bought it because its so sweet and strong at the same time. loved it</li>
            <li> Good scent, just what the lady wanted</li>
            <li> who knew britney spears could make such a great fragrance?? i was a bit skeptical the first time i tried this in a department store months ago but as soon as i smelled it i was hooked. this stuff is the bomb. i always get compliments when i put it on from both men and women. i highly recommend it if you like sweet, floral scents.</li>
            <li> This is not the original. It smells similar but doesn&#x27;t even last 10 minutes . I bought 2 and now I am screwed..</li>
            <li> This is the best scent I have ever worn! I get constant compliments when wearing Fantasy--it has a cotton candy undertone to it. It can be worn either during the day or night. When Britney Spears was having problems--it was difficult to say I was wearing her perfume when people would ask, but she sure knows how to create a unique scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear anything else and this was cheaper than buying from the department or drug store.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE.  It smells soooooo goood.&lt;br /&gt;update: I still only use this fragrance.  Had alot of compliments.  Its light but seductive in smell.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY SECOND PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DELICATE FRAGRANCE.  I WISH IT WERE LONGER LASTING, HOWEVER.</li>
            <li> I went solely by reviews that said people liked this fragrance as much or more than Britney Spears Curious perfume; I think is is best to try it in a store first. I really like Curious, but found Fantasy to be very \\&quot;young\\&quot;. In fact, I donated it for a prize at work and the organizer&#x27;s 14 year old daughter told her she wanted it right away.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for the 2nd xmas in a row - she is 13 and just loves it.</li>
            <li> Came super fast. Packaged well. This was the BEST deal around-and I SEARCHED! I will use this company again when it&#x27;s time for more.</li>
            <li> This poduct is not the original, The box is not original TESTER NOT FOR SALE.&lt;br /&gt;was a Christmas gift and gave me a lot of embarrassment</li>
            <li> I have used Fantasy perfume for a few years now, and have ordered through Amazon before. I absolutely LOVE the way Fantasy smells, and always get compliments. This time, however, I have noticed that there is very little perfume scent to this bottle, even though it looks identical. I do not smell it throughout the day, even if I spray it liberally.  There is no doubt that this bottle I received was an imposter/generic version with the same packaging. I will not be purchasing this way again. :(</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents! My favorite scent is cotton candy, and this perfume smells like cotton candy, but in a grown up way! You will not smell like the carnival, but it is like a sensual cotton candy, if that makes sense lol You will get so many compliments!!!</li>
            <li> The perfume was fine but the packaging was disappointing.  I purchased this as a gift for my niece and would have preferred the colorful pretty packaging shown.  However, the perfume arrived in a plain brown cardboard box.  As I said, disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed when people say, &amp;#34;Oh! I love that! What are you wearing?!&amp;#34; And I have to respond &amp;#34;Britney Spears,&amp;#34; but this is clean and sweet-smelling, not cloying or overpowering. The first time I was given this as a present and I thought, &amp;#34;Ugh! I&#x27;m going to smell like I didn&#x27;t shower and just sprayed overwhelming perfume all over myself instead!&amp;#34; (My grandmother calls this a French whore bath). I was happily mistaken.</li>
            <li> This perfume is all around amazing. I have been using it for about a year and a half now, and I&#x27;m not the least bit tired of the smell. I ordered the perfume and got it very soon afterwards, not to mention for the best price ever. I have never, and probably will never, get this perfume this cheap anywhere else. It is the real thing, Fantasy by Britney Spears. I don&#x27;t know how they make it available so cheap, but it&#x27;s great! I understand how someone could find it questionable to buy a perfume by Britney Spears, because it seems like it might smell too sweet, cheap, or overwhelming, but it is actually amazing. Every time I wear it, my friends compliment me, and it is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite scent of mine. I would describe it as a sweet, warm and inviting scent, with vanilla and sugary notes (without being too much). You only need a few sprays, so the bottle lasts a long time, and the scent stays all day. 100% recommend!! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again when mine runs out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wantingto try this perfume for years I&#x27;ve heard so much talk about it an just couldnt get myself to try it. I&#x27;m not a britany spears fan but the perfume is for the cent not just for her. I have to admit i finally gave in an bought it. The first time i sprayed it on myself it smelled so fantastic. It smells so sweet an feminine. I am a super girlie girl with a love for sweet smelling lotions an perfumes. Though i have to be careful because some cents give me headaches when they are too strong, but not this is sweet an light without overpowering. I am so glad that i finally tryed this i definatly recommend this product to others. Just because it said britany spears is why i was causious because she is not someone i admire, however regardless of the name i love this perfume. I will definatly be repurchasing this over an over again worth the price an the buy.</li>
            <li> Good smell, is amaizing my girlfriend was crayzi waiting for it, and i am satisfied with the move to venezuela</li>
            <li> this is a great scent I get compliments everywhere I go.. I know other say its for young adults but I have to say it IS NOT its for everyone... I love it,</li>
            <li> Love the smell and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, the smell is sublime, the right size, right color, and I really love the smell, I love britney spears perfum</li>
            <li> This smell is so light and refreshing. I absolutely love this scent! It&#x27;s a must have! Just buy it already.</li>
            <li> erertert wer wer wer wer wer wer wer wer wer wer wer wer wer we wer wer w erwwe  wer wer ewrwerw doc</li>
            <li> I love this smell from Britney Spears. One of my favorite perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the 3.3 oz for 24$ was too good to be true, so I ordered it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came 3 days earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was damaged and packaging was sufficent.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find out that it wasn&#x27;t too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrived 3.3 oz. I think the reason it was so cheap is because its a tester and they arent for sale by manufacturer?&lt;br /&gt;But anyways, I was very pleased with service..&lt;br /&gt;and hopefully once my bottle runs out, they still have some left.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENED!!!!</li>
            <li> this was a tester sample, which I didn&#x27;t realize, and it smelled ok, but it burned my skin when first putting it on. Definitely a perfume for a younger person. I am almost thirty, and well not something I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Have had this perfume before.  Always a lovely scent.  Always been one of my favorites by Britney.  Would recommend.  Sweet smelling and sort of a Down South feel to it.</li>
            <li> When shopping at Walmart I was also price comparing on Amazin and found this. More than satisfied!!! Same price as Walmsrt but double the size just because it came in a really nice plain white box???? SO WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the reviews that say this is a young girl perfume.  I&#x27;m 44 and its a great smelling perfume that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  PLUS I get compliments all the time on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I bought it as a gift for my mom for mothers day. Great Buy! Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is not the original perfurm</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and it was perfect for her. She loved the light fruity scent. It is perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I never thought I would but, one day my sis told me she loves it and men comment on it.  So of course I tried it, several yrs ago!  I am still HOOKED!  Sexy girlie, womanily, softly vanillaish, soft spoken sweetness, stay with you fragrance!  Its still around for a reason!  I have squeezed the last bit out again!  I want more...of my &#x27;go to fragrance&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AFTER HER FRIEND GAVE HER A SMALL BOTTLE. IT WASNT BAD,SO I ORDERED HER THIS ONE. I USE IT MYSELF(56)YEARS OLD AND I THINK IT SMELLS PRETTY GOOD AND SEEMS TO LAST MOST OF THE DAY. THE SCENT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY FOR ME BUT I WILL SAY,A LITTLE MUSK,VANILLA AND MORE ETC. ITS NOT AN OVERWHELMING SCENT JUST A SUTLE ONE.</li>
