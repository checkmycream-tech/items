            <li>I loved my nude waxy pencil from Sephora -</li>
            <li>Perfect for any nude look, has great pigment and is very soft without tugging on your lips..</li>
            <li>I have tried many nude lip liners and this one takes the cake!</li>
            <li>as soon as you find something you love, they discontinue it!</li>
            <li>I have fairly light skin and this lip liner goes great with my skin tone.  </li>

            <li>Pretty good price also!</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>This liner was nice because it gives the lips a nice shape without being too bold!</li>
            <li>Many come out too mauve or brown.</li>
            <li>I love Too Faced cosmetics and this shade</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d first like to say that this is good for any skin color and for any lipstick or gloss.  </li>
            <li>Matched my lips perfectly and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, natural color.</li>
            <li>Just perfect, smooth application and the color is just slightly more deeply hued than my lips</li>
            <li>and it is great for light skin as well, with a really creamy feel.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and natural looking and goes great with all of my light lippies.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is creamy &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It pares up perfect with nude or light pink or brown-pink tones.</li>
            <li>Faced makes high quality, premium products, and knew this would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, buy as many pencils as you can find as the liner sells out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just beginning to get those little crinklies around the lip and this fills them in perfectly to give the illusion of smooth outline.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>After reading about lip liner online, I figured out that if you apply it really lightly it&#x27;ll go on lighter.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, yet has some staying power.</li>
            <li>This color is perfect, I love the subtle lining.</li>
            <li>Wish this was the original pencil.. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>The only thing this brand has over the others is this awesome natural color!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pink toned nude lip liner this is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best color on me, but I wear it all day long because its the only liner I know that will do that!</li>
            <li>I usually do not spend a lot on liner, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is a true neutral, pretty color.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, but waaay better then wearing nothing.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with light pink lip and this a beige pink.</li>
            <li>If you like a little bit of color this liner is good.</li>
            <li>If it had better lasting power it would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Pretty color but way over-priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true as natural gets.</li>
            <li>I like this color because I don&#x27;t like a lip liner to show like clown lips as I see some people of a certain age wearing...</li>
            <li>The liner goes on very gummy like, almost sticky.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li>I also pair it with a gloss when I don&#x27;t want much color.  </li>
            <li>so many other liner/lipsticks do.</li>
            <li>I can even just wear the liner because it&#x27;s such a lovely color, almost the same color as my lips.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who is buying it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, definitely.</li>
            <li>It is not hard to apply but also not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is a naturally neutral shade that blends in with your lips&#x27; natural shade, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your liner showing through your lipcolor.</li>
            <li>I love the color but this mechanical pencil really sucks</li>
            <li>Mirrors your natural lip color and helps hold lip stick/gloss on longer.</li>
            <li>so I can be au natural if I want.  </li>
            <li>Its close to the natural color of your lips.</li>
            <li>But this...is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The color is ok, a little too pink for my olive tone.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty dark for my skin color.</li>
            <li>Several of my friends tried it as well, and it really goes on *nude* (not clear).  </li>
            <li>Not cheap in price, however considering the quality worth it...</li>
            <li>a day is messy, a pain and means you plough through the pencil pretty</li>
            <li>I reapply the gloss coating a few times a day and usually don&#x27;t have to reapply the liner itself more than</li>
            <li>once a day.ly the gloss coating a few times a day and usually don&#x27;t have to reapply the liner itself more than once a day.</li>
            <li>As a person with very light skin, it is not easy for me to find a beige or pink liner that is truly nude instead of too dark.</li>

            <li> Being older, I&#x27;ve lost little pigment in my bottom lip and I can wear this liner and it appears that its just my lips</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 3 stars and not 1 is that this stuff LASTS a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I apply it all over my lips, then a little gloss or lip cream (like DHC Lip Cream - major recommend!!), and I can eat and drink tea all day long without my lip color falling off or looking dopey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They promise things and almost never live up to their expectations.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and my lips are a fairly pale pink, so the Sephora mimics my lip color exactly.</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5 star, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as other brands I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I wanted a neutral liner that did not turn pink or orange after applying.</li>
            <li> This is the same color and can use it everyday with every color or just with gloss.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been wearing this liner nonstop for a month and it&#x27;s still got a few inches left, so I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> This nude is really nude - but not clear (an annoying new liner trend) - and I find I can wear it with any lipstick or gloss.</li>
            <li> average lip liner.</li>
            <li> I find this almost totally unacceptable -- I use lip liner as my lip color, so to have to sharpen at least 1ce</li>
            <li> Some women may find it a little waxy but in order to stay where it is, it needs to be IMO.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering a few because you know</li>
            <li> have another few inches of pencil to go through, and I plan to buy another Sephora pencil to compare.</li>
            <li> and I prefer to be lazy about reapplying, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to having to sharpen it once a day, but still not loving carrying a sharpener around (yes, I&#x27;m lazy).</li>
            <li> I just need a small swipe and it keeps my lipstick on all day!</li>
            <li> I have a very messy Mac lipglass that I couldn&#x27;t use before, and now this lip liner just keeps it in place!  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> The color and style make it impossible to make a mistake.  </li>
            <li> My bad, I guess for not seeing that, although I don&#x27;t think they point it out in the add.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I used to have dozens of shades of lip liners, but it becomes a nuisance after awhile.  Too Faced makes high quality, premium products, and knew this would be a good investment.  I&#x27;d first like to say that this is good for any skin color and for any lipstick or gloss.  Several of my friends tried it as well, and it really goes on *nude* (not clear).  It gives shape and definition to your lips, and helps keep your lipstick in one place.  I have a very messy Mac lipglass that I couldn&#x27;t use before, and now this lip liner just keeps it in place!  Definitely recommend as your every day lip liner.</li>
            <li> As a person with very light skin, it is not easy for me to find a beige or pink liner that is truly nude instead of too dark. Many come out too mauve or brown. This nude is really nude - but not clear (an annoying new liner trend) - and I find I can wear it with any lipstick or gloss. I&#x27;m just beginning to get those little crinklies around the lip and this fills them in perfectly to give the illusion of smooth outline. The consistency is creamy &amp; easy to apply. I bought their lipstick in the color Totally Nude at the same time and it is great for light skin as well, with a really creamy feel.</li>
            <li> I like this color because I don&#x27;t like a lip liner to show like clown lips as I see some people of a certain age wearing...however the price for this product is steep.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin and this lip liner goes great with my skin tone.  I just outline my lips and use a lip gloss and \\&quot;blend it all in\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any nude look, has great pigment and is very soft without tugging on your lips..Pretty good price also!</li>
            <li> Too Faced Perfect Lips Perfect Nude Lip Liner is THE PERFECT lip liner. It is a naturally neutral shade that blends in with your lips&#x27; natural shade, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your liner showing through your lipcolor. It lasts &amp; lasts, which is great. This is a product I can&#x27;t go without. If I couldn&#x27;t have my Too Faced Perfect Lips Perfect Nude Lip Liner, I don&#x27;t know WHAT I&#x27;d do! If you have yet to try it, put it on your &amp;#34;to-do&amp;#34; list and give it a shot! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, but PLEASE don&#x27;t pay $41 for it!!!  you can buy it from Ulta or Sephora for $17!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with light pink lip and this a beige pink. and fairly cakey. it smired and faded. that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> I have tried many nude lip liners and this one takes the cake! I use it daily and wish I would have gotten two. The shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> for the money its not all that great. average lip liner. go to the grocery store and get on similar.</li>
            <li> I usually do not spend a lot on liner, but I&#x27;m glad I did. I wanted a neutral liner that did not turn pink or orange after applying. This is a true neutral, pretty color.</li>
            <li> Matched my lips perfectly and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of liners looking for something that does not change the color of my lips.  This is the same color and can use it everyday with every color or just with gloss.  It is not hard to apply but also not greasy.  It keeps lipstick from feathering and holds the lipstick on.</li>
            <li> The color is ok, a little too pink for my olive tone.  The liner goes on very gummy like, almost sticky.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a pink toned nude lip liner this is great.  Very smooth and natural looking and goes great with all of my light lippies.  I also pair it with a gloss when I don&#x27;t want much color.  If it had better lasting power it would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love the color but this mechanical pencil really sucks.. Breaks off a lot. Wish this was the original pencil.. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Beautiful, natural color. Doesn&#x27;t clump up on lip or feather. Goes on smooth. Not cheap in price, however considering the quality worth it...</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced cosmetics and this shade is beautiful.  If you are looking for a pinkish hue of nude... this is the color!</li>
            <li> Absolute perfect lip liner for all shades of lipstick and gloss.  Mirrors your natural lip color and helps hold lip stick/gloss on longer.</li>
            <li> Best liner I have ever used.  The color and style make it impossible to make a mistake.  It lasts all day.  Ladies, buy as many pencils as you can find as the liner sells out quickly.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Best pencil I&#x27;ve ever found color wise and wear wise.  I can even just wear the liner because it&#x27;s such a lovely color, almost the same color as my lips.  Being older, I&#x27;ve lost little pigment in my bottom lip and I can wear this liner and it appears that its just my lips so I can be au natural if I want.  And it stays on through coffee and food.  Some women may find it a little waxy but in order to stay where it is, it needs to be IMO.  I&#x27;ll be ordering a few because you know as soon as you find something you love, they discontinue it!</li>
            <li> This liner was nice because it gives the lips a nice shape without being too bold! If you like a little bit of color this liner is good. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Wish it lasted longer but it is what it is! I highly recommend to anyone who is buying it.</li>
            <li> Pretty color but way over-priced.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I just need a small swipe and it keeps my lipstick on all day! Great buy.</li>
            <li> I loved my nude waxy pencil from Sephora - I am very pale and my lips are a fairly pale pink, so the Sephora mimics my lip color exactly. I ran out and when I found this on Amazon I figured I&#x27;d save myself a trip to the mall. Well, it&#x27;s not great but I&#x27;m using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The color is pretty dark for my skin color. After reading about lip liner online, I figured out that if you apply it really lightly it&#x27;ll go on lighter.&lt;br /&gt;- This is not a mechanical pencil... you need a sharpener. My bad, I guess for not seeing that, although I don&#x27;t think they point it out in the add. I find this almost totally unacceptable -- I use lip liner as my lip color, so to have to sharpen at least 1ce a day is messy, a pain and means you plough through the pencil pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The only reason I am giving this 3 stars and not 1 is that this stuff LASTS a LONG time. I apply it all over my lips, then a little gloss or lip cream (like DHC Lip Cream - major recommend!!), and I can eat and drink tea all day long without my lip color falling off or looking dopey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another few inches of pencil to go through, and I plan to buy another Sephora pencil to compare. I suspect I may find this pencil lasts longer and I prefer to be lazy about reapplying, so I may look for another color of Too Faced liner. I&#x27;ll update my review after my comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been wearing this liner nonstop for a month and it&#x27;s still got a few inches left, so I can&#x27;t complain and I added a star. I&#x27;m getting used to having to sharpen it once a day, but still not loving carrying a sharpener around (yes, I&#x27;m lazy). I apply it lightly and add on a thin coat of lip cream, gloss or even lipstick and it wears perfectly. I especially love that it doesn&#x27;t wear off in the corners of the lips like so many other liner/lipsticks do. It&#x27;s not the best color on me, but I wear it all day long because its the only liner I know that will do that! Note: I reapply the gloss coating a few times a day and usually don&#x27;t have to reapply the liner itself more than once a day.ly the gloss coating a few times a day and usually don&#x27;t have to reapply the liner itself more than once a day.</li>
            <li> This is nice lip liner. It looks natural, but waaay better then wearing nothing. Its close to the natural color of your lips.</li>
            <li> This has become my ONLY lipliner. This color is perfect, I love the subtle lining. It goes on smoothly, yet has some staying power. It pares up perfect with nude or light pink or brown-pink tones. I&#x27;ve also used it with just lip gloss and it looks fab!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about cosmetic products. They promise things and almost never live up to their expectations. But this...is exactly what I expected. Worth the money, definitely.</li>
            <li> Just perfect, smooth application and the color is just slightly more deeply hued than my lips so it doesn&#x27;t leave that tacky lip liner outline.  Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5 star, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as other brands I have purchased. The only thing this brand has over the others is this awesome natural color! It&#x27;s true as natural gets. And for that, I&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>
