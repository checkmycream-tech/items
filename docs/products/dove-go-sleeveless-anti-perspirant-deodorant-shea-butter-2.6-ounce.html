            <li>My sister wanted to try this kind</li>
            <li>This also moisturizes my skin wonderfully, especially right after shaving.</li>
            <li>The smell of it was very strong and made her eyes water and burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s best for a preteen and not an adult.</li>

            <li>love this scent too.</li>

            <li>I always double-check prices the day or so before the ship date to make sure they aren&#x27;t inflated.  </li>
            <li>THIS WORKS LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li>The scents are also appealing to me.</li>
            <li>but this stuff works just as well &amp; smells even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple scents and they&#x27;re all light and beautiful, my favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin and keeps me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and it leaves your underarms soft.</li>
            <li>I love Dove deodorant, primarily because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>A nice deodorant, but wasn&#x27;t worth the amazon price.</li>
            <li>I also use the original Dove as the smell is very light as well.</li>
            <li>other than no scent, this shea butter is the best dove scent.</li>
            <li>Its nice i got it to go with my lotion and soap it does last and smell good</li>
            <li>I admit that I do not have issues with having to have a strong formula to hide my body odor, but this stuff can work for 2 days with no problem at all.</li>
            <li>very good product, it is many years i&#x27;m using this, i really like it even if leave the white spot in t-shirt below the armpit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet almost sensual.</li>
            <li>It smells so yummy and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Offers good all day protection.</li>
            <li>I love the Shea smell when I first put it on, but once I start to sweat</li>
            <li>I have been using Dove original scent for years...</li>
            <li>I love most Dove products, especially the deodorant, but this stands out as my favorite fragrance of the bunch.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, does the job just right -</li>
            <li>Good little deodorant, smells very much like shea butter, more than I would prefer, but not awful.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to receive this</li>
            <li>Mild scent and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Dove deodorant, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d happily spend $7 if this was a twin pack but for just one, it&#x27;s just not worth the money imho.</li>
            <li>if applied right after the shower, you smell good all day long, even overnight!</li>
            <li>She has tried other Dove products and loved them.</li>
            <li>(you know the scent; it isn&#x27;t sweat, but it&#x27;s not too right either).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Dove&#x27;s Go Sleeveless for a long time and really like it - it&#x27;s a good antiperspirant/deodorant and takes care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Shea scents, in general, with my fav being The Body Shop&#x27;s shea butter line.  </li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I could have bought this more inexpensively locally, so I will just take that chance from now on.  </li>
            <li>love this deodorant, it&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t burn under my arms and this has cleared under my arms so nicely,this is one product i&#x27;m gonna continue using.</li>
            <li>I know the weather is hot in L.A.</li>
            <li>And no weird smell when my sweat combines with it over the course of the day</li>
            <li>I use a lot of natural products, including shea butter, so I was excited when I saw this.</li>
            <li>As consistent with the Dove Go Sleeveless collection this deodorant smells great, is long lasting, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t cake up.</li>
            <li>works great even with a little run over into a second morning.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes - which is the whole reason to buy this one.</li>
            <li>I guess it was just this fragrance that really bothered her.</li>
            <li>Love the soft scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.</li>
            <li>I love most of Dove products, but this one was a true disappointment.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the Shea Butter and Vanilla body wash, so I search for other Dove products with the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>it keeps me dry and fresh</li>
            <li>It controls sweat and odor, and only leaves marks on my clothes if I&#x27;m not careful right after applying it.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>My go to deodorant as I have sensitive skin and others</li>
            <li>Works very well and keeps me dry ALL day!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s barely ANY scent to mine.  </li>

            <li> However, upon checking the invoice, this product ballooned to almost 2x as much on my ship date (and of course my charge date), but has since settled back to the &#x27;usual&#x27; price.  </li>
            <li> this product came out white and lasted for a long time</li>
            <li> I will stick to this pack from Secret.[[ASIN:B001F51W10 Secret Invisible Solid Powder Fresh Scent Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I can only wear this on cooler nights when I will only be out for a few hours.</li>
            <li> the very, very mild scent doesn&#x27;t last long enough, and my pits reflected that. :(  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle on my poor, abused underarms</li>
            <li> I Love All Dove Products I have used them for years &amp; have never been disappointed yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I am a regular Dove Go Sleeveless user, usually in Nourished Beauty or Soothing Chamomile.</li>
            <li> Adding this to my Subscribe and Save basket was a moment of genius as this product is pretty expensive in stores.    </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell anything like TBS&#x27;s shea, or any other brand I&#x27;ve smelled before.  </li>
            <li> like the other brand names I  have used.</li>
            <li> MY UNDERARM IS NOT THAT DARK</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone that doesn&#x27;t like a heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li> make me smell bad when I sweat or get hot throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but I had to carry it with me and wash and reapply at least three times a day.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately she hated it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Mild scent and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t attest to the going sleeveless claim cause it&#x27;s been about 20 degrees here and I&#x27;ve been wearing sweatshirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone that doesn&#x27;t like a heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive this but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with my body chemistry. I love the Shea smell when I first put it on, but once I start to sweat it is not so pleasant. I can only wear this on cooler nights when I will only be out for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Works just like it claims.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, smells nice and not overly scented. Makes your skin feel soft. Offers good all day protection.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the Shea Butter and Vanilla body wash, so I search for other Dove products with the same ingredients.  Love this.  Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does the job just right - if applied right after the shower, you smell good all day long, even overnight!</li>
            <li> A nice deodorant, but wasn&#x27;t worth the amazon price. I will stick to this pack from Secret.[[ASIN:B001F51W10 Secret Invisible Solid Powder Fresh Scent Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I just used this and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is my fav deodorant but it&#x27;s been sold out so I got it here. It&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin and keeps me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this scent too. Not all flowery and overpowering.</li>
            <li> this product came out white and lasted for a long time</li>
            <li> I love this Dove scent &amp; product as it works great and does not irritate my skin. Only problem is that I can NEVER find it locally and was buying it on Amazon up until it went up to $7 a pop. This stuff works well but not that well. I&#x27;d happily spend $7 if this was a twin pack but for just one, it&#x27;s just not worth the money imho.</li>
            <li> very good product, it is many years i&#x27;m using this, i really like it even if leave the white spot in t-shirt below the armpit</li>
            <li> Love this. The smell is great, and it leaves your underarms soft. The scent lasts 24 hours or until you shower again. Quality product.</li>
            <li> My go to deodorant as I have sensitive skin and others make me smell bad when I sweat or get hot throughout the day. I just wish it was not so expensive. I also use the original Dove as the smell is very light as well.</li>
            <li> I Love All Dove Products I have used them for years &amp; have never been disappointed yet would recommend to everyone !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I am a regular Dove Go Sleeveless user, usually in Nourished Beauty or Soothing Chamomile. As consistent with the Dove Go Sleeveless collection this deodorant smells great, is long lasting, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t cake up. I use a lot of natural products, including shea butter, so I was excited when I saw this. It has been working well and I will add it to my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to those looking for a great deodorant without the overpowering flowery/frilly scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Dove&#x27;s Go Sleeveless for a long time and really like it - it&#x27;s a good antiperspirant/deodorant and takes care of my skin.  Adding this to my Subscribe and Save basket was a moment of genius as this product is pretty expensive in stores.    Update as of 12/16: So my second purchase through Subscribe and Save turned out to be a bust.  I always double-check prices the day or so before the ship date to make sure they aren&#x27;t inflated.  At the time all was good.  However, upon checking the invoice, this product ballooned to almost 2x as much on my ship date (and of course my charge date), but has since settled back to the &#x27;usual&#x27; price.  Hmm.  I smell a rat.  I cancelled my subscription and caution others to watch the price, too.  I could have bought this more inexpensively locally, so I will just take that chance from now on.  Still a good product.</li>
            <li> Its nice i got it to go with my lotion and soap it does last and smell good</li>
            <li> love this deodorant, it&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t burn under my arms and this has cleared under my arms so nicely,this is one product i&#x27;m gonna continue using.</li>
            <li> I love Dove deodorant, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and incredibly smooth. It controls sweat and odor, and only leaves marks on my clothes if I&#x27;m not careful right after applying it. I&#x27;ve tried multiple scents and they&#x27;re all light and beautiful, my favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Smells good and goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> Good little deodorant, smells very much like shea butter, more than I would prefer, but not awful. Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes - which is the whole reason to buy this one.</li>
            <li> I love most of Dove products, but this one was a true disappointment. I know the weather is hot in L.A. but I had to carry it with me and wash and reapply at least three times a day. I don&#x27;t have a rigorous lifestyle I&#x27;m a K-8 tutor.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s best for a preteen and not an adult.</li>
            <li> THIS DEODORANT HAVE A VERY NICE SMELL TO IT, I&#x27;LL KEEP ON USING THIS ONE MY UNDERARM IS NOT THAT DARK SO THIS WORKS LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li> As described and received promptly</li>
            <li> Love Dove, amazing product, smell!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also loves it which is a plus!!!!</li>
            <li> Did I get a dud??  There&#x27;s barely ANY scent to mine.  I love Shea scents, in general, with my fav being The Body Shop&#x27;s shea butter line.  This product doesn&#x27;t smell anything like TBS&#x27;s shea, or any other brand I&#x27;ve smelled before.  Again, maybe I did receive a dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the very, very mild scent doesn&#x27;t last long enough, and my pits reflected that. :(  Definitely would not recommend, for the deodorizing effect, nor would I recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;shea&amp;#34; scent.  It&#x27;s NOT.</li>
            <li> I use the entire line of Dove products in this scent. It smells so good and works great.</li>
            <li> Use daily. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I love Dove deodorant, primarily because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The scents are also appealing to me. This scent however lingers and I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove original scent for years...like 10 years...but this stuff works just as well &amp; smells even better.  I admit that I do not have issues with having to have a strong formula to hide my body odor, but this stuff can work for 2 days with no problem at all.</li>
            <li> My sister wanted to try this kind so I ordered it for her. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Unfortunately she hated it. The smell of it was very strong and made her eyes water and burn. The fragrance lingered wherever she went and stayed on her clothes. She had to shower and launder the clothes she was wearing. She has tried other Dove products and loved them. I guess it was just this fragrance that really bothered her.</li>
            <li> My favourite deodorant ever! It&#x27;s so gentle on my poor, abused underarms lol. But she works while I work!! And no weird smell when my sweat combines with it over the course of the day (you know the scent; it isn&#x27;t sweat, but it&#x27;s not too right either).</li>
            <li> I love most Dove products, especially the deodorant, but this stands out as my favorite fragrance of the bunch. It&#x27;s light yet almost sensual. This also moisturizes my skin wonderfully, especially right after shaving.</li>
            <li> other than no scent, this shea butter is the best dove scent. works great even with a little run over into a second morning.</li>
            <li> Works very well and keeps me dry ALL day!  Love the soft scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It smells so yummy and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant it keeps me dry and fresh this is great it doesn&#x27;t make my underarm sore. like the other brand names I  have used.</li>
