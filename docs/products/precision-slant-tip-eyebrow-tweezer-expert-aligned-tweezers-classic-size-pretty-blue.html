            <li>I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own after personal use.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased these along with a pair of ( very popular named brand) tweezers and both of them arrived today.</li>
            <li>They are not dull or too blunt but have a nice edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are very strong, high quality tweezers.  </li>

            <li>Yes, they are pretty.</li>
            <li>while I do have another set which is considered a more professional grade of tweezers, that might have just a slight amount more precision; these still do everything I need them to do</li>
            <li>I also used it to grab my one chin hair that is very stubble and breaks every time , and this time it came out straight out !</li>
            <li>These tweezers are really well made</li>
            <li>They are very well made and durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly a professional set of tweezers and so much better than a standard pair you can buy in the &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; and make-up department.</li>
            <li>The grip is nice, not too slippery, makes it easy to snag those little hairs before they become too long and noticeable.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are high quality.  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted to get a pair of high quality eyebrow tweezers.  </li>
            <li>any better than my old, rather dulled down tweezers that I bought these to replace.</li>
            <li>It took several attempts at different angles to even locate the fine hairs with these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>can also attest to these being high quality, these were much more solid in my hand than any other tweezers I have felt.  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality, durable tweezer...search no more!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money getting some junky eyebrow tweezers at one of those big box stores.  </li>
            <li> It was also delivered on time and was exactly as expected from the product description and photo.</li>
            <li> so I tried again and after a few attempt finally felt a click of metal on glass.</li>
            <li> The other brand don&#x60;t- they swiftly and painlessly pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> Getting them out is a difficult task cause grasping them and holding on to the fine metal fiber is hard.</li>
            <li> also used them to grab a piece of glass out of my foot the other day that I thought would never come out.</li>
            <li> My kids had broken a mirror and while cleaning up the remainder of dust in the floor I realized I had a sore spot on my sole that had to be a tiny shard.</li>
            <li> These blue tweezers tug at the delicate skin around the eye when grasping onto hairs under my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Complete fail.</li>
            <li> you really can not go wrong with these tweezers !</li>
            <li> The metal ends of these tweezers are twice as thick as the other brand.</li>
            <li> I could never find one that worked which seems hard to believe for eyebrow tweezers, but they just didn&#x27;t pull the hair out like</li>
            <li> These are the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x60;ll be forever skeptical to purchase products from Amazon where the majority of the reviews are 5 star reviews from people who, per their disclaimer, received the item at a discount for an &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; review.&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Tried as I might I could not find it and was afraid I was going to make my foot sore.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow tweezers rock as I&#x27;ve had a stubborn wart that&#x27;s been driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> The tips don&#x27;t come together at the ends, making tweezing actually impossible.</li>

            <li> In order to have nice shaped eyebrows I rely on good tweezers to do so from home. I did order these tweezers through a special deal to test it and share my honest and unbiased opinion. I do like the way that is built, the paint is well done and the tip is well shaped and grabs even the finest hair from eyebrows. It is a regular size and about 4&amp;#34; long, it fits my hands perfectly . I also used it to grab my one chin hair that is very stubble and breaks every time , and this time it came out straight out ! Perfect to have it at home or in your purse for any emergencies , living in Hawaii sometimes we get keawe thorns or sea urchin pokes and they work great as well for the removal of those! Great buy!</li>
            <li> These are very strong, high quality tweezers.  They are the perfect size and feel great in the hand, which makes them really easy to use and has halved the time it takes me to weed wack those brows.  If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality, durable tweezer...search no more!  This is the one!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money getting some junky eyebrow tweezers at one of those big box stores.  I could never find one that worked which seems hard to believe for eyebrow tweezers, but they just didn&#x27;t pull the hair out like I thought they should.  These are great!  Plus, they are quite stylish!</li>
            <li> Impressive.  These tweezers have surgical precision.  They are even packaged like an instrument.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are definitely excellent quality. The slanted tip makes it very easy to get to the smaller hairs which I have an abundance of. I would definitely recommend these to others. They are very reasonably priced which you can&#x27;t beat. I did a good amount of searching before buying these and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> These Professional Slant Tip Eyebrow Tweezers are wonderful for getting those perfectly shaped eyebrows!  These tweezers are durable, high quality, perfectly sized, and come at a great price too!  The slant tip makes shaping eyebrows very easy.  Would definitely recommend these tweezers!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are really well made and it&#x27;s so easy to grip compared with metal tweezers.  I threw out my old tweezers because they don&#x27;t grip nearly as well as these.  The slant tip make it perfect to pull out hairs and a great addition to my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also needed MUCH better tweezers to remove ticks when camping. This is often a problem for campers in the south and we take the kids on weekend camping trips a lot and for scouting events.  Having quality tweezers in a first aid kit is essential. These do a MUCH better job!!!  I&#x27;m going to keep the rubbery band that it came with to put back around the tweezers for storing them between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also perfect for removing splinters from the skin.  I am really happy with these tweezers!  I order a lot of products on Amazon and I was so happy to be selected to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  It&#x27;s truly a professional set of tweezers and so much better than a standard pair you can buy in the &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; and make-up department.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are pretty. And they&#x60;re blue. Beyond that, they aren&#x60;t any better than my old, rather dulled down tweezers that I bought these to replace. I actually purchased these along with a pair of ( very popular named brand) tweezers and both of them arrived today. Just looking at them in a side by side comparison, I could tell which ones were going to be more effective. The metal ends of these tweezers are twice as thick as the other brand. Functionally, they don&#x60;t even compare. These blue tweezers tug at the delicate skin around the eye when grasping onto hairs under my eyebrows. The other brand don&#x60;t- they swiftly and painlessly pull the hair out. Small fine hairs were graspable with the other pair of tweezers. It took several attempts at different angles to even locate the fine hairs with these.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;ll be forever skeptical to purchase products from Amazon where the majority of the reviews are 5 star reviews from people who, per their disclaimer, received the item at a discount for an &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; review.&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers! They fit comfortably in my hands and don&#x27;t pull or pinch my skin. They are very well made and durable. They are made out of metal and have a good amount of bend to them. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers, strong, durable, BEAUTIFUL color - make it easy to spot when my teenage daughter &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; them. I received these at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> great tweezers, these are the best tweezers I have even used for my eyebrows, Love them.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how much of a difference these tweezers made compared to the regular old kind I usually get from the drug store. These seem to always pluck on the first try and they are so easy to find in my purse due to the bright blue color! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Complete fail. These are the absolute worst. The tips don&#x27;t come together at the ends, making tweezing actually impossible. Trying again with a name brand product...</li>
            <li> Great tweezer. Gets even the hard-to-grab hairs and is far less likely to pinch the skin. Best tweezer I&#x27;ve owned. It was also delivered on time and was exactly as expected from the product description and photo.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are ok.  They dont seem to hold the hair well once pinched by the tweezers.  However they are precise in their grasp.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are awesome. They fit perfectly in my hand and between my thumb and pointer finger. The grasp those fine hairs with no problem at all. I&#x27;m able to pluck those stubborn eyebrow hairs without hurting myself by pinching my skin. I was even able to get those pesky chin hairs that I usually have problems getting.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is a diesel mechanic and always ends up getting metal splinters in his hands and fingers. Getting them out is a difficult task cause grasping them and holding on to the fine metal fiber is hard. But, I had the chance to use these tweezers and was extremely surprised that I could remove them without difficulty or pain to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;These are one set of tweezers that you must have in your supply.&lt;br /&gt; I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. Regardless all opinions are 100% my own based on experiences with said product.</li>
            <li> I love these Tweezers ! They are a fun color too so they stand out and they are easy to find :) I use them for my eyebrows and the slanted tip is great !! Im really happy I received an opportunity to review them as part of a promotion . I can honestly say they are one of the best pairs I&#x27;ve owned . I also think they are a great size .I have tried the mini size and I prefer this reg. size . its just more comfortable in my hand . for the price this is in my opinion a great deal :) oh and I almost forgot to mention their no questions asked return policy ! you really can not go wrong with these tweezers ! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> All around good tweezers. I have owned quite a range of sets of these and this one is a set I carry around for on the go and having on hand. They have tweezed my eyebrows consistently as well as other stray hairs.  They are not dull or too blunt but have a nice edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used them to grab a piece of glass out of my foot the other day that I thought would never come out. My kids had broken a mirror and while cleaning up the remainder of dust in the floor I realized I had a sore spot on my sole that had to be a tiny shard. Tried as I might I could not find it and was afraid I was going to make my foot sore. I gave up for a bit but it kept bothering me so I tried again and after a few attempt finally felt a click of metal on glass. I grabbed ahold and got it out and my foot didn&#x27;t bother me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I do have another set which is considered a more professional grade of tweezers, that might have just a slight amount more precision; these still do everything I need them to do and I can always get the job done. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own after personal use.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are high quality.  The blue color really stands out in my purse so I can reach into the &amp;#34;black hole&amp;#34; and find it easily.  The grip is nice, not too slippery, makes it easy to snag those little hairs before they become too long and noticeable.  Nice grip too at the end of the tweezer.  This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to get a pair of high quality eyebrow tweezers.  It seems like she always has had those flimsy cheap versions of tweezers that only last so long and you can&#x27;t get too precise with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She raved about how precise she could get with these tweezers, and that once she grabbed an eyebrow hair it never slipped away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also attest to these being high quality, these were much more solid in my hand than any other tweezers I have felt.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a great set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow tweezers rock as I&#x27;ve had a stubborn wart that&#x27;s been driving me crazy. Two minutes after ridding myself of a unibrow I decided to take these tweezers to my arch nemesis or as I call him Wallace(the wart). Well Wallace took a walk, and these eyebrow tweezers did the job. I&#x27;m never going back to Tweezerman. Never. Good bye Wallace.</li>
