            <li>always have enjoyed Yardley products.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it came so fast!!Not even a week...</li>
            <li>Lily of the Valley had become my favorite perfume, and then the company discontinued it.</li>
            <li>Yes,  a very old one, but a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance not over bearing, easy to carry in purse,</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li>This was bought as a gift and the 85 year old lady loved it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this Lily of the Valley scent, which I had been looking for for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Not quite the true Lily of the Valley aroma.</li>
            <li>This is overall a good product.</li>
            <li>This smells good, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>Overall, good value for the price.</li>
            <li>IT HAS A VERY LIGHT FRAGRANCE, BUT REMINDS YOU OF A CLEAR MILD SPRING DAY.&lt;br /&gt;IT</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a scent a bit less sweet, but it is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is authentic, but really old.</li>
            <li>This is a gift for my 95 year old aunt who has not been able to find the product.  </li>
            <li>With this particular product, the bottle is large, and it is the accurate smell.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly as described-</li>
            <li>If I would have tested this perfume FIRST, I would not have bought it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>This smells absolutely nothing like Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li>I really looked forward to receiving my \\&quot;treat\\&quot; because I hadn&#x27;t had any for some time.  </li>
            <li>I only hope that the new Lily of the Valley (and April Violets) will be as nice as the current one.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would have would be the scent of pure lilies, but I live and learn.</li>
            <li>She is older</li>
            <li>I gave it away,and will be more careful before ordering in the future..</li>
            <li>(Kate Middleton carried them at her wedding, so not just for old folks!)</li>
            <li>It was so old it lost it&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
            <li>When ordering Christmas presents in November, 2012, I ordered this Lily of the Valley by Yardley as a early Christmas gift for mmyself.  </li>
            <li>I learned recently that Yardley will soon reformulate this and their other &amp;#34;English&amp;#34; scents (English Lavender, April Violets, and English Rose).  </li>
            <li>but I swear her nose is ever so sensitive to different scents.</li>
            <li>Mind barely spells as I&#x27;m putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Label indicates that lilly of the valley is somewhere in there (middle notes); if it is, it is very well hidden.  </li>

            <li> However, when I tried it, I didn&#x27;t think it had much scent, much less smelled like lily of the valley!!</li>
            <li> So now I have this brand new bottle with only a few sprays gone, that I can&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> She just loves it and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will just have to buy some other product..</li>
            <li> LET&#x27;S OTHER&#x27;S KNOW THAT</li>
            <li> This one smells like a watered down version of Jean Nate.  </li>
            <li> Then when we did it was far too expensive.  </li>
            <li> No more buying perfume online for me.</li>
            <li> I do detect a hint of lemon or orange, but it is hardly the dominant note.  </li>
            <li> This scent is so hard to find now, for some reason</li>
            <li> There is a faint harsh overtone of something chemical which makes me think of kerosene for some reason.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> One can never go wrong with Yardley products and&lt;br /&gt;Lily of the Valley in the summer is a treat</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed upon receiving.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed!!!!!</li>

            <li> This item is exactly as described- I am very pleased</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this Lily of the Valley scent, which I had been looking for for quite a while. However, when I tried it, I didn&#x27;t think it had much scent, much less smelled like lily of the valley!! Thinking it might be the fault of my nose, I tried it again on several different occasions. It still didn&#x27;t smell like I knew it should. I was extremely disappointed!!!!! So now I have this brand new bottle with only a few sprays gone, that I can&#x27;t use! Bummer!!!!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for seller. If a scent is labeled &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;, you expect it to smell like lilly of the valley.  This one smells like a watered down version of Jean Nate.  Label indicates that lilly of the valley is somewhere in there (middle notes); if it is, it is very well hidden.  Would not recommend this product and have contacted Yardley and voiced my opinion about the pretty-close-to-deceptive labeling.</li>
            <li> It smells delightful, fresh, and mot nauseating. I was hoping it would have would be the scent of pure lilies, but I live and learn.</li>
            <li> Not like any lily of the valley flower I ever smelled. Very disappointed. Plus it doesn&#x27;t last. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> My grandma was very satisfied with this scent. She is older but I swear her nose is ever so sensitive to different scents. She did like a scent another company had, but they discontinued it. This is serving as a great replacement!</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely nothing like Lily of the Valley. Had I tried it before buying I would never have bought it. I gave it away,and will be more careful before ordering in the future..</li>
            <li> always have enjoyed Yardley products. this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Yes,  a very old one, but a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> It was so old it lost it&#x27;s fragrance.  I threw it in the trash!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Disappointment.  Not like what I remembered.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the lily of the valley by Yardly.a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the lily of the valley I remember.  There is a faint harsh overtone of something chemical which makes me think of kerosene for some reason.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I use, the one before I bought in a shop, but the scent does not last 10 minutes. It is the same story when I wear it all over my body. I think this product is authentic, but really old. I will just have to buy some other product..</li>
            <li> When ordering Christmas presents in November, 2012, I ordered this Lily of the Valley by Yardley as a early Christmas gift for mmyself.  I really looked forward to receiving my \\&quot;treat\\&quot; because I hadn&#x27;t had any for some time.  So very disappointed upon receiving.  Another reviewer stated that her&#x27;s didn&#x27;t last the day.  Mind barely spells as I&#x27;m putting it on.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> If I would have tested this perfume FIRST, I would not have bought it. To me, it just does not smell like \\&quot;Lilies of the Valley\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t like the way it smells at all, so I will be giving it away.  No more buying perfume online for me.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my 95 year old aunt who has not been able to find the product.  She is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> In the market for a lily of the valley eau de toilette, I was initially wary of buying Yardley&#x27;s after reading the reviews claiming it smells more like citrus fruits than like lilies of the valley.  In the end I bought the eau de toilette, and am I glad I did!  To me this smells like a dew-kissed bouquet of lilies of the valley and white lilies.  I do detect a hint of lemon or orange, but it is hardly the dominant note.  Yardley Lily of the Valley is pure and innocent; it would make an ideal wedding-day fragrance.  I learned recently that Yardley will soon reformulate this and their other &amp;#34;English&amp;#34; scents (English Lavender, April Violets, and English Rose).  I only hope that the new Lily of the Valley (and April Violets) will be as nice as the current one.</li>
            <li> perfect gift, being xmas, birthday or just wanting to show you care. the wife loved it. I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a scent a bit less sweet, but it is pleasant.  Not quite the true Lily of the Valley aroma.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this for my mother!!  She just loves it and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for a long time.  Then when we did it was far too expensive.  I love the fact that it came so fast!!Not even a week...only 3 days!!</li>
            <li> As to the scent, Yardley of London is a quality company of long-standing, and the scent remains the same year after year. I like that, I know what I&#x27;m getting. I love the scent of this, I think it very authentic, and my mother -- for whom I bought it -- loves it as well. This scent is so hard to find now, for some reason (Kate Middleton carried them at her wedding, so not just for old folks!) I was glad to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li> This is overall a good product. Lily of the Valley had become my favorite perfume, and then the company discontinued it. I have been looking for a suitable replacement for a while. This smells good, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day. With this particular product, the bottle is large, and it is the accurate smell. Overall, good value for the price. When I go out in the evening, I just re-apply.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance not over bearing, easy to carry in purse,</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift and the 85 year old lady loved it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT SINCE MY YOUTH.  IT HAS A VERY LIGHT FRAGRANCE, BUT REMINDS YOU OF A CLEAR MILD SPRING DAY.&lt;br /&gt;IT LET&#x27;S OTHER&#x27;S KNOW THAT YOUR&#x27;E THERE WITHOUT OVERPOWERING THEM.</li>
            <li> One can never go wrong with Yardley products and&lt;br /&gt;Lily of the Valley in the summer is a treat not only&lt;br /&gt;for the wearer but people around her.</li>
