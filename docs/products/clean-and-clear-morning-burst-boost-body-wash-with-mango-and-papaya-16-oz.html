            <li>It makes me feel very clean and</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT, lathers nicely, and DOES help treat my minor body acne, and prevents it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These new Clean &amp; Clear Boost products smell great and work great.</li>
            <li>The Seller has described this product accurately.</li>
            <li>The Seller has described this product accurately.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells so good and comes in a pretty large container.</li>
            <li>I love the scents and refreshing feeling of many body washes, a convenient liquid gel saturating your body and senses, over the general “lather,” experience of a soap bar.  </li>
            <li>it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>The smell is the perfect amount of fragrance not too strong or too weak.</li>
            <li>I felt rejuvenated, refreshed, a burst of energy as my skin breathed with cleanliness, the lovely scent gave my senses a feeling of a morning burst of energy, and ready to start my day.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and it isn&#x27;t too liquidy, it&#x27;s actually a gel.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really is getting you \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; up more of an after soap use just for the scent.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads are so mild and if you are looking for a exclusive exfoliating body wash , this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>Lucky for us</li>

            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite shower soap, and our local store often doesn&#x27;t have it in stock.</li>
            <li>Since I use the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Facial Scrub, love the results which is oil free, gently exfoliating my skin with bursting beads, and also includes vitamin C and ginseng, I find that the facial scrub leaves my face clean and clear, yet</li>

            <li>very slippery on the tub surface.</li>
            <li>It is good body wash although not exceptional.</li>
            <li>If you are feeling tired one evening, and would like to stay awake for a few more hours, to entertain friends/family, finish a task or project, this would be a great body wash to use, keeping you refreshed, rejuvenated, and giving you the feeling of a burst of energy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This body wash left me feeling refreshed after I used it. It leaves my skin feeling soft. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry like my previous body washes. The scent smells great. You can use this body wash any time of day. I use it at night.</li>
            <li> Was extremely excited to see Clean and Clear came out with a body wash. I use their sensitive skin face wash.  However after using this for 3 days I noticed that my skin was abnormally itchy. It really made me horribly uncomfortable and as soon as I stopped using it I had no issues. So I will not give this product a good review. Though I am upset it didnt work for me cause it smells so good...</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with my back acne.</li>
            <li> I had a small sample bottle that came with one of their products that I was very content with. I just ran out so I decided to purchase this :) I&#x27;m in love with fruit scented body washes and this scent is amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to try the others as well. With a loofa, it leaves your skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered a two pack of this. I only received one (for $15.00). When I called to get this fixed, they said they would send the other bottle and even gave me a reference number, but I still never received the second bottle. I would not have paid $15.00 for one bottle of body wash. It says clearly in the description that it is a pack of 2. Not happy with this seller. I should have received what I ordered, and especially after calling to get a correction.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful!  If it weren&#x27;t a body wash, I&#x27;d eat it.  It smells very good, just like oranges.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells so good, and it&#x27;s moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t bother my really sensitive pale skin. Boost and Splash both smell like candy, can&#x27;t wait to try the blue one. If you are tired of floral womanly smelling body wash, get this! It lathers great, but not how you&#x27;d think. It&#x27;s FOAMY, not soapy and bubbly, personally I love it. Also in case anyone is confused, this body wash is not for body acne, it&#x27;s not medicated.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it here at our stores anymore.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  The smell everymorning when I shower is a burst of sunshine.</li>
            <li> It is good body wash although not exceptional. The smell is pleasant and it cleans pretty good and it doesnt dry out my skin. The exfoliating beads are so mild and if you are looking for a exclusive exfoliating body wash , this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it cleans. I wish that they were still selling in the store. It does make you feel more awake after using.</li>
            <li> The smell is the perfect amount of fragrance not too strong or too weak. leaves my skin feeling clean,fresh and oh so soft!&lt;br /&gt;But! I bought a 16 oz bottle at Target for $4.00 while you guys are paying $16 for two 16oz bottles, litterly double what I pay!</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I can purchase this item anymore. They stopped selling it at Wal-Mart and I searched high and low for the product for months. I was happy to see that I can get it on Amazon. This time I used the Prime Pantry but I have also used Subscribe and Save. Pantry takes a little bit longer to ship but it&#x27;s still a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of allergies to body washes as well as other products and this is one of the few body washes/face washes I can use without breaking out in a rash. It is gentle on the skin and smells absolutely fantastic. I can&#x27;t even tell you how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> Really glad to see these products and hope they stick around. The other body washes for those of us who like to avoid \\&quot;backne\\&quot;, etc have horrible scents. These new Clean &amp; Clear Boost products smell great and work great.</li>

I definitely could not wait to try the body wash, which I saw while shopping on the Amazon website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Wash is GREAT! The smell of papaya/mango blended together stimulates your senses while showering. If you have tried the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Facial Scrub, the results and refreshing feeling you have after cleansing your face, is a similar experience of a rejuvenated, invigorating feeling of clean, refreshing results after using the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Body Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that you can purchase a bottle or the 2-pack set, at a reasonable price.

You would not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for a great choice of body wash selections, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it isn&#x27;t too liquidy, it&#x27;s actually a gel.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels good but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really is getting you \\&quot;cleaned\\&quot; up more of an after soap use just for the scent. very slippery on the tub surface.</li>
            <li> Best body wash ever, this is all I will use and have used for the last 5 years :)</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good and comes in a pretty large container. helped me feel energized. it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This wash smells absolutely amazing. It makes me feel very clean and the scent even seems to last a little while once I&#x27;m out of the shower.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this stuff and have been using for years!!</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite shower soap, and our local store often doesn&#x27;t have it in stock. Lucky for us I could just order it, and now she won&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> It smells GREAT, lathers nicely, and DOES help treat my minor body acne, and prevents it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
