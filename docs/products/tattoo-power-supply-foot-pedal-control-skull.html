            <li>great items fast delivery and everything as described haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li>Like the supply unit but needs a better foot pedal the one that comes with</li>
            <li>i checked my address and it is ok</li>
            <li>better used on NON carpeted floor though.</li>
            <li>but works okay on both.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good</li>
            <li>Skull Black works great, shipped fast and had an excellent price.</li>
            <li>but in fact the one i ordered is Chrome-ish and will smudge easy but wipes just as eay with a anti microbe wipe.</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast and came in good condition.</li>
            <li>LIKE UR GOING TO BREAK IT LIKE SOME OF THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC ONES</li>
            <li>I am not at all happy with my recent purchase.</li>
            <li>get a round  one they are the best.</li>
            <li>Works best on hard flooring.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it looks cool and gets comments from customers all of the time.</li>
            <li>bam\\&quot;\\&quot; thats it.they are cool looking,but cool looks</li>
            <li>This foot pedal is as cool in person as it is here online.</li>
            <li>not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>The pedal becomes very hot under my foot in a matter of minutes alone.</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>If your into skulls and wanting to accessorize your equipment this is the ticket to do so, just have fun</li>
            <li>Seller shipped it right out no delays.</li>
            <li>i thank u very much</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s flat and feels better under my foot.</li>
            <li>i got the skull pedal in a fast time to thank u</li>
            <li>NICE AND FIRM</li>
            <li>a foot petal with a round heavy duty cord,and if you can get the one with cotacts that touch and generate power to your power box, not the one&#x27;s with the cheap built in switchs,because over a period of time the switch is going to wear out like any switch good example a miter box saw switch that you keep using over and</li>
            <li>High quality insulated electrical connections.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone needing a pedal, or just wanting a cooler looking one.</li>
            <li>At this price, I will probably buy a few more for spares and to hand out to friends.</li>
            <li>when i hooked up my old pedal all was well again an i could finish the tattoo.</li>
            <li>It is sold direct from the manufacturer, so that explains the cost.</li>
            <li>The only reason for the 2 stars is because the seller shipped it out really fast.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to pack up for mobil use.</li>
            <li>its so bad Arse its really stylish with out going broke but be warned the skull looks almost white like most picture a skull</li>
            <li>Cheap crap, I could&#x27;ve made something better in my garage.</li>
            <li>recommend no flat tattoo foot petals believe me</li>

            <li> recommend no flat tattoo foot petals believe me</li>
            <li> most painful tattoo ive ever had.</li>
            <li> Because it ships from China, the expected delivery time was 3-4 weeks, but it arrived in about 8-10 days.</li>
            <li> The foot pedal that came with my tattoo equipment clicked on and off which made it harder to work.</li>
            <li> I ran across this being sold at a tenth the price of other dealers on Amazon, so I picked one up.</li>
            <li> Not what you want half way down a line.</li>
            <li> Got my pedal when i was supposed to, but the only problems i have is that one of the electric sleeves are torn where the wire and pedal connect, still functions but wasnt looking to buy broken merchandise</li>
            <li> Heavy made works with very little presure looks</li>
            <li> i help some people new in the art of tattooing  CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> Kinda small and dinky</li>
            <li> every flat petal i&#x27;ve ever owned was crap, i cleaned the contacts and tried to wire them up beter,resolder them and they would work for a little while then you get set up</li>
            <li> but everything looked as it should  be so ill be returning</li>
            <li> Really crap product.</li>
            <li> i had no idea that this was shocking people until i used it on myself.</li>

            <li> Got this just because I liked the look but it&#x27;s actually a good pedal. Kinda small and dinky but it works even for a big guy like me. Would recommend to anyone. No contact or wiring issues.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 tattoos.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for. i had no idea that this was shocking people until i used it on myself. then went back and asked the people i had used it on. there must be a short in the wires or crossed wires something... most painful tattoo ive ever had. when i hooked up my old pedal all was well again an i could finish the tattoo. garbage never used it again</li>
            <li> Garbage.  Cheap crap, I could&#x27;ve made something better in my garage.</li>
            <li> When the foot pedal was received it did not work. It did not cost enough to warrant returning it but I will not purchase from this company again</li>
            <li> Small and easy to pack up for mobil use. Works Great. High quality insulated electrical connections.  Oh, and it looks cool and gets comments from customers all of the time.</li>

            <li> THIS IS BADASS.ITS NICE AND FIRM,LOOKS NICE AND U DONT FEEL LIKE UR GOING TO BREAK IT LIKE SOME OF THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC ONES U SEE.U&#x27;LL BE HAPPY WITH THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> great items fast delivery and everything as described haven&#x27;t used it yet but everything looked as it should  be so ill be returning</li>
            <li> Nice!! Like the supply unit but needs a better foot pedal the one that comes with it is low quailty</li>
            <li> I am not at all happy with my recent purchase. The pedal becomes very hot under my foot in a matter of minutes alone. Another item for the trash can.</li>
            <li> Love it! For the price it can&#x27;t be beat! It shipped super fast and came in good condition. It works well and seems sturdy. Works best on hard flooring. People think it looks awsome!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good you might want to change the cord though. I would of gave it 5 stars but the piece that plugs into the power box broke off.</li>
            <li> This thing is junk. The only reason for the 2 stars is because the seller shipped it out really fast. Good seller. Really crap product. Shorts in and out. Not what you want half way down a line. Buy an eikon and be done with it.</li>
            <li> every flat petal i&#x27;ve ever owned was crap, i cleaned the contacts and tried to wire them up beter,resolder them and they would work for a little while then you get set up and bam\\&quot;\\&quot; thats it.they are cool looking,but cool looks don&#x27;nt make money and batttling with a foot petals are not my kinda of thing speacially in the middle or starting to do a tattoo.i do&#x27;nnt recommend no flat tattoo foot petals believe me, i&#x27;ve tried all of the them slim ones skulls and ect.get you a foot petal with a round heavy duty cord,and if you can get the one with cotacts that touch and generate power to your power box, not the one&#x27;s with the cheap built in switchs,because over a period of time the switch is going to wear out like any switch good example a miter box saw switch that you keep using over and over.i hope i help some people new in the art of tattooing  CRAZY RICK</li>

            <li> Great product. The foot pedal that came with my tattoo equipment clicked on and off which made it harder to work. This product was a contact switch which was great. Foot on, machine on...foot off, machine off.</li>
            <li> exactly as described! great product!</li>
            <li> it was so slim and lightweight i like alot  it was not bulky i can pack it any  where and take it anywhere</li>

            <li> sturdy, well made, good quality. better used on NON carpeted floor though. but works okay on both. not a bad buy. would recommend</li>
            <li> its so bad Arse its really stylish with out going broke but be warned the skull looks almost white like most picture a skull but in fact the one i ordered is Chrome-ish and will smudge easy but wipes just as eay with a anti microbe wipe. Love it.</li>
