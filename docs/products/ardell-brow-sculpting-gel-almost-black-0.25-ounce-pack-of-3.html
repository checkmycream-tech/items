            <li>This gel did an awesome job, easy to apply and they look natural.</li>
            <li>I really love this gel.</li>
            <li>I have been using Ardell Brow Sculpting Gel for many years.  </li>
            <li>Amazon did handle the return quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>but I just wish there wouldn&#x27;t have crumb like things come out and had to Qtip it clean.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It looks more natural, and doesn&#x27;t clump or smudge.</li>
            <li>this is perfect if you have black hair, doesn&#x27;t smudge and last all day.</li>
            <li>The tint darkens the ends of your real lashes, allowing the full length of them to be seen.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to rock!</li>
            <li>This is the best product for dark (black) eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>but this gel is a great way to make thin brows look fuller and real.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows are very sparse and this sculpting gel is a life saver.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but it dries up fast-</li>
            <li>I really like this product to darken my brows</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and I use it alone when I only want some light daytime makeup.</li>
            <li>It makes your brows very pretty in a soft and natural way.  </li>
            <li>Was a little nervous using this product but have fell in love with it since.</li>
            <li>Just dab a little on and follow it up with a brow brush to smooth out.</li>
            <li>The gel is light weight and doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel stiff at all.</li>
            <li>It is small and easy to carry around with me when I need a touch up.</li>
            <li>To help make it darker, I fill in my eyebrows with a  black eyeliner pencil and then smudge or fill them in with black eye shadow then use the gel on top to keep my hairs in place.</li>
            <li>It leaves black globs all over and doesn&#x27;t do much for your brows!  </li>
            <li>I really needed a dark brown, but this one served its purpose.</li>

            <li> This sculpting gel covers over the grey brows.  </li>
            <li> It also lengthens your lashes, and makes them look naturally long vs. the look of mascara.  </li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair black, but didn&#x27;t want to dye my eyebrows</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow gel I found that is actually black</li>
            <li> I thought the consistency of the gel was a little to light to actually do anything for my brows –– wrong!</li>
            <li> I dye my eyebrows, but there are always a few strands of grey brows that are missed.  </li>
            <li> I find that other colors seem to wash out my eyebrows</li>
            <li> For some reason I was buying dark brown.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> Almost black a bit too dark for me.</li>
            <li> It does slightly sculpt the eyebrow, but for me, the added color is the reason for the 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I have a few stray gray hairs in each eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I have used some that have been way too expsensive and way too overpriced for what they deliver, stiff brows that break off from the alcohol within the gel.</li>
            <li> This gel helps blend them in AND it helps keep my eyebrows tame and in place.</li>
            <li> Product is a little gloopy and thick for my sparse brows.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t require a pencil, just slick on the gel</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> Thought it would make my brows hard and crunchy</li>
            <li> My brows are a bit like Wolverine&#x27;s caught in a windstorm, very hard to tame.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow pencils tend to be too heavy and look fake when applied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> No fuss, no frills - crazy eyebrows be gone!</li>
            <li> This is worthless.</li>
            <li> Worst brow makeup I ever used.</li>

            <li> Best eyebrow gel and cheap too! No fuss, no frills - crazy eyebrows be gone!</li>
            <li> I dye my eyebrows, but there are always a few strands of grey brows that are missed.  This sculpting gel covers over the grey brows.  It does slightly sculpt the eyebrow, but for me, the added color is the reason for the 5 stars.  My eyebrows look great when I use this on them.  The applicator has a brush end that looks like a mascara brush, and none of the gel seems to get on my skin.  I really love this gel.</li>
            <li> This is worthless. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your time with this product, all it is is basically mascara... And not even a waterproof mascara. If I wanted to use mascara on my eyebrows I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered something specifically for eyebrows I would have just used mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars are for the amazing customer service! Everything I could ever hope for in customer service!</li>
            <li> Product is a little gloopy and thick for my sparse brows.  For some reason I was buying dark brown.  Almost black a bit too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a great brow gel for ages. I have used some that have been way too expsensive and way too overpriced for what they deliver, stiff brows that break off from the alcohol within the gel. But Ardell has just knocked it out of the park. My brows are a bit like Wolverine&#x27;s caught in a windstorm, very hard to tame. I thought the consistency of the gel was a little to light to actually do anything for my brows –– wrong! This gel did an awesome job, easy to apply and they look natural.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dark (black) eyebrows.  You won&#x27;t require a pencil, just slick on the gel and you&#x27;re ready to rock!</li>
            <li> I wish it was darker, but the product does help to fill in my eyebrows and keep them in place. It looks very natural and I use it alone when I only want some light daytime makeup. To help make it darker, I fill in my eyebrows with a  black eyeliner pencil and then smudge or fill them in with black eye shadow then use the gel on top to keep my hairs in place.

            <li> Was a little nervous using this product but have fell in love with it since. I use it every day. Just dab a little on and follow it up with a brow brush to smooth out. Thought it would make my brows hard and crunchy but it doesn&#x27;t at all. I will be purchasing this again. Oh and it has lasted me forever!!!</li>
            <li> It does the job but I just wish there wouldn&#x27;t have crumb like things come out and had to Qtip it clean.</li>
            <li> OMG the best!! I love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Worst brow makeup I ever used. Very messy. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very sparse and this sculpting gel is a life saver.  Eyebrow pencils tend to be too heavy and look fake when applied but this gel is a great way to make thin brows look fuller and real.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it dries up fast-</li>
            <li> It works and smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I recently dyed my hair black, but didn&#x27;t want to dye my eyebrows so I put this on every morning. It goes on nicely and stays put! I&#x27;ve forgotten I had it on and have rubbed or scratched my eyebrows and it didn&#x27;t smudge or flake. It smells really good too, which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow gel I found that is actually black I find that other colors seem to wash out my eyebrows this is perfect if you have black hair, doesn&#x27;t smudge and last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  It leaves black globs all over and doesn&#x27;t do much for your brows!  I returned it.  Amazon did handle the return quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ardell Brow Sculpting Gel for many years.  It is the best.  It makes your brows very pretty in a soft and natural way.  I will certainly continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have a few stray gray hairs in each eyebrow. This gel helps blend them in AND it helps keep my eyebrows tame and in place. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I really like this product to darken my brows it&#x27;s not too dark. It also lengthens your lashes, and makes them look naturally long vs. the look of mascara.  I am very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I like using tinted gel instead of mascara. It looks more natural, and doesn&#x27;t clump or smudge. The tint darkens the ends of your real lashes, allowing the full length of them to be seen.</li>
