            <li> I have been a steady buyer of Listerine for years and years. I recently purchased Scope Dual Blast Fresh Mint Blast Mouthwash for my son.  Unfortunately, his gums became inflamed and the dentist said the mouthwash was the probably culprit.  I can&#x27;t blame the product alone because obviously many people use it problem free. I just thought that awareness was a good thing and for those that might be sensitive, you might want to look at other options.</li>
            <li> I feel amazing going about my day knowing there are little soldiers in my mouth fighting off bad germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Scope, I have an extra pep in my step!</li>
            <li> Scope Dualblast Mouthwash is wonderful. It helps remove phlegm and in general the early morning symptoms of gastric esophageal reflux. Highly recommended. Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive if you use the free-shipping option. Delivery was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, but you know it&#x27;s working.  Scope knocked it out of the park with this one, so refreshing.</li>
            <li> This product is nice for a quick hit of freshness.  If your breath is particularly offensive, you may want to consider something stronger.  But for a shot of mintyness (is that even a word???) this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love the Scope mouthwash, it gave me a long lasting fresh taste. I also used it with the crest toothpaste that also have Scope in it and it works even better!</li>
            <li> I love it. I bought it for work and its a quick mouth wash. I also think the size its perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> Taste like blahg, trying this out but did not like it.&lt;br /&gt;Sticking with my Crest Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves strong after taste.</li>
            <li> Burns my face up with crazy minty flavor. Exactly what I want. Scope does the trick on my stink mouth. Probably will yours too.</li>
            <li> This is mouthwash, nothing more to it. I got this after coupon for $2 otherwise, I would stick with the generic brand I buy at Costco. Both freshen my breath and kill germs.</li>
            <li> It is mouth wash.  It is minty and it seems to work killing germs and bad breath.  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> This really gets rid of the garlic odor you ate for lunch.  Gave to husband to take to work</li>
            <li> Got this when it was a special and had a coupon. Less than two bucks, delivered to my door for this sized bottle can&#x27;t be beat. Good product; been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Good mouthwash.  It&#x27;s probably cheaper just to buy when you are at a store.</li>
            <li> I GIVE ONE TO MY UNCLE AND HE LOVE IT , HE SAID IT WORKS PERFECTLY, MY NEPHEW SAID WOW HIS BREATHE IS FRESH</li>
            <li> IT DOES LAST LONG FOR ME LAUGH OUI LOUD, NUY OTHER THAN  THAT IYS OKAY. THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT THANKS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an adjustment going from an alcohol-free mouthwash to this stuff.  The first time, it&#x27;s like having fire in your mouth; you&#x27;ll get used to it.  Very noticable to what we&#x27;ve been using.  This fresh feeling really does last for the better part of the day, even with meals in between.  I love it.  If you want a mouthwash that CLEANS YOUR MOUTH, then this is the one.  Awesome flavor and no after taste, except minty fresh (confirmed by my wife).</li>
            <li> I have used this scope mouthwash forever now, I just started getting it added to my subscribe and save order, which makes it cheaper (and easier) to get it delivered through amazon. it is my favorite mouthwash, I have tried others, and not liked them as much, but I do think most are a lot like... I did write a review about another mouthwash that I need to update, because after using it for a while, I do not really like it as much, and I will be sticking with this one! it does everything a mouthwash should, and tastes great (for a mouthwash lol) and leaves your breath nice and fresh. recommended! also remember that you save on this if you get it through the subscribe and save option, which is even better!</li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash and it is way more effective in getting rid of raw onion smell as compared to listerine. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff tastes. Some mouthwashes are instantly a bad idea once they are in your mouth.  This one is quite nice and leaves your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> personally like the Listerine better</li>
            <li> Great mouth wash. I like because it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash works well but it leaves my mouth feeling and tasting weird, as if I washed with extra hot water. It night be too strong for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great tasting mouthwash.  It also does what it promises.  I will buy this product again because my kids actually use it.</li>
