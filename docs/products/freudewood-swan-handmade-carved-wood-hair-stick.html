            <li>However, it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>These are the best hair sticks ever!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Came in beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li>one can see a swan.&lt;br /&gt;Has been quite sturdy and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it.</li>
            <li>but this does great.</li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>My hair does not fall out and the material these hair sticks are made out of is really nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely weighted</li>
            <li>I did not give it 5 stars as I would have preferred a bit more detail or perhaps more depth in the carving but still a very nice chopstick indeed.  </li>
            <li>but this one is very strong and holds up nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is well-made, useful and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Beautiful hand carved wood, its a very nice accent piece, and the carved portion is a bit longer than simple toppers.</li>
            <li>so it is very comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>Recommended :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this hair</li>
            <li>This is truly a love hair piece.</li>
            <li>Wish they sold these as a set...not sure who uses just one???</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as elegant as what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I also love the swan design as it gives an elegant appeal to my hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this.  </li>
            <li>The length is perfect even though my daughter&#x27;s hair is approaching her knees so it has been thoroughly tested out.</li>
            <li>The carving is lovely.</li>
            <li>And the best part is I have gotten more compliments on this stick than any other one that I have owned.</li>
            <li>It is not only functional but also beautiful.</li>
            <li>This hair stick is beautiful, graceful and sturdy enough to hold all my hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair accessories can often slip out of my hair because it&#x27;s so baby fine</li>
            <li>the stick is light in weight (although strong and durable)</li>
            <li>stick - it works very well and is the prettiest one I own.  </li>
            <li>The angles and edges aren&#x27;t as smooth and the stick isn&#x27;t as well lacquered as the one shown.  </li>
            <li>The finish is quite smooth</li>
            <li>Totally cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this numerous times in the last month or two and it has held up wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful and heavy hair stick.</li>
            <li>It is also really pretty and well made.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as dark as shown in the picture, but that didn&#x27;t bother me, since you can see the details of the swan more clearly and from a greater distance.</li>
            <li>It is slightly bowed in the middle which makes it easier to use and more effective.  </li>
            <li>It really is quite beautiful - simplistic but elegant and definitely functional.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a decent hair stick for the price</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is very difficult to find anything to hold my hair, but these work amazing.</li>
            <li>Sturdy but not heavy.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit longer because I have a lot of hair when it&#x27;s twisted up, but otherwise this is a splendid little hair stick, solidly made and pretty when in place.</li>

            <li> I bought this wood hair stick slightly hesitant it wouldn&#x27;t work. However, it worked perfectly! I have very long thing hair (hip length) and I twisted it up and stuck this in. It kept my hair up all day. It is also really pretty and well made. Recommended :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this hair stick - it works very well and is the prettiest one I own.  Everyone compliments it.  It is well-made, useful and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Product listed with a gift box. Product arrived in a plain plastic wrapper. Disapponting.</li>
            <li> This is truly a love hair piece. I was always using spare pencils in junk drawers and finally decided to buy something proper. It is not only functional but also beautiful.</li>
            <li> Wish they sold these as a set...not sure who uses just one??? I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> The one I received isn&#x27;t the same quality as the one pictured.  The angles and edges aren&#x27;t as smooth and the stick isn&#x27;t as well lacquered as the one shown.  The wood used in the one I received is also a few shades lighter, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.  It&#x27;s still a decent hair stick for the price but it isn&#x27;t as elegant as what I was expecting.  I would buy from the company/band again though.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and heavy hair stick. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair sticks ever!!! I bought two of them. I have fine hair and it is very difficult to find anything to hold my hair, but these work amazing. My hair does not fall out and the material these hair sticks are made out of is really nice. I also love the swan design as it gives an elegant appeal to my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hand carved wood, its a very nice accent piece, and the carved portion is a bit longer than simple toppers.</li>
            <li> I really love this.  It&#x27;s actually hand-carved.  Totally cool.</li>
            <li> Came in beautiful packaging. Was tied up in a pink box with a bow. Arrived undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailing is just like the image. one can see a swan.&lt;br /&gt;Has been quite sturdy and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for one of my daughters to add to her collection of chopsticks for her hair.  It really is quite beautiful - simplistic but elegant and definitely functional.  I did not give it 5 stars as I would have preferred a bit more detail or perhaps more depth in the carving but still a very nice chopstick indeed.  The finish is quite smooth so there is no pulling or sagging and the stick is light in weight (although strong and durable) so it is very comfortable to wear.  The length is perfect even though my daughter&#x27;s hair is approaching her knees so it has been thoroughly tested out.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit longer because I have a lot of hair when it&#x27;s twisted up, but otherwise this is a splendid little hair stick, solidly made and pretty when in place.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  A little long for my purpose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this numerous times in the last month or two and it has held up wonderfully.  I like that it is wood because a lot of plastic items will cause skin irritation for me.  The carving is lovely.</li>
            <li> I like this hair stick a lot. It&#x27;s not quite as dark as shown in the picture, but that didn&#x27;t bother me, since you can see the details of the swan more clearly and from a greater distance. It&#x27;s nicely weighted and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the edges of the wood being unfinished. I&#x27;ve used this in my hair a couple of times, and it works well each time.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair.  This hair stick is beautiful, graceful and sturdy enough to hold all my hair.  It is slightly bowed in the middle which makes it easier to use and more effective.  I tend to snap hair sticks all the time because my hair is so thick but this one is very strong and holds up nicely.  And the best part is I have gotten more compliments on this stick than any other one that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just the right length &amp; holds my thin hair well. Hair accessories can often slip out of my hair because it&#x27;s so baby fine but this does great. Sturdy but not heavy.</li>
