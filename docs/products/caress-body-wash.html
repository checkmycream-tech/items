            <li>Love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the sent.  </li>
            <li>I truly LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Frankly I love the smell, but just not on my sweater.</li>
            <li>I have three favorite brands and one of them is Caress.  </li>

            <li>Very rich and inviting.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super sensual and sexy.</li>
            <li>The heading says Scarlet Blossom - the Patchouli dominates the body wash and you end up smelling like a cheap used car salesman.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I needed some body wash, and this was such a great price.</li>
            <li>I love it and the price is right.</li>
            <li>My husband likes to smell my skin right after a shower, so what more need be said?</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>and i enjoyed the product very much.</li>
            <li>Nice, lush smell--more fruity than floral, to my nose.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t too sweet and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals to me.  </li>
            <li>The scent is exotic and very sensual, makes you feel feminine and leaves your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>but this was not my favorite though it was a nice scent but didn&#x27;t seem to stay with me once dry.</li>
            <li>This smells great and wintery, but it&#x27;s a little globby coming out.  </li>
            <li>Love the product but the shipper needs to do a little better.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is no stinker.  </li>

            <li>This is an enjoyable change from the usual favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few of Caress body wash and they all smell and feel good.</li>
            <li>Makes you smell great,body soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to open and hold.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon with subscribe and save is a real bargain</li>
            <li>It works well and lathers up well, but the smell isn&#x27;t really what I thought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off quite as fast as others, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This body wash is fantastic and as a prior reviewer said, \\&quot;It smells SO freakin&#x27; good!\\</li>
            <li>The scent is warm, sensual, but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Whatever the scent of the mysterious &amp;#34;scarlet blossom,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not overly sweet</li>
            <li>I shopped 3 main stores with no luck.</li>
            <li>But when the next box arrived it was worth the persistence...</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you&#x27;re not too sensitive to strongly perfumed body washes (or if you are, only use it occasionally like I do).</li>
            <li>But, the fragrance is far too strong and heavy for my taste.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t attract unicorns with your post-shower scent unless you come by it naturally.</li>
            <li>but has a scent like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>this body wash leaves a lingering soft fragrance on your skin after you have showered.</li>
            <li>Although I really like the subtle scent that lingers on my skin afterward, it is strongly scented out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The body wash does not dry my skin out and makes a creamy lather when using my puff.</li>
            <li>It generally comes out all in one big glob.  </li>

            <li> This smells soooo good!...I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for a few weeks now and I am still In Love with how it smells on my skin!...It&#x27;s so intoxicating!..I hope they continue this scent b/c it smells and lathers like a dream!...</li>
            <li> This smells great and wintery, but it&#x27;s a little globby coming out.  It&#x27;s difficult to get just a little bit.  It generally comes out all in one big glob.  I probably won&#x27;t re-order it.</li>
            <li> I love...... the smell of blossoms! This body wash creates the perfect shower suds. I feel invigorated each time I use it. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is no stinker.  Nice, lush smell--more fruity than floral, to my nose.  But my nose doesn&#x27;t always know.  Whatever the scent of the mysterious &amp;#34;scarlet blossom,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not overly sweet (maybe with some amber or sandalwood in it to balance the sweetness).  It&#x27;s feminine, without being too little girlish.  You won&#x27;t attract unicorns with your post-shower scent unless you come by it naturally.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash and it lathers up beautifully.  The price on Amazon with subscribe and save is a real bargain and I don&#x27;t have to make a trip out to get it.</li>
            <li> the plastic container of this product is terrific.  It is easy to open and hold.  But, the fragrance is far too strong and heavy for my taste.  i will not purchase this fragrance again but would try another if offered.</li>
            <li> Smells great and for a good price.  Makes your skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Sheer Twilight, but I was looking to try something different and decided to give the Scarlet Blossom a shot.  The texture, lather and scent are all really nice and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  Although I really like the subtle scent that lingers on my skin afterward, it is strongly scented out of the bottle. For that reason I can only use it occasionally so as not to become turned off.  I recommend it if you&#x27;re not too sensitive to strongly perfumed body washes (or if you are, only use it occasionally like I do).</li>
            <li> Awesome  fragrance and soft skin. I love it and the price is right. I would recommend to anyone. Will be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> Arrived frozen causing contents to spill into the plastic bage holding the items #of these) Was able to salvage most of the product.</li>
            <li> Considering this is a more &amp;#34;budget body wash,&amp;#34; I was very impressed with the quality. The smell sticks around and you don&#x27;t have to use an absurd amount to get it to do so.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this product. The first I tried this body wash, I was afraid it may irritate my skin because of the fragrances; but it was gentle to my skin. I have tried a few of Caress body wash and they all smell and feel good.</li>
            <li> Smells HORRIBLE! The heading says Scarlet Blossom - the Patchouli dominates the body wash and you end up smelling like a cheap used car salesman. I threw it out as soon as I smelled it in the shower. Waste of money! Women, AVOID - gag!</li>
            <li> comes out like Jell-O. doesn&#x27;t stick well.</li>
            <li> omg! I&#x27;ve been purchasing this stuff forever and all of a sudden they stop selling it in the local drug stores! I went from Rite Aid, to CVS, and Wallgreens lookin for it! I don&#x27;t care for any of the other scents in the Caress line, only this one and I&#x27;m stoked that you all carry it!</li>
            <li> smells very wonderful and is a very large size and i enjoyed the product very much. alot cheaper than you can get in the store</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday present and I love the sent.  I shopped 3 main stores with no luck. I had my Aunt looking around,too. I was over joyed when I found this on Amazon,  I love it!</li>
            <li> After the initial mess with the first shipment, being only a partial order, and having the only bottle sent get here empty I was skeptical. But when the next box arrived it was worth the persistence... I truly LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Too expensive after shipping</li>
            <li> Cleans like you&#x27;d expect.  No exfoliating beads or anything, just simple liquid (moisturizing) soap... but has a scent like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the shipper needs to do a little better. Ordered 2 bottles and when I received them, one had leaked totally in the box. So you don&#x27;t save any money here.</li>
            <li> When the shipment arrived the bottle was cracked at the bottom and everything else in my order smelled like the fragerence.  Frankly I love the smell, but just not on my sweater.</li>
            <li> Feel spotless and feel invigorated  and the scent is amazing. won&#x27;t want to ever use a different brand or scent ever again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super sensual and sexy. Very rich and inviting. My husband likes to smell my skin right after a shower, so what more need be said? ;)</li>
            <li> I have three favorite brands and one of them is Caress.  I have found many scents I truly love but this was not my favorite though it was a nice scent but didn&#x27;t seem to stay with me once dry.</li>
            <li> This shower gel smells sooo wonderful. I buy it monthly. If they ever take it off subscribe and save I hope they have something equally as great to take it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell great,body soft, and clean. I have it in the bathroom, and the kitchen,greAt smell I have it on my subscribe and save so I can continue to get it without looking it up.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I needed some body wash, and this was such a great price. It works well and lathers up well, but the smell isn&#x27;t really what I thought. I expected a floral, girly scent, but this almost has a masculine smell. My husband agrees. It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about fragrance.  This is an enjoyable change from the usual favorite.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t too sweet and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals to me.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off quite as fast as others, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This body wash is fantastic and as a prior reviewer said, \\&quot;It smells SO freakin&#x27; good!\\&quot; I don&#x27;t wear perfume after showering with this body wash - there is no need. The scent is warm, sensual, but not too heavy. The body wash does not dry my skin out and makes a creamy lather when using my puff. I do have to admit that the dark red color of the body wash was a little off-putting the first couple of times I used it. I kept thinking of Norman Bates, but I got over it and I keep ordering more of the stuff. This one is a favorite!</li>
            <li> What can I say... this body wash leaves a lingering soft fragrance on your skin after you have showered. The scent is exotic and very sensual, makes you feel feminine and leaves your skin moisturized. I would definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
