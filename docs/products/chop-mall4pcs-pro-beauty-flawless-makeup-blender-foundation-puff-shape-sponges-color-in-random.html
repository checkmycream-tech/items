            <li>I have the name brand ones, works just as good.</li>
            <li>They said the quality isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>but my daughter still loved the gift.  </li>
            <li>Took forever to ship, but they are in good condition.  </li>

            <li>Great for blending makeup and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleased with what I got, I love them!</li>
            <li>The yellow is a beautiful bright</li>
            <li>Soft and very good with foundation application or just dabbing on a setting powder.  </li>
            <li>These blenders are perfect for applying your foundation - I have ordered these several times!!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THESE AND WILL GET SOME MORE...</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering scores more.</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing this item twice that way you have a good punt of beauty blenders ready to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used my fingers or brushes to smooth out my make-up, but nothing&#x27;s ever done it as flawlessly or as smoothly as these.</li>
            <li>applies makeup smoothly</li>
            <li>Great for you daily use of make up</li>
            <li>The last longer and work great at putting on serums, lotions, and balms, as well as make-up.</li>
            <li>So far I have used one of these and seems to be good</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cool tho.</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not expensive because they are cheap made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite the same as a beauty blender but these blenders are pretty decent...really good for the price.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li>Great bargain compared to more expensive sponges.</li>
            <li>I dont really like the material!</li>
            <li>I actually like these better than the pricey beauty blender.</li>
            <li>They have a bit of an smell when you first take them out of the package, but that disappears after airing them out.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smaller than previous ones I&#x27;ve bought but still work great.</li>
            <li>just be really gentle.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really work when you soak it and wring it out.</li>
            <li>Thanks I got all sizes from you &amp; colors.  </li>
            <li>OK, but too too long to receive and better off just buying at local store for similar price.</li>
            <li>I can get more at Wal-Mart for the same price and not have to wait a long time for them to get here</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product and it arrived way earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>Sponges are smaller than most beauty blender but they work just as well as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Finally got them thanks!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as soft.</li>
            <li>These are so big I could have had personal fun with them</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m highly upset because I only received 3 pieces when it clearly stated it was a set of 4.</li>
            <li>overall decent quality product.</li>

            <li> Bought these for my daughters and they didn&#x27;t like them. They said the quality isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> I received these 3 weeks after ordering, it took a while but I&#x27;m pleased with what I got, I love them! They work great for applying foundation and blending :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smaller than previous ones I&#x27;ve bought but still work great.</li>
            <li> I just received my order, I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I&#x27;m highly upset because I only received 3 pieces when it clearly stated it was a set of 4.</li>
            <li> These are so big I could have had personal fun with them</li>
            <li> I only received 2 of the four pieces. I did not receive the screw driver like pieces.</li>
            <li> This arrived after Christmas but my daughter still loved the gift.  These are great</li>
            <li> These are okay. You get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> Took forever to ship, but they are in good condition.  Just as pictured, great price can&#x27;t wait to use!</li>
            <li> Soft and very good with foundation application or just dabbing on a setting powder.  Received earlier by 2 weeks than expected.  Thanks I got all sizes from you &amp; colors.  The yellow is a beautiful bright and I&#x27;ll make that my summer applicator just to switch them up and give each a rest for longevity.</li>
            <li> OK, but too too long to receive and better off just buying at local store for similar price.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a dupe for the beauty blender but it isn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t expand when wet and it&#x27;s not as soft.</li>
            <li> They are really hard and are not that flexible</li>
            <li> The sponge is too hard.</li>
            <li> Great for blending makeup and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> To expensive for the money.  One time use sponges. I can get more at Wal-Mart for the same price and not have to wait a long time for them to get here</li>
            <li> I dont really like the material!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite the same as a beauty blender but these blenders are pretty decent...really good for the price. I don&#x27;t wear foundation - just BB cream and bronzer...this is great for blending my concealer though.</li>
            <li> I actually like these better than the pricey beauty blender. The last longer and work great at putting on serums, lotions, and balms, as well as make-up. They have a bit of an smell when you first take them out of the package, but that disappears after airing them out.</li>
            <li> No problems, received on time!</li>
            <li> The Mrs. loves them. Will be ordering scores more.</li>
            <li> Is to hard&lt;br /&gt;Is not like a beauty blender</li>
            <li> Same product being sold in stores for 4.00 dollars a piece. This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product and it arrived way earlier than I expected. The sizes are perfect and they apply my foundations, concealers, and tinted moisturizers flawlessly! Great bargain compared to more expensive sponges.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work the same as a beauty blender!! Buyers beware..</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be a LITTLE softer. Even after wetting, they&#x27;re very hard and don&#x27;t get much bigger when you wet them. Maybe I got a defective set (?)</li>
            <li> Finally got them thanks!</li>
