            <li>You already have the best design in a razor.</li>
            <li>and you will find thousands of women weeping over the disappearance of the best razor they ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the Schick company comes to its senses and reinstates this wonderful product during that time.  </li>

            <li>It grieves me that all the best products that everyone wants stop being made.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find them on Amazon and had to read many of these great reviews to my husband to prove I am not the only one who thinks the PT is the best.  </li>
            <li>This razor is the BEST razor on the market, and the company needs to bring it back</li>
            <li>after a 4 day search I was able to call schick @ 1-800-Shavers, THIS ITEM IS NOT DISCOUNTUNUED</li>
            <li>This razor has been my favorite for 30+ yrs.</li>
            <li>[...] My husband doesn&#x27;t get it, but I know you ladies out there in similar situations will be as happy as I am!</li>
            <li>Slap on some new colors (a wall mount would be great) and sell away.</li>
            <li>Slap on some new colors (a wall mount would be great) and sell away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and love how smoothly they shave my legs with no worry of nicks or cuts in shin bone area, etc.  </li>
            <li>After three years of being with out this razor I finally found one online and am so excited to again have the best razor again.  </li>
            <li>It is in great shape and packaged professionally.</li>
            <li>Just like the other comments, it is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It gives the closest, pain free shave you could ever want.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU Amazon for keeping these blades available as SCHICK</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product, as it was not avalable at any of my local stores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Therese and Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>But Amazon&#x27;s prices are the best I&#x27;ve found so far, so as long as Shick makes &#x27;em and Amazon stocks</li>
            <li>I second what all the ladies have been saying about the BEST PERSONAL RAZOR EVER MADE FOR WOMEN!</li>
            <li>Personal Touch is the best and replacement cartridges are no where to be found locally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had both my PT razors for many years and keep finding new sources for blade cartridges.  </li>
            <li>This is the best, and i agree with the other women on this site, and Schick needs to bring it back.</li>
            <li>I agree with Reviewer from Stamford CT in advising Schick to stop exploring other designs, and support their best product:  Personal Touch razor for women.  </li>
            <li>Even if i am in a rush and shaving too fast, i still do not nick or cut myself, something that has happened many times with the many other inferior razors.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll be happy again when I get my Personal Touch back.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Personal Touch.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>were the only replacement blades we can find of which she is satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY razor that provides a smooth shave without the worries about nicks and skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s reviews, I found Therese&#x27;s review of the blades and her tip on where to find the razor, so I just ordered one.</li>
            <li>You can shave as fast as you can go with the PT and still not nick yourself.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most of the other reviews i did not grow up using this razor.</li>
            <li>This personal touch razor was designed in the 1970&#x27;s and they never changed the original formula for making the razor/blades.</li>
            <li>I, like many of the other reviewers have been using my PT since it came on the market.  </li>
            <li>I still have mine and after fifteen to twenty years it looks brand new!</li>
            <li>I still have mine and after fifteen to twenty years it looks brand new!</li>
            <li>I would rather pay a couple more pennies and get a quality razor than pay less for nothing.</li>
            <li>I saw all the reviews and in search of something with less blades and a better price tag, bought this one.</li>
            <li>I was recently able to replace the razor (and one blade) at a discount store recently after forcing my blades onto a generic razor.</li>
            <li>case Schick foolishly does away with this classic product....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone searching for a quality razor.</li>
            <li>The cost compared to a lot of newer razor handles and \\&quot;high performance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of newer razors, having no other recourse, and they ALL stink!!!!  </li>
            <li>Stop spending all your money in new product design and give it to me for telling you</li>
            <li>Are drugstores ordering inferior products in ice-cream colors designed to lure indiscriminate new razor users?  </li>
            <li>Stop spending all your money in new product design and give it to me for telling you</li>
            <li>I very much hope that Schick reads these reviews and will bring this razor back!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been telling me it&#x27;s too old and to find a new one.  </li>
            <li>Please be careful if you insist on using this razor, and i am horrified that they are still available at all, as i know i was not the only person this happened to.</li>
            <li>But now, thanks to online buying, I&#x27;m back in business again.</li>
            <li>I have been using them since the 8th grade and now am 37 years old.</li>
            <li>, wow I am old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have no desire to try any of the (too expensive and cheap-looking, trendy) new razors.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found some remaining Personal Touch products on-line and have purchased enough to last me at least 6 years.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for the Personal Touch Razors.  </li>
            <li>Ask any 30 or 20 year old what razor she learned to shave on, the answer will be a Personal Touch.</li>

            <li> I have looked \\&quot;high and low\\&quot; to find the refill cartridges in my area and have been unable to do so.  </li>
            <li> so this was a surprise), and not a clean shave on either.</li>
            <li> This search forced me to try Schicks newer produts, in addition to products by every other razor company on the market.</li>
            <li> I did my usual prepping and shaving.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed and will probably just let my sister have it</li>
            <li> The new products are clumsy, awkward and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I too have been using it for decades - maybe even since the late 70s when it came out.</li>
            <li> With an 8-pack costing less than a dollar per cartridge at some sites, you can&#x27;t go wrong.    </li>
            <li> The Venus is super expensive and the shave doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare!!!!  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t shave very hard</li>
            <li> The new ones are horrible.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I noticed that my legs were irritated after the shave.</li>
            <li> Are they CRAZY??</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy and WHY???</li>
            <li> Silly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that this product line is being phased out by Schick since is is so very difficult to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> I just hate them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unlike most of the other reviews i did not grow up using this razor. When i started shaving i tried every razor on the market, then my mother bought me a Personal Touch Razor, and i have been using it ever since. I was forced to search for a new razor a year ago after i left my razor in a london hotel room. This search forced me to try Schicks newer produts, in addition to products by every other razor company on the market. NOTHING COMPARES to the personal touch. This razor is the BEST razor on the market, and the company needs to bring it back it is without fault. Even if i am in a rush and shaving too fast, i still do not nick or cut myself, something that has happened many times with the many other inferior razors. There is no comparison when it comes to this debate. This is the best, and i agree with the other women on this site, and Schick needs to bring it back.</li>
            <li> I want to thank Therese Davis for her helpful tip on finding the Personal Touch razor at Hocks.com. Thanks so much! I too have been using my Personal Touch razor for over 20 years (I am now 39). It is the ONLY razor that provides a smooth shave without the worries about nicks and skin irritation. I LOVE my Personal Touch. I needed a second one because we redid our bathroom and have a separate bath and shower, so I wanted a razor for each. I&#x27;ve wanted a second one for months since we finished the bathroom, but I could not find another Personal Touch, only the blades! Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s reviews, I found Therese&#x27;s review of the blades and her tip on where to find the razor, so I just ordered one. What a relief! I wish Schick would wake up and smell the razor burn! NO OTHER razor works as well as Personal Touch. I&#x27;ve tried them all and they all end up in the garbage. I will never give up my Personal Touch. Thanks Therese and Amazon!!! Tina in Ohio</li>
            <li> Schick I have a message for you... Stop spending all your money in new product design and give it to me for telling you You already have the best design in a razor. Ask any 30 or 20 year old what razor she learned to shave on, the answer will be a Personal Touch. Slap on some new colors (a wall mount would be great) and sell away. If you don&#x27;t take my advise I beseach you not to discounting the cartridges. I still have mine and after fifteen to twenty years it looks brand new! And I haven&#x27;t lost my Touch in shaving with it. No NICKS EVER.</li>
            <li> Message for Schick:  Bring the Personal Touch Razor back on the market.  I can&#x27;t find any other razor to even compare to my old faithful \\&quot;Personal Touch\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li> I second what all the ladies have been saying about the BEST PERSONAL RAZOR EVER MADE FOR WOMEN! I too have been using it for decades - maybe even since the late 70s when it came out. I never switched. Then suddenly could not find the refills. I was totally dismayed. But now, thanks to online buying, I&#x27;m back in business again. I had thrown my last one out when I couldn&#x27;t get refills so just ordered another Personal Touch with blades. It gives the closest, pain free shave you could ever want. I too tried the newer stuff WHICH IS JUNK! I just hate them. So I&#x27;ll be happy again when I get my Personal Touch back. Glad to see I was not the only one so impressed with this wonderful ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 5 years since I bought my last pack of refill blades for my Personal Touch razor, on clearance at Walmart.  I used my Personal Touch for over 30 years and I can&#x27;t bear to throw the blades out, let alone the razors.  I keep hoping they bring them back. I&#x27;ve tried a number of newer razors, having no other recourse, and they ALL stink!!!!  I just don&#x27;t understand why they stopped making the Personal Touch.  Just do a Google search and you will find thousands of women weeping over the disappearance of the best razor they ever owned.  Please bring it back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Personal Touch for twenty five years.  I have been using my last refill blade for months and finally went online to search for some more as I have been unable to find them anywhere.  I am thrilled to find them on Amazon and had to read many of these great reviews to my husband to prove I am not the only one who thinks the PT is the best.  He&#x27;s been telling me it&#x27;s too old and to find a new one.  The new ones are horrible.  Uncomfortable to hold on to and do not provide a close and nick free shave.  You can shave as fast as you can go with the PT and still not nick yourself.  Schick, bring back the Personal Touch!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I also have been shaving with my Personal Touch razor for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ve had to replace the handle a few times only because I&#x27;ve lost/left them somewhere.  I have tried some of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; razors and concur with all the other reviewers--Personal Touch is the best and replacement cartridges are no where to be found locally.  THANK YOU Amazon for keeping these blades available as SCHICK has no idea what they are doing by discontinuing this line of razors.  I was already a repeat customer--you&#x27;ve now just strengthen this customer&#x27;s loyalty to you.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for the Personal Touch Razors.  I&#x27;m assuming that this product line is being phased out by Schick since is is so very difficult to find in retail stores.  In my opinion the \\&quot;new\\&quot; items that Schick has placed on the market are patently inferior to the Personal Touch product.  The new products are clumsy, awkward and flimsy.  I was thrilled when I found some remaining Personal Touch products on-line and have purchased enough to last me at least 6 years.  I&#x27;m hoping that the Schick company comes to its senses and reinstates this wonderful product during that time.  I can understand wanting to upgrade a product line, but to replace it with an inferior product?  I really do not understand that logic.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Schick Personal Touch Razors are no where to be found in the retail market. I was recently able to replace the razor (and one blade) at a discount store recently after forcing my blades onto a generic razor. Finally I can have it all - I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and NOTHING compares to the Personal Touch. I have been using them since the 8th grade and now am 37 years old. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> What does it take to get this razor back in the stores? Just like the other comments, it is the best razor I have ever used. Is Schick losing money on it because of it&#x27;s efficiency and durability? Could that be why poor quality razors are only available for the same price? I would rather pay a couple more pennies and get a quality razor than pay less for nothing. &lt;br /&gt;Please return the Personal Touch razor to the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and love how smoothly they shave my legs with no worry of nicks or cuts in shin bone area, etc.  I&#x27;ve never found another razor that does as good a job.</li>
            <li> This personal touch razor was designed in the 1970&#x27;s and they never changed the original formula for making the razor/blades. The blades are brittle and the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; strip  can break with as little pressure as it takes to shave your legs, leaving you subject to injury from a straight razor blade.  This happened to me, and i had 27 stiches 18 external and 9 internal to hold the wound shut which was about 6 inches long, and an inch deep. I have a permanent scar on my calf.  This was all proven in a court of law...i won a lawsuit against Schick. Please be careful if you insist on using this razor, and i am horrified that they are still available at all, as i know i was not the only person this happened to.</li>
            <li> I agree with Reviewer from Stamford CT in advising Schick to stop exploring other designs, and support their best product:  Personal Touch razor for women.  Cartridges are harder than ever to find in &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; drugstores:  Has Schick discontinued production?  Foolish!  Are drugstores ordering inferior products in ice-cream colors designed to lure indiscriminate new razor users?  Silly!  I&#x27;ve had both my PT razors for many years and keep finding new sources for blade cartridges.  But Amazon&#x27;s prices are the best I&#x27;ve found so far, so as long as Shick makes &#x27;em and Amazon stocks &#x27;em, I&#x27;ll be back to buy &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> After three years of being with out this razor I finally found one online and am so excited to again have the best razor again.  Since I lost my previous razor three years ago I finally broke down and bought the Venus.  The Venus is super expensive and the shave doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare!!!!  I very much hope that Schick reads these reviews and will bring this razor back!</li>
            <li> Schick I have a message for you... Stop spending all your money in new product design and give it to me for telling you You already have the best design in a razor. Ask any 30 or 20 year old what razor she learned to shave on, the answer will be a Personal Touch. Slap on some new colors (a wall mount would be great) and sell away. If you don&#x27;t take my advise I beseach you not to discounting the cartridges. I still have mine and after fifteen to twenty years it looks brand new! And I haven&#x27;t lost my Touch in shaving with it. No NICKS EVER.</li>
            <li> after a 4 day search I was able to call schick @ 1-800-Shavers, THIS ITEM IS NOT DISCOUNTUNUED they still make it but its up to your local store whether or not they want to carry it!! &lt;br /&gt;You can buy the razor for $3 and the refills from either:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;[...]    &lt;br /&gt;[...]    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most walmarts have the refill cartiges. &lt;br /&gt;Call schick and tell them to promote this item again!! It was introduced in 1977 and people are still using it, this is something good!! Revisit this razor you all!!</li>
            <li> I have looked \\&quot;high and low\\&quot; to find the refill cartridges in my area and have been unable to do so.  I, like many of the other reviewers have been using my PT since it came on the market.  As long as I can get the refills I will NEVER use another razor! &lt;br /&gt;Thanks again! &lt;br /&gt;Emma  &lt;br /&gt;Raleigh, NC</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product, as it was not avalable at any of my local stores.  The product arrived in great shape.</li>
            <li> My wife loves her Schick Personal Touch razor and these were the only replacement blades we can find of which she is satisfied.</li>
            <li> good quality, though overpriced since it&#x27;s out of production..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and when I recently went to buy refill catridges, no one had them anymore. Thank goodness Amazon sells them.</li>
            <li> I finally found Personal Touch razor cartridges for sale here on Amazon.  I have looked everywhere for them as they are no longer sold in any brick and mortar stores in our area.</li>
            <li> WHY has Schick stopped selling these??? Are they CRAZY?? I have been using this for years also and it IS the BEST razor out there!! Come on girls, if we ALL email Schick, maybe they will bring them back!!</li>
            <li> I wish Schick would make these again.  This razor has been my favorite for 30+ yrs., wow I am old.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the turn around time in which I received my item. It is in great shape and packaged professionally. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor out there. I have been using it for over 15 years and I love it! No razor burn, no cuts, no red bumps. The blade lasts forever so refills last awhile. I was happy using this razor until the metal part that holds the razor broke. I guess after 15 years it had served me well. I went to the store to buy another one and couldn&#x27;t find it. Turns out every store I went to didn&#x27;t carry it anymore. I bought that Intuition razor-crap let me tell you. [...] My husband doesn&#x27;t get it, but I know you ladies out there in similar situations will be as happy as I am! I bought two just in case this next one breaks in 15 years and I am stuck again. Good luck and happy shaving! :)</li>
            <li> &#x27;Lo and Behold!  The Personal Touch Razor can be found AND purchased on line at hocks.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps everyone (like me) who had broken the razor, but still had many replacement blades (o:</li>
            <li> Love this razor!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have no desire to try any of the (too expensive and cheap-looking, trendy) new razors.  I, too, turned to the internet in desperation to restock cartridges.  My mom did find cartridges at Walmart just yesterday, surprisingly, but I also ordered some online.  I&#x27;m stocking up just in case Schick foolishly does away with this classic product....I highly recommend this product for anyone searching for a quality razor.</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews and in search of something with less blades and a better price tag, bought this one. The cost compared to a lot of newer razor handles and \\&quot;high performance disposables\\&quot; these days is a big plus. With an 8-pack costing less than a dollar per cartridge at some sites, you can&#x27;t go wrong.    When it came down to the SHAVE, my reaction was not as favorable as was with the value. I&#x27;m very careful because I have sensitive skin with coarse hair prone to in-growns. I did my usual prepping and shaving. Unfortunately, I noticed that my legs were irritated after the shave. The shave gel left my legs soft as usual but the blade left them covered in small red irritated bumps (I didn&#x27;t shave very hard so this was a surprise), and not a clean shave on either. I was pretty disappointed and will probably just let my sister have it so she quits using my regular shaver. Results may vary from person to person though. This is just my experience.</li>
            <li> I am 50 yrs old and used personal touch razors as long as I can remember, but frustrated because walmart hasn&#x27;t had refill cartridges in a long time. I don&#x27;t use credit cards so I can&#x27;t order on line. Tried other razors and can&#x27;t find one I like. Want my personal touch but can&#x27;t get refills. Is there another store that carries them, cause I&#x27;ve looked everywhere?</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I use!  Why did they stop making it?!! It grieves me that all the best products that everyone wants stop being made.  It&#x27;s crazy and WHY???</li>
