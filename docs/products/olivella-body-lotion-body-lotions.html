            <li>Smells nice, very mild.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it has a bit of a pickled smell, but if you love olives as i do you wont mind.  </li>
            <li>The top and be screwed off.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of L&#x27;Occitane 100% (unscented)</li>
            <li>scent is what I&#x27;m really in love with, had this lotion been thicker and more emollient</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be more moisturizing than I found it to be.</li>
            <li>Love this body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it does wonders, it hydrates well</li>
            <li>More liquid than most lotions are.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, It has a really great clean smell and goes on really smooth and light.</li>
            <li>The pump makes it easy to use and not greasy after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I bought a huge bottle of body wash with the citris smell</li>
            <li>Fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li>It is Dermatologically tested and paraben free.</li>
            <li>Covers well and keeps skin smooth for the day.  </li>
            <li>Silky and smooth, absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Could be a little thicker,  but still amazing how my skin feels and a very light and appealing fragrance.</li>
            <li>love the texture but the smell is absolutely pungent and nothing like the body wash.</li>
            <li>Olive oil is the second ingredient listed after water, so it does contain a fair amount of that.</li>
            <li>found this product a good way to help my dry skin and it helped with the asthma bumps too..</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed and leaves your skin elasticized and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It does not leave any noticeable scent once it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the large amount at such a great price.</li>
            <li>but you will need to apply it more than once a day if you are super dry.  </li>
            <li>It does smell like olive oil at first</li>
            <li>and your hands are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this first at the Biltmore on vacation...</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, soft scent of this lotion and was excited to see that for such a large bottle the price was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding emollient for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say to apply to lotion every day and gently massage into the skin.</li>
            <li>This body lotion is ok, but not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very calming and does not leave a greasy or sticky feel - or even that damp feeling you get from oatmeal based products.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice change from your usual lotion.</li>
            <li>This Body Lotion by Olivella is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it is very soft and i use it everyday.</li>
            <li>It is dispensed through a pump on the top of the container and it comes with a hard plastic cover to put over the dispenser.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself works amazingly in terms of hydration, especially when it comes to natural products, but I had to stop using after a few days due to the smell.</li>
            <li>It is not too thick or too light.</li>

            <li> This is the best very light lotion.  I use it on my face every night!</li>
            <li> I did not like the odor of this olive oil body lotion. Too bad we don&#x27;t have a scratch and sniff page. It smelled too heavy for my liking.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Very light and silky!</li>
            <li> Sorry but do not like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it has a bit of a pickled smell, but if you love olives as i do you wont mind.  Its doesnt take alot to cover entire body, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding emollient for dry skin.  It goes deep into skin layers with a non- sticky feel that leaves skin feeling renewed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lotion. The pump makes it easy to use and not greasy after you put it on. It does smell like olive oil at first but that goes away and your hands are smooth and soft. Im really happy and hope if you get it you will be too.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, It has a really great clean smell and goes on really smooth and light. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or sticky, yet it moisturizes really good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the soap. I will not be buying this again.  I expected it to smell like the soap.  It&#x27;s good on the skin though.  Feels good and pump is convenient</li>
            <li> This Body Lotion by Olivella is a high quality product. The lotion is made with 100% Virgin Olive Oil and other natural ingredients. It was anti-aging properties, containing Vitamins C and E. It is Dermatologically tested and paraben free. This container is 16.9 fluid ounces. It is dispensed through a pump on the top of the container and it comes with a hard plastic cover to put over the dispenser. The top and be screwed off. The container itself is plastic. The product is made in Italy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions on the back of the container are written in English, French, Italian and Russian. The instructions say to apply to lotion every day and gently massage into the skin. It is easily absorbed and leaves your skin elasticized and moisturized. It has very little scent. It smells like a very faint &amp;#34;linen&amp;#34; air freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the lotion is lightweight. It is not too thick or too light. It has a faint white/pale-green color. It does not leave any noticeable scent once it is absorbed into the skin. It is a great every day moisturizer. There is no stickiness or oil feel to the skin, after application. A little bit goes a long way. The manufacturers website is www.olivellaline.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommended this lotion. You get a lot for your money and with the quality of the product, it is a great value!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it is very soft and i use it everyday. It is a good buy will buy again.</li>
            <li> I keep reordering this one.....great product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful texture to lotion....not greasy.  Covers well and keeps skin smooth for the day.  Great buy and value for your money.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, soft scent of this lotion and was excited to see that for such a large bottle the price was quite reasonable. However, the lotion itself is quite thin and wasn&#x27;t nearly as moisturizing as I had hoped it would be. I use it on top of L&#x27;Occitane 100% (unscented) Shea butter because my skin needs the hydration and I don&#x27;t want to toss this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is what I&#x27;m really in love with, had this lotion been thicker and more emollient it would have been a 5 star bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought this first at the Biltmore on vacation...now I purchase from Amazon whoever I run out.</li>
            <li> A very good body lotion. It will be a staple.</li>
            <li> love the texture but the smell is absolutely pungent and nothing like the body wash. i almost wonder if it has been sitting on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> The product is great. My girlfriend and daughter in-law love it!!</li>
            <li> It a nice body lotion  I was expecting it to be more moisturizing than I found it to be.</li>
            <li> Love this body lotion.  Moisturizes my skin and heals dry cracked places on my feet.  I use it all over and it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Thank you for an exceptional deal and delivery!! I love this product it does wonders, it hydrates well and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  It is one of the best lotions on the market!!! THANK YOU AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells nice, very mild. Silky and smooth, absorbs well. I was surprised at the large amount at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Lovely!  Could be a little thicker,  but still amazing how my skin feels and a very light and appealing fragrance.</li>
            <li> found this product a good way to help my dry skin and it helped with the asthma bumps too..so I use it.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is ok, but not very moisturizing. Olive oil is the second ingredient listed after water, so it does contain a fair amount of that. But I found the lotion did not prevent my legs from feeling dry and scratchy. The lotion itself was rather thin and watery feeling. More liquid than most lotions are.</li>
            <li> Its very nice. Fresh and not too greasy or smelling bad. It does the job. I recommend it highly. Its a nice change from your usual lotion.</li>
            <li> I found out about this lotion and body wash from my girlfriend when we went shopping at Ross Dress for Less Store.  I bought a huge bottle of body wash with the citris smell and I mix it with some triple butter body wash by St. Ives to give me the extra lather and scent of vanilla.  I got the lotion for 8.99 and the body wash around the same price.  Lot cheaper than online.</li>
            <li> I have very dry itchy skin.  This lotion is very calming and does not leave a greasy or sticky feel - or even that damp feeling you get from oatmeal based products.  It is however very thin, watery almost.  It works great but you will need to apply it more than once a day if you are super dry.  Maybe carry a small bottle with you for problem areas.  I even use this on my face.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself works amazingly in terms of hydration, especially when it comes to natural products, but I had to stop using after a few days due to the smell. Several friends mentioned it smells rotten and I agree, but other didn&#x27;t mind at all-- might just be a personal thing.</li>
