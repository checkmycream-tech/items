            <li>Thanks for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>The seller coded it nicely so there were no problems with customs when crossing the border from USA to Canada.   </li>
            <li>but you can make your own.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t opened this gel yet to see how effective it is</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, shipped quickly and works wonders at an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>Great product exactly what I purchased at the dentist office and paid three times more.</li>
            <li>It will also do what many people have said.</li>
            <li>I get 3x&#x27;s more for the price</li>
            <li>One has to love the application of this stuff.</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably whiter after even just one application. :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never looked better.</li>
            <li>and they gave me some gel for monthly refreshing, which ran out</li>
            <li>I recommend it but make sure you research Opalescence PF35% to make sure</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I orginally got this from my dentist who charges a lot more for it.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years - top quality.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had known it was available online years ago, after getting cutom bleach trays made!</li>
            <li>i will be buying more as soon as i need it.</li>
            <li>used it twice and saw no need for more applications.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>but i love this product</li>
            <li>no whiter just hurt more ..</li>
            <li>and if course told me to toss that out .I would love to know if this happened to anyone else .I</li>
            <li>Love this whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>Much better than all the strips I have tried before.</li>
            <li>Better than the 12% dentist stuff.</li>
            <li>Much better than the toothpaste brands in the drugstores.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love these and love the price too</li>
            <li>and my teeth did not look any better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased and will return.</li>
            <li>Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Much better pricing than my dentist</li>
            <li>TRICK to using whitening tray&#x27;s is to make sure</li>
            <li>and I used GC Tooth Mousse as advised by many dentists because it is scientifically proven to protect tooth enamel.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for getting your teeth their whitest and then giving them an occasional whitening tune-up!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and amazing results!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this before and liked it very much!</li>
            <li>a brilliant white like I want.  </li>
            <li>Easily.</li>
            <li>Their customer service  department does not seem to make it easy to get any situations</li>
            <li>but you want to make sure that you are also practicing great oral hygiene and seeing your dentist regularly.</li>
            <li>I have Invisalign braces and as they work like tooth trays already, my ortho said I could easily whiten with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, fresh and delivered very timely.</li>
            <li>I think I needed the PF15% or something not at strong.  </li>
            <li>and this wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Do NOT use this stuff, 35% is way too strong.</li>
            <li>good product,  great service, very satisified with overall transaction.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was free, and it came in very quickly.</li>
            <li>The mint taste is fine.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that there is a huge difference in the product I received from my dentist and this product.</li>
            <li>You need to have customized tray made to fit your teeth.</li>
            <li>Great results already after 2nd treatment.</li>
            <li>do not feel this product should be available for home use.</li>
            <li>There was some light discolouration on my gums after each treatment.</li>
            <li>It is important to post treat your teeth</li>
            <li>These do the job, but very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like them at first because they are like a sticky gel, whereas the NiteWhite, which I was used to, was more like a toothpaste consistency.</li>
            <li>No expiration or sell by date or original packaging which is troubling.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly, as described and in damage free condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So easy to decide to use even right before going out.</li>
            <li>Using this right now!</li>
            <li>This is a great value and is exactly the same product they have at dentist office.</li>
            <li>A dental teeth tray would probably be a good idea to prevent irritation to the inner cheeks and gums.</li>
            <li>I will say that I&#x27;ve had exceptionally good whitening results with the product and received comments as to how white my teeth have become.</li>
            <li>Would recommend Cool Teeth Whitening (TM) in their replacement, although the packaging isn&#x27;t nearly as cool.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should not have kept it on for the full two hours, which was the time prescribed by my dentist for their gel.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest taking it easy at first</li>
            <li>It was just too strong for my mouth, burned my gums and made them very sore!  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, but probably not a full 35% -- more like 22%.  </li>
            <li>so this seemed like a good deal, especially since it&#x27;s (guaranteed fresh).</li>
            <li>Works quickly to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s 35% which whitens your teeth quickly.  </li>
            <li>this is a very good product and I have use several times, I live in Denmark and I get it very fast...</li>
            <li>However, the reason I bought this is because this seller stated New and Latest expiration dates.</li>
            <li>and this was fast, easy and affordable.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Im finishing up and is the same brand (Opalescence) and love this bleach!</li>
            <li>however your teeth would get coloured easily after this as i believe it removes an important natural protective layer from the teeth.</li>
            <li>However, this stuff is brutally strong so make sure you keep it off your gums as much as possible.</li>
            <li>the difference is amazing, I have white teeth.  </li>
            <li>35% Teeth Whitening 12 pk Mint with COLOR CHART (GUARANTEED FRESH)]]</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li>Product advertised as being guaranteed fresh.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I found it on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
            <li>So I figured it was fresh .Day</li>
            <li>Good results and much cheeper than going through your local dentist office.</li>
            <li>Continuing a personal teeth whitening routine, using custom-fitted forms, and these Opalescence syringes are handy for applying the gel to the forms.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these were as fresh.</li>
            <li>This product works great ... far better than &#x27;Day White Excel&#x27;, &#x27;Nite White ACP&#x27; or the high priced &#x27;Generic Junk&#x27; from the dentist ... at a great price too.  </li>
            <li>The Syringes are smaller but 12 should be more than one years worth of whitening!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the right strength for you.</li>
            <li>w/ both 10-15% in the past and had great results with no problems.</li>
            <li>Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging.</li>
            <li>I got my teeth to a nice bright white and maintain by using it for 3 nights every few months.</li>
            <li>It is great to keep my teeth white after the initial whitening at my dentist.</li>
            <li>and i love my white smile</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and works very well when paired with opalescence tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I had very mild sensitivity one night after using a little too much gel, but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>it certainly gives me a pretty smile.</li>
            <li>Fast and reliable!</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as I had got from my dentist.</li>
            <li>The top tray I could only keep on for 5 minutes the two times</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time yesterday; awoke this morning with the look of Lisa Rinna silicone-injected lips.  </li>
            <li>Arrived hot.</li>
            <li>To use this properly you must be able to read and follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>I found the exact product here that my dentist offered so I bought it.</li>
            <li>People comment on the unusual whiteness of my teeth; I just smile and say thank you.</li>
            <li>They work exactly like I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>Crest pro white strips work 10x better then</li>
            <li>I first bought it from the dentist, then discovered on line purchasing and a four pack lasts me a year of maintenance.</li>
            <li>I WISH CAN RETURN IT FOR GET MY MONEY BACK AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE BETTER THAN IT.</li>
            <li>I needed to whiten before getting crowns on my two front teeth (yes, yes ; )  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both have custom whitening trays and have used this brand for years, but this is our first time trying the 35% strength.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to whiten in 30 minutes, rather than having to wear the trays all night!</li>
            <li>Had gum irritation first time using it</li>
            <li>Got it from my dentist at first.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact).</li>
            <li>Just as effective as other reviewers said, and no pain user follows directions.</li>
            <li>All gels should be used sparingly, but since this one is up to 3 1/2 times more powerful that what my dentist sells, be careful to avoid an excess that will leak from the tray onto the gums, because the result will be unpleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself is good, but to no fault of the seller it is definitely a source of sensitivity as it is 30% (I had only used 15% before).</li>
            <li>However be careful its very strong</li>
            <li>These are definitely 35% and they are definitely STRONG.</li>
            <li>strong as what I get from dentist even though same brand?</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to others but warn if you have very sensitive teeth, these may not be your favorite thing to use.</li>
            <li>It is a more potent product than typically supplied outside the dentist office.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had the courage to ask my dentist what he things of 35% strength, because what he sells is twelve times more expensive than this product, and I suspect most of the difference helps him make his boat payment!</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>or you will have very sore gums.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It does work very well.</li>
            <li>Intense but really works.</li>
            <li>Came fast too, well packaged.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I ended up really liking the fact that the opalescence is a sticky gel, because it doesn&#x27;t move around in the tray and sticks my trays to my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I go all out when I do things, so I decided on the 35% like I used to have in the NiteWhite, but these are SO much stronger.</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated until we are ready to use it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>It really works but use it with care and sensibly.</li>
            <li>These Opalescence PF 35% Teeth Whitening really work.</li>
            <li>white teeth have always been important to me.</li>
            <li>These really do whine your teeth</li>
            <li>Additionally, in the beginning I was using too much of the product and it was causing some sores on my gums.</li>
            <li>Some dentists will charge you as much as $50 for one tube.</li>
            <li>the package  arrived  fast</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>need my two teeth drilled and refilled .Amazon was very apologetic ...refunded my money immediately ..</li>
            <li>This is a product whish really work</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing for my teeth.</li>
            <li>It also arrived in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the purchase.</li>
            <li>OFF IS WAY TO MUCH</li>
            <li>After 4 applications it really whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li>REAly Works fast.  </li>
            <li>will temporarily burn if too much is</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Wow, we love it and will be using it in the future.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my teeth were so sensitive to air.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth do not use this percentage and buy a much lower one!</li>
            <li>The 35 percentage is a whole new level of pain.</li>
            <li>This PF is much better and quicker than using the PF 15% formula I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, gel with carbamide peroxide is the main ingredient to de-staining your teeth, And you don&#x27;t need to put a lot of gel into your trays, just a couple of drops and after a week or so, your teeth will glisten, and delivery was also prompt....</li>
            <li>An hour will do a decent job, without over-sensitizing your teeth, or messing your gums up.</li>
            <li>particular, it</li>
            <li>Highly suggested.</li>
            <li>I think 35% is too high for me.</li>
            <li>It was delivered promptly and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;three pack (12)&amp;#34; came with instructions and a cute little &amp;#34;teeth shade&amp;#34; chart.</li>
            <li>so this was an expensive lessen ...be happy with what god gave me .</li>
            <li>If you leave in your mouth too long it will burn your gums, but you do get sparkling white teeth :)</li>
            <li>Tip: if I wear the gel for 30 or more minutes my teeth will be sore the entire next day, but wearing the gel for 25 minutes doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>I used to use NiteWhite, but I switched to Opalescence after my dentist gave me a couple with my new whitening trays</li>
            <li>I paid a fortune for this exact same product at my dentist office.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Worked very fast, much faster than expected when paired with my dentist made guards.</li>
            <li>I love this whitening brand, which is why I ordered it, but if you have sensitive teeth definitely go for the less percentage.</li>
            <li>My teeth are a little more sensitive to temperature now, but very white!</li>
            <li>I actually was very excited when they were burning a little ..</li>
            <li>However, does make my teeth and gums sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The 20% from my dentist is by far, stronger than this 35% I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>This stuff is either gained, or just plane old garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Use for only 30 minutes per time and if it burns you know have too much in the trays remove it and rinse.</li>
            <li>this really makes the teeth white!</li>
            <li>You have to have a non sensitive mouth/gums to use this stuff.</li>
            <li>you get professional quality and results with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that really whitens my teeth, I have tried others and they make my teeth lighter but yellowish.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and WOW</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old a smoker and coffee drinker</li>
            <li>I put the minimum amount possible into the tray and only did the top front teeth so that I could focus on being extremely</li>
            <li>The first is make your teeth white, the second is attack your gums.</li>
            <li>I paid several hundred dollars for the exact same product at my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I have used Opalescence for a long time and it works really well.</li>
            <li>My gums are very tolerant of over the counter whitening gels but this stuff should only be sold to and used by a professional such as a dentist or dental hygienist.</li>
            <li>I even paid for overnight shipping so it wouldn&#x27;t sit in a hot distribution center.</li>
            <li>However, it was only momentarily discoloured and returned to normal after 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Only more slowly.</li>
            <li>The peroxide content is very high and you must be careful not to burn your gums</li>
            <li>Had a professional whitening done by dentist last year</li>
            <li>There is nothing wrong with it except it is too strong and my mouth and teeth were really hurting when I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>The gel also stays on your teeth better than other whiteners I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I find that sometimes I need to brush gently 2-4 days after using the product due to gum sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>can burn your gums if you&#x27;re not careful and follow the instructions properly.</li>
            <li>The last time I had trays made, about 6yrs ago, the dentist told me the product will only be active for a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Previously used nite-white, this is much stronger, do not use over night.</li>

            <li> The seller coded it nicely so there were no problems with customs when crossing the border from USA to Canada.   </li>
            <li> but you can make your own.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened this gel yet to see how effective it is</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, shipped quickly and works wonders at an excellent price.  </li>
            <li> Great product exactly what I purchased at the dentist office and paid three times more.</li>
            <li> It will also do what many people have said.</li>
            <li> I get 3x&#x27;s more for the price</li>
            <li> One has to love the application of this stuff.</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter after even just one application. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never looked better.</li>
            <li> and they gave me some gel for monthly refreshing, which ran out</li>
            <li> I recommend it but make sure you research Opalescence PF35% to make sure</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I orginally got this from my dentist who charges a lot more for it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years - top quality.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had known it was available online years ago, after getting cutom bleach trays made!</li>
            <li> i will be buying more as soon as i need it.</li>
            <li> used it twice and saw no need for more applications.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> but i love this product</li>
            <li> no whiter just hurt more ..</li>
            <li> and if course told me to toss that out .I would love to know if this happened to anyone else .I</li>
            <li> Love this whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> Much better than all the strips I have tried before.</li>
            <li> Better than the 12% dentist stuff.</li>
            <li> Much better than the toothpaste brands in the drugstores.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love these and love the price too</li>
            <li> and my teeth did not look any better.</li>
            <li> I am pleased and will return.</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Much better pricing than my dentist</li>
            <li> TRICK to using whitening tray&#x27;s is to make sure</li>
            <li> and I used GC Tooth Mousse as advised by many dentists because it is scientifically proven to protect tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for getting your teeth their whitest and then giving them an occasional whitening tune-up!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and amazing results!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and liked it very much!</li>
            <li> a brilliant white like I want.  </li>
            <li> Easily.</li>
            <li> Their customer service  department does not seem to make it easy to get any situations</li>
            <li> but you want to make sure that you are also practicing great oral hygiene and seeing your dentist regularly.</li>
            <li> I have Invisalign braces and as they work like tooth trays already, my ortho said I could easily whiten with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, fresh and delivered very timely.</li>
            <li> I think I needed the PF15% or something not at strong.  </li>
            <li> and this wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this stuff, 35% is way too strong.</li>
            <li> good product,  great service, very satisified with overall transaction.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was free, and it came in very quickly.</li>
            <li> The mint taste is fine.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that there is a huge difference in the product I received from my dentist and this product.</li>
            <li> You need to have customized tray made to fit your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great results already after 2nd treatment.</li>
            <li> do not feel this product should be available for home use.</li>
            <li> There was some light discolouration on my gums after each treatment.</li>
            <li> It is important to post treat your teeth</li>
            <li> These do the job, but very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at first because they are like a sticky gel, whereas the NiteWhite, which I was used to, was more like a toothpaste consistency.</li>
            <li> No expiration or sell by date or original packaging which is troubling.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, as described and in damage free condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So easy to decide to use even right before going out.</li>
            <li> Using this right now!</li>
            <li> This is a great value and is exactly the same product they have at dentist office.</li>
            <li> A dental teeth tray would probably be a good idea to prevent irritation to the inner cheeks and gums.</li>
            <li> I will say that I&#x27;ve had exceptionally good whitening results with the product and received comments as to how white my teeth have become.</li>
            <li> Would recommend Cool Teeth Whitening (TM) in their replacement, although the packaging isn&#x27;t nearly as cool.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should not have kept it on for the full two hours, which was the time prescribed by my dentist for their gel.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest taking it easy at first</li>
            <li> It was just too strong for my mouth, burned my gums and made them very sore!  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, but probably not a full 35% -- more like 22%.  </li>
            <li> so this seemed like a good deal, especially since it&#x27;s (guaranteed fresh).</li>
            <li> Works quickly to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s 35% which whitens your teeth quickly.  </li>
            <li> this is a very good product and I have use several times, I live in Denmark and I get it very fast...</li>
            <li> However, the reason I bought this is because this seller stated New and Latest expiration dates.</li>
            <li> and this was fast, easy and affordable.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Im finishing up and is the same brand (Opalescence) and love this bleach!</li>
            <li> however your teeth would get coloured easily after this as i believe it removes an important natural protective layer from the teeth.</li>
            <li> However, this stuff is brutally strong so make sure you keep it off your gums as much as possible.</li>
            <li> the difference is amazing, I have white teeth.  </li>
            <li> 35% Teeth Whitening 12 pk Mint with COLOR CHART (GUARANTEED FRESH)]]</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li> Product advertised as being guaranteed fresh.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I found it on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
            <li> So I figured it was fresh .Day</li>
            <li> Good results and much cheeper than going through your local dentist office.</li>
            <li> Continuing a personal teeth whitening routine, using custom-fitted forms, and these Opalescence syringes are handy for applying the gel to the forms.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these were as fresh.</li>
            <li> This product works great ... far better than &#x27;Day White Excel&#x27;, &#x27;Nite White ACP&#x27; or the high priced &#x27;Generic Junk&#x27; from the dentist ... at a great price too.  </li>
            <li> The Syringes are smaller but 12 should be more than one years worth of whitening!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the right strength for you.</li>
            <li> w/ both 10-15% in the past and had great results with no problems.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging.</li>
            <li> I got my teeth to a nice bright white and maintain by using it for 3 nights every few months.</li>
            <li> It is great to keep my teeth white after the initial whitening at my dentist.</li>
            <li> and i love my white smile</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and works very well when paired with opalescence tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I had very mild sensitivity one night after using a little too much gel, but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> it certainly gives me a pretty smile.</li>
            <li> Fast and reliable!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as I had got from my dentist.</li>
            <li> The top tray I could only keep on for 5 minutes the two times</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time yesterday; awoke this morning with the look of Lisa Rinna silicone-injected lips.  </li>
            <li> Arrived hot.</li>
            <li> To use this properly you must be able to read and follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> I found the exact product here that my dentist offered so I bought it.</li>
            <li> People comment on the unusual whiteness of my teeth; I just smile and say thank you.</li>
            <li> They work exactly like I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> Crest pro white strips work 10x better then</li>
            <li> I first bought it from the dentist, then discovered on line purchasing and a four pack lasts me a year of maintenance.</li>
            <li> I WISH CAN RETURN IT FOR GET MY MONEY BACK AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE BETTER THAN IT.</li>
            <li> I needed to whiten before getting crowns on my two front teeth (yes, yes ; )  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both have custom whitening trays and have used this brand for years, but this is our first time trying the 35% strength.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to whiten in 30 minutes, rather than having to wear the trays all night!</li>
            <li> Had gum irritation first time using it</li>
            <li> Got it from my dentist at first.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact).</li>
            <li> Just as effective as other reviewers said, and no pain user follows directions.</li>
            <li> All gels should be used sparingly, but since this one is up to 3 1/2 times more powerful that what my dentist sells, be careful to avoid an excess that will leak from the tray onto the gums, because the result will be unpleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself is good, but to no fault of the seller it is definitely a source of sensitivity as it is 30% (I had only used 15% before).</li>
            <li> However be careful its very strong</li>
            <li> These are definitely 35% and they are definitely STRONG.</li>
            <li> strong as what I get from dentist even though same brand?</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to others but warn if you have very sensitive teeth, these may not be your favorite thing to use.</li>
            <li> It is a more potent product than typically supplied outside the dentist office.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had the courage to ask my dentist what he things of 35% strength, because what he sells is twelve times more expensive than this product, and I suspect most of the difference helps him make his boat payment!</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> or you will have very sore gums.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It does work very well.</li>
            <li> Intense but really works.</li>
            <li> Came fast too, well packaged.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I ended up really liking the fact that the opalescence is a sticky gel, because it doesn&#x27;t move around in the tray and sticks my trays to my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I go all out when I do things, so I decided on the 35% like I used to have in the NiteWhite, but these are SO much stronger.</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated until we are ready to use it.</li>

            <li> the package  arrived  fast</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>

            <li> Thanks for the purchase.</li>
            <li> OFF IS WAY TO MUCH</li>
            <li> After 4 applications it really whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> REAly Works fast.  </li>
            <li> will temporarily burn if too much is</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Wow, we love it and will be using it in the future.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my teeth were so sensitive to air.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth do not use this percentage and buy a much lower one!</li>
            <li> The 35 percentage is a whole new level of pain.</li>
            <li> This PF is much better and quicker than using the PF 15% formula I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, gel with carbamide peroxide is the main ingredient to de-staining your teeth, And you don&#x27;t need to put a lot of gel into your trays, just a couple of drops and after a week or so, your teeth will glisten, and delivery was also prompt....</li>
            <li> An hour will do a decent job, without over-sensitizing your teeth, or messing your gums up.</li>
            <li> particular, it</li>
            <li> Highly suggested.</li>
            <li> I think 35% is too high for me.</li>
            <li> It was delivered promptly and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;three pack (12)&amp;#34; came with instructions and a cute little &amp;#34;teeth shade&amp;#34; chart.</li>
            <li> so this was an expensive lessen ...be happy with what god gave me .</li>
            <li> If you leave in your mouth too long it will burn your gums, but you do get sparkling white teeth :)</li>
            <li> Tip: if I wear the gel for 30 or more minutes my teeth will be sore the entire next day, but wearing the gel for 25 minutes doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> I used to use NiteWhite, but I switched to Opalescence after my dentist gave me a couple with my new whitening trays</li>
            <li> I paid a fortune for this exact same product at my dentist office.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Worked very fast, much faster than expected when paired with my dentist made guards.</li>
            <li> I love this whitening brand, which is why I ordered it, but if you have sensitive teeth definitely go for the less percentage.</li>
            <li> My teeth are a little more sensitive to temperature now, but very white!</li>
            <li> I actually was very excited when they were burning a little ..</li>
            <li> However, does make my teeth and gums sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The 20% from my dentist is by far, stronger than this 35% I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> This stuff is either gained, or just plane old garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Use for only 30 minutes per time and if it burns you know have too much in the trays remove it and rinse.</li>
            <li> this really makes the teeth white!</li>
            <li> You have to have a non sensitive mouth/gums to use this stuff.</li>
            <li> you get professional quality and results with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that really whitens my teeth, I have tried others and they make my teeth lighter but yellowish.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and WOW</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old a smoker and coffee drinker</li>
            <li> I put the minimum amount possible into the tray and only did the top front teeth so that I could focus on being extremely</li>
            <li> The first is make your teeth white, the second is attack your gums.</li>
            <li> I paid several hundred dollars for the exact same product at my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence for a long time and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My gums are very tolerant of over the counter whitening gels but this stuff should only be sold to and used by a professional such as a dentist or dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> I even paid for overnight shipping so it wouldn&#x27;t sit in a hot distribution center.</li>
            <li> However, it was only momentarily discoloured and returned to normal after 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Only more slowly.</li>
            <li> The peroxide content is very high and you must be careful not to burn your gums</li>
            <li> Had a professional whitening done by dentist last year</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it except it is too strong and my mouth and teeth were really hurting when I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> The gel also stays on your teeth better than other whiteners I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I find that sometimes I need to brush gently 2-4 days after using the product due to gum sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> can burn your gums if you&#x27;re not careful and follow the instructions properly.</li>
            <li> The last time I had trays made, about 6yrs ago, the dentist told me the product will only be active for a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Previously used nite-white, this is much stronger, do not use over night.</li>
            <li> It did seem much thicker than I expected though the other reviews stating it would bleach your gums were spot on.</li>
            <li> smaller doses multiple times makes the gums less sensitive</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening gel will last you a long time because you only need a minute amount for each tooth.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from the dentist, however, this was much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> If you are subject to sensitivity you can brush with Sensodyne or any toothpaste made for sensitive teeth for a week before whitening.</li>
            <li> The peroxide gel won&#x27;t be as likely to leak out of your trays, then onto your gums, possiably burning you, if you start with a dry tray.  </li>
            <li> USE only in DRY TRAY!</li>
            <li> as the old saying goes, \\&quot;a little dab will do ya\\&quot; ... it can burn your gums ...</li>
            <li> The product worked very well, though I was a little tender for the next few day and was very careful to avoid foods that would generally stain.</li>
            <li> So please with the results and especially shipping, since I got the package sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It is sensitive to the gums and they will heal if you stop using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are not sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time and it works.</li>
            <li> This Opalescence product works extremely well at whitening teeth after several uses, but be cautious about leaving the product in your mouth over two hours, else, it will make the gums tender.</li>
            <li> Takes too long!</li>
            <li> I originally bought Opalescence from my dentist, and that is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Received the product, everything is ok.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was not exactly the same as on the picture.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone has questions about how long to use - it states clearly in the package that for the 35%, take it out after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I can tell that this product is not fresh or not stored properly.</li>
            <li> I would probably try  a lower percent and get less quantity next time.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful not to over do it as it could damage your gums, especially in the lower tray as any excess solution will drain down onto the gums.</li>
            <li> I smoke a little and drink cola, red wine, etc.</li>
            <li> Some post treatment tooth sensitivity can be expected.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend - it&#x27;s even whitening my dead tooth in front.</li>
            <li> My teeth are harder to whiten because of drugs I had to take as a child, but it IS working.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> however you have to be careful since using it</li>
            <li> got to be careful not to put in the gum line or your gums</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd round of the 35% opalescence, having used the 15% variety for years before.  </li>
            <li> I use this strength carefully.</li>
            <li> Plus I believe the product was old, to thick of gel</li>
            <li> I have used another brand in the past that didn&#x27;t turn gums white or irritate the gums.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found any other product that works as well</li>
            <li> Way stronger than other 35% gels that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> There was some slight irritation on the gums the few times, but that is expected due to the nature of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> dark wines you will need to use it again.</li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> wish they made one a little stronger like 45% due to smoking years ago.</li>
            <li> However this 35% stuff will burn your gums pretty bad if you let it stay on them too long, so if you feel your gums start to burn</li>
            <li> I typically wait 5 to 7 days between applications.  </li>
            <li> so much less costly than buying from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with anything less than the 35%.</li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t get the sensitivity if I use Sensodyne toothpaste for at least a few weeks prior to whitening.</li>
            <li> Half price here.</li>
            <li> I used as directed, got results and this was much less expensive than something a dentist gave me (at high cost) which hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> It does not burn my gums unless I have brushed to hard and have raw gums.  </li>
            <li> it made my teeth a little tender for a couple days</li>
            <li> Just use a little bit or you burn your gums</li>
            <li> It was just a little cheaper on-line.  </li>
            <li> I had a few little spots where my application was a bit generous that were tender for a few days even after color returned.&lt;br /&gt;Great value, will be using once a month or so to ward off severe staining.</li>
            <li> Literally had to wait a few days to brush my gums without pain.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week with my bleach tray for continuous results.</li>
            <li> Well I know it did not cost $29.00 I would say less than $5.00 for shipping!  </li>
            <li> buy half!  </li>
            <li> I whiten with them at least every other night or so.</li>
            <li> A little thinner and stickier then usual order&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> see very little change.. can not use often, it burns my gum every time I use it.</li>
            <li> basically, if I get a dab of the 20% on my gums, it will burn a hole in them, but the 35% doesn&#x27;t really seem to burn nearly as bad as the 20%.</li>
            <li> the dealer only said sorry</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It can burn your mouth if you have any small cuts on your gums</li>
            <li> These worked but just too expensive as you can only use each syringe once,  </li>
            <li> I have learned to use it small amount so as not to touch the gums.</li>
            <li> Whenever you use a tray, inevitably, a small amount will touch the gum line, and as soon as this happens, this product needs to be removed or it will damage the gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 30 minutes usually works for me, sometimes I&#x27;ll go up to 1 1/2 hours ... depending on my gum sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Very harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> A few times I put too much in my custom made trays and had bloody pained gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, for those who complained about the lack of instructions, well-</li>
            <li> The gel does seem to work for removing interim tea and coffee stains, but should be used with caution to avoid irritation and swelling, at least in my case.</li>
            <li> I mean, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into.</li>
            <li> For example, A055 would mean an expiration date of May 2015.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise you will have some serious sensitivity pain.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this percentage sadly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 20% for a while now but got tired of trying to find three or four hours to keep it in.</li>
            <li> After I decreased the amount and followed the guidelines that didn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> but it was so expensive</li>
            <li> Product was difficult to spread across the front face of my dentist formed mouthpieces.  </li>
            <li> so well, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to peel them off, even combined with the Opalescence.  </li>
            <li> I am so sorry I didn&#x27;t explore this purchase sooner.  </li>
            <li> If you think you can put it in a tray for a few hours your gums will hurt very badly.  </li>
            <li> I also have to note that if you get this gel on your gums it will BURN really badly.</li>
            <li> BAD stuff.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the savings.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t get the gel as close to my gums as I would like to for fear of it burning the crap out of them.</li>
            <li> Very expensive!</li>
            <li> You wanna do it at home then buy the strips and get rid of the hassle that is using the cream with those horrible moldable tray</li>
            <li> Also, using the 10% strength overnight would give me horrible tooth sensitivity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased several differnet times for my wife. She is very pleased.</li>
            <li> The product worked very well, though I was a little tender for the next few day and was very careful to avoid foods that would generally stain. It did seem much thicker than I expected though the other reviews stating it would bleach your gums were spot on. I had a few little spots where my application was a bit generous that were tender for a few days even after color returned.&lt;br /&gt;Great value, will be using once a month or so to ward off severe staining. I would definitely recommend this product to others but warn if you have very sensitive teeth, these may not be your favorite thing to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using opalescence for almost 20 years.  The first time I used it my teeth were so sensitive to air.  The last time I had trays made, about 6yrs ago, the dentist told me the product will only be active for a certain amount of time.  Which is good, because I fell asleep with them in on day 2.  This product is great!  Remember to store them in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been using it for years .  Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This works really well. However, does make my teeth and gums sensitive.  I didn&#x27;t experience this with the lower strength formulas.  I have always used the lower formulas and it works just as well at twice the speed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, gel with carbamide peroxide is the main ingredient to de-staining your teeth, And you don&#x27;t need to put a lot of gel into your trays, just a couple of drops and after a week or so, your teeth will glisten, and delivery was also prompt....</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do. It will also do what many people have said. The first is make your teeth white, the second is attack your gums. I would suggest taking it easy at first or you will have very sore gums.</li>
            <li> Home teeth whitener has never been easier. It is a more potent product than typically supplied outside the dentist office. A dental teeth tray would probably be a good idea to prevent irritation to the inner cheeks and gums. Good, thorough rinsing after treatment is advisable. Some post treatment tooth sensitivity can be expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and amazing results! Thanks for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> My son told me about ordering the Opalescence online.  I was shocked by the savings.  I get 3x&#x27;s more for the price my dentist charges!!!!![[ASIN:B001CZWNUC Opalescence PF 35% Teeth Whitening 12 pk Mint with COLOR CHART (GUARANTEED FRESH)]]</li>
            <li> This Opalescence product works extremely well at whitening teeth after several uses, but be cautious about leaving the product in your mouth over two hours, else, it will make the gums tender.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> The product probably is great.  There is nothing wrong with it except it is too strong and my mouth and teeth were really hurting when I tried to use it.  I think I needed the PF15% or something not at strong.  I have used a similar product from the dentist but it was so expensive I couldn&#x27;t justify buying it.  My teeth are white just not a brilliant white like I want.  Again, the product would be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> I would not reccommend this product. I have used another brand in the past that didn&#x27;t turn gums white or irritate the gums. Literally had to wait a few days to brush my gums without pain. Plus I believe the product was old, to thick of gel and you can&#x27;t return product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly. The seller coded it nicely so there were no problems with customs when crossing the border from USA to Canada.   The product itself is good, but to no fault of the seller it is definitely a source of sensitivity as it is 30% (I had only used 15% before).</li>
            <li> Just as effective as other reviewers said, and no pain user follows directions.</li>
            <li> So far,excellent results.........  ....  everything is perfect!  Same stuff I paid double the price from a dentist!  Same brand and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> This item is great for whitening your teeth! It does work very well. I would realy check the shipping price before ordering from this dealer. I could have drove to the house where it was shipped from in 15 min. Rather than spending $29.00. the dealer only said sorry that is the price Amazon put for shipping. Well I know it did not cost $29.00 I would say less than $5.00 for shipping!  So who keeps the shipping money?</li>
            <li> I gave it only a 2 for now since there were not any instructions included as to how to use the product.</li>
            <li> So I just ordered the Opalesence 35% and used 2 times. I can tell that this product is not fresh or not stored properly. I just visited my dentist and bought a 4 pack of the 20% because that&#x27;s all he carries. I can tell you that there is a huge difference in the product I received from my dentist and this product. The 20% from my dentist is by far, stronger than this 35% I bought on Amazon. I still have some of the 20% left overa and basically, if I get a dab of the 20% on my gums, it will burn a hole in them, but the 35% doesn&#x27;t really seem to burn nearly as bad as the 20%. So that tells me it&#x27;s not fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess sometimes you do get what you pay for. I payed 50.00 dollars for the 4 pack of 20% from dentist so this seemed like a good deal, especially since it&#x27;s (guaranteed fresh). I even paid for overnight shipping so it wouldn&#x27;t sit in a hot distribution center.</li>
            <li> Intense but really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Opalescence PF 35% for sometime now and it works. You need to be careful not to over do it as it could damage your gums, especially in the lower tray as any excess solution will drain down onto the gums. Otherwise it works well.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t come with instruction and exp date. I tried it and there was no difference in color.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This stuff works excellent for whitening... I get constant compliments about how white my teeth are.  However this 35% stuff will burn your gums pretty bad if you let it stay on them too long, so if you feel your gums start to burn I&#x27;d suggest removing your trays and reapplying your gel in a smaller amount.  Great product and great results at a great price!! Highly suggested.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!! I would totally recommend - it&#x27;s even whitening my dead tooth in front. Came fast too, well packaged.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months and it is wonderful.  I smoke and drink coffee, and now have really white teeth.  The product was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Best teeth whiting product there is. It really works. Only product I will buy now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. It is great to keep my teeth white after the initial whitening at my dentist. You need to have customized tray made to fit your teeth. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> bright glossy teeth. One has to love the application of this stuff. smaller doses multiple times makes the gums less sensitive</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me ...</li>
            <li> Love it! This is what my dentist uses and it only takes 30 minutes! I always get compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist to get started but I will now get my supplies here.  Save a bundle. This stuff works GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> These do the job, but very powerful.  If you leave in your mouth too long it will burn your gums, but you do get sparkling white teeth :)</li>
            <li> Works great good value</li>
            <li> burned my skin for 2 days</li>
            <li> Works great. I would get the 10% next time I think 35% is too high for me. It burns my gums.</li>
            <li> Fast and reliable! I suggest everyone!</li>
            <li> I paid a fortune for this exact same product at my dentist office.  This is a great value and is exactly the same product they have at dentist office.</li>
            <li> These are definitely 35% and they are definitely STRONG. I cannot reiterate that enough. I used to use NiteWhite, but I switched to Opalescence after my dentist gave me a couple with my new whitening trays (my teeth have moved from my TMJ). He actually gave me 20%. I didn&#x27;t like them at first because they are like a sticky gel, whereas the NiteWhite, which I was used to, was more like a toothpaste consistency. I ended up really liking the fact that the opalescence is a sticky gel, because it doesn&#x27;t move around in the tray and sticks my trays to my teeth. Because of this, I also don&#x27;t have to spit out the extra whitening stuff that seeps out from the trays like my last brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I go all out when I do things, so I decided on the 35% like I used to have in the NiteWhite, but these are SO much stronger. You should only leave them in 20 minutes to 35 minutes MAX! Otherwise you will have some serious sensitivity pain. I left them in for an hour once and I will never do that again. I also have to note that if you get this gel on your gums it will BURN really badly. To the point where you think it might actually burn a hole in your gums. Yikes. I&#x27;ve had to take them out and try again later because of this. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. I feel like I can&#x27;t get the gel as close to my gums as I would like to for fear of it burning the crap out of them. I&#x27;m going to give some of them to my siblings and I&#x27;ll go for the 20% next time I order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is bomb. My teeth are noticeably whiter after even just one application. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a youtube review on this type of whitener. So please with the results and especially shipping, since I got the package sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Works quickly to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as I had got from my dentist. I would definitely order it again the next time I need it.</li>
            <li> must use overnight! Takes too long!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Used it until my desired results were achieved.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product with a great price!  Keep it off the gums, it can feel like it&#x27;s burning.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, as described and in damage free condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Previously used nite-white, this is much stronger, do not use over night. An hour will do a decent job, without over-sensitizing your teeth, or messing your gums up. The Syringes are smaller but 12 should be more than one years worth of whitening! Easily. Good product would recommend. If I ever run out of this stuff I&#x27;d look for it and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence for a long time and it works really well. I can get it for 2/3 of the cost on Amazon rather than purchasing it from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have used this for three years. Always bought from my dentist at $45.00 for four. This was a great bargin for twelve for $43. Will order again.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth do not use this percentage and buy a much lower one! I&#x27;ve used the pre loaded trays w/ both 10-15% in the past and had great results with no problems. The 35 percentage is a whole new level of pain. I couldn&#x27;t even place this on my lower teeth for even 30 seconds without incredible pain at all and had to immediately remove them so I didn&#x27;t even try again. The top tray I could only keep on for 5 minutes the two times I used it. I love this whitening brand, which is why I ordered it, but if you have sensitive teeth definitely go for the less percentage. I wasted my money on this percentage sadly.</li>
            <li> This is the same product my dentist sells for three times the price. It has worked wonders on my husbands stained teeth. My teeth are harder to whiten because of drugs I had to take as a child, but it IS working. Only more slowly. It can burn your mouth if you have any small cuts on your gums but we have had no problems with it. I keep it refrigerated until we are ready to use it. It was delivered promptly and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described. Fast shipping. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Product advertised as being guaranteed fresh.  That was not the case with this shipment as I&#x27;ve purchased this item on multiple occasions.  Product was difficult to spread across the front face of my dentist formed mouthpieces.  I will say that I&#x27;ve had exceptionally good whitening results with the product and received comments as to how white my teeth have become.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes is all that is necessary. I use it a few times a week with my bleach tray for continuous results. My teeth have never looked better.</li>
            <li> These DO whiten. However the set I got (they sat on the shelf for a y ear mind you) came out in a sort of gelatinous form. Plus it&#x27;s one tube/use. Would recommend Cool Teeth Whitening (TM) in their replacement, although the packaging isn&#x27;t nearly as cool. I mean, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into.</li>
            <li> They did not work. I saw no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> You wanna do it at home then buy the strips and get rid of the hassle that is using the cream with those horrible moldable tray</li>
            <li> Product was as expected. No surprises</li>
            <li> I did not get the amount of product that I paid for.For the last month I have trying to get in touch with the seller to rectify this error. Their email system does not seem to work well with mine and as of 6/14/14 this is still unsolved.&lt;br /&gt;  Their customer service  department does not seem to make it easy to get any situations solved.&lt;br /&gt;  Sheri Stewart</li>
            <li> Great price, prompt service.</li>
            <li> see very little change.. can not use often, it burns my gum every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging. Was I wasting hours wearing the trays with the product that may have expired ?&lt;br /&gt;Well, there&#x27;s an expiration date after all, except it&#x27;s not very obvious. I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product lines).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date is indicated as \\&quot;ZMMY\\&quot;, where Z is a product lot letter, MM is the month and Y is the year. For example, A055 would mean an expiration date of May 2015.&lt;br /&gt;So look closely on your syringe for these characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those who complained about the lack of instructions, well- they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact). ultradent.com/en-us/Product Instruction Documents/Opalescence Tooth Whitening.pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, it says-&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Wear Opalescence 10% for 8-10 hours&lt;br /&gt;or overnight, Opalescence 15% for 4-6 hours, Opalescence&lt;br /&gt;20% for 2-4 hours, and Opalescence 35% for 30 minutes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep on smiling with your (hopefully brighter) smiles !</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time yesterday; awoke this morning with the look of Lisa Rinna silicone-injected lips.  Had a professional whitening done by dentist last year and they gave me some gel for monthly refreshing, which ran out so I bought this product.  Maybe I should not have kept it on for the full two hours, which was the time prescribed by my dentist for their gel.  Next month, I will only use it for one hour.  The gel does seem to work for removing interim tea and coffee stains, but should be used with caution to avoid irritation and swelling, at least in my case.</li>
            <li> Arrived hot. So i returned it.</li>
            <li> It works great and fair price</li>
            <li> good product,  great service, very satisified with overall transaction.  thank yoy</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but probably not a full 35% -- more like 22%.  No expiration or sell by date or original packaging which is troubling.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, shipped quickly and works wonders at an excellent price.  I recommend it but make sure you research Opalescence PF35% to make sure it&#x27;s the right strength for you.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I orginally got this from my dentist who charges a lot more for it. It really whitens your teeth. It&#x27;s the best whitening product out there. I have tried them all. I have sensitive teeth and this wasn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it immediately after brushing, your gums will pay! .....  ... ////// ........... .......... ........ .///////////// .............. ,</li>
            <li> Excellent product....</li>
            <li> These worked but just too expensive as you can only use each syringe once,  so that&#x27;s 12 days.  You have whiter teeth for a while but if you don&#x27;t keep up with it you&#x27;re back where you started.</li>
            <li> I got this from my dentist about 3 years ago. Very expensive! I was so surprised when I found it on Amazon at such a great price. Its even a stronger strength than what I got from the dentist! I use it for the occasional touch up.if you smoke, drink coffee, colas, dark wines you will need to use it again. I have my specific made trays from my dentist so I use those but you can make your own. I wear for 2 hours ever so often to keep my teeth white. If you are subject to sensitivity you can brush with Sensodyne or any toothpaste made for sensitive teeth for a week before whitening. This teeth whitening gel will last you a long time because you only need a minute amount for each tooth. When you put the trays in, the gel will spread out to cover your teeth. Take a tissue to wipe any excess off of your gums. Happy whitening! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, with great results and you don&#x27;t have to have trays.  I combine this product with Crest white strips.  I just place the Opalescence on the part of the strip that lays on the front side of the teeth and then put the white strip on my teeth.  The newer white strips stick to your teeth so well, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to peel them off, even combined with the Opalescence.  To avoid sensitivity, don&#x27;t use this product every day and keep it off of your gums.</li>
            <li> Using this right now! I have been using the 20% for a while now but got tired of trying to find three or four hours to keep it in. Upped to the 35% per my friend, a former dental hygienist&#x27;s, recommendation. The &amp;#34;three pack (12)&amp;#34; came with instructions and a cute little &amp;#34;teeth shade&amp;#34; chart. Not sure why everyone has questions about how long to use - it states clearly in the package that for the 35%, take it out after 30 minutes. If your teeth hurt, take a day or two off and then start again. Good luck and happy whitening!</li>
            <li> This stuff worst great!  To use this properly you must be able to read and follow instructions.  If you think you can put it in a tray for a few hours your gums will hurt very badly.  If this is you, I would recommend a lower strength.  It is sensitive to the gums and they will heal if you stop using it for a few days. I typically wait 5 to 7 days between applications.  My teeth are a little more sensitive to temperature now, but very white!</li>
            <li> A reorder. Have used this product for years - top quality.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, purchasing it from my dentist. I have used every % of gel they make, but I&#x27;m going for ultra white teeth, so I went up the 35% gel. Very happy with the results, and I&#x27;m even happier about the price! I had very mild sensitivity one night after using a little too much gel, but that was my own fault. I use about 1/3 of each tube per bleaching session. I will continue to buy from this seller instead of my dentist. The shipping was free, and it came in very quickly. I store my bleach in the fridge,as this keeps the gel \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; longer. I wish I had known it was available online years ago, after getting cutom bleach trays made!</li>
            <li> Everything just as promised.</li>
            <li> Best bleaching material</li>
            <li> this works as described however you have to be careful since using it will cause pain in the teeth. it will make your teeth white however your teeth would get coloured easily after this as i believe it removes an important natural protective layer from the teeth.</li>
            <li> Burns your gums AND does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE! This stuff is either gained, or just plane old garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, and it did nothing to whiten my teeth. There is also NO guarantee - you cannot return anything un-used if it does not work/ hurts you. BAD stuff.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent teeth whitner. The peroxide content is very high and you must be careful not to burn your gums so dont over do. Use for only 30 minutes per time and if it burns you know have too much in the trays remove it and rinse. It really works but use it with care and sensibly.</li>
            <li> These Opalescence PF 35% Teeth Whitening really work. I have been using them for years. Haven&#x27;t found any other product that works as well</li>
            <li> Great buy... so much less costly than buying from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Came on a timely basis.  It works.  However be careful its very strong can burn your gums if you&#x27;re not careful and follow the instructions properly.</li>
            <li> Opalescence is the best teeth whitening product on the market !</li>
            <li> this really makes the teeth white! i will be buying more as soon as i need it. white teeth have always been important to me. my friends are going to buy this plus the toothpaste too.</li>
            <li> It takes about 2 hours a day for about a week to whiten when your teeth are really yellow or discolored&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice and saw no need for more applications.&lt;br /&gt;You got to be careful not to put in the gum line or your gums wiil burn.&lt;br /&gt;I use this only twice a year and it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> Great product exactly what I purchased at the dentist office and paid three times more.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Thxs!</li>
            <li> All gels should be used sparingly, but since this one is up to 3 1/2 times more powerful that what my dentist sells, be careful to avoid an excess that will leak from the tray onto the gums, because the result will be unpleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had the courage to ask my dentist what he things of 35% strength, because what he sells is twelve times more expensive than this product, and I suspect most of the difference helps him make his boat payment!</li>
            <li> I originally bought Opalescence from my dentist, and that is quite expensive. I wanted to continue to whiten my teeth but could not afford that expense. I found the exact product here that my dentist offered so I bought it. I am glad I did. People comment on the unusual whiteness of my teeth; I just smile and say thank you. These really do whine your teeth but you want to make sure that you are also practicing great oral hygiene and seeing your dentist regularly. If not, then you run the risk of some really deep toothache. Additionally, in the beginning I was using too much of the product and it was causing some sores on my gums. After I decreased the amount and followed the guidelines that didn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Tip: if I wear the gel for 30 or more minutes my teeth will be sore the entire next day, but wearing the gel for 25 minutes doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> Positively the best deal!  Will buy again.  Some dentists will charge you as much as $50 for one tube.Best Buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Ive used it many times,  works great and my teeth are not sensitive. the package  arrived  fast</li>
            <li> I have used the 15% without problems.  Thought I would speed things up and try the 35%.  It was just too strong for my mouth, burned my gums and made them very sore!  I think this brand is great and have faith in their products, but I will stick with the 15% from now on.</li>
            <li> Way stronger than other 35% gels that I have tried.  Gums turned white then started to bleed in just under a minute.  For myself I&#x27;m going to stick with the 20% or 15%.</li>
            <li> As described. I whiten with them at least every other night or so. They work exactly like I&#x27;d expect. I have Invisalign braces and as they work like tooth trays already, my ortho said I could easily whiten with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyone else bad-mouthing this product, did you know what you were buying? Did you already have a tray? Do you know, anything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, whitens as designed, period.</li>
            <li> Received the product, everything is ok.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was not exactly the same as on the picture. On the picture the box is angular, but in reality it is round.&lt;br /&gt;For me that doesn&#x27;t make any difference, the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipped here so expeditiously, too.  This is my 2nd round of the 35% opalescence, having used the 15% variety for years before.  So easy to decide to use even right before going out.</li>
            <li> it made my teeth a little tender for a couple days but i love this product and i love my white smile</li>
            <li> Really works well. Don&#x27;t bother with anything less than the 35%.</li>
            <li> I used as directed, got results and this was much less expensive than something a dentist gave me (at high cost) which hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> What a deal!!  Nuff said</li>
            <li> These ended up costing me one thousand dollars .I used them for 3 days as written on the tiny piece of paper ..I actually was very excited when they were burning a little ..I read where some could be expired and don&#x27;t work ,So I figured it was fresh .Day 3 no whiter just hurt more ..when I took the trays off ..2 or my silver fillings were in the tray .I need my two teeth drilled and refilled .Amazon was very apologetic ...refunded my money immediately ..and if course told me to toss that out .I would love to know if this happened to anyone else .I don&#x27;t have dental insurance so this was an expensive lessen ...be happy with what god gave me .</li>
            <li> Love this whitening gel.  For the cost it is way cheaper then you would spend from a doctors office, it&#x27;s 35% which whitens your teeth quickly.  The gel also stays on your teeth better than other whiteners I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Whitener works good but irritated my gums I would probably try  a lower percent and get less quantity next time.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product and I have use several times, I live in Denmark and I get it very fast... This is a product whish really work</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for my teeth.Crest pro white strips work 10x better then this product. not worth the money. i threw mine away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 years. I smoke a little and drink cola, red wine, etc. my teeth are very white. I use this strength carefully. A few times I put too much in my custom made trays and had bloody pained gums. I have learned to use it small amount so as not to touch the gums. I got my teeth to a nice bright white and maintain by using it for 3 nights every few months. I first bought it from the dentist, then discovered on line purchasing and a four pack lasts me a year of maintenance. I keep it refrigerated until I need a syringe. One syringe lasts me 3 nights, as I only use it for my front teeth, as the rest are all procelin crowns.....it certainly gives me a pretty smile.</li>
            <li> Great results already after 2nd treatment. This PF is much better and quicker than using the PF 15% formula I&#x27;d been using previously.</li>
            <li> This is the best bleach I have found over the internet. Great product at a great price. Good results and much cheeper than going through your local dentist office.</li>
            <li> Great price beats the Dentist price  buy half!  A must get if you like to whiten your teeth often as i do.</li>
            <li> Continuing a personal teeth whitening routine, using custom-fitted forms, and these Opalescence syringes are handy for applying the gel to the forms. The mint taste is fine. Excellent results, as well.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM DID BURNED MY MOUTH COULDN&#x27;T EAT. I DIDN&#x27;T USE IT AND IT STILL WITH ME HERE. I WISH CAN RETURN IT FOR GET MY MONEY BACK AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE BETTER THAN IT.</li>
            <li> A little thinner and stickier then usual order&lt;br /&gt;But it has been a great product and works for me. And would reorder again</li>
            <li> Much better than all the strips I have tried before. You have to have a non sensitive mouth/gums to use this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing for me. It also arrived in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Better than the 12% dentist stuff. Just use a little bit or you burn your gums</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened this gel yet to see how effective it is but I have a 20 percent solution that Im finishing up and is the same brand (Opalescence) and love this bleach! However, the reason I bought this is because this seller stated New and Latest expiration dates. I did not see the label with the date anywhere, so I will just have to take his word for it.</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because this doesn&#x27;t seem&lt;br /&gt;As strong as what I get from dentist even though same brand?</li>
            <li> It works but I would recommend not getting the 35%. Very harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. I needed to whiten before getting crowns on my two front teeth (yes, yes ; )  and this was fast, easy and affordable. Much better than the toothpaste brands in the drugstores.  For the same price or cheaper you get professional quality and results with this product.  I would look into getting a custom mold however - I think it would enhance use.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this stuff, 35% is way too strong. There is no way to avoid some of the gel contacting the edges of your gums and when it does it will cause a chemical burn.  My gums are very tolerant of over the counter whitening gels but this stuff should only be sold to and used by a professional such as a dentist or dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really whitens my teeth, I have tried others and they make my teeth lighter but yellowish.</li>
            <li> My teeth are the whitest ever.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love these and love the price too</li>
            <li> 35%  (as opposed to 10% or 15%) is what I like . I have been using this for a long time and it works.</li>
            <li> if you want perfect tooth these is the solution, i love how my tooth looks, everybody talks about it also is very cheap than in the dentist, is the best way THANKS OPALESCENCE!!!!</li>
            <li> I was using the 22% from the dentist at 22.00 a tube and my teeth did not look any better. I ordered this product and WOW the difference is amazing, I have white teeth.  It does not burn my gums unless I have brushed to hard and have raw gums.  I am 55 years old a smoker and coffee drinker and you can&#x27;t tell by my teeth!!  If you are using the 22%, change to 35% and you will see the difference.  Great product, fresh and delivered very timely. Great Price..</li>
            <li> Achieve my expectation. Is very good product and I have suggest this to some of my friends also. They are also happy.</li>
            <li> I bought the opalesence 35% teeth whitening gel and I have custom made trays from my dentist. I cannot use this product because as soon as any of the gel touches my gum, it gives me an instant, white burn mark onto my gum. I put the minimum amount possible into the tray and only did the top front teeth so that I could focus on being extremely careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is a product that should only be used by a dentist, in a dental chair, with gum protection and painted on, with a guard to hold mouth open and lips back. Whenever you use a tray, inevitably, a small amount will touch the gum line, and as soon as this happens, this product needs to be removed or it will damage the gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel this product should be available for home use.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and liked it very much! Thanks for the purchase. I am pleased and will return.</li>
            <li> SAVED OVER TWO HUNDRED PERCENT.  GREAT DEAL AND WORKS WELL.  WOULD ONLY BUY THIS PRODUCT ON LINE.  THE DENTIST OFF IS WAY TO MUCH</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product and will continue to purchase this product.  I am a coffee, tea and red wine drinker.  Using the product I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like a coffee, tea and red wine drinker…lol.</li>
            <li> I paid several hundred dollars for the exact same product at my dentist.  I am so sorry I didn&#x27;t explore this purchase sooner.  35% is strong - dental strength and works awesome.  I bought a 3 pack and used only 1 set (4 syringes).  I learned from the dentist they will keep a year in the refrigerator!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have custom whitening trays and have used this brand for years, but this is our first time trying the 35% strength. Wow, we love it and will be using it in the future. It is so much easier to whiten in 30 minutes, rather than having to wear the trays all night! Also, using the 10% strength overnight would give me horrible tooth sensitivity. Amazingly, I have no problem with that anymore with using the 35% for 30 minutes. One word of caution though, don&#x27;t get the gel on your gums and let it sit, it will burn them!</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Much better pricing than my dentist</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from the dentist, however, this was much cheaper.  I don&#x27;t think these were as fresh.</li>
            <li> These have been great for quick touch ups! I find I don&#x27;t get the sensitivity if I use Sensodyne toothpaste for at least a few weeks prior to whitening.</li>
            <li> After 4 applications it really whitened my teeth.  However, this stuff is brutally strong so make sure you keep it off your gums as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Great product!  REAly Works fast.  TRICK to using whitening tray&#x27;s is to make sure your &amp;#34;TRAY&#x27;s are DRY&amp;#34; before fixing trays for use.  The peroxide gel won&#x27;t be as likely to leak out of your trays, then onto your gums, possiably burning you, if you start with a dry tray.  USE only in DRY TRAY!</li>
            <li> Worked very fast, much faster than expected when paired with my dentist made guards. People visibly noticed the difference after the second session. There was some slight irritation on the gums the few times, but that is expected due to the nature of the ingredients. It is best to do a couple of days, have a day off and then hit it again. Be patient! There was some light discolouration on my gums after each treatment. However, it was only momentarily discoloured and returned to normal after 15 minutes. It is important to post treat your teeth and I used GC Tooth Mousse as advised by many dentists because it is scientifically proven to protect tooth enamel. I found the taste quite neutral, but prepare yourself to become a spit factory!</li>
            <li> One of the best whitening products I tried.  Had gum irritation first time using it but the second time didn&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Got it from my dentist at first. Half price here. Even cheaper elsewhere but I like the convenience.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth as another product I used 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Gums will temporarily burn if too much is but in.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I have used this same product from my dentist.  It was just a little cheaper on-line.  It works very well and I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love it. You can see great results after one application. I use it as a touch up every month.</li>
            <li> This product works great ... far better than &#x27;Day White Excel&#x27;, &#x27;Nite White ACP&#x27; or the high priced &#x27;Generic Junk&#x27; from the dentist ... at a great price too.  30 minutes usually works for me, sometimes I&#x27;ll go up to 1 1/2 hours ... depending on my gum sensitivity.  As others have said, be careful when applying the gel near the gum area in the teeth whitening trays ... as the old saying goes, \\&quot;a little dab will do ya\\&quot; ... it can burn your gums ... which will subside shortly after you remove the trays and rinse the gel out of your mouth; but it can leave your gums sore.  I find that sometimes I need to brush gently 2-4 days after using the product due to gum sensitivity.  This product is perfect for getting your teeth their whitest and then giving them an occasional whitening tune-up!</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth sensivtive at all but it well bleach your gums so be carefull.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made one a little stronger like 45% due to smoking years ago. But over all it&#x27;s the best product out there.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and works very well when paired with opalescence tooth paste. Actually helps in whitening teeth, just don&#x27;t drink sodas or anything that&#x27;ll stain your teeth!</li>
