            <li>The toothbrush remains great</li>
            <li>I think these sonic brushes do a great job.  </li>
            <li>so the kid is now brushing happily for four  minutes--</li>
            <li>This is a great brush.  </li>
            <li>The price is great for both the unit and the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>A great brush at a great price</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is great unless water happens to get into the mechanism that holds the brush onto the body.  </li>
            <li>I love this!!  </li>
            <li>The Sensonic Waterpik is a remarkable product that&#x27;ll leave you and your mouth happy.  </li>
            <li>A remarkable duration.</li>
            <li>is the latest Waterpik product I have used and the best .</li>
            <li>Good product for a great price.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST brush out there, I believe I have tried most if not all of the others, they do not compare.</li>
            <li>Please--especially if you&#x27;ve never experience this level of awesome toothbrush--BUY THIS BRUSH! :)</li>
            <li>My teeth are very clean after using this toothbrush and I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I would call a pleasant, noticeable buzz    </li>
            <li>What an awesome feeling to have clean teeth and gums!    </li>
            <li>Better rigorous investigation required for best choice; my experience is these 3 brands are fine, but Waterpic appears best.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all a superb product that I can strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise...</li>
            <li>Life is good with these two products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik got fairly good reviews in comparison</li>
            <li>And it does feel good and look good</li>
            <li>seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>I owned the predecessor to this toothbrush (200w) and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good value and a good price.</li>
            <li>But what is really good is the pik.</li>
            <li>Every dental visit I dreaded, knowing that they would admonish me for failing to form good oral hygiene routines, and</li>
            <li>We &#x27;ve been using the Waterpiks for years with good results.</li>
            <li>Before this, I used and loved the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik Sensonic did a good job</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife after getting a good deal through our health insurance.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about this product.  </li>
            <li>Durability has been mostly good.  </li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d try this because it was cheaper and had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>The sonic effect while brushing is very good and my teeth feel very  clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great for all the reasons the reviewers who liked it liked it.  </li>
            <li>That made the Waterpik very appealing.      </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if sensonic is really better, but my teeth feel great.</li>
            <li>SOOO great brush, wish it were more modular re pricing.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning and in combination with the Waterpik Ultra Waterjet, my mouth feels very clean.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik gets it right - great product for a great price.  </li>
            <li>though - make sure you turn it off before you take it out of your mouth, or you may need to do another face cleaning!</li>
            <li>I really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They just kind of just sit there so</li>
            <li>~520 Hz + ultrasonic blast [peculiarly, have not found information demonstrating ultrasound is effective: thus dubious]  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great toothbrush and does an excellent job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>nice speed and vibration (2 speeds:</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice about the brush is that it has a two minute timer that will shut the brush off when finished.  </li>
            <li>I know of no problems with this kind of powered brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled I tried this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this toothbrush on December 31, 2011 after years of owning, and loving, Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>It has better features and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover that I have fewer problems with brushing now than I did before.</li>
            <li>The width fits nicely into your hand--there is no awkwardness at all in manipulating the  brush.    </li>
            <li>the charger,  brush, two brush heads (nice to use with family) and an in-between brush head (which my six-year-old also likes to use</li>
            <li>The Waterpik comes with two brush head, a pick head (for the gums) and a convienient charger stand that fits nicely on the bathroom</li>
            <li>Waterpik is an excellent toothbrush, and if you use it, you&#x27;ll get that Straight</li>
            <li>(It does look nice.)  </li>
            <li>High is best for cleaning under the gums.  </li>
            <li>This also works wonders for my six-year-old who now brushes happily for the full length.    </li>
            <li>We just started using a new dentist, and his cleaning method was wonderful - something akin to a sandblast with water and baking soda.  </li>
            <li>Well, for a while it was a fine substitute for the Sonicare, being every bit as good as the products I&#x27;d owned from the competing brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was clearly the best value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it is a great toothbrush and worth the price.</li>
            <li>WaterPik did a great job designing and building this brush, and proves their confidence in it with a two year warranty.</li>
            <li>The quad timer is useful and the unit looks great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike some brands, this toothbrush comes with everything you need (except for toothpaste, lol) right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Gets my teeth clean, a fair price and has lower cost replacement brushes....</li>
            <li>It also stops after two minutes, which is considered by some to be the optimum time to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>The holder, unlike the brush itself, does feel cheaply made and flimsy, and the brush heads don&#x27;t fit great on their holders.  </li>
            <li>First off - Sonic toothbrushes are great.  </li>
            <li>, it felt very comfortable in the hand and mouth.  </li>
            <li>The stand/base/charger feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>Great, Delivered in very timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>I thought electric toothbrushes were overrated, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product and have already recommended it to several people.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>they will toughen up and be able to handle full-speed in no time.  </li>
            <li>I said bye bye to most if not all of the plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>I feel confident that I&#x27;m brushing my teeth for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the Waterpik Sensonic \\&quot;and the replacement</li>
            <li>I have ordered 2 more for my children.  </li>
            <li>My individual, nonscientific view: Waterpic seems excellent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be glad to save your effort by forwarding my literature search &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many electronic toothbrushes over the years including rotodent, braun and interplaque.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush itself re strength of pulse, feel in my hand, length of charge.</li>
            <li>Decided to buy a sonic toothbrush to take better care of my teeth as I do not make it to the dentist as often as I should.</li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>It also massages the gums as it cleans, making them feel better as well as refreshed by removing the gum soreness</li>
            <li>We both love it.  </li>
            <li>It is, in my opinion and experience, the top of the line.</li>
            <li>Brushing your teeth with an electric toothbrush is ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>so I found myself using the manual most of the time.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do nothing that would cause more dental problems than I already had.  </li>
            <li>This one was the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, I could buy my own, but even the cheap electric toothbrushes come with a plastic cap which covers the bristles.</li>
            <li>With so many electrical gadgets, mounting allows us to get it out of the way.  </li>
            <li>and they brush better using this brush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>Almost totally satisfied with this product, except I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;stop&#x27; feature at all.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it comes with two seperate brush heads (one for him and one for her), along with an interdental brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is an attractive set-up and good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like to have known more about how it worked, what frequencies are used, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this</li>
            <li>Having been a user of the Oral-B ProfessionalCare series for many years, I was eager to give Waterpik&#x27;s product entry into the uber-competitive electric toothbrush market a try.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly though, the brush itself will turn off after two minutes which may or may not be an annoyance to some.  </li>
            <li>They just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with it&#x27;s quality of performance and ease of usage.    </li>
            <li>The Water Pik Sensonic did not, so there&#x27;s even more value from a Sonicare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would always promise that I would do better.  </li>
            <li>The reviews for this toothbrush were great, and gave me a lot of hope that it would help me with my teeth and gums as much as it had helped others.  </li>
            <li>I have had the toothbrush for about one month now, and the difference in my mouth is astonishing.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik is MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>Charging takes most of a day before the indicator stops flashing.  </li>
            <li>and I feel more confident that I am doing a thorough job.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is just sized better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost is well within reason for such a wonderful instrument.    </li>
            <li>Excellent plaque removal after only 1-2 brushings.  </li>
            <li>In comparing to the Sonicare, it got more power</li>
            <li>I wish there was a better way to manage the speeds (perhaps a separate button for each speed instead of a multi-press.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I guess I am one of those people who cannot use an electric toothbrush as much as I&#x27;d love to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with the Oral-B Pro 1000.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I am ok having fewer office cleanings.</li>
            <li>I loved it the first two or three times I used it, but then the very fine brush point ended up not working as well.  </li>
            <li>While the Sonicare units clean your teeth well, the Waterpik Sensonic does it as well or better (with more effective oscillation) and stays substantially cleaner.</li>
            <li>Best not to leave this one too close to the toilet or trashcan</li>
            <li>Great price from Amazon, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use the high setting and it leaves my mouth feeling great.</li>
            <li>It does an outstanding job of getting my teeth clean, and makes my gums pretty happy as well.</li>
            <li>It should be effective, reliable, easy to use, and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very comfortable, the timer works just fine</li>
            <li>(I have to do that to clean them!</li>
            <li>I was able to clean it up with a wire brush and it seems to work OK now.</li>
            <li>Along with the Water Pik Flosser, the two combined are the best $100 I ever spent on my health.</li>
            <li>Use speed 1 for gentle cleaning; Use speed 2 for superior plaque removal.</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use, with just one button to worry about.</li>
            <li>Tips are easy to change and identify.</li>
            <li>I was sure that after Philips bought the company they would redesign the product so that it would be easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I found this toothbrush easy to charge, easy to use and easy to store between uses.</li>
            <li>Easy to switch heads.  </li>
            <li>It will leave gunk along gum line even in easy to reach places.</li>
            <li>cleaner\\&quot;; easy to control and operate.    </li>
            <li>I found this toothbrush surprisingly easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is easy to use, just plug in and let it charge for 16 hours before you use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to change the brushheads, and the recharging unit makes them easy to store -- there are storage spots for the unit and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The heads come out to easily</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for almost two years, and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>So what is good about this particular one?  </li>
            <li>The manual should be a good reference to people who are new to electric toothbrushes or the brand, not just multilingual eye-candy.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve owned two sonicares and it was easily on par with the Elite Pro) cheap replacement heads</li>
            <li>The toothbrush, itself, works just fine</li>
            <li>Easy and comfortable to grasp for two minutes.    </li>
            <li>This worked fine for about 5 months.</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>The brush worked fine out of the box and for about 1 year.</li>
            <li>This way you can be sure you&#x27;re spending an adequate amount of time cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the other brands of sonic toothbrushes, but the Waterpik has the strongest vibes and does the best job, is easiest to clean.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great sonic brush, my teeth feel a lot cleaner and the brush is a lot more gentle on my teeth and gums than normal brushing.  </li>
            <li>My six-year-old handles it fine, but it doesn&#x27;t at all feel overly light or cheaply made.</li>
            <li>many people, we have a pedestal sink, not a cabinet with a large counter top.  </li>
            <li>They have also gone from bright red to a more muted pink-a sign of health.</li>
            <li>One huge plus to this device is the timer setting for each area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention that the price on Amazon is fantastic?</li>
            <li>Thought the last one was great, but now I have the Waterpik Sensonic</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the mechanism is comfortably tingly and tickly, even on the backs of my teeth and in places where I have sore gums.  </li>
            <li>It is also more economical when you have to replace the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Much more powerful than the battery operated model we had been using.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;interdental brush\\&quot; is quite nice and seems to do a very efficient job of cleaning between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, use a light touch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, while this is a great toothbrush, it falls short of a five-star rating in my book.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an indicator light to let you know when it has fully charged.  </li>
            <li>If I do end up ruining this toothbrush, I will replace it without hesitation because it does such a great job.</li>
            <li>The head now swivels freely.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless this is an outstanding dental product and well worth trying.</li>
            <li>It has several attractive features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>so I was worried that a sonic toothbrush would be more hassle than it was worth.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, especially short trips you don&#x27;t need to bring the charger.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so smooth</li>
            <li>it work great, its quite even if it close to u, it didnt wakeup the kids if the door was open.</li>
            <li>Nov. 2012 - compact heads are no longer available on Amazon</li>
            <li>light pulling of the power cord will slide it out of position.</li>
            <li>, overall it does a great job</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am quite surprised to feel so enthusiastic about a teeth cleaning product, but I really, really, love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>While mostly plastic, it seems solidly built, and feels good in my hand.    </li>
            <li>I was pleased to not have to spend money right away on chargers or brush heads to try it out.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very nice product with the quality one would expect from Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li>The interdental brush is a very useful adjunct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good cleaning action with timed quads for full brushing.</li>
            <li>First and most importantly</li>
            <li>Original post:    </li>
            <li>This works wonderfully for me because, in the morning, I&#x27;m not exactly at my most awake.      </li>
            <li>It is much more ergonomic than my first brush, which always felt like I was trying to brush with a shovel or something.    </li>
            <li>Now, I love it, but I was willing to give this baby a try.  </li>
            <li>that alone is worth it!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable for me and does not feel large.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and my teeth feel polished after every use.  </li>
            <li>The two speeds available seem to be adequate.</li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth with a really clean feel.</li>
            <li>Additionally teeth feel clean after using it, just like after a cleaning.    </li>
            <li>I tried an Oral B and did not feel my teeth were clean after using.  </li>
            <li>so clean (except after my twice a year cleaning and check-up from my dentist).  </li>
            <li>It does a very nice job of cleaning and the battery charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I found the brush very easy, almost fun, to use, although the somewhat large size and vibrating bristles spraying toothpaste/saliva required modifications in my brushing method.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve ever used, you don&#x27;t know how much better you can clean your mouth with a modern electric.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this waterpik product very much and am so very glad to have it for my daily use.</li>
            <li>is still a great product but you need to be careful not to press to against your teeth and gums if you use it at full strength.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush for between the teeth I feel is was a wise investment.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush automatically shuts off after 2 minutes, and if I want to brush longer, I must push the button again- once for low-speed and twice for full speed.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with how much brighter and cleaner my teeth are with using this product along with the water flosser.</li>
            <li>The two speeds are good as well for different types of brushing along with the brush heads themselves.  </li>
            <li>also own a Braun Oral B Triumph Professional Care 900.  </li>
            <li>I like the fresh smooth feel of my teeth afterwards.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is really gentle, the vibrating/scrubbing motion is mostly at the end of the toothbrush where it belongs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
            <li>for full refund.</li>
            <li>Battery charge is good for several days to a week after being fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I strongly advise anyone interested in a sonic toothbrush to forego this product and get the Sonicare Elite.  </li>
            <li>sure beats the Phillips and Braun products and many independent trials rate the SR 1000 equal or superior to them.&lt;br /&gt;Finding</li>
            <li>Love my new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>when I wake up, my mouth feels fresh and clean and not at all yucky or slimy.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was still in the bathroom</li>
            <li>I have used a few models from the 3 companies itemized below; all seem good, but I find Waterpic better.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating frequency is amazing, yet it is very quiet and quite comfortable when brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A quick list of my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m lucky to get a 2-minute cycle out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this means to keep tissue healthy.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the high speed setting just doesn&#x27;t work with this brush.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I love the high.  </li>
            <li>long as this motion is what you want/expect - it would be a good item.  </li>
            <li>This brush on high is great for people that only take a minute to brush.</li>
            <li>A detailed electric toothbrush search in Medline shows Oral B generally fares better than Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Two speeds: the fast is quite fast and leaves a great feeling in the mouth (fair warning--put it in your mouth and close your mouth before hitting the high speed if you want to avoid a mess).  </li>
            <li>DO NOT REMOVE BRUSH FROM MOUTH WITHOUT TURNING THE UNIT OFF FIRST!  </li>
            <li>I think the Waterpik brand electric toothbrushes have the best design, but they are very hard to find.</li>
            <li>This occurs especially easily with the toothbrush resting on the pedestal because of the Sensonic&#x27;s weight and resultant high center of gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the very first electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve tried, I have always been hesitant to use one thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective as a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>suppose the quality of the Sensonic toothbrush is very good - but the bristle tufts are stationary; that is, they do not move, although the entire head is whipping sideways back and forth at a rapid rate.  </li>
            <li>Since there is not that good of a rubber grip, the toothbrush ends up slipping  upward in my hand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Sensonic Professional Toothbrush for over a year, and happily use it several times a day.</li>
            <li>rare these days.</li>
            <li>Instead, they added a brush type floss-er tool which rarely gets used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and I really liked this one overall.  </li>
            <li>After considerable tugging, I was able to get it off.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product, but the short life span drove me away to $10 AA toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brushes are multilevel like many current manual brushes, and sport rounded bristle ends to be more gentle to gums.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this for me because my old one stopped working after about 6 years.</li>
            <li>and I have to throw away 2 of them ($12 worth) because the toothbrush stopped working.</li>
            <li>This unit has two speed, both useful and without injury to gums.</li>
            <li>it has the 30 second pauses to move the brush to another quandrant which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I had wanted the pricier, more well-known brand of electric sonic toothbrushes, but decided the smart thing to do (mainly because I am unemployed...)</li>
            <li>It would also be nice to have some warning light or some other notification before the battery charge runs out---</li>
            <li>Studies show sonic brushes are better than manual or other powered types of brushes, while being better for your gums.    </li>
            <li>It has an ergonomic handle that fits perfectly in your hand, and the on/off switch is high enough up that you don&#x27;t have problems with accidentally switching it off mid brush.  </li>
            <li>I can feel the higher speed as it has a noticeable difference, but it is not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>first that anybody looking at these has already decided to spend more than the 1/49 for a toothbrush (or waiting for the free one at the dentist) and second, that they&#x27;ll price compare and decide what their range is.  </li>
            <li>Use a gentle touch, more pressure does NOT mean cleaner.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good electric toothbrush with really no complaints.  </li>
            <li>I find that to really get my teeth clean</li>
            <li>It will allow people to clean their teeth without effort and yet very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>The larger brush heads are great for everyday use, but I like to use the interdental brush for very precise cleaning-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I focused more on brushing my teeth (and spent more time doing it) with the Waterpik than when I used to brush manually, but I don&#x27;t think that will simply be a \\&quot;trend\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>, I use the high speed setting and take a full cycle on the bottom teeth and a full cycle on the top teeth for a total of 4 minutes.    </li>
            <li>Apparently, the power of the vibrations obliterates plaque and other debris more effectively than applying more pressure with a brush directly.</li>
            <li>One uses much less pressure than with a manual brush, which is good news for gums, since they don&#x27;t like the abrasion that comes with too strenuous a brushing style.</li>
            <li>In combination and regular use my teeth and gums have shown noticeable improvement according to my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is comfortable to hold and on both speeds it is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very picky about my teeth...</li>
            <li>its current price, the Sensonic Pro provides great value and is a terrific budget alternative to Oral-B and Sonicare while providing (for the most part) almost equal results in terms of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>A single charge is good for 1 week of normal use (2x a day)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other electric toothbrushes and some of them are pretty good, but I really like this one and plan to stick with it for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Brushing with the Sensonic leaves my teeth feeling smooth and clean as if I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I have 18 crowns and two dental implants and this brush on the high setting for the full time does NOT make my gums bleed.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling of the ultrasonic cleaning and recommend the purchase of the Waterpik for both the high level of cleaning and the low cost of the replacement brush heads (which are just a bit more than a regular toothbrush).  </li>
            <li>The intensity of the high speed is very high, I rarely use this setting, but it really depends, some people may be comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>The seal is not very tight, so this can easily happen.  </li>
            <li>First off, I am not an employee or have any interest in Waterpik.</li>
            <li>a larger rubber grip would have made this brush much better.</li>
            <li>This is my first toothbrush from Sensonic</li>
            <li>I took it one step further just to be sure and looked up the price of replacement heads on all the brands</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 12 years...</li>
            <li>And that is exactly what I got when I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>Very similar to the original sonicare, for you original toothbrush gangstas.</li>
            <li>The first unit I had lasted 16 years.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this toothbrush based on an article which claimed it was better than the Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>I think the product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>When you first get the toothbrush, it will need to charge for 16 hours.  </li>
            <li>Since the standard heads come with color bands at the bottom, this toothbrush could be shared by more than one person.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really unfortunate too, because if it weren&#x27;t for these issues, this would be a wonderful 5-star</li>
            <li>That would open too many doors that some would prefer remain shut.    </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t spray the mirror, but your mouth feels so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>The timed reminders help you make sure you are giving equal attention to each area of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having suffered many tooth problems over the last couple of years (and $1000 of dollars in insurance copay)</li>
            <li>Overall I prefer ultrasonic type toothbrushes over the electric models that scrub and rub and they are better than hand brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toothbrush operates on two levels, a lower vibration and a higher vibration.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare&#x27;s handle is more narrow/smaller around and is easier for my (female) hand to hold.</li>
            <li>It does such a better job than hand brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d absolutely buy this again and feel it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this brush came with 2 smaller, addition brush heads than my pricy Sonicare did, and the power of the brush is fabulous!</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m not going to deal with cost, assuming two things:  </li>
            <li>it takes 16 hrs for the first then charges almost immediately after that,   </li>
            <li>It takes a while to get used to letting the brush do the work, but my teeth feel thoroughly cleaned after each use, probably more than when I use a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t recommended a charging behavior, except that the first charge must be 16 hours.</li>
            <li>I thought electric toothbrushes were supposed to make life more simple, my experience did not show that to be the case.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing it has 2 year warranty, but it&#x27;s a lot of hassle to have them replaced every few months.</li>
            <li>This product also conveniently comes with 2 brush-heads, an inderdental cleaner as well as a wall mount insuring that you&#x27;re good to go for a few months before having to dip into the accessories market.</li>
            <li>Spend 5-10 seconds in each spot, gently work the longer bristles between the teeth and right along the gum line.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush and toothbrush heads fit loosely on the stand, which looks cheap when they wobble around.  </li>
            <li>They are superb quality for less money than other brand names.  </li>
            <li>I am a healthy 23-year old, who has luckily gone through life with only one cavity.  </li>
            <li>This is not the most expensive sonic toothbrush I have used, but it is definitely a good buy for its price if you care about your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waterpik guarantees positive results in 14 days.</li>
            <li>All the research I have found is quite positive about the benefits of these brushes, and there have been no reported problems healthwise.</li>
            <li>Two other reviewers, both dated April 4 2009 seem to have experienced related problems.</li>
            <li>and what I really was interested in trying about the Waterpik</li>
            <li>It gives you a very thorough brushing, leaving you with that super clean, just left the dentist office feeling, and THEN you use the Interdental attachment...</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is just as good, if not better than the Ultreo...and it has the added bonus of the attachment.  </li>
            <li>Was not sure I would like the Sonic, but it turns out that it was a good choice.</li>
            <li>, I have to sit on the dental chair for over 30 mins and come back with a fresh clean feeling - but it also comes with bleeding gums.    </li>
            <li>Seem to be about the appropriate size and last for a decent amount of time as well.  </li>
            <li>Physically, the unit itself is quite handsome and in terms of design stands well on par with the high end Oral-B and Sonicare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only bone to pick is that the pedestal upon which the toothbrush is recharged and its accessories rest is rather easily overturned and the pedestal&#x27;s plastic construction can break.</li>
            <li>The brush head is smaller, which I like because I can clean the back of my front teeth better.  </li>
            <li>wand is easy to work with and you get just enough of a buzz, (vibrating levels) that circulates within your mouth.</li>
            <li>It comes with an extra brushhead and the heads are color coded so it is easy to share the toothbrush (</li>
            <li>There are simple care and use instructions which are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I made some nice toothpaste-spot \\&quot;art\\&quot; on my black shirt and mirror.</li>
            <li>If you pull of the top after brushing, rinse it off, and keep it somewhere separated where each piece can dry, there will never be a problem.  </li>
            <li>I certainly would.  </li>
            <li>The Water Pik was fine while it lasted, but it cost me more than the Sonicare brushes I&#x27;d been using and proved to be far less durable.  </li>
            <li>Most brushes come with a 2 minute timer and 30 second quadrant reminder, so nothing new here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the Sensonic Pro does provide 2 brush-speeds (low and high) - the low is almost too gentle, ideally suited for young children or those with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>In general I like it and have had 2 dental cleaning since my purchase and the hygienist said my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush did a fine job while it worked, but that was for only seven days.</li>
            <li>A month later, the toothbrush seems to be holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li>The low speed is fine for the interdental brushing and my six-year-old    charger:  </li>
            <li>We already have a wall-mounted soap dish to free up space, but still there&#x27;s little free surface room, and some of what there is is curved, so</li>
            <li>The only replacement heads that are available everywhere are the Oral-B ones.  </li>
            <li>This means I have to really force myself to spend two minutes with a tooth brush in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the modern age.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my current unit, as I make sure to clean and dry the it before returning it to the charging stand.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very reliable brand.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik Sensonic really does the job.  </li>
            <li>Our teeth feel so much cleaner every day, and the brushes (it comes with two) are removable for cleaning and replaceable.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very well designed.  </li>
            <li>so seems it may work much longer.</li>
            <li>Great product only issue is it is not international voltage, meaning only can be use in US not in Asia countries.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was going to like this feature until I had it.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has never used an automatic toothbrush has a real treat in store for them.</li>
            <li>but then it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Never great when a product conks out, but I would have happily bought another.  </li>
            <li>I have bought three of the Waterpiks, for my whole family.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothbrush worked really well while it lasted...</li>
            <li>With all that in mind, the Sensonic Professional really makes it even easier to maintain the appropriate standards for the daily care of your</li>
            <li>According to our dentist, it has really improved the health of our teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s more of a personal opinion, but at least this brush is well designed and nicely built.  </li>
            <li>so you know when to switch to the different section of your mouth (top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back).  </li>
            <li>We wanted heads for the whole family which cost $25 each for the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li>The brush seems very well built and designed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this much, but it seems to work</li>
            <li>There are two speeds to fit different needs -- my wife likes the slower speed</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel and look very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Yeah, I know, real geek stuff.)</li>
            <li>It really cleans her teeth and gets between the teeth</li>
            <li>I cannot begin to tell anyone who is reading this just how much this has helped the health of my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li>Was in Barbardos for a week and it help up the whole time.  </li>
            <li>This was the very model he suggested.  </li>
            <li>I received it a couple weeks ago, and I must say I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll accidentally turn it on fast.  </li>
            <li>Not that there was much guesswork to begin</li>
            <li>reasonable price too</li>
            <li>Holds charge quite well and is very compact in terms of it&#x27;s footprint.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li>Although replacement heads are available for the regular heads</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like much (hence 4 instead of 5 stars)</li>
            <li>While you wouldn&#x27;t want to submerge the entire toothbrush since it doesn&#x27;t appear to be watertight near the battery, you can run water over the top end and even around the button area after use.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>I like the nice touch of the brief pause telling you 30 second</li>
            <li>Weight:  a nice heft to it without at all feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>While it does hold the toothbrush and 4 different toothbrush heads, it is light weight and easily topples over (minor gripe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has never been an issue and if I travel for 7 days or less, I only have to bring the brush as it will easily hold a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li>Quality so far seems good, and it came with a large and small brush head and an inter-dental cleaner.      </li>
            <li>This study demonstrated Waterpik Sensonic Toothbrush performed better than the other brands; this article prompted my purchasing this model.     </li>
            <li>chose the WaterPik because I have used their other products and always been pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the older model I had, it is much</li>
            <li>This model comes with a regular toothbrush head and a pointy shaped tool that can be used to clean the gum line or where the teeth</li>
            <li>year product life seemed a reasonable, although not ideal, product life expectancy and it has done a great job of meeting the dental cleaning needs for me and my family.</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it works in place of the old fashion do it yourselfer but</li>
            <li>It makes me more conscious of how well I&#x27;m brushing my teeth, and how long I brush them.</li>
            <li>have owned an older model Oral B toothbrush for 5 years and it is still going strong (the battery doesn&#x27;t hold as long of a charge, but still completes all the cleanings).</li>
            <li>I was bothered by how tiny the heads were; I have pretty big teeth, generally speaking, and I like have a nice fat set of bristles to work with.  </li>
            <li>If the battery dies, I will be crushed, because my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li>toothbrush head is all one length and not good as some of the more dental friendly options out there</li>
            <li>Yet, for the technical ingenuity behind this enhancement, I have to admit the best feature of the Sensonic Professional is the built-in timer, which automatically turns off the brush after two minutes.</li>
            <li>First, the bristles on the toothbrushes are relatively soft.</li>
            <li>It does come with a wall mount, which would be nice if you have a small space to work with in your bathroom    </li>
            <li>There for about 4 years my dentist was discovering a new cavatie at every visit!</li>
            <li>I have never had this problem with my previous electric brushes, of which there have been many, and I do not want to mount this thing on my wall.</li>
            <li>this product costs less than most, but it has the features.</li>
            <li>To sum it up, if you&#x27;re looking to replace your regular toothbrush with something that does more for your dental health, look no further than the Waterpik Sensonic.  </li>
            <li>, they called back quickly and sent a replacement unit.  </li>
            <li>The 30 second timer segments help make sure you devote enough time to each quadrant.</li>
            <li>There was only one speed, but it did an adequate job.  </li>
            <li>That is why I can&#x27;t give 5-stars, but I am GLAD I didn&#x27;t cave in to the hype from Oral B for a MORE expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li>regular and super fast)&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>Whoever had the idea to save a few cents and not use a stainless steel rod will probably cost Waterpik more than they save.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works just as well as or better than its more expensive counterparts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of the cheaper electric toothbrushes and while they are better than manual, this is still a step above that.  </li>
            <li>well, only complaint is that the interdental brush isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As is standard with most powered toothbrushes these days, the Sensonic Pro will pulse every 30 seconds to remind you to switch to the next quadrant in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>those much older than me were tackling.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik Sensonic is something which really stands out from the rest of them - I have the same fresh feeling like that</li>
            <li>I get from getting my teeth cleaned with a dentist - mainly because of the using both the toothbrush and the interdental cleaner.    </li>
            <li>I did do some independent research online and found several studies (non-industry) showing these type of brushes are more efficient at removing plaque and</li>
            <li>This Waterpik with the timer is wonderful, letting you know when you&#x27;ve spent enough time on each area of your mouth and then having the dental head to get the spots between the teeth that are hard to clean and stain easily, especially with tea and soda drinkers.    </li>
            <li>I have dentin hypersensitivity, which is due to the gums receding, enamel eroding, and dentin becoming exposed.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I would highly recommend this toothbrush, along with a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush over all the rest.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I use it on high speed, it splatters everywhere and messes up my mirror.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;ve checked, you&#x27;ll see that their sticker price is quite high.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Now I use the high speed all the time.  </li>
            <li>It is an electric toothbrush that vibrates at high frequencies.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommended the Waterpik over others because the brush is just a bit larger than the other popular brands.</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s some bristles and little elbow grease when you&#x27;re talking about a set of healthy chompers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never want to go back to hand brushing again because after each brushing,  the ultrasonic toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling as clean and polished just as it does after a professional teeth cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like your teeth have been professionally cleaned each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>To Waterpik&#x27;s credit, they do advise pulling the head off and to clean and dry off the handle after each use.  </li>
            <li>Second, replacement brush heads are reasonably prices and available locally.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>One brush even lasted me nearly 10 years, which I know is unusual, but this Sensonic dying in under 2 years is unforgivable considering the steep price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The fast mode is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the Sensonic, I had to use the gentle setting-the regular setting hurt and made my gums bleed.</li>
            <li>It is quiet but powerful.</li>
            <li>replacement brushes might be a problem since the Waterpik product is rarely found at the chain and big box stores.</li>
            <li>The company has long since expanded to electric toothbrushes that consolidate our mandatory dental tasks knowing full well that we are all passively resistant to the onerous task of brushing our teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It is a minor nuisance to start it back up again if you need more time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that stable plus it&#x27;s just a waste of counter top space.  </li>
            <li>Which one is the normal speed?</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t clean my teeth much better than an ordinary toothbrush, and they vibrated way too much and were quite rough.  </li>
            <li>It has a habit of stopping right in the middle of a teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I have this item for about 17 months now and it runs like new.</li>
            <li>: Our new dental hygienist asked me if I used a sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>If there is a problem they will send you a new one with no questions asked...</li>
            <li>New brush would not charge.  </li>
            <li>, i searched and searched for a new charger, to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine any brushing on high, but I can only imagine that a person&#x27;s gums will become very tough and healthy if they can handle the top setting.      </li>
            <li>The bristles are actually very soft.  </li>
            <li>There is no added sensitivity as far as I felt with the  high speed.</li>
            <li>Mine have only gotten more and more sensitive the few months I have used this toothbrush, and I have only used it on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>The high setting may be too much for small children or people with advanced gum disease.</li>
            <li>1- Charge for 16h prior to first use</li>
            <li>Wow!     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the exact same model for two years.  </li>
            <li>Oral B 5000 small head, rotary motion; somewhat better reviews than Sonicare [Medline search]  </li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews...</li>
            <li>My old one lasted 6 years!  </li>
            <li>Even more unfortunately, they had discontinued my original model.  </li>
            <li>My first one only cost $25.00!</li>
            <li>I am not sure i am going to buy more of this brand.  </li>
            <li>the many years Sonicare has been making their brushes, I&#x27;ve only owned 3 of them, but they&#x27;ve all lasted well over 5 years before needing to be replaced due to the batteries wearing out.  </li>
            <li>This way my wife and I can brush at the same time and not have to race to get to the bathroom first.</li>
            <li>I had to send back the first one because it did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>, I have not been able to find replacement heads for the small head - although this might be it [</li>
            <li>But if you enjoy electric toothbrushes and you want your money&#x27;s worth, I advise you to seriously think about picking up a Sensonic Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 30 second timer, the professional design and the financial investment will ensure that I&#x27;ll be more motivated to give my teeth their proper attention at each brushing.</li>
            <li>No damage to gum as long as you apply the right pressure while cleaning - it takes 3-4 days to get used to the brush.  </li>
            <li>toothbrushes\\&quot; are almost half the price of their competitors without sacrificing primary features.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the size of the unit and the comfort in holding it.</li>
            <li>gums.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does the job and cleaning is very high quality, only if you can live the aobve mention caveats.</li>
            <li>When I finally decided to try one, it wasn&#x27;t a positive experience.  </li>
            <li>The two normal brushes are nice in that they come with a colored base, so if more than one person is using the brush, you can tell the heads apart.  </li>
            <li>I returned my first order within a week of arrival, as the unit would not even operate long enough for a single two-minute use (Battery would die and need a minimum of 16h in the charger before the batt indicator light stopped blinking).  </li>
            <li>This helps clear food particles in those areas as well as stimulate the gum tissue and prevent periodontal problems.</li>
            <li>Waterpik has come a long way since my parents first bought a Dental Water Jet in the early 1970&#x27;s, a jet-stream tool with a water tank that we were supposed to use after brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear there was an electrical problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that the metal piece was misaligned and no longer functioned</li>
            <li>(hey, Starbucks, how about getting to work on inventing Clear Coffee?).  </li>
            <li>This goes directly on the toothbrush handle.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never had an ultrasonic toothbrush and are using a \\&quot;manual\\&quot;, standard toothbrush, you&#x27;re in for a real treat.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush lives up to its billing.  </li>
            <li>that the toothbrush just signal that the 2 minutes are complete and keep on running.      </li>
            <li>B00132FUNG Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>I needed to replace a toothbrush that looked much like this one, but where each tuft of bristles twirled individually.  </li>
            <li>The green light blinks but the hanndle does not turn on.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to send them the old one or any proof of purchase.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Interplak electric that was losing battery recharge capability</li>
            <li>I never had this problem with my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It has advantages over my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It even provides an automatic pause at thirty-second intervals to signal when you should be complete with each quadrant in your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, it feels like Waterpik has really listened to their customers and made an electric toothbrush that stops just short of brushing your teeth for you.as really listened to their customers and made an electric toothbrush that stops just short of brushing your teeth for you.</li>
            <li>I still feel like I&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning after each use.  </li>
            <li>No luck -- even with drying it after every use it still developed cracks and the circuit board inside was charred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having said that, the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush is not all I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>For what it does, the cost seems quite reasonable -- especially given that it can be shared by two (or three, with the purchase of an additional brushhead)</li>
            <li>only drawback I see is that there is no indicator on the toothbrush as to how much charge remains.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The high-speed does provide a satisfactory cleanse while still maintaining that overall gentle sensation throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It scared me to find myself so young and already going through issues</li>
            <li>adult hands</li>
            <li>The two-speed feature allowed me to get used to the action without damaging the gum line.  </li>
            <li>I keep going for the professional dental cleaning every 6 months because my dental insurance provider reccommends it.  </li>
            <li>After using this for at least a month, my teeth and gums are in much better condition.  </li>
            <li>I noticed marked reduction in the plaque deposits.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see whether it really has the next time I have a dental cleaning and check-up.</li>
            <li>After all, our ancestors were, to my understanding, once brushing their teeth with old pine cones.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve read that it uses a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery, which means that memory issues occur if it is removed from power before the charge is complete.</li>
            <li>I find the manual to be very ambiguous because it doesn&#x27;t say anything specific on usage.</li>
            <li>The button to turn it on is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>If not caught early, the replacement brush head can get stuck and the toothbrush is ruined.  </li>
            <li>I waited until my latest professional dental cleaning to write this review, because I wanted to see if there would be ANY improvement in removing the plague from my teeth, or at least keeping my gums healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; It also has the prototypical \\&quot;30 second timer\\&quot; which has become so popular with sonic brushes as of late.</li>
            <li>We thought the toothbrush we had been using was doing a good job until we used the Sensonic for the first time and realized what a poor job our previous toothbrush had done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to it now, but it sure made a splattery mess the first few times I used this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive gums, use the High speed for and ultimate brushing.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first waterpik back in 2000 and lasted until last December 2010.</li>
            <li>Water eventually seeped through the cracks and into the main panel, which began to short out and smoke.</li>
            <li>think the second speed is a little strong but figure it is working.</li>
            <li>Since then, the toothbrush actually slowed down to a comfortable speed.  </li>
            <li>After brushing teeth feel really clean, I also alternate between the high and low speed every other day.</li>
            <li>You can set the brush on low or high.  </li>
            <li>It goes from low, to high, to off each time one pushes it.</li>
            <li>I use it with the larger head and on high speed all the time</li>
            <li>Overall, highly recommended for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter J. Miller</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the way it switches to high speed before I can turn it off after I&#x27;ve been using it on low speed.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to brush and massage you gums at the same time.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik comes operates on two vibration levels, low and high.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two settings on the brush (low and high).  </li>
            <li>After a week or two I was using the high speed daily.</li>
            <li>and I only brush using the high setting.</li>
            <li>The regular brush heads have a nice design, similar to the head on a regular toothbrush as opposed to the round heads seen on some electrics.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally get all mushy about personal hygiene products, but I&#x27;m going to gush about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The base of my original Sensonic was very sturdy and superior design-wise in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Expect to purchase a new toothbrush in three years, as disassembly to remove and replace battery pack is likely not to be a process that your toothbrush will survive...and you&#x27;ll need a soldering gun.</li>
            <li>Still, WP customer service is a winner, and I am actually looking forward to trying the company&#x27;s new flossing device.  </li>
            <li>and I decided I can live with the annoyances when I bought the same model.</li>
            <li>If you are tired of your old electric toothbrush and want something that&#x27;ll get the job done fast and easy, then look no further.  </li>
            <li>It holds an excellent charge, and actually has room on the base for an additional head if you have someone else you&#x27;d like to also share it with you.  </li>
            <li>~$60/Amazon [higher or lower for other Sonicare models]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  </li>
            <li>~$110/Amazon [higher or lower for other Oral B models]  </li>
            <li>They are half the price for the Waterpick and comes with two heads right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>IT leaves my teeth as clean as any of the others, and I like the small brush-head size.</li>
            <li>The device has a clever timer which creates a brief pause in thirty second intervals.</li>
            <li>At first use, I found the first speed to be too slow and the second speed to be too quick and messy.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, unlike the Ultreo which has been my brush of choice, it has two seperate speed settings, one low and one high.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush tickles at first, but has serious cleaning power, though it is supposed to take 2 minutes, with easily recognizable pauses every 30 seconds, reminding the user to switch to the next \\&quot;zone\\&quot; for brushing.  </li>
            <li>However it did make me appreciate electric toothbrushes in general.    </li>
            <li>I recommend starting with the low-speed setting if your gums feel sensitive-</li>
            <li>I had a Braun Oral B before I replaced it with this brush, and vastly prefer the cleaning action of my Sensonic.      </li>
            <li>Apparently I missed something in the instructions about removing the brush attachment after each use.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Sensonic professional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After several weeks of use of the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush here is what I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Waterpik apparently helps with removing any extrinsic stains on the teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the old, reliable Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive about this, as I recently had a deep-cleaning session at the dentist and they warned me about letting plaque build back up under my gums.  </li>
            <li>I like the small size of the brush, which allows you to insert better for the other side of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is probably a combination of several things: it forces me to brush for 2 minutes, instead of my old 30 second crap job; I use Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s \\&quot;Complete Care\\&quot; toothpaste with it, which is just gritty enough that when combined with thesonic vibrations of the brush, does an amazing job at scrubbing my teeth sparkly clean; I use the massage head to give my gums a massage after brushing, to promote circulation and reduce swelling.   </li>
            <li>This Waterpik is going in my garage to possibly be used to clean small parts.</li>
            <li>the other hand, Amazon&#x27;s customer service was absolutely five star.</li>
            <li>not sure how long the battery would actually last (ie, a week off the charger); the on / off button is too easily activated.    </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive teeth), so I only use the low setting.  </li>
            <li>No other time have I thought about my dentist, especially after the bill.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts half as long it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;+ thin, tapered brush for hard to reach areas or targeting specific areas (this would be a great option for people with braces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, there&#x27;s really no excuse for not giving your teeth the attention they need.      </li>
            <li>I got my first electric tooth brush a few months ago - a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it really gets down under the gum line and between teeth to brush all the gunk away.  </li>
            <li>A common, but necessary attribute is the 2-minute timer, which pretty much ensures you&#x27;ll brush that long (c&#x27;mon--admit it--</li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds, low and high, a 2 min. timer, with 30 sec.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the Low speed and at shutdown, press the ON button for stopless High speed to polish off the molars and any other area you might have slighted.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to other&#x27;s comments, my Sensonic sits on the charger 24 hours a day and is always ready.</li>
            <li>it is, this is still priced decently compared to other \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; brushes on the market, but if you&#x27;re looking for the ultimate brushing experience, I would have to recommend Ultreo over this Waterpik.</li>
            <li>There are days when I just don&#x27;t have the time to scrub my chompers, or when I do, but not long enough.  </li>
            <li>At first I only used the low setting because it seemed to harsh on my gums.  </li>
            <li>Does a fairly good job; lasts for at least three on / off cycles (haven&#x27;t had the patience to go beyond that); has better brush holders than the Sonicare; replacement heads are significantly less bulky and expensive (about half the price) than Sonicare; comes with a \\&quot;between the teeth</li>
            <li>The toothbrush was fine, but I had to buy a whole new one to make the old one useable b/c I couldnt buy the base separately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try to be more careful with the next replacement and dried off the toothbrush completely before placing it on the charger, hoping that it was the small amount of water on the toothbrush that was causing the problem.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik saved themselves close to $10 by only including 1 Adult &amp; 1 Childs brush head over the previous 4 Adult.</li>
            <li>This does not clean between my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>a price point well below some other sonic brushes, this brush wins hands down for value.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like the little beastie.</li>
            <li>As far as other reviews go about keeping it clean, I think they are ridiculous.  </li>

            <li> This is a great brush.  </li>
            <li> The price is great for both the unit and the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> A great brush at a great price</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great unless water happens to get into the mechanism that holds the brush onto the body.  </li>
            <li> I love this!!  </li>
            <li> The Sensonic Waterpik is a remarkable product that&#x27;ll leave you and your mouth happy.  </li>
            <li> A remarkable duration.</li>
            <li> is the latest Waterpik product I have used and the best .</li>
            <li> Good product for a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST brush out there, I believe I have tried most if not all of the others, they do not compare.</li>
            <li> Please--especially if you&#x27;ve never experience this level of awesome toothbrush--BUY THIS BRUSH! :)</li>
            <li> My teeth are very clean after using this toothbrush and I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I would call a pleasant, noticeable buzz    </li>
            <li> What an awesome feeling to have clean teeth and gums!    </li>
            <li> Better rigorous investigation required for best choice; my experience is these 3 brands are fine, but Waterpic appears best.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all a superb product that I can strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise...</li>
            <li> Life is good with these two products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik got fairly good reviews in comparison</li>
            <li> And it does feel good and look good</li>
            <li> seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I owned the predecessor to this toothbrush (200w) and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good value and a good price.</li>
            <li> But what is really good is the pik.</li>
            <li> Every dental visit I dreaded, knowing that they would admonish me for failing to form good oral hygiene routines, and</li>
            <li> We &#x27;ve been using the Waterpiks for years with good results.</li>
            <li> Before this, I used and loved the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik Sensonic did a good job</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife after getting a good deal through our health insurance.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> Durability has been mostly good.  </li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d try this because it was cheaper and had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> The sonic effect while brushing is very good and my teeth feel very  clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great for all the reasons the reviewers who liked it liked it.  </li>
            <li> That made the Waterpik very appealing.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if sensonic is really better, but my teeth feel great.</li>
            <li> SOOO great brush, wish it were more modular re pricing.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning and in combination with the Waterpik Ultra Waterjet, my mouth feels very clean.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik gets it right - great product for a great price.  </li>
            <li> though - make sure you turn it off before you take it out of your mouth, or you may need to do another face cleaning!</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They just kind of just sit there so</li>
            <li> ~520 Hz + ultrasonic blast [peculiarly, have not found information demonstrating ultrasound is effective: thus dubious]  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great toothbrush and does an excellent job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> nice speed and vibration (2 speeds:</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice about the brush is that it has a two minute timer that will shut the brush off when finished.  </li>
            <li> I know of no problems with this kind of powered brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled I tried this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush on December 31, 2011 after years of owning, and loving, Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> It has better features and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to discover that I have fewer problems with brushing now than I did before.</li>
            <li> The width fits nicely into your hand--there is no awkwardness at all in manipulating the  brush.    </li>
            <li> the charger,  brush, two brush heads (nice to use with family) and an in-between brush head (which my six-year-old also likes to use</li>
            <li> The Waterpik comes with two brush head, a pick head (for the gums) and a convienient charger stand that fits nicely on the bathroom</li>
            <li> Waterpik is an excellent toothbrush, and if you use it, you&#x27;ll get that Straight</li>
            <li> (It does look nice.)  </li>
            <li> High is best for cleaning under the gums.  </li>
            <li> This also works wonders for my six-year-old who now brushes happily for the full length.    </li>
            <li> We just started using a new dentist, and his cleaning method was wonderful - something akin to a sandblast with water and baking soda.  </li>
            <li> Well, for a while it was a fine substitute for the Sonicare, being every bit as good as the products I&#x27;d owned from the competing brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was clearly the best value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it is a great toothbrush and worth the price.</li>
            <li> WaterPik did a great job designing and building this brush, and proves their confidence in it with a two year warranty.</li>
            <li> The quad timer is useful and the unit looks great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike some brands, this toothbrush comes with everything you need (except for toothpaste, lol) right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth clean, a fair price and has lower cost replacement brushes....</li>
            <li> It also stops after two minutes, which is considered by some to be the optimum time to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> The holder, unlike the brush itself, does feel cheaply made and flimsy, and the brush heads don&#x27;t fit great on their holders.  </li>
            <li> First off - Sonic toothbrushes are great.  </li>
            <li> , it felt very comfortable in the hand and mouth.  </li>
            <li> The stand/base/charger feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> Great, Delivered in very timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> I thought electric toothbrushes were overrated, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product and have already recommended it to several people.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> they will toughen up and be able to handle full-speed in no time.  </li>
            <li> I said bye bye to most if not all of the plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> I feel confident that I&#x27;m brushing my teeth for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the Waterpik Sensonic \\&quot;and the replacement</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 more for my children.  </li>
            <li> My individual, nonscientific view: Waterpic seems excellent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be glad to save your effort by forwarding my literature search &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electronic toothbrushes over the years including rotodent, braun and interplaque.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush itself re strength of pulse, feel in my hand, length of charge.</li>
            <li> Decided to buy a sonic toothbrush to take better care of my teeth as I do not make it to the dentist as often as I should.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.</li>
            <li> It also massages the gums as it cleans, making them feel better as well as refreshed by removing the gum soreness</li>
            <li> We both love it.  </li>
            <li> It is, in my opinion and experience, the top of the line.</li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth with an electric toothbrush is ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> so I found myself using the manual most of the time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do nothing that would cause more dental problems than I already had.  </li>
            <li> This one was the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, I could buy my own, but even the cheap electric toothbrushes come with a plastic cap which covers the bristles.</li>
            <li> With so many electrical gadgets, mounting allows us to get it out of the way.  </li>
            <li> and they brush better using this brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> Almost totally satisfied with this product, except I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;stop&#x27; feature at all.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it comes with two seperate brush heads (one for him and one for her), along with an interdental brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is an attractive set-up and good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like to have known more about how it worked, what frequencies are used, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this</li>
            <li> Having been a user of the Oral-B ProfessionalCare series for many years, I was eager to give Waterpik&#x27;s product entry into the uber-competitive electric toothbrush market a try.  </li>
            <li> Interestingly though, the brush itself will turn off after two minutes which may or may not be an annoyance to some.  </li>
            <li> They just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li> I love this one.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with it&#x27;s quality of performance and ease of usage.    </li>
            <li> The Water Pik Sensonic did not, so there&#x27;s even more value from a Sonicare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would always promise that I would do better.  </li>
            <li> The reviews for this toothbrush were great, and gave me a lot of hope that it would help me with my teeth and gums as much as it had helped others.  </li>
            <li> I have had the toothbrush for about one month now, and the difference in my mouth is astonishing.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik is MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> Charging takes most of a day before the indicator stops flashing.  </li>
            <li> and I feel more confident that I am doing a thorough job.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is just sized better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost is well within reason for such a wonderful instrument.    </li>
            <li> Excellent plaque removal after only 1-2 brushings.  </li>
            <li> In comparing to the Sonicare, it got more power</li>
            <li> I wish there was a better way to manage the speeds (perhaps a separate button for each speed instead of a multi-press.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I guess I am one of those people who cannot use an electric toothbrush as much as I&#x27;d love to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with the Oral-B Pro 1000.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I am ok having fewer office cleanings.</li>
            <li> I loved it the first two or three times I used it, but then the very fine brush point ended up not working as well.  </li>
            <li> While the Sonicare units clean your teeth well, the Waterpik Sensonic does it as well or better (with more effective oscillation) and stays substantially cleaner.</li>
            <li> Best not to leave this one too close to the toilet or trashcan</li>
            <li> Great price from Amazon, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use the high setting and it leaves my mouth feeling great.</li>
            <li> It does an outstanding job of getting my teeth clean, and makes my gums pretty happy as well.</li>
            <li> It should be effective, reliable, easy to use, and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> This brush is very comfortable, the timer works just fine</li>
            <li> (I have to do that to clean them!</li>
            <li> I was able to clean it up with a wire brush and it seems to work OK now.</li>
            <li> Along with the Water Pik Flosser, the two combined are the best $100 I ever spent on my health.</li>
            <li> Use speed 1 for gentle cleaning; Use speed 2 for superior plaque removal.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use, with just one button to worry about.</li>
            <li> Tips are easy to change and identify.</li>
            <li> I was sure that after Philips bought the company they would redesign the product so that it would be easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush easy to charge, easy to use and easy to store between uses.</li>
            <li> Easy to switch heads.  </li>
            <li> It will leave gunk along gum line even in easy to reach places.</li>
            <li> cleaner\\&quot;; easy to control and operate.    </li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush surprisingly easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is easy to use, just plug in and let it charge for 16 hours before you use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to change the brushheads, and the recharging unit makes them easy to store -- there are storage spots for the unit and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The heads come out to easily</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for almost two years, and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> So what is good about this particular one?  </li>
            <li> The manual should be a good reference to people who are new to electric toothbrushes or the brand, not just multilingual eye-candy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve owned two sonicares and it was easily on par with the Elite Pro) cheap replacement heads</li>
            <li> The toothbrush, itself, works just fine</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to grasp for two minutes.    </li>
            <li> This worked fine for about 5 months.</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> The brush worked fine out of the box and for about 1 year.</li>
            <li> This way you can be sure you&#x27;re spending an adequate amount of time cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other brands of sonic toothbrushes, but the Waterpik has the strongest vibes and does the best job, is easiest to clean.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great sonic brush, my teeth feel a lot cleaner and the brush is a lot more gentle on my teeth and gums than normal brushing.  </li>
            <li> My six-year-old handles it fine, but it doesn&#x27;t at all feel overly light or cheaply made.</li>
            <li> many people, we have a pedestal sink, not a cabinet with a large counter top.  </li>
            <li> They have also gone from bright red to a more muted pink-a sign of health.</li>
            <li> One huge plus to this device is the timer setting for each area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention that the price on Amazon is fantastic?</li>
            <li> Thought the last one was great, but now I have the Waterpik Sensonic</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the mechanism is comfortably tingly and tickly, even on the backs of my teeth and in places where I have sore gums.  </li>
            <li> It is also more economical when you have to replace the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Much more powerful than the battery operated model we had been using.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;interdental brush\\&quot; is quite nice and seems to do a very efficient job of cleaning between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, use a light touch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, while this is a great toothbrush, it falls short of a five-star rating in my book.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an indicator light to let you know when it has fully charged.  </li>
            <li> If I do end up ruining this toothbrush, I will replace it without hesitation because it does such a great job.</li>
            <li> The head now swivels freely.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless this is an outstanding dental product and well worth trying.</li>
            <li> It has several attractive features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> so I was worried that a sonic toothbrush would be more hassle than it was worth.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, especially short trips you don&#x27;t need to bring the charger.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so smooth</li>
            <li> it work great, its quite even if it close to u, it didnt wakeup the kids if the door was open.</li>
            <li> Nov. 2012 - compact heads are no longer available on Amazon</li>
            <li> light pulling of the power cord will slide it out of position.</li>
            <li> , overall it does a great job</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am quite surprised to feel so enthusiastic about a teeth cleaning product, but I really, really, love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> While mostly plastic, it seems solidly built, and feels good in my hand.    </li>
            <li> I was pleased to not have to spend money right away on chargers or brush heads to try it out.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very nice product with the quality one would expect from Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> The interdental brush is a very useful adjunct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good cleaning action with timed quads for full brushing.</li>
            <li> First and most importantly</li>
            <li> Original post:    </li>
            <li> This works wonderfully for me because, in the morning, I&#x27;m not exactly at my most awake.      </li>
            <li> It is much more ergonomic than my first brush, which always felt like I was trying to brush with a shovel or something.    </li>
            <li> Now, I love it, but I was willing to give this baby a try.  </li>
            <li> that alone is worth it!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable for me and does not feel large.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and my teeth feel polished after every use.  </li>
            <li> The two speeds available seem to be adequate.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth with a really clean feel.</li>
            <li> Additionally teeth feel clean after using it, just like after a cleaning.    </li>
            <li> I tried an Oral B and did not feel my teeth were clean after using.  </li>
            <li> so clean (except after my twice a year cleaning and check-up from my dentist).  </li>
            <li> It does a very nice job of cleaning and the battery charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I found the brush very easy, almost fun, to use, although the somewhat large size and vibrating bristles spraying toothpaste/saliva required modifications in my brushing method.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve ever used, you don&#x27;t know how much better you can clean your mouth with a modern electric.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this waterpik product very much and am so very glad to have it for my daily use.</li>
            <li> is still a great product but you need to be careful not to press to against your teeth and gums if you use it at full strength.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush for between the teeth I feel is was a wise investment.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush automatically shuts off after 2 minutes, and if I want to brush longer, I must push the button again- once for low-speed and twice for full speed.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with how much brighter and cleaner my teeth are with using this product along with the water flosser.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are good as well for different types of brushing along with the brush heads themselves.  </li>
            <li> also own a Braun Oral B Triumph Professional Care 900.  </li>
            <li> I like the fresh smooth feel of my teeth afterwards.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really gentle, the vibrating/scrubbing motion is mostly at the end of the toothbrush where it belongs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
            <li> for full refund.</li>
            <li> Battery charge is good for several days to a week after being fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I strongly advise anyone interested in a sonic toothbrush to forego this product and get the Sonicare Elite.  </li>
            <li> sure beats the Phillips and Braun products and many independent trials rate the SR 1000 equal or superior to them.&lt;br /&gt;Finding</li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> when I wake up, my mouth feels fresh and clean and not at all yucky or slimy.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I was still in the bathroom</li>
            <li> I have used a few models from the 3 companies itemized below; all seem good, but I find Waterpic better.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating frequency is amazing, yet it is very quiet and quite comfortable when brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A quick list of my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m lucky to get a 2-minute cycle out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this means to keep tissue healthy.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the high speed setting just doesn&#x27;t work with this brush.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I love the high.  </li>
            <li> long as this motion is what you want/expect - it would be a good item.  </li>
            <li> This brush on high is great for people that only take a minute to brush.</li>
            <li> A detailed electric toothbrush search in Medline shows Oral B generally fares better than Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Two speeds: the fast is quite fast and leaves a great feeling in the mouth (fair warning--put it in your mouth and close your mouth before hitting the high speed if you want to avoid a mess).  </li>
            <li> DO NOT REMOVE BRUSH FROM MOUTH WITHOUT TURNING THE UNIT OFF FIRST!  </li>
            <li> I think the Waterpik brand electric toothbrushes have the best design, but they are very hard to find.</li>
            <li> This occurs especially easily with the toothbrush resting on the pedestal because of the Sensonic&#x27;s weight and resultant high center of gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the very first electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve tried, I have always been hesitant to use one thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective as a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> suppose the quality of the Sensonic toothbrush is very good - but the bristle tufts are stationary; that is, they do not move, although the entire head is whipping sideways back and forth at a rapid rate.  </li>
            <li> Since there is not that good of a rubber grip, the toothbrush ends up slipping  upward in my hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sensonic Professional Toothbrush for over a year, and happily use it several times a day.</li>
            <li> rare these days.</li>
            <li> Instead, they added a brush type floss-er tool which rarely gets used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and I really liked this one overall.  </li>
            <li> After considerable tugging, I was able to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product, but the short life span drove me away to $10 AA toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brushes are multilevel like many current manual brushes, and sport rounded bristle ends to be more gentle to gums.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this for me because my old one stopped working after about 6 years.</li>
            <li> and I have to throw away 2 of them ($12 worth) because the toothbrush stopped working.</li>
            <li> This unit has two speed, both useful and without injury to gums.</li>
            <li> it has the 30 second pauses to move the brush to another quandrant which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I had wanted the pricier, more well-known brand of electric sonic toothbrushes, but decided the smart thing to do (mainly because I am unemployed...)</li>
            <li> It would also be nice to have some warning light or some other notification before the battery charge runs out---</li>
            <li> Studies show sonic brushes are better than manual or other powered types of brushes, while being better for your gums.    </li>
            <li> It has an ergonomic handle that fits perfectly in your hand, and the on/off switch is high enough up that you don&#x27;t have problems with accidentally switching it off mid brush.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the higher speed as it has a noticeable difference, but it is not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> first that anybody looking at these has already decided to spend more than the 1/49 for a toothbrush (or waiting for the free one at the dentist) and second, that they&#x27;ll price compare and decide what their range is.  </li>
            <li> Use a gentle touch, more pressure does NOT mean cleaner.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good electric toothbrush with really no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I find that to really get my teeth clean</li>
            <li> It will allow people to clean their teeth without effort and yet very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> The larger brush heads are great for everyday use, but I like to use the interdental brush for very precise cleaning-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I focused more on brushing my teeth (and spent more time doing it) with the Waterpik than when I used to brush manually, but I don&#x27;t think that will simply be a \\&quot;trend\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> , I use the high speed setting and take a full cycle on the bottom teeth and a full cycle on the top teeth for a total of 4 minutes.    </li>
            <li> Apparently, the power of the vibrations obliterates plaque and other debris more effectively than applying more pressure with a brush directly.</li>
            <li> One uses much less pressure than with a manual brush, which is good news for gums, since they don&#x27;t like the abrasion that comes with too strenuous a brushing style.</li>
            <li> In combination and regular use my teeth and gums have shown noticeable improvement according to my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is comfortable to hold and on both speeds it is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very picky about my teeth...</li>
            <li> its current price, the Sensonic Pro provides great value and is a terrific budget alternative to Oral-B and Sonicare while providing (for the most part) almost equal results in terms of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> A single charge is good for 1 week of normal use (2x a day)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric toothbrushes and some of them are pretty good, but I really like this one and plan to stick with it for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Brushing with the Sensonic leaves my teeth feeling smooth and clean as if I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I have 18 crowns and two dental implants and this brush on the high setting for the full time does NOT make my gums bleed.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling of the ultrasonic cleaning and recommend the purchase of the Waterpik for both the high level of cleaning and the low cost of the replacement brush heads (which are just a bit more than a regular toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> The intensity of the high speed is very high, I rarely use this setting, but it really depends, some people may be comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> The seal is not very tight, so this can easily happen.  </li>
            <li> First off, I am not an employee or have any interest in Waterpik.</li>
            <li> a larger rubber grip would have made this brush much better.</li>
            <li> This is my first toothbrush from Sensonic</li>
            <li> I took it one step further just to be sure and looked up the price of replacement heads on all the brands</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 12 years...</li>
            <li> And that is exactly what I got when I ordered this one.</li>
            <li> Very similar to the original sonicare, for you original toothbrush gangstas.</li>
            <li> The first unit I had lasted 16 years.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this toothbrush based on an article which claimed it was better than the Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> I think the product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> When you first get the toothbrush, it will need to charge for 16 hours.  </li>
            <li> Since the standard heads come with color bands at the bottom, this toothbrush could be shared by more than one person.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really unfortunate too, because if it weren&#x27;t for these issues, this would be a wonderful 5-star</li>
            <li> That would open too many doors that some would prefer remain shut.    </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t spray the mirror, but your mouth feels so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> The timed reminders help you make sure you are giving equal attention to each area of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having suffered many tooth problems over the last couple of years (and $1000 of dollars in insurance copay)</li>
            <li> Overall I prefer ultrasonic type toothbrushes over the electric models that scrub and rub and they are better than hand brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toothbrush operates on two levels, a lower vibration and a higher vibration.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare&#x27;s handle is more narrow/smaller around and is easier for my (female) hand to hold.</li>
            <li> It does such a better job than hand brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d absolutely buy this again and feel it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> In fact, this brush came with 2 smaller, addition brush heads than my pricy Sonicare did, and the power of the brush is fabulous!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m not going to deal with cost, assuming two things:  </li>
            <li> it takes 16 hrs for the first then charges almost immediately after that,   </li>
            <li> It takes a while to get used to letting the brush do the work, but my teeth feel thoroughly cleaned after each use, probably more than when I use a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t recommended a charging behavior, except that the first charge must be 16 hours.</li>
            <li> I thought electric toothbrushes were supposed to make life more simple, my experience did not show that to be the case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing it has 2 year warranty, but it&#x27;s a lot of hassle to have them replaced every few months.</li>
            <li> This product also conveniently comes with 2 brush-heads, an inderdental cleaner as well as a wall mount insuring that you&#x27;re good to go for a few months before having to dip into the accessories market.</li>
            <li> Spend 5-10 seconds in each spot, gently work the longer bristles between the teeth and right along the gum line.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush and toothbrush heads fit loosely on the stand, which looks cheap when they wobble around.  </li>
            <li> They are superb quality for less money than other brand names.  </li>
            <li> I am a healthy 23-year old, who has luckily gone through life with only one cavity.  </li>
            <li> This is not the most expensive sonic toothbrush I have used, but it is definitely a good buy for its price if you care about your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waterpik guarantees positive results in 14 days.</li>
            <li> All the research I have found is quite positive about the benefits of these brushes, and there have been no reported problems healthwise.</li>
            <li> Two other reviewers, both dated April 4 2009 seem to have experienced related problems.</li>
            <li> and what I really was interested in trying about the Waterpik</li>
            <li> It gives you a very thorough brushing, leaving you with that super clean, just left the dentist office feeling, and THEN you use the Interdental attachment...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just as good, if not better than the Ultreo...and it has the added bonus of the attachment.  </li>
            <li> Was not sure I would like the Sonic, but it turns out that it was a good choice.</li>
            <li> , I have to sit on the dental chair for over 30 mins and come back with a fresh clean feeling - but it also comes with bleeding gums.    </li>
            <li> Seem to be about the appropriate size and last for a decent amount of time as well.  </li>
            <li> Physically, the unit itself is quite handsome and in terms of design stands well on par with the high end Oral-B and Sonicare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only bone to pick is that the pedestal upon which the toothbrush is recharged and its accessories rest is rather easily overturned and the pedestal&#x27;s plastic construction can break.</li>
            <li> The brush head is smaller, which I like because I can clean the back of my front teeth better.  </li>
            <li> wand is easy to work with and you get just enough of a buzz, (vibrating levels) that circulates within your mouth.</li>
            <li> It comes with an extra brushhead and the heads are color coded so it is easy to share the toothbrush (</li>
            <li> There are simple care and use instructions which are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I made some nice toothpaste-spot \\&quot;art\\&quot; on my black shirt and mirror.</li>
            <li> If you pull of the top after brushing, rinse it off, and keep it somewhere separated where each piece can dry, there will never be a problem.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would.  </li>
            <li> The Water Pik was fine while it lasted, but it cost me more than the Sonicare brushes I&#x27;d been using and proved to be far less durable.  </li>
            <li> Most brushes come with a 2 minute timer and 30 second quadrant reminder, so nothing new here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the Sensonic Pro does provide 2 brush-speeds (low and high) - the low is almost too gentle, ideally suited for young children or those with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> In general I like it and have had 2 dental cleaning since my purchase and the hygienist said my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush did a fine job while it worked, but that was for only seven days.</li>
            <li> A month later, the toothbrush seems to be holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li> The low speed is fine for the interdental brushing and my six-year-old    charger:  </li>
            <li> We already have a wall-mounted soap dish to free up space, but still there&#x27;s little free surface room, and some of what there is is curved, so</li>
            <li> The only replacement heads that are available everywhere are the Oral-B ones.  </li>
            <li> This means I have to really force myself to spend two minutes with a tooth brush in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the modern age.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my current unit, as I make sure to clean and dry the it before returning it to the charging stand.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very reliable brand.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic really does the job.  </li>
            <li> Our teeth feel so much cleaner every day, and the brushes (it comes with two) are removable for cleaning and replaceable.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very well designed.  </li>
            <li> so seems it may work much longer.</li>
            <li> Great product only issue is it is not international voltage, meaning only can be use in US not in Asia countries.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was going to like this feature until I had it.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has never used an automatic toothbrush has a real treat in store for them.</li>
            <li> but then it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Never great when a product conks out, but I would have happily bought another.  </li>
            <li> I have bought three of the Waterpiks, for my whole family.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothbrush worked really well while it lasted...</li>
            <li> With all that in mind, the Sensonic Professional really makes it even easier to maintain the appropriate standards for the daily care of your</li>
            <li> According to our dentist, it has really improved the health of our teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s more of a personal opinion, but at least this brush is well designed and nicely built.  </li>
            <li> so you know when to switch to the different section of your mouth (top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back).  </li>
            <li> We wanted heads for the whole family which cost $25 each for the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li> The brush seems very well built and designed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this much, but it seems to work</li>
            <li> There are two speeds to fit different needs -- my wife likes the slower speed</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel and look very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Yeah, I know, real geek stuff.)</li>
            <li> It really cleans her teeth and gets between the teeth</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell anyone who is reading this just how much this has helped the health of my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li> Was in Barbardos for a week and it help up the whole time.  </li>
            <li> This was the very model he suggested.  </li>
            <li> I received it a couple weeks ago, and I must say I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll accidentally turn it on fast.  </li>
            <li> Not that there was much guesswork to begin</li>
            <li> reasonable price too</li>
            <li> Holds charge quite well and is very compact in terms of it&#x27;s footprint.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li> Although replacement heads are available for the regular heads</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like much (hence 4 instead of 5 stars)</li>
            <li> While you wouldn&#x27;t want to submerge the entire toothbrush since it doesn&#x27;t appear to be watertight near the battery, you can run water over the top end and even around the button area after use.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> I like the nice touch of the brief pause telling you 30 second</li>
            <li> Weight:  a nice heft to it without at all feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> While it does hold the toothbrush and 4 different toothbrush heads, it is light weight and easily topples over (minor gripe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has never been an issue and if I travel for 7 days or less, I only have to bring the brush as it will easily hold a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li> Quality so far seems good, and it came with a large and small brush head and an inter-dental cleaner.      </li>
            <li> This study demonstrated Waterpik Sensonic Toothbrush performed better than the other brands; this article prompted my purchasing this model.     </li>
            <li> chose the WaterPik because I have used their other products and always been pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the older model I had, it is much</li>
            <li> This model comes with a regular toothbrush head and a pointy shaped tool that can be used to clean the gum line or where the teeth</li>
            <li> year product life seemed a reasonable, although not ideal, product life expectancy and it has done a great job of meeting the dental cleaning needs for me and my family.</li>
            <li> Not sure how good it works in place of the old fashion do it yourselfer but</li>
            <li> It makes me more conscious of how well I&#x27;m brushing my teeth, and how long I brush them.</li>
            <li> have owned an older model Oral B toothbrush for 5 years and it is still going strong (the battery doesn&#x27;t hold as long of a charge, but still completes all the cleanings).</li>
            <li> I was bothered by how tiny the heads were; I have pretty big teeth, generally speaking, and I like have a nice fat set of bristles to work with.  </li>
            <li> If the battery dies, I will be crushed, because my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> toothbrush head is all one length and not good as some of the more dental friendly options out there</li>
            <li> Yet, for the technical ingenuity behind this enhancement, I have to admit the best feature of the Sensonic Professional is the built-in timer, which automatically turns off the brush after two minutes.</li>
            <li> First, the bristles on the toothbrushes are relatively soft.</li>
            <li> It does come with a wall mount, which would be nice if you have a small space to work with in your bathroom    </li>
            <li> There for about 4 years my dentist was discovering a new cavatie at every visit!</li>
            <li> I have never had this problem with my previous electric brushes, of which there have been many, and I do not want to mount this thing on my wall.</li>
            <li> this product costs less than most, but it has the features.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, if you&#x27;re looking to replace your regular toothbrush with something that does more for your dental health, look no further than the Waterpik Sensonic.  </li>
            <li> , they called back quickly and sent a replacement unit.  </li>
            <li> The 30 second timer segments help make sure you devote enough time to each quadrant.</li>
            <li> There was only one speed, but it did an adequate job.  </li>
            <li> That is why I can&#x27;t give 5-stars, but I am GLAD I didn&#x27;t cave in to the hype from Oral B for a MORE expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> regular and super fast)&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> Whoever had the idea to save a few cents and not use a stainless steel rod will probably cost Waterpik more than they save.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works just as well as or better than its more expensive counterparts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the cheaper electric toothbrushes and while they are better than manual, this is still a step above that.  </li>
            <li> well, only complaint is that the interdental brush isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As is standard with most powered toothbrushes these days, the Sensonic Pro will pulse every 30 seconds to remind you to switch to the next quadrant in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> those much older than me were tackling.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic is something which really stands out from the rest of them - I have the same fresh feeling like that</li>
            <li> I get from getting my teeth cleaned with a dentist - mainly because of the using both the toothbrush and the interdental cleaner.    </li>
            <li> I did do some independent research online and found several studies (non-industry) showing these type of brushes are more efficient at removing plaque and</li>
            <li> This Waterpik with the timer is wonderful, letting you know when you&#x27;ve spent enough time on each area of your mouth and then having the dental head to get the spots between the teeth that are hard to clean and stain easily, especially with tea and soda drinkers.    </li>
            <li> I have dentin hypersensitivity, which is due to the gums receding, enamel eroding, and dentin becoming exposed.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I would highly recommend this toothbrush, along with a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush over all the rest.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I use it on high speed, it splatters everywhere and messes up my mirror.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;ve checked, you&#x27;ll see that their sticker price is quite high.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Now I use the high speed all the time.  </li>
            <li> It is an electric toothbrush that vibrates at high frequencies.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended the Waterpik over others because the brush is just a bit larger than the other popular brands.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s some bristles and little elbow grease when you&#x27;re talking about a set of healthy chompers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never want to go back to hand brushing again because after each brushing,  the ultrasonic toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling as clean and polished just as it does after a professional teeth cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like your teeth have been professionally cleaned each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> To Waterpik&#x27;s credit, they do advise pulling the head off and to clean and dry off the handle after each use.  </li>
            <li> Second, replacement brush heads are reasonably prices and available locally.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> One brush even lasted me nearly 10 years, which I know is unusual, but this Sensonic dying in under 2 years is unforgivable considering the steep price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The fast mode is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the Sensonic, I had to use the gentle setting-the regular setting hurt and made my gums bleed.</li>
            <li> It is quiet but powerful.</li>
            <li> replacement brushes might be a problem since the Waterpik product is rarely found at the chain and big box stores.</li>
            <li> The company has long since expanded to electric toothbrushes that consolidate our mandatory dental tasks knowing full well that we are all passively resistant to the onerous task of brushing our teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It is a minor nuisance to start it back up again if you need more time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that stable plus it&#x27;s just a waste of counter top space.  </li>
            <li> Which one is the normal speed?</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t clean my teeth much better than an ordinary toothbrush, and they vibrated way too much and were quite rough.  </li>
            <li> It has a habit of stopping right in the middle of a teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I have this item for about 17 months now and it runs like new.</li>
            <li> : Our new dental hygienist asked me if I used a sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> If there is a problem they will send you a new one with no questions asked...</li>
            <li> New brush would not charge.  </li>
            <li> , i searched and searched for a new charger, to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine any brushing on high, but I can only imagine that a person&#x27;s gums will become very tough and healthy if they can handle the top setting.      </li>
            <li> The bristles are actually very soft.  </li>
            <li> There is no added sensitivity as far as I felt with the  high speed.</li>
            <li> Mine have only gotten more and more sensitive the few months I have used this toothbrush, and I have only used it on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> The high setting may be too much for small children or people with advanced gum disease.</li>
            <li> 1- Charge for 16h prior to first use</li>
            <li> Wow!     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the exact same model for two years.  </li>
            <li> Oral B 5000 small head, rotary motion; somewhat better reviews than Sonicare [Medline search]  </li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews...</li>
            <li> My old one lasted 6 years!  </li>
            <li> Even more unfortunately, they had discontinued my original model.  </li>
            <li> My first one only cost $25.00!</li>
            <li> I am not sure i am going to buy more of this brand.  </li>
            <li> the many years Sonicare has been making their brushes, I&#x27;ve only owned 3 of them, but they&#x27;ve all lasted well over 5 years before needing to be replaced due to the batteries wearing out.  </li>
            <li> This way my wife and I can brush at the same time and not have to race to get to the bathroom first.</li>
            <li> I had to send back the first one because it did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> , I have not been able to find replacement heads for the small head - although this might be it [</li>
            <li> But if you enjoy electric toothbrushes and you want your money&#x27;s worth, I advise you to seriously think about picking up a Sensonic Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 30 second timer, the professional design and the financial investment will ensure that I&#x27;ll be more motivated to give my teeth their proper attention at each brushing.</li>
            <li> No damage to gum as long as you apply the right pressure while cleaning - it takes 3-4 days to get used to the brush.  </li>
            <li> toothbrushes\\&quot; are almost half the price of their competitors without sacrificing primary features.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the size of the unit and the comfort in holding it.</li>
            <li> gums.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does the job and cleaning is very high quality, only if you can live the aobve mention caveats.</li>
            <li> When I finally decided to try one, it wasn&#x27;t a positive experience.  </li>
            <li> The two normal brushes are nice in that they come with a colored base, so if more than one person is using the brush, you can tell the heads apart.  </li>
            <li> I returned my first order within a week of arrival, as the unit would not even operate long enough for a single two-minute use (Battery would die and need a minimum of 16h in the charger before the batt indicator light stopped blinking).  </li>
            <li> This helps clear food particles in those areas as well as stimulate the gum tissue and prevent periodontal problems.</li>
            <li> Waterpik has come a long way since my parents first bought a Dental Water Jet in the early 1970&#x27;s, a jet-stream tool with a water tank that we were supposed to use after brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear there was an electrical problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear that the metal piece was misaligned and no longer functioned</li>
            <li> (hey, Starbucks, how about getting to work on inventing Clear Coffee?).  </li>
            <li> This goes directly on the toothbrush handle.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had an ultrasonic toothbrush and are using a \\&quot;manual\\&quot;, standard toothbrush, you&#x27;re in for a real treat.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush lives up to its billing.  </li>
            <li> that the toothbrush just signal that the 2 minutes are complete and keep on running.      </li>
            <li> B00132FUNG Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a toothbrush that looked much like this one, but where each tuft of bristles twirled individually.  </li>
            <li> The green light blinks but the hanndle does not turn on.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to send them the old one or any proof of purchase.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Interplak electric that was losing battery recharge capability</li>
            <li> I never had this problem with my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It has advantages over my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It even provides an automatic pause at thirty-second intervals to signal when you should be complete with each quadrant in your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, it feels like Waterpik has really listened to their customers and made an electric toothbrush that stops just short of brushing your teeth for you.as really listened to their customers and made an electric toothbrush that stops just short of brushing your teeth for you.</li>
            <li> I still feel like I&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning after each use.  </li>
            <li> No luck -- even with drying it after every use it still developed cracks and the circuit board inside was charred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having said that, the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush is not all I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> For what it does, the cost seems quite reasonable -- especially given that it can be shared by two (or three, with the purchase of an additional brushhead)</li>
            <li> only drawback I see is that there is no indicator on the toothbrush as to how much charge remains.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The high-speed does provide a satisfactory cleanse while still maintaining that overall gentle sensation throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It scared me to find myself so young and already going through issues</li>
            <li> adult hands</li>
            <li> The two-speed feature allowed me to get used to the action without damaging the gum line.  </li>
            <li> I keep going for the professional dental cleaning every 6 months because my dental insurance provider reccommends it.  </li>
            <li> After using this for at least a month, my teeth and gums are in much better condition.  </li>
            <li> I noticed marked reduction in the plaque deposits.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see whether it really has the next time I have a dental cleaning and check-up.</li>
            <li> After all, our ancestors were, to my understanding, once brushing their teeth with old pine cones.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve read that it uses a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery, which means that memory issues occur if it is removed from power before the charge is complete.</li>
            <li> I find the manual to be very ambiguous because it doesn&#x27;t say anything specific on usage.</li>
            <li> The button to turn it on is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> If not caught early, the replacement brush head can get stuck and the toothbrush is ruined.  </li>
            <li> I waited until my latest professional dental cleaning to write this review, because I wanted to see if there would be ANY improvement in removing the plague from my teeth, or at least keeping my gums healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; It also has the prototypical \\&quot;30 second timer\\&quot; which has become so popular with sonic brushes as of late.</li>
            <li> We thought the toothbrush we had been using was doing a good job until we used the Sensonic for the first time and realized what a poor job our previous toothbrush had done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to it now, but it sure made a splattery mess the first few times I used this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive gums, use the High speed for and ultimate brushing.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first waterpik back in 2000 and lasted until last December 2010.</li>
            <li> Water eventually seeped through the cracks and into the main panel, which began to short out and smoke.</li>
            <li> think the second speed is a little strong but figure it is working.</li>
            <li> Since then, the toothbrush actually slowed down to a comfortable speed.  </li>
            <li> After brushing teeth feel really clean, I also alternate between the high and low speed every other day.</li>
            <li> You can set the brush on low or high.  </li>
            <li> It goes from low, to high, to off each time one pushes it.</li>
            <li> I use it with the larger head and on high speed all the time</li>
            <li> Overall, highly recommended for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter J. Miller</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the way it switches to high speed before I can turn it off after I&#x27;ve been using it on low speed.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to brush and massage you gums at the same time.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik comes operates on two vibration levels, low and high.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two settings on the brush (low and high).  </li>
            <li> After a week or two I was using the high speed daily.</li>
            <li> and I only brush using the high setting.</li>
            <li> The regular brush heads have a nice design, similar to the head on a regular toothbrush as opposed to the round heads seen on some electrics.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally get all mushy about personal hygiene products, but I&#x27;m going to gush about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The base of my original Sensonic was very sturdy and superior design-wise in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expect to purchase a new toothbrush in three years, as disassembly to remove and replace battery pack is likely not to be a process that your toothbrush will survive...and you&#x27;ll need a soldering gun.</li>
            <li> Still, WP customer service is a winner, and I am actually looking forward to trying the company&#x27;s new flossing device.  </li>
            <li> and I decided I can live with the annoyances when I bought the same model.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of your old electric toothbrush and want something that&#x27;ll get the job done fast and easy, then look no further.  </li>
            <li> It holds an excellent charge, and actually has room on the base for an additional head if you have someone else you&#x27;d like to also share it with you.  </li>
            <li> ~$60/Amazon [higher or lower for other Sonicare models]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  </li>
            <li> ~$110/Amazon [higher or lower for other Oral B models]  </li>
            <li> They are half the price for the Waterpick and comes with two heads right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> IT leaves my teeth as clean as any of the others, and I like the small brush-head size.</li>
            <li> The device has a clever timer which creates a brief pause in thirty second intervals.</li>
            <li> At first use, I found the first speed to be too slow and the second speed to be too quick and messy.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, unlike the Ultreo which has been my brush of choice, it has two seperate speed settings, one low and one high.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush tickles at first, but has serious cleaning power, though it is supposed to take 2 minutes, with easily recognizable pauses every 30 seconds, reminding the user to switch to the next \\&quot;zone\\&quot; for brushing.  </li>
            <li> However it did make me appreciate electric toothbrushes in general.    </li>
            <li> I recommend starting with the low-speed setting if your gums feel sensitive-</li>
            <li> I had a Braun Oral B before I replaced it with this brush, and vastly prefer the cleaning action of my Sensonic.      </li>
            <li> Apparently I missed something in the instructions about removing the brush attachment after each use.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Sensonic professional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several weeks of use of the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush here is what I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Waterpik apparently helps with removing any extrinsic stains on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the old, reliable Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive about this, as I recently had a deep-cleaning session at the dentist and they warned me about letting plaque build back up under my gums.  </li>
            <li> I like the small size of the brush, which allows you to insert better for the other side of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is probably a combination of several things: it forces me to brush for 2 minutes, instead of my old 30 second crap job; I use Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s \\&quot;Complete Care\\&quot; toothpaste with it, which is just gritty enough that when combined with thesonic vibrations of the brush, does an amazing job at scrubbing my teeth sparkly clean; I use the massage head to give my gums a massage after brushing, to promote circulation and reduce swelling.   </li>
            <li> This Waterpik is going in my garage to possibly be used to clean small parts.</li>
            <li> the other hand, Amazon&#x27;s customer service was absolutely five star.</li>
            <li> not sure how long the battery would actually last (ie, a week off the charger); the on / off button is too easily activated.    </li>
            <li> (I have sensitive teeth), so I only use the low setting.  </li>
            <li> No other time have I thought about my dentist, especially after the bill.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts half as long it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;+ thin, tapered brush for hard to reach areas or targeting specific areas (this would be a great option for people with braces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, there&#x27;s really no excuse for not giving your teeth the attention they need.      </li>
            <li> I got my first electric tooth brush a few months ago - a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it really gets down under the gum line and between teeth to brush all the gunk away.  </li>
            <li> A common, but necessary attribute is the 2-minute timer, which pretty much ensures you&#x27;ll brush that long (c&#x27;mon--admit it--</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds, low and high, a 2 min. timer, with 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the Low speed and at shutdown, press the ON button for stopless High speed to polish off the molars and any other area you might have slighted.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to other&#x27;s comments, my Sensonic sits on the charger 24 hours a day and is always ready.</li>
            <li> it is, this is still priced decently compared to other \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; brushes on the market, but if you&#x27;re looking for the ultimate brushing experience, I would have to recommend Ultreo over this Waterpik.</li>
            <li> There are days when I just don&#x27;t have the time to scrub my chompers, or when I do, but not long enough.  </li>
            <li> At first I only used the low setting because it seemed to harsh on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Does a fairly good job; lasts for at least three on / off cycles (haven&#x27;t had the patience to go beyond that); has better brush holders than the Sonicare; replacement heads are significantly less bulky and expensive (about half the price) than Sonicare; comes with a \\&quot;between the teeth</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was fine, but I had to buy a whole new one to make the old one useable b/c I couldnt buy the base separately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try to be more careful with the next replacement and dried off the toothbrush completely before placing it on the charger, hoping that it was the small amount of water on the toothbrush that was causing the problem.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik saved themselves close to $10 by only including 1 Adult &amp; 1 Childs brush head over the previous 4 Adult.</li>
            <li> This does not clean between my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> a price point well below some other sonic brushes, this brush wins hands down for value.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like the little beastie.</li>
            <li> As far as other reviews go about keeping it clean, I think they are ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to as it tickled the roof of my mouth especially when on high.</li>
            <li> Once I removed the brush head I noticed the rust and had to sand it down in order to get a new brush head on.</li>
            <li> brush offers a 25% increase in bristle speed over other brushes.</li>
            <li> I charged it the original 16 hours and it worked for almost two weeks (using it approximately 3 times per day).</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product at first, but shortly after purchase, the base began to crack.</li>
            <li> The high setting is a little too close to the dentist&#x27;s devices of torture</li>
            <li> No more do my gums bleed, no more gum recession, and awesomely clean feeling teeth!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that this new Waterpik will help ensure that I do not have to go through that painful deep cleaning again.    </li>
            <li> They sent me a WHOLE NEW TOOTHBRUSH, with charging base and replacement heads, free of charge.  </li>
            <li> By the way my previous unit lasted nearly 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have found is the reduction of brushes provided.</li>
            <li> I am a fast and lazy teeth brusher.</li>
            <li> Second, there is a three-speed option similar to the way a kitchen blender works - \\&quot;Low\\&quot; for basic cleaning and gum massage, \\&quot;High\\&quot; for targeted plaque removal, and a toggling feature that lets you switch between the speeds with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> There is a possibility that the specific frequencies could have a health impact, but allopathic medicine has not advanced far enough to recognize that (or prefers to ignore it).</li>
            <li> It did take a long time to charge initially (the manual says to charge it 16 hours before using it), but after that, it seems to hold a charge well and doesn&#x27;t need recharging after every use.</li>
            <li> , a few months after that, my husband&#x27;s charger stopped working, and again i couldn&#x27;t buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight pause in the action every 30 seconds telling you to switch quadrants</li>
            <li> (He had previously declined my offers to buy him one.)d a sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> (He had previously declined my offers to buy him one.)</li>
            <li> If you remove the brush head and allow the chrome plated stem to dry, they will last even longer as the stem</li>
            <li> Every single day, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist - silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Things don&#x27;t fit tightly on the base, so it is easy to bump and knock things off.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the chargers failed after 2 years but we managed to use one charger for both brushes which worked fine since battery life has not been an issue.  </li>
            <li> A big plus for the Waterpik is the low cost of the replacement brush heads, which is a fraction of the cost of some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> The set includes three brushes - two regular and one interdental brush for getting between teeth and into other such hard-to-clean spaces.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty benign, although they do warn not to let anything but the bristles touch your teeth while using it, a reasonable idea, as vibrating hard plastic bouncing on tooth enamel is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious to know if my dental hygienist can tell the difference at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> The Sensonic holds a charge reasonably long-  </li>
            <li> I wish I had the money to invest in this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really practical since the individual brushes will always lose their shape.      </li>
            <li> Waterpik has long been a respected name in the oral care industry, so when I saw this product I jumped at the chance to try it out.</li>
            <li> The brush handle which holds the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; power source and the rechargeable battery is about nine inches long without a brush attached.</li>
            <li> Brush attachments are about 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> The recharger/base takes up a space roughly 4 inches on a side, and has the docking area for recharging the handle as well as tabs for holding 4 extra brushes.</li>
            <li> That having been said, I have always had trouble with puffy, sensitive bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the faster speed for my normal brushing.  </li>
            <li> Programmed to stop after 30 seconds of brushing, the device also has a built in reminder of how long you should brush each quadrant of your mouth.   </li>
            <li> This is better than them all and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Personal neglect eventually catches up with us during the dreaded semi-annual dental appointment when a wagging finger usually accompanies a sermon on the necessities of flossing and consistent brushing.</li>
            <li> After using it for two weeks, I definitely feel I am exerting less pressure than my previous electric toothbrush, and my gums do not feel nearly as sore.</li>
            <li> I dropped it in the sink once (totally my fault due to an injury).  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of toothbrush, flosses - from the $10 Oral B and the painful process of flossing all the way to ultrasonic toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted $60 on a second toothbrush for this same problem.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> either so does not take up a lot of space on your bathroom counter if you are limited in room.  </li>
            <li> That way, no left over paste runs down the brush and accumulates on the charger.</li>
            <li> I was using an older electric toothbrush before that left plaque behind.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush shaft is thinner on the Sonicare and it therefore is easier to reach to my back teeth with less bulk.</li>
            <li> These heads are barely bigger than a couple of pencil erasers, so my usual brushing style meant I kept banging the buzzing plastic back against my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Dental hygiene beyond a quick brushing seemed tedious, and I just didn&#x27;t have the patience to commit myself to it.  </li>
            <li> The power button has an annoying lag when turning on and switching to the high setting, which is the only one really worth while on either model.    </li>
            <li> Then, starting a few weeks ago, my toothbrush is failing to keep a charge very long, it turns itself off after a couple of seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the product is fantastic, but the price needs some serious work.fantastic, but the price needs some serious work.</li>
            <li> The original one I purchased from Amazon just stopped charging the toothbrush after 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first replacement from Waterpik worked for another few months, then the plastic base started to develop cracks and fell apart</li>
            <li> The handle is extremely large and difficult to hold once the inevitable toothpast foam gets on it.  </li>
            <li> A big minus is the speed and vibration, it can be a little abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long its brush head will last.</li>
            <li> If your regular brush just ain&#x27;t cutting it, and if your elbows are sore from all of the backbreaking pressure you apply to your dental work morning and night, then seventy dollars might be worth the price of admission.  </li>
            <li> I compared it to Oral-B (Braun), Philips, Ultreo and a few lesser known names.  </li>
            <li> If you ever have to return to manual brushing, you will feel like you are mentally challenged.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not very, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my wife and I use this one, and I use the green head and she uses the red one).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head on the Waterpik is wider, so wide that it scrubs at my gums, cleans my teeth and then hits &#x60;the air&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I think the width is too wide</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is designed to last for 1-2 months and they are not cheap to replace it.</li>
            <li> In Thailand), and although it might be a bit rough for those of you with mushy gums, there&#x27;s no doubting that it takes the guesswork out of brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have not tested how long a single charge can go, but I do know that it will last at least 4 days.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got a wall-mountable base which is GREAT for cutting down clutter around the bathroom sink, and keeps it up and out of the way of small hands looking to \\&quot;help clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 5/2013 - the charging base has developed significant cracks and is disintegrating.</li>
            <li> Though I have had several through the years this particular Waterpick may prove her wrong.    </li>
            <li> addition to the effectiveness and features of the toothbrush, my decision to purchase it was very strongly influenced by the fact that it has a wall-mountable base.</li>
            <li> One thing that is a little strange is the on off button.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;ve had no issues.     </li>
            <li> so we don&#x27;t accidentally use each other&#x27;s brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of months and the brush is now dead!  </li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare but decided to check into other sonic toothbrushes because of the size and price of replacement heads for the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any other electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first one died after about 6 years.</li>
            <li> I used to have 2 sonicare e3000 both died in a month due to water leakage into the battery and circuitry chambers (and the designer&#x27;s brain)</li>
            <li> This is the third Waterpik electric toothbrush I have owned in the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are inexpensive compared to the other two as well.  </li>
            <li> I hope Waterpik keeps participating in this market segment despite the other 2 getting all the press.</li>
            <li> I got this one because the other brand seems to have a design flaw: there&#x27;s a leak between the brush and the handle where toothpaste gets in.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush comes with 4 heads - 2 regular, 1 small and 1 interdental.  </li>
            <li> Due to the corrosion issue, I have had to replace both sonic toothbrushes this year</li>
            <li> I was very careful to follow directions for the battery as it seems to have been an issue for some people.</li>
            <li> Dentist was pushing for me to switch in order to get better cleaning, less plaque buildup and reduce abrasion (I brushed too hard which is bad for tooth enamel).  </li>
            <li> After approximately 3 years of extensive use battery started loosing capacity and the thing finally died after 3.5 years after being fully discharged during hurricane Sandy blackout -- battery won&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li> I no longer beat up my gums with a manual and the vibrating versus the conventional electric is gum stimulating.</li>
            <li> Which by the way is half the price of other brands.</li>
            <li> Have to try hard not to have toothbrush hit my teeth, just the brushed.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are less expensive than other &amp;#34;sensonic&amp;#34; toothbrushes and it cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I decided against the lesser known names for fear replacement brush heads would be hard to find or even nonexistent down the road.</li>
            <li> Im a fanatic about personal hygiene</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the time one is supposed to brush for...</li>
            <li> BUT... if you have sensitive teeth issues, it will make them worse.  </li>
            <li> Also, the on/off button is poorly situated and way too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik needs to come up with a heavier, more stable base.  </li>
            <li> I love this head because I hate to floss.</li>
            <li> For maintenance, all you do is rinse your brush head under running water and wipe down the brush itself after each use.</li>
            <li> There are lots of choices, but I narrowed it down to this one, after years of using another one.  </li>
            <li> down in the grooves of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush stops for a split second to let you know you have brushed for so many seconds---completely useless to me and annoying.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have been using Sonicare brushes for many years, and this product is definitely not better as far as cleaning goes, and the ergonomics are terrible.  </li>
            <li> It cleans between teeth with relative ease, removing plaque and other bad things without the strenuous effort that is necessary when using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> ** all for less money.  </li>
            <li> and I found out Waterpik&#x27;s brush heads cost less than all of them.</li>
            <li> Less than two weeks after I purchased one of these, the charging unit started smoking and fell apart.</li>
            <li> For users accustomed to Oral-B&#x27;s products the Sensonic Professional will surprise you with just how gentle it feels, making Oral-B&#x27;s experience almost violent in comparison.  </li>
            <li> lot faster than previous version</li>
            <li> or if you jostle it slightly, the brushes will fall off    In the box:  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has always had much less work since I started using the WaterPik and my gums never bleed</li>
            <li> After dealing with all these issues for half a month, I encountered plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Pretty  crazy to have to do this -</li>
            <li> There is also a tool for cleaning between teeth, but it is not a true substitute for flossing.</li>
            <li> But they shipped the SR-3000 model which has a new base that has to live on a table or shelf.</li>
            <li> I have not liked the powered brushes I have tried in the past, but had heard that the sonic brushes like this were different.</li>
            <li> A little advice about using these sonic brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little over 18 months</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Even those that already use an electric toothbrush, the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting might be too vigorous, and takes a little while to get used</li>
            <li> Also the bristles are little harsh on my teeth/</li>
            <li> One if my previous units made a slight crackling and popping noise before a small wisp of smoke came out.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way to be careful taking the brush out of my mouth -</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t too harsh-</li>
            <li> The toothbrush failed after nearly two years of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few battery operated toothbrushes</li>
            <li> It seems to work just as well as the Sonicare barring a few Cons;    </li>
            <li> I have a few complaints about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It took a few uses before I got the hang of it, now I have become a fan of Sensonic brushing.</li>
            <li> Dead after a year.    </li>
            <li> Died after few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ultreo with no problems for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I do like the two power settings, which are missing from some high-end brushes.</li>
            <li> so the link is dead.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately (again), the wall-mounted base is very flimsy, and pieces of it have been breaking off over time just through regular use.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually about half done when it quits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other electronic toothbrushes and have never liked them.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t push down too hard-</li>
            <li> Be careful when it is on, it can spray stuff around (watch your eyes - toothpaste is not good for them).</li>
            <li> The Waterpik does all the work for me and leaves my teeth and gums with that slick, firm feeling I associate with leaving the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> All it needs to be kept on base for one night once a week for full charge.</li>
            <li> Over the course of just a few weeks it went from the odd speed dip to an outright failure to start save for a half-second \\&quot;blip\\&quot; of operation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noticeable from outside the bathroom but not at all loud or annoying.  </li>
            <li> and it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot to like and very little to dislike with regard to the waterpik sensonic.</li>

            <li> I am going to e-mail a complaint to Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> The resistor in the charge base does not have enough wattage rating and got burnt out (design flaw), the reason for the one in the brush is unknown.  </li>
            <li> I tried going on vacation once with one of those cheap, battery operated brushes &amp; was miserable.</li>
            <li> Both toothbrushes failed around the 3 to 3.5 year mark due to corrosion (chrome-like coating flaking off) on the shaft to attach the toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> I just brushed my teeth, and when I put the handle back on the base, the whole thing tipped over, the base and handle fell into the wastebasket, and the handle turned itself on!  </li>

            <li> This is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Once the corrosion sets in, it is next to impossible to change toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> and found it a little unwieldy and expensive for replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I specifically ordered the SR-1000 model, so I could re-use the base from my previous one, the base that attaches to the wall in my tiny, no shelf space bathroom.</li>
            <li> This bad design makes the toothbrush less predictable, because the toothbrush can start into 2 modes from the Off mode without user indication.</li>
            <li> There is a charger base so no batteries to replace, just put it back in when you&#x27;re done!  </li>
            <li> It comes with the charger base and three different brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I short circuited the damn thing while in Europe, and the base broke.</li>
            <li> concept behind this machine is what the manufacturer calls a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> : The only con to the product is the base.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums, stemming from years of horrible braces, retainers and other assorted unpleasant dental procedures</li>
            <li> I had given up flossing from the bloody mess, and subsequently given up mouthwash because of how badly it burned.  </li>
            <li> It probably wouldn&#x27;t make any difference anyway - the brushes would still get knocked off the base because they are too loose.   </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad model but this toothbrush just does not clean my husband&#x27;s or my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and with Water Pik in general.  </li>
            <li> That is, until the day I noticed what looked like little &#x27;cuts&#x27; at the base of 2 of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I find this expensive.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!  </li>
            <li> When I tried this for a week, my gums bled something awful every time, even on the low speed setting.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is just too expensive for the slimmer model.  </li>
            <li> It got to the point that it was difficult to remove the brush head.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik has expensive replacement heads</li>
            <li> I feel guilty if I don&#x27;t wait for the brush to turn off after two minutes.</li>
            <li> The crazy thing is it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a poorly made plastic base.  </li>
            <li> I could not handle the faster vibrations as it made all my teeth rattle in my jaw in a scary way!</li>
            <li> The bad news is that the metal rod that you attach the brush head onto has started to corrode.  </li>
            <li> The interdental head is pointy and looks like it would be painful but did not cause me any discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you give this toothbrush a try.</li>
            <li> Flossing was nearly impossible, as it was excruciatingly painful and resulted in a bloody mouth.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d known this stupid design I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it&#x27; feeling</li>
            <li> We share one base for family of two and have no problem at all.</li>
            <li> I have seen some reviewers complain that the brush is top-heavy on the charging base, and it is.  </li>
            <li> the slightest tap on the base cause them to fall over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those of you complaining about the battery life, if you keep the handle on the base when you aren&#x27;t using it, it will stay charged.  </li>
            <li> Annoyingly, you would never know that from the ads or even the box itself.  </li>
            <li> I believe I contacted the company to find out if the base was wall-mountable and to urge them to include the fact that it was in supposedly informational descriptions.</li>
            <li> but I cannot use the base anymore.  </li>
            <li> I HATE IT!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great, Delivered in very timely fashion.  Great</li>
            <li> I like the toothbush It works well I like how my teeth feel after words. I like that I can get all of the stuff that gets stuck between teeth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like that I can only get refills from Waterpics web site. They are 19.99 for three plus 5.95 shipping and handling charge. I find this expensive.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; It is just an angled brush that dosen&#x27;t do much for my braces let alone my teeth.... Should have bought a sonicare</li>
            <li> I do like my Waterpik toothbrush.  It does a very nice job of cleaning and the battery charge lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s a well-build product. The one thing I do NOT like is that you cannot buy replacement heads anywhere but online.  3 heads for $28, including shipping?  What a rip-off!  The only replacement heads that are available everywhere are the Oral-B ones.  Word to the wise...</li>
            <li> This product is great.      I wonder if my dental hygenist will notice a difference!</li>
            <li> First off, I am not an employee or have any interest in Waterpik. I have 18 crowns and two dental implants and this brush on the high setting for the full time does NOT make my gums bleed. I am a fast and lazy teeth brusher. This means I have to really force myself to spend two minutes with a tooth brush in my mouth. This brush on high is great for people that only take a minute to brush. It can get the job done. I have owned all the various electric tooth brushes (Braun, Sonicare, Interplak), I like this the best. The high setting may be too much for small children or people with advanced gum disease. I really like this toothbrush. If your not awake in the morning, you will be after this one cleans your teeth. I really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Waterpik Sensonic toothbrush recently.  Everytime I brush it is like getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist office.  Great price for the value.</li>
            <li> cleaned my teeth well (I&#x27;ve owned two sonicares and it was easily on par with the Elite Pro) cheap replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but: NiMH batteries. Died in three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c&#x27;mon, people. It&#x27;s the modern age. Use Lithium Ion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect to purchase a new toothbrush in three years, as disassembly to remove and replace battery pack is likely not to be a process that your toothbrush will survive...and you&#x27;ll need a soldering gun.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush, itself, works just fine but I&#x27;ve replaced several units because the plastic that was used to make the charging stand disintegrates over time. It took me awhile to figure out why, but it turned out to be a combination of toothpaste residue and heat. After a few month of daily use, the left over toothpaste that had accumulated on the base had broken down the plastic to the point where, one day, the base simply shattered.    I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my current unit, as I make sure to clean and dry the it before returning it to the charging stand. That way, no left over paste runs down the brush and accumulates on the charger. Other than that, I&#x27;ve had no issues.     If your units charger does crack, I recommend disposing of it immediately. It&#x27;s both a fire and shock hazard, once the charging circuit is exposed! One if my previous units made a slight crackling and popping noise before a small wisp of smoke came out. Luckily, I was still in the bathroom so I could yank the plug out of the wall!</li>
            <li> It feels like I just left the dentists office. Noticeable improvement in 2 days.  Im a fanatic about personal hygiene and this is defiantly up to par.</li>
            <li> I thought electric toothbrushes were overrated, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this one. Along with the Water Pik Flosser, the two combined are the best $100 I ever spent on my health. When I first started using the Sensonic, I had to use the gentle setting-the regular setting hurt and made my gums bleed. Now, after just under three weeks, I&#x27;m using the regular setting and my gums don&#x27;t bleed at all! They have also gone from bright red to a more muted pink-a sign of health. And my wisdom teeth no longer cause me pain. The brush is easy to use, with just one button to worry about. You simply choose your setting and it takes you through four timed intervals, between which you switch to a different quadrant in the mouth. This way you can be sure you&#x27;re spending an adequate amount of time cleaning your teeth. For maintenance, all you do is rinse your brush head under running water and wipe down the brush itself after each use. I am very impressed with this product and have already recommended it to several people. Did I mention that the price on Amazon is fantastic?</li>
            <li> Just had the Waterpick about three weeks now. After brushing teeth feel really clean, I also alternate between the high and low speed every other day. The smaller brush for between the teeth I feel is was a wise investment. The battery life is about 5/6 days as we both use it and I use it twice a day. I&#x27;ll try to make another evaluation after seeing the dentist in August. I would recommend the brush to a friend. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used the Waterpik Sensonic brand for 30 years or so.  Very reliable brand.  The sonic effect while brushing is very good and my teeth feel very  clean and shiny.  My problem, as with almost everything else, they have &#x27;over-teched&#x27; it.  There is a timer that interrupts the power to tell you to &#x27;move  on&#x27; to another area in your mouth.  It is always too soon or too late for my preference.  I think I know how to brush my teeth by now!  If there was a way to  disable that &#x27;feature&#x27; I certainly would.  I have just practiced ignoring it.  And... I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I brush my teeth, saliva and toothpaste  is running out of my mouth.  This goes directly on the toothbrush handle.  Since there is not that good of a rubber grip, the toothbrush ends up slipping  upward in my hand and I have to re-grab it.  I am solving this problem by placing rubber bands around the handle to help prevent slippage.  Pretty  crazy to have to do this - a larger rubber grip would have made this brush much better.</li>
            <li> There are lots of choices, but I narrowed it down to this one, after years of using another one.  Thought the last one was great, but now I have the Waterpik Sensonic and I love it.  Even forgot the name of the one I thought was so great before.  The Waterpik Sensonic really does the job.  Also bought the actual Waterpik, and am now using them both.  Life is good with these two products.  Recommended, to say the least.</li>
            <li> We just started using a new dentist, and his cleaning method was wonderful - something akin to a sandblast with water and baking soda.  But our toothbrushes couldn&#x27;t keep up with it - now they can.  This Waterpik with the timer is wonderful, letting you know when you&#x27;ve spent enough time on each area of your mouth and then having the dental head to get the spots between the teeth that are hard to clean and stain easily, especially with tea and soda drinkers.    Our teeth feel so much cleaner every day, and the brushes (it comes with two) are removable for cleaning and replaceable.  There is a charger base so no batteries to replace, just put it back in when you&#x27;re done!  One thing, though - make sure you turn it off before you take it out of your mouth, or you may need to do another face cleaning!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had an ultrasonic toothbrush and are using a \\&quot;manual\\&quot;, standard toothbrush, you&#x27;re in for a real treat.  The Waterpik Sensonic has what has become the standard 2 minute cycle, with a tone after every 30 seconds, which signals you to move to another quadrant of your mouth.      After use, your teeth will have that minty-fresh feeling that nothing but a cleaning by a dental hygenist can rival.  I like the design of the toothbrush and the placement of the on/off switch.  I have another ultrasonic toothbrush that I tend to accidentally turn off while brushing because the button is in the grip area.      A big plus for the Waterpik is the low cost of the replacement brush heads, which is a fraction of the cost of some of the other brands.  That made the Waterpik very appealing.      I love the clean feeling of the ultrasonic cleaning and recommend the purchase of the Waterpik for both the high level of cleaning and the low cost of the replacement brush heads (which are just a bit more than a regular toothbrush).  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you give this toothbrush a try.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush lives up to its billing.  It really does feel like your teeth have been professionally cleaned each time you use it.  What an awesome feeling to have clean teeth and gums!    One huge plus to this device is the timer setting for each area of your mouth.  I tell my kids to say their \\&quot;ABC&#x27;s\\&quot; while they&#x27;re brushing, but I used to forget to do that myself.  Now, with the Waterpik&#x27;s timer, I know my teeth are getting a thorough cleaning.  30 seconds for each of four areas is plenty of brushing time.    The toothbrush is very well designed.  Two detachable heads, so my wife and I can each use it.  Each is a different color so we don&#x27;t accidentally use each other&#x27;s brush.  It also fits well in my hand.  Easy and comfortable to grasp for two minutes.    You can set the brush on low or high.  High is best for cleaning under the gums.  I&#x27;m very sensitive about this, as I recently had a deep-cleaning session at the dentist and they warned me about letting plaque build back up under my gums.  I&#x27;m confident that this new Waterpik will help ensure that I do not have to go through that painful deep cleaning again.    To sum it up, if you&#x27;re looking to replace your regular toothbrush with something that does more for your dental health, look no further than the Waterpik Sensonic.  Great design, great price.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush. It took a little getting used to as it tickled the roof of my mouth especially when on high. I don&#x27;t know if sensonic is really better, but my teeth feel great. One thing that is a little strange is the on off button. It goes from low, to high, to off each time one pushes it. If you only push it once it goes off after two mins. I&#x27;m used to it now, but it sure made a splattery mess the first few times I used this tooth brush. I&#x27;ll be curious to know if my dental hygienist can tell the difference at my next cleaning. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The product manual states the ff:  1- Charge for 16h prior to first use (Yes, I followed the instruction)  2- A single charge is good for 1 week of normal use (2x a day)    I returned my first order within a week of arrival, as the unit would not even operate long enough for a single two-minute use (Battery would die and need a minimum of 16h in the charger before the batt indicator light stopped blinking).  When the replacement came, the battery would hold charge enough for only 2 two-minute uses.  I did not opt for another replacement and returned the item instead.    I think there may be manufacturing quality issues with either the built-in battery or the charger unit (at least for batches shipped Apr..May..2009).  Two other reviewers, both dated April 4 2009 seem to have experienced related problems.</li>
            <li> I have this item for about 17 months now and it runs like new. Tips are easy to change and identify. We share one base for family of two and have no problem at all. All it needs to be kept on base for one night once a week for full charge. I never tried to fully discharge it so seems it may work much longer. We even had it out on 8 days camp trip once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After approximately 3 years of extensive use battery started loosing capacity and the thing finally died after 3.5 years after being fully discharged during hurricane Sandy blackout -- battery won&#x27;t charge anymore. Bought again without any doubt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sensonic Professional Toothbrush for over a year, and happily use it several times a day. Brushing with the Sensonic leaves my teeth feeling smooth and clean as if I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  This brush isn&#x27;t too harsh- the mechanism is comfortably tingly and tickly, even on the backs of my teeth and in places where I have sore gums.  I recommend starting with the low-speed setting if your gums feel sensitive- they will toughen up and be able to handle full-speed in no time.  And don&#x27;t push down too hard- let the brush do the work.  The larger brush heads are great for everyday use, but I like to use the interdental brush for very precise cleaning- it really gets down under the gum line and between teeth to brush all the gunk away.  The Sensonic holds a charge reasonably long-  I get about a week&#x27;s use between charges.  I use it in the shower on a regular basis, and have not had any problems with leaking or power-supply.  I have seen some reviewers complain that the brush is top-heavy on the charging base, and it is.  Best not to leave this one too close to the toilet or trashcan (but why would you want to do that anyways?  ewww!).  I had a Braun Oral B before I replaced it with this brush, and vastly prefer the cleaning action of my Sensonic.      Water-Pik&#x27;s customer service has been unrivaled, in my opinion.  When I accidentally lost my charging base while I was overseas, I contacted customer service to inquire how to obtain a new one.  They sent me a WHOLE NEW TOOTHBRUSH, with charging base and replacement heads, free of charge.  Wow!     If I had to make a criticism, it would be that there is no option to ignore the 2 minute timer.  The toothbrush automatically shuts off after 2 minutes, and if I want to brush longer, I must push the button again- once for low-speed and twice for full speed.  I would rather that the toothbrush just signal that the 2 minutes are complete and keep on running.      All in all, I would highly recommend this toothbrush, along with a [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]] for anyone who is serious about dental hygiene.  Since I started using these two products, I kid you not, I no longer even have morning breath- when I wake up, my mouth feels fresh and clean and not at all yucky or slimy.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son as a Christmas present.   I&#x27;ve been using the exact same model for two years.  A great product.  Nuff said.</li>
            <li> This is my first toothbrush from Sensonic it works great. After a week of use I said bye bye to most if not all of the plaque on my teeth. Great product only issue is it is not international voltage, meaning only can be use in US not in Asia countries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it is the best. I use this along with the water flosser and it has actually got rid of plaque build up and kept it off. It has also made my teeth whiter. I use it with the larger head and on high speed all the time and i&#x27;ve actually gone about 2 weeks on one charge with no signs of sluggish performance. I wish I had the money to invest in this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This brush is very comfortable, the timer works just fine and it takes up very little space. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of research on sonic toothbrushes before deciding on Waterpik&#x27;s Sensonic. I compared it to Oral-B (Braun), Philips, Ultreo and a few lesser known names.  I decided against the lesser known names for fear replacement brush heads would be hard to find or even nonexistent down the road. I was leaning towards the Waterpik because it does everything the others do **BUT** has a sonic speed of 25% faster **AND** comes with a variety of brush heads **AND** all for less money.  I took it one step further just to be sure and looked up the price of replacement heads on all the brands and I found out Waterpik&#x27;s brush heads cost less than all of them. So, my decision was made.  It was clearly the best value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for four months now and my only regret is not buying it sooner. This thing is like a jet. I can actually feel it getting in between my teeth and I have no doubt it&#x27;s removing plaque from along my gum line.  My mouth feels clean and my teeth feel polished after every use.  I use it on the highest sonic speed and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all.  You do have a choice to use it at a lower speed.  There&#x27;s a slight pause in the action every 30 seconds telling you to switch quadrants and I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was going to like this feature until I had it. I feel confident that I&#x27;m brushing my teeth for the recommended amount of time. For ongoing teeth and gum heath, everyone should use a sonic toothbrush whether it&#x27;s this one or another but I recommend this one if you&#x27;re looking for the best value out there.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a con I would say the only one is that the extra brush heads should snap onto the base.  They just kind of just sit there so the slightest tap on the base cause them to fall over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The picture doesn&#x27;t show the entire unit you will receive.  It comes with the charger base and three different brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Our new dental hygienist asked me if I used a sonic toothbrush and I told her I did.  She said she thought so and that she can always tell when someone uses one. My 6 month cleanings take practically no time now. I told my husband about my short cleanings and what the hygienist said and he wanted one so I bought him this same model for Fathers Day. (He had previously declined my offers to buy him one.)d a sonic toothbrush and I told her I did.  She said she thought so and that she can always tell when someone uses one.

            <li> The first one lasted 12 years...best quality for the money out there and does the best job of all those I have tried. Battery lasts a week on the road...superb product and superb customer service. If there is a problem they will send you a new one with no questions asked...rare these days.</li>
            <li> I have used various Sonicare models over the years. I had always hoped they would seal the units so that gunk doesn&#x27;t build up in the handset and toothbrush cartridge. I was sure that after Philips bought the company they would redesign the product so that it would be easier to clean. Never happened. While the Sonicare units clean your teeth well, the Waterpik Sensonic does it as well or better (with more effective oscillation) and stays substantially cleaner. The Sensonic also comes with three brushes that have different purposes. On top of all that, the Waterpik Sensonic \\&quot;and the replacement toothbrushes\\&quot; are almost half the price of their competitors without sacrificing primary features.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the size of the unit and the comfort in holding it. It&#x27;s very comfortable for me and does not feel large. In fact, I compared the handle diameter of both brands and they are about the same. The brush head has a thicker stem that may be a bit more difficult to maneuver if you have a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;2/18/13 follow up:&lt;br /&gt;This is still a great product but you need to be careful not to press to against your teeth and gums if you use it at full strength. Ultrasonic toothbrushes can do damage if not used correctly.</li>
            <li> I have had the Waterpik toothbrush for 2 years now.  They are superb quality for less money than other brand names.  I have ordered 2 more for my children.  We had another brand name before and are replacing them with this Waterpik.  It is also more economical when you have to replace the toothbrush.  I highly recommend this toothbrush over all the rest.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable, high-quality electric toothbrush. And that is exactly what I got when I ordered this one. It encourages you to brush for two minutes, and it has two speeds. It is quiet but powerful. My teeth are cleaner and whiter. Plus, I now look forward to brushing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Actually this is a repeat purchase. I bought my first waterpik back in 2000 and lasted until last December 2010. A remarkable duration. I will stick to this tooth brush product-system until some innovation comes up sometime in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used a few models from the 3 companies itemized below; all seem good, but I find Waterpic better.  A detailed electric toothbrush search in Medline shows Oral B generally fares better than Sonicare.  Only one article reports on those 2 + Waterpic ¨       Evaluation of the Plaque Removal Efficacy of Three Power Toothbrushes        Sharma NC et al       J Int Acad Periodontol 2006; 8(3):83-88.  This study demonstrated Waterpik Sensonic Toothbrush performed better than the other brands; this article prompted my purchasing this model.     Based on &gt;score recent articles, my conclusions &#x3D;&gt;    Sonicare/Phillips 5300 traditional linear brush design  ~520 Hz + ultrasonic blast [peculiarly, have not found information demonstrating ultrasound is effective: thus dubious]  ~$60/Amazon [higher or lower for other Sonicare models]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Oral B 5000 small head, rotary motion; somewhat better reviews than Sonicare [Medline search]  ~150 Hz  ~$110/Amazon [higher or lower for other Oral B models]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Waterpik Sensonic     Similar to Sonicare design  500 Hz; Note: 2 speeds, but unacceptably, only one oscillation rate specified  ~$60 [one model only]    My individual, nonscientific view: Waterpic seems excellent.  Better rigorous investigation required for best choice; my experience is these 3 brands are fine, but Waterpic appears best.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  I&#x27;ll be glad to save your effort by forwarding my literature search &#x3D;&gt; [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electronic toothbrushes over the years including rotodent, braun and interplaque. This is better than them all and less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the second electric toothbrush I have owned, and it&#x27;s a step up.  The vibrating frequency is amazing, yet it is very quiet and quite comfortable when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/2012:  The toothbrush failed after nearly two years of use. Apparently I missed something in the instructions about removing the brush attachment after each use.  When I e-mailed customer service (and included photos of the damage), they called back quickly and sent a replacement unit.  No questions asked!  KUDOS to Waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;In truth, I don&#x27;t think it was my fault; but the battery may have leaked out some corrosive materials.  Still, WP customer service is a winner, and I am actually looking forward to trying the company&#x27;s new flossing device.  You can call me a WP fan now, and my five stars remain in place.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush itself re strength of pulse, feel in my hand, length of charge. It&#x27;s great! But I short circuited the damn thing while in Europe, and the base broke. The toothbrush was fine, but I had to buy a whole new one to make the old one useable b/c I couldnt buy the base separately. SOOO great brush, wish it were more modular re pricing. Very similar to the original sonicare, for you original toothbrush gangstas.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews... however, I feel compelled to share my experience!  Overall, this is a great toothbrush and does an excellent job cleaning.  BUT... if you have sensitive teeth issues, it will make them worse.  I have dentin hypersensitivity, which is due to the gums receding, enamel eroding, and dentin becoming exposed.  Mine have only gotten more and more sensitive the few months I have used this toothbrush, and I have only used it on the low setting.  SO if you have sensitivity issues, you may want to go with something gentler.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sensonic professional toothbrush. The first unit I had lasted 16 years. When used properly, your teeth will feel like you just got a cleaning at the dentist. This is an excellent product which does everything it claims in regard to cleaning and plaque removal. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how much brighter and cleaner my teeth are with using this product along with the water flosser.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has never used an automatic toothbrush has a real treat in store for them. If you ever have to return to manual brushing, you will feel like you are mentally challenged.&lt;br /&gt;This is the latest Waterpik product I have used and the best . The 30 second timer segments help make sure you devote enough time to each quadrant. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive gums, use the High speed for and ultimate brushing.  I personally prefer the Low speed and at shutdown, press the ON button for stopless High speed to polish off the molars and any other area you might have slighted.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to other&#x27;s comments, my Sensonic sits on the charger 24 hours a day and is always ready. By the way my previous unit lasted nearly 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have found is the reduction of brushes provided. Waterpik saved themselves close to $10 by only including 1 Adult &amp; 1 Childs brush head over the previous 4 Adult. Instead, they added a brush type floss-er tool which rarely gets used.&lt;br /&gt;The overall cost sure beats the Phillips and Braun products and many independent trials rate the SR 1000 equal or superior to them.&lt;br /&gt;Finding replacement brushes might be a problem since the Waterpik product is rarely found at the chain and big box stores. You will almost have to deal Online or with Waterpik themselves.[[ASIN:B00132FUNG Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> Decided to buy a sonic toothbrush to take better care of my teeth as I do not make it to the dentist as often as I should. Toothbrush came as described. Have been using it now for about 3 weeks. Waterpik guarantees positive results in 14 days. It only took about a week of regular brushing to notice quite a difference in the cleanliness of my mouth and the brighter look of my teeth. I have not tested how long a single charge can go, but I do know that it will last at least 4 days. Good product for a great price. Would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good electric toothbrush with really no complaints.  It&#x27;s not very big either so does not take up a lot of space on your bathroom counter if you are limited in room.  The two speeds are good as well for different types of brushing along with the brush heads themselves.  Seem to be about the appropriate size and last for a decent amount of time as well.  Overall, highly recommended for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter J. Miller</li>
            <li> This is the best. Ya gotta have a sonic toothbrush. Nothing else comes close to cleaning the way sonic does. I&#x27;ve used the other brands of sonic toothbrushes, but the Waterpik has the strongest vibes and does the best job, is easiest to clean. Less expensive brushes. Simply the best. This is the third one I&#x27;ve owned. They last several years. My only complaint is that I specifically ordered the SR-1000 model, so I could re-use the base from my previous one, the base that attaches to the wall in my tiny, no shelf space bathroom. But they shipped the SR-3000 model which has a new base that has to live on a table or shelf. Oh well. I&#x27;ll figure out something.</li>
            <li> For 15-years I have been using a Panasonic Electric Toothbrush that operated on one replaceable Double-A battery.  The brushes had the ability to go side-to-side or up-and-down depending on which switch you pushed.  There was only one speed, but it did an adequate job.  Then it DIED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the WaterPik because I have used their other products and always been pleased with them.  I waited until my latest professional dental cleaning to write this review, because I wanted to see if there would be ANY improvement in removing the plague from my teeth, or at least keeping my gums healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hygienist&#x27;s probing in my mouth showed that there was some improvement on some teeth, BUT OVERALL there was NO IMPROVEMENT, and on some teeth the condition had worsened.  I also found that the brushes wear out faster than the brushes that came with the Panasonic - - replaced about once a year, but with WaterPik I am going to have to replace SEVERAL times a year.  Oh well.  That is why I can&#x27;t give 5-stars, but I am GLAD I didn&#x27;t cave in to the hype from Oral B for a MORE expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There for about 4 years my dentist was discovering a new cavatie at every visit! Now that I&#x27;ve been using this, no cavaties (been using for about a year). My teeth feel great after using- just like a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a toothbrush that looked much like this one, but where each tuft of bristles twirled individually.  I have always used Waterpik&#x27;s water flossing devices (one for home, one portable for travel), and respect the name and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the quality of the Sensonic toothbrush is very good - but the bristle tufts are stationary; that is, they do not move, although the entire head is whipping sideways back and forth at a rapid rate.  Disconcerting.  I have a number of tooth implants and caps; and I suspect they are being loosened by this brush.  I have taken to using a manual toothbrush 4 days a week, and using the Sensonic only 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;As long as this motion is what you want/expect - it would be a good item.  But it&#x27;s not what I wanted; and toothbrushes have never been returnable items, so I am out the bucks!</li>
            <li> I remember Waterpik from from childhood (almost 20 years ago) so I&#x27;m thinking this company lead the way in sonic toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve owned a few battery operated toothbrushes and I really liked this one overall.  It takes 16 hours to initially charge it but then it&#x27;s ready to go.  A quick list of my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ nice speed and vibration (2 speeds: regular and super fast)&lt;br /&gt;+ 30 second timer for quandrant area brushing&lt;br /&gt;+ 2 minute timer for total brushing time&lt;br /&gt;+ thin, tapered brush for hard to reach areas or targeting specific areas (this would be a great option for people with braces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- around one week battery life brushing 3x a day&lt;br /&gt;- toothbrush head is all one length and not good as some of the more dental friendly options out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own a Braun Oral B Triumph Professional Care 900.  It has the same features but a nicer shaped tooth brush and a longer battery life. A big minus is the speed and vibration, it can be a little abrasive.  If I could just switch brush heads I would have the perfect sonic toothbrush but I cannot (I tried) so I&#x27;ll keep using this one.</li>
            <li> This is the very first electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve tried, I have always been hesitant to use one thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective as a regular toothbrush. My doubts have now been eased: this electric toothbrush works beautifully. It cleans between teeth with relative ease, removing plaque and other bad things without the strenuous effort that is necessary when using a regular toothbrush. It also massages the gums as it cleans, making them feel better as well as refreshed by removing the gum soreness I&#x27;m occasionally prone to suffering from. I found this toothbrush easy to charge, easy to use and easy to store between uses. All-in-all a superb product that I can strongly recommend. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to using a regular toothbrush after using this. Well done Waterpik!</li>
            <li> Our Hygienist recommended a different brand, but I did a lot of research before purchasing and selected the Waterpik Sensonic. We both love it.  Much more powerful than the battery operated model we had been using.  Easy to switch heads.  Stutter-timer works well.  Got the best evaluation from my hygienist EVER!  It does take about 24 hours to recharge - so plan ahead.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad model but this toothbrush just does not clean my husband&#x27;s or my teeth. It will leave gunk along gum line even in easy to reach places. I HATE IT! Either we will get another Oral B or try Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this toothbrush based on an article which claimed it was better than the Sonicare brushes.  Well, I have been using Sonicare brushes for many years, and this product is definitely not better as far as cleaning goes, and the ergonomics are terrible.  The handle is extremely large and difficult to hold once the inevitable toothpast foam gets on it.  The brush is not angled like the Sonicare and is larger in all respects. There are no protective covers for the brushes and it does not have the UV sterilizer that comes with the Sonicare elite.  The power button has an annoying lag when turning on and switching to the high setting, which is the only one really worth while on either model.    I strongly advise anyone interested in a sonic toothbrush to forego this product and get the Sonicare Elite.  This Waterpik is going in my garage to possibly be used to clean small parts.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. The toothbrush did a fine job while it worked, but that was for only seven days. Then, it appears that something in the area of the battery and the induction pickup began to swell. The outer shell began to split, and the fissures widened. Not cracks, but actual openings of about 1/16\\&quot; in width. Water got in, and the unit began to function erratically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, Amazon&#x27;s customer service was absolutely five star.</li>
            <li> This is my third iteration of the Waterpik Sensonic toothbrush.  It is, in my opinion and experience, the top of the line. My only bone to pick is that the pedestal upon which the toothbrush is recharged and its accessories rest is rather easily overturned and the pedestal&#x27;s plastic construction can break. This occurs especially easily with the toothbrush resting on the pedestal because of the Sensonic&#x27;s weight and resultant high center of gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the Sensonic cleans teeth well with an array of accessories. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of months and the brush is now dead!  The green light blinks but the hanndle does not turn on.  My old one lasted 6 years!  What a piece of trash!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year.  No complaints.  It works well, and the battery seems to be maintaining its capacity.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare but decided to check into other sonic toothbrushes because of the size and price of replacement heads for the Sonicare.  The Waterpik got fairly good reviews in comparison so I gave it a shot.  It seems to work just as well as the Sonicare barring a few Cons;    Pros: Does a fairly good job; lasts for at least three on / off cycles (haven&#x27;t had the patience to go beyond that); has better brush holders than the Sonicare; replacement heads are significantly less bulky and expensive (about half the price) than Sonicare; comes with a \\&quot;between the teeth cleaner\\&quot;; easy to control and operate.    Cons: Brush design inferior to Sonicare&#x27;s; not sure how long the battery would actually last (ie, a week off the charger); the on / off button is too easily activated.    All in all an excellent toothbrush for the money, all factors taken into consideration, I&#x27;d choose this over the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Waterpik believes in their products, which explains the two-year warranty. And it does feel good and look good, evidence of the attention paid to ergonomic design factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  How rhapsodic can you get over an electric toothbrush? Not very, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is comfortable to hold. The two speeds available seem to be adequate. The regular brush heads have a nice design, similar to the head on a regular toothbrush as opposed to the round heads seen on some electrics. The \\&quot;interdental brush\\&quot; is quite nice and seems to do a very efficient job of cleaning between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, a very nice product with the quality one would expect from Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth with an electric toothbrush is ok. I think the product does exactly what it says it does. Not sure how good it works in place of the old fashion do it yourselfer but seems to do a good job. Guess we will see when the dentist inspects the choppers!</li>
            <li> I worked in dental offices for over 25 years; I have used electric toothbrushes for 50 years.  I have always bought Waterpik electric toothbrushes. This model is the best yet. It comes with a separate \\&quot;inter-dental stimulator\\&quot; that is used in between teeth at the gumline. This helps clear food particles in those areas as well as stimulate the gum tissue and prevent periodontal problems. I highly recommend using this means to keep tissue healthy.</li>
            <li> I have a few complaints about this toothbrush.  When I use it on high speed, it splatters everywhere and messes up my mirror.  CAUTION: DO NOT REMOVE BRUSH FROM MOUTH WITHOUT TURNING THE UNIT OFF FIRST!  Also, the on/off button is poorly situated and way too sensitive.  The unit keeps shutting off while I&#x27;m brushing because my thumb accidentally hits the button, and it turns on every time I wipe off the handle. I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any other electric toothbrush.  I also don&#x27;t like the way it switches to high speed before I can turn it off after I&#x27;ve been using it on low speed.  This makes it splatter everywhere.  It should have two separate buttons - one for one/off and one for low/high speed.  My last complaint is that the brushes don&#x27;t fit tightly on the base, and every time I put the handle back on the base or accidentally bump it, they fall off into the wastebasket!  For those of you complaining about the battery life, if you keep the handle on the base when you aren&#x27;t using it, it will stay charged.  I have been using electric toothbrushes for 45 years and always kept them on the charger when not in use.  UPDATE: This is ridiculous.  I just brushed my teeth, and when I put the handle back on the base, the whole thing tipped over, the base and handle fell into the wastebasket, and the handle turned itself on!  The brushes all wound up on the bathroom floor. Waterpik needs to come up with a heavier, more stable base.  I have never had this problem with my previous electric brushes, of which there have been many, and I do not want to mount this thing on my wall. It probably wouldn&#x27;t make any difference anyway - the brushes would still get knocked off the base because they are too loose.   8/16/08 -  My toothbrushes just fell into the wastebasket again! I am going to e-mail a complaint to Waterpik.  10/14/09 -  This toothbrush died last month after only 14 months of use, so I called the company and they sent me a brand-new one that I received only a week later.  I didn&#x27;t even have to send them the old one or any proof of purchase.  They have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sensonic toothbrush for a month now and I&#x27;m really pleased with its performance. I had an old Interplak electric that was losing battery recharge capability so I found myself using the manual most of the time. If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve ever used, you don&#x27;t know how much better you can clean your mouth with a modern electric. Great price from Amazon, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I owned the predecessor to this toothbrush (200w) and loved it.  If this one lasts half as long it is well worth the price.  Which by the way is half the price of other brands.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:     I have now had the brush for about 6 months.  In general I like it and have had 2 dental cleaning since my purchase and the hygienist said my teeth are clean.  The bad news is that the metal rod that you attach the brush head onto has started to corrode.  I am the only one using this brush so I only pull the head off every 3 months.  When I went to replace the head this last time, the brush seemed to be stuck on.  After considerable tugging, I was able to get it off.  What I found was that the stem is a chrome plated steel rod that has started to corrode and the chrome is flaking off.  I never had this problem with my old Sonicare.  I was able to clean it up with a wire brush and it seems to work OK now. Whoever had the idea to save a few cents and not use a stainless steel rod will probably cost Waterpik more than they save. To Waterpik&#x27;s credit, they do advise pulling the head off and to clean and dry off the handle after each use.  If I had done that, it probably wouldn&#x27;t have corroded.  If you aren&#x27;t doing that, you might want to start if you don&#x27;t want it to corrode like mine.  I think I will just coat the steel rod with Vaseline and see how that works.  These things don&#x27;t last forever anyway.      Original post:    It has advantages over my old Sonicare.  The brush head is smaller, which I like because I can clean the back of my front teeth better.  I also like the lower replacement brush cost.  Quality so far seems good, and it came with a large and small brush head and an inter-dental cleaner.      A little advice about using these sonic brushes. Use a gentle touch, more pressure does NOT mean cleaner.  Spend 5-10 seconds in each spot, gently work the longer bristles between the teeth and right along the gum line.  Again, use a light touch.  Experiment, you&#x27;ll find what works.  I find that to really get my teeth clean, I use the high speed setting and take a full cycle on the bottom teeth and a full cycle on the top teeth for a total of 4 minutes.    Gets my teeth clean, a fair price and has lower cost replacement brushes....so far so good.</li>
            <li> Before using this sonic toothbrush I read just about everything I could find on the web about the advantages and possible disadvantages of sonic toothbrushes when it comes to dental hygiene.  I wanted to do nothing that would cause more dental problems than I already had.  Although some were paid for in part by sonic toothbrush manufacturers, some seemed independent.  I found no red flags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of use of the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush here is what I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1) My teeth felt cleaner for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2) I was asked by a couple of people I know well if I was using a tooth whitener system.  The Waterpik apparently helps with removing any extrinsic stains on the teeth.  While it does it so gradually that I never noticed the difference, people who knew me well could tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is not the most expensive sonic toothbrush I have used, but it is definitely a good buy for its price if you care about your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  (I would like to note that I have never had any sonic toothbrush injury my teeth, my amalgam fillings or my crowns.)</li>
            <li> We received a Waterpik Sensonic toothbrush a year ago.  We were immediately impressed by how well the brush worked.  We thought the toothbrush we had been using was doing a good job until we used the Sensonic for the first time and realized what a poor job our previous toothbrush had done.  We thoroughly recommend this product.  We also hope that Waterpik doesn&#x27;t discontinue this product any time soon.</li>
            <li> In the past, always used Sensonic power brush.  Item arrived, seemed cheaper construction than prior models. New brush would not charge.  Returned brush and bought Sonicare e5300.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> It took a few uses before I got the hang of it, now I have become a fan of Sensonic brushing. It leaves your teeth with a really clean feel. It makes me more conscious of how well I&#x27;m brushing my teeth, and how long I brush them.</li>
            <li> Good cleaning action with timed quads for full brushing. I like the fresh smooth feel of my teeth afterwards. I also have the WaterPik Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li> The sound is very annoying like a buzzin bee who is out to take you down mortally. Also the bristles are little harsh on my teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does the job and cleaning is very high quality, only if you can live the aobve mention caveats.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great for all the reasons the reviewers who liked it liked it.  I&#x27;ve used Waterpik Sensonic toothbrushes for years.  Unfortunately, the first one died after about 6 years. Never great when a product conks out, but I would have happily bought another.  Even more unfortunately, they had discontinued my original model.  This one was the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the effectiveness and features of the toothbrush, my decision to purchase it was very strongly influenced by the fact that it has a wall-mountable base. Annoyingly, you would never know that from the ads or even the box itself.  I believe I contacted the company to find out if the base was wall-mountable and to urge them to include the fact that it was in supposedly informational descriptions. (I see that hasn&#x27;t changed. Heck, why give customers info that might be the deciding factor in favor of your product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many people, we have a pedestal sink, not a cabinet with a large counter top.  We already have a wall-mounted soap dish to free up space, but still there&#x27;s little free surface room, and some of what there is is curved, so not usable for an electric toothbrush base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately (again), the wall-mounted base is very flimsy, and pieces of it have been breaking off over time just through regular use.  The base of my original Sensonic was very sturdy and superior design-wise in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while this is a great toothbrush, it falls short of a five-star rating in my book.</li>
            <li> This is my second Waterpik Sensonic toothbrush. My first one only cost $25.00! Nonetheless, it is a great toothbrush and worth the price. Every time I use it, it feels as if I just had my teeth cleaned. They feel and look polished. This toothbrush works just as well as or better than its more expensive counterparts. Good value and a good price.</li>
            <li> I have bought three of the Waterpiks, for my whole family.  When my son fried one in Italy (he plugged it into a 220V outlet without the adaptor...), i searched and searched for a new charger, to no avail.  I had to replace the entire toothbrush just because the charger got fried.&lt;br /&gt;Then, a few months after that, my husband&#x27;s charger stopped working, and again i couldn&#x27;t buy a new one.  Now we are sharing the same charger.  Not a big deal.  Then, starting a few weeks ago, my toothbrush is failing to keep a charge very long, it turns itself off after a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I am not sure i am going to buy more of this brand.  Not built to last and no parts for it.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush worked really well while it lasted...</li>
            <li> Waterpik has come a long way since my parents first bought a Dental Water Jet in the early 1970&#x27;s, a jet-stream tool with a water tank that we were supposed to use after brushing. The company has long since expanded to electric toothbrushes that consolidate our mandatory dental tasks knowing full well that we are all passively resistant to the onerous task of brushing our teeth thoroughly. Personal neglect eventually catches up with us during the dreaded semi-annual dental appointment when a wagging finger usually accompanies a sermon on the necessities of flossing and consistent brushing. With all that in mind, the Sensonic Professional really makes it even easier to maintain the appropriate standards for the daily care of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept behind this machine is what the manufacturer calls a sonic toothbrush. Apparently, the power of the vibrations obliterates plaque and other debris more effectively than applying more pressure with a brush directly. After using it for two weeks, I definitely feel I am exerting less pressure than my previous electric toothbrush, and my gums do not feel nearly as sore. Yet, for the technical ingenuity behind this enhancement, I have to admit the best feature of the Sensonic Professional is the built-in timer, which automatically turns off the brush after two minutes. It even provides an automatic pause at thirty-second intervals to signal when you should be complete with each quadrant in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The non-think aspect already complements the quality I have come to expect from Waterpik. First, the bristles on the toothbrushes are relatively soft. Second, there is a three-speed option similar to the way a kitchen blender works - \\&quot;Low\\&quot; for basic cleaning and gum massage, \\&quot;High\\&quot; for targeted plaque removal, and a toggling feature that lets you switch between the speeds with minimal effort. And finally, there are three color-coded brush-heads, one specifically for inter-dental brushing. All in all, it feels like Waterpik has really listened to their customers and made an electric toothbrush that stops just short of brushing your teeth for you.as really listened to their customers and made an electric toothbrush that stops just short of brushing your teeth for you.</li>
            <li> When you first get the toothbrush, it will need to charge for 16 hours.  There&#x27;s an indicator light to let you know when it has fully charged.  After that, it maintains its charge for a week.  I charged mine off and on and never had a problem.  It comes with two standard heads and an interdental brush head.  Since the standard heads come with color bands at the bottom, this toothbrush could be shared by more than one person.  The interdental head is pointy and looks like it would be painful but did not cause me any discomfort.  The bristles are actually very soft.  The toothbrush is wall mountable, but I chose not to do so since the heads don&#x27;t come with a cover.  I found this toothbrush surprisingly easy to hold.  I&#x27;ve had troubles in the past wielding electric toothbrushes with smaller awkward handles.  The toothbrush has 2 speeds.  It works for 30 seconds and then pauses so to signal that it&#x27;s time to brush another zone of your mouth.  After 2 minutes it shuts off.  This probably helps me save time. At first use, I found the first speed to be too slow and the second speed to be too quick and messy.  I dropped it in the sink once (totally my fault due to an injury).  This caused the metal bar to which you attach the toothbrush head to bend.  Since then, the toothbrush actually slowed down to a comfortable speed.  This happened after about the third day of use and the toothbrush is still working well.  I still feel like I&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning after each use.  My teeth are whiter.  I&#x27;ve tried several of the cheaper electric toothbrushes and while they are better than manual, this is still a step above that.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.   The only improvements I could suggest for this product would be to create covers for the toothbrush heads. Of course, I could buy my own, but even the cheap electric toothbrushes come with a plastic cap which covers the bristles.</li>
            <li> No other time have I thought about my dentist, especially after the bill. But I feel as if my dentist is there when I wake up and there when I go to bed! I am hooked on electronic toothbrush and I can&#x27;t get over how my teeth feel, so dentifully clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is easy to work with and you get just enough of a buzz, (vibrating levels) that circulates within your mouth. Haven&#x27;t got used to the paused intervals which allow you to time and focus on quadrants of your mouth. Either way, the pausing is relatively inconspicuous. But what is really good is the pik. It works wonders, designed correctly and works correctly. I like the small size of the brush, which allows you to insert better for the other side of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also applaud the idea that you can mount this on the wall or keep on the countertop.  With so many electrical gadgets, mounting allows us to get it out of the way.  Great product....Rizzo</li>
            <li> This was the third pruchase of this toothbrush for a family member and I use one myself. According to our dentist, it has really improved the health of our teeth and gums. Kids like it and they brush better using this brush.</li>
            <li> Ask yourself, what do you expect from a tooth brush.  It should be effective, reliable, easy to use, and comfortable to use.  That&#x27;s what you get from this product.  I used to have 2 sonicare e3000 both died in a month due to water leakage into the battery and circuitry chambers (and the designer&#x27;s brain), you don&#x27;t see this happening here.  As the matter of fact, there&#x27;s even no metal contact points on the brush and the charger (the power is transformed by magnetic field) so you would never worry about rusting problems.  One charge lasts about 2 weeks so I plug the charger in only when needed.  I&#x27;m not going to discuss the effectiveness since a lot of threads already covered that and that&#x27;s more of a personal opinion, but at least this brush is well designed and nicely built.  You wouldn&#x27;t get that &#x27;If I&#x27;d known this stupid design I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it&#x27; feeling I had for soniwhocares.    Update:  Dead after a year.    First the charge base started to show cracks, even to the point where pieces began to fall off.  Then 2 resistors, one in the charger (which I replaced) and one in the brush, died, and I finally gave up fixing it.  The resistor in the charge base does not have enough wattage rating and got burnt out (design flaw), the reason for the one in the brush is unknown.  I really liked this product, but the short life span drove me away to $10 AA toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m in love.  The package comes with the charger stand, three brush heads (two standard brush heads and one interdental brush), and the actual toothbrush.      What&#x27;s nice about the brush is that it has a two minute timer that will shut the brush off when finished.  Additionally, it briefly pauses every thirty seconds so you know when to switch to the different section of your mouth (top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back).  This works wonderfully for me because, in the morning, I&#x27;m not exactly at my most awake.      The two normal brushes are nice in that they come with a colored base, so if more than one person is using the brush, you can tell the heads apart.  My biggest...well, only complaint is that the interdental brush isn&#x27;t that great.  I loved it the first two or three times I used it, but then the very fine brush point ended up not working as well.  It&#x27;s not really practical since the individual brushes will always lose their shape.      Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great sonic brush, my teeth feel a lot cleaner and the brush is a lot more gentle on my teeth and gums than normal brushing.  I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try, if you&#x27;re going to purchase a sonic brush.</li>
            <li> I am quite surprised to feel so enthusiastic about a teeth cleaning product, but I really, really, love this toothbrush.  Every single day, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist - silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other electronic toothbrushes and have never liked them. They didn&#x27;t clean my teeth much better than an ordinary toothbrush, and they vibrated way too much and were quite rough.  This toothbrush is really gentle, the vibrating/scrubbing motion is mostly at the end of the toothbrush where it belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is easy to use, just plug in and let it charge for 16 hours before you use it.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to use abrasive toothpaste with this brush, such as Arm &amp; Hammer baking powder toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve been using it anyway and taking extra care to rinse off my toothbrush.  A month later, the toothbrush seems to be holding up just fine.  If I do end up ruining this toothbrush, I will replace it without hesitation because it does such a great job.</li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush! I was very careful to follow directions for the battery as it seems to have been an issue for some people. So far, so good. I charged it the original 16 hours and it worked for almost two weeks (using it approximately 3 times per day). When it ran out, I charged it another 16. Again, no worries but it has only been a couple of weeks. If the battery dies, I will be crushed, because my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> Died after few months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on May 30, 2008.  Since that date, I&#x27;ve had to call Waterpik 3 times for replacements under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works wonderfully.  My teeth are very clean after using this toothbrush and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the charger.  It&#x27;s a poorly made plastic base.  The original one I purchased from Amazon just stopped charging the toothbrush after 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first replacement from Waterpik worked for another few months, then the plastic base started to develop cracks and fell apart so I could see the charred circuit board inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try to be more careful with the next replacement and dried off the toothbrush completely before placing it on the charger, hoping that it was the small amount of water on the toothbrush that was causing the problem.  No luck -- even with drying it after every use it still developed cracks and the circuit board inside was charred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for my next replacement to come in the mail.  It&#x27;s a good thing it has 2 year warranty, but it&#x27;s a lot of hassle to have them replaced every few months.</li>
            <li> Almost totally satisfied with this product, except I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;stop&#x27; feature at all.  The toothbrush stops for a split second to let you know you have brushed for so many seconds---completely useless to me and annoying.  It would also be nice to have some warning light or some other notification before the battery charge runs out---instead,  the toothbrush just totally stops working and I&#x27;m usually about half done when it quits.</li>
            <li> Waterpik has long been a respected name in the oral care industry, so when I saw this product I jumped at the chance to try it out. Having said that, the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush is not all I had hoped for. Let&#x27;s start with the positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a wall-mountable base which is GREAT for cutting down clutter around the bathroom sink, and keeps it up and out of the way of small hands looking to \\&quot;help clean the bathroom.\\&quot; It also has the prototypical \\&quot;30 second timer\\&quot; which has become so popular with sonic brushes as of late. On top of that, it comes with two seperate brush heads (one for him and one for her), along with an interdental brush. Lastly, unlike the Ultreo which has been my brush of choice, it has two seperate speed settings, one low and one high. Overall, it is an attractive set-up and good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is VERY harsh on the gums for some reason. I&#x27;ve used Ultreo with no problems for a few months now. When I tried this for a week, my gums bled something awful every time, even on the low speed setting. On top of that, the high speed setting just doesn&#x27;t work with this brush. You end up splattering spit and toothpaste all over the place, no matter how proper your brushing style is. It&#x27;s really unfortunate too, because if it weren&#x27;t for these issues, this would be a wonderful 5-star brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, this is still priced decently compared to other \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; brushes on the market, but if you&#x27;re looking for the ultimate brushing experience, I would have to recommend Ultreo over this Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I got my first electric tooth brush a few months ago - a [[ASIN:B000V4O1UA Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush]] and found it a little unwieldy and expensive for replacement parts.  However it did make me appreciate electric toothbrushes in general.    This toothbrush exceled in two areas.  First and most importantly, it felt very comfortable in the hand and mouth.  It is much more ergonomic than my first brush, which always felt like I was trying to brush with a shovel or something.    Second, replacement brush heads are reasonably prices and available locally.  We wanted heads for the whole family which cost $25 each for the Ultreo.  They are half the price for the Waterpick and comes with two heads right out of the box.  Plus a brush to reach within teeth.    The brush seems very well built and designed. I think I found the brush for our family for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Less than two weeks after I purchased one of these, the charging unit started smoking and fell apart. It&#x27;s clear there was an electrical problem. After returning it, I received another one. This worked fine for about 5 months. Then the metallic plug upon which you insert the head broke. The head now swivels freely. It could be coincidental, but products should not be defective this often.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine, a dental hygienist, once told me the only gadget men wouldn&#x27;t buy were electric toothbrushes. Though I have had several through the years this particular Waterpick may prove her wrong.    The device has a clever timer which creates a brief pause in thirty second intervals. The idea is that the pause is a signal to go to the next quadrant, assuring thirty seconds of brushing per quadrant. The crazy thing is it works. The brushing feels like polishing at the dentist&#x27;s office-stimulating to the gums and scrubbing the teeth. Additionally teeth feel clean after using it, just like after a cleaning.    There is also a tool for cleaning between teeth, but it is not a true substitute for flossing. Nonetheless this is an outstanding dental product and well worth trying.</li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush.  It has several attractive features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It comes with an extra brushhead and the heads are color coded so it is easy to share the toothbrush (my wife and I use this one, and I use the green head and she uses the red one).&lt;br /&gt;2. It also comes with an additional precision brush for getting at hard to reach spots.  I don&#x27;t really use this much, but it seems to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s easy to change the brushheads, and the recharging unit makes them easy to store -- there are storage spots for the unit and four additional heads.&lt;br /&gt;4. There are two speeds to fit different needs -- my wife likes the slower speed and I like the faster one.&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s easy to wash off.  While you wouldn&#x27;t want to submerge the entire toothbrush since it doesn&#x27;t appear to be watertight near the battery, you can run water over the top end and even around the button area after use.&lt;br /&gt;6. It makes my teeth feel and look very clean.&lt;br /&gt;7. The battery lasts for several brushing sessions when it is fully charged and can be recharged overnight.&lt;br /&gt;8. For what it does, the cost seems quite reasonable -- especially given that it can be shared by two (or three, with the purchase of an additional brushhead) users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I see is that there is no indicator on the toothbrush as to how much charge remains.  That would be a helpful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric toothbrushes and some of them are pretty good, but I really like this one and plan to stick with it for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this electric toothbrush. I have not liked the powered brushes I have tried in the past, but had heard that the sonic brushes like this were different. I have to agree. It is great.    The brush handle which holds the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; power source and the rechargeable battery is about nine inches long without a brush attached. Brush attachments are about 3 inches long. The recharger/base takes up a space roughly 4 inches on a side, and has the docking area for recharging the handle as well as tabs for holding 4 extra brushes. Hardware for wall mounting is included. Things don&#x27;t fit tightly on the base, so it is easy to bump and knock things off. It should be positioned with that in mind. While mostly plastic, it seems solidly built, and feels good in my hand.    The set includes three brushes - two regular and one interdental brush for getting between teeth and into other such hard-to-clean spaces. The charging system uses the new inductive style single knob that fits into a hole in the base of the handle. This way the battery is charged without having any exposed electrical connections to short out or cause problems. It seems to work quite well.    There are simple care and use instructions which are easy to follow. The brush has two speeds, and will pause briefly at 30 second intervals to help time one&#x27;s brushing. It also stops after two minutes, which is considered by some to be the optimum time to clean teeth. It is a minor nuisance to start it back up again if you need more time. The brushes are multilevel like many current manual brushes, and sport rounded bristle ends to be more gentle to gums.    One uses much less pressure than with a manual brush, which is good news for gums, since they don&#x27;t like the abrasion that comes with too strenuous a brushing style. I found the brush very easy, almost fun, to use, although the somewhat large size and vibrating bristles spraying toothpaste/saliva required modifications in my brushing method. I learned the hard way to be careful taking the brush out of my mouth - I made some nice toothpaste-spot \\&quot;art\\&quot; on my black shirt and mirror. Be careful when it is on, it can spray stuff around (watch your eyes - toothpaste is not good for them). Kids would have to be supervised, and the size will be a factor for them as well.    Overall I really like the little beastie. It does an outstanding job of getting my teeth clean, and makes my gums pretty happy as well. I know of no problems with this kind of powered brush. It seems pretty benign, although they do warn not to let anything but the bristles touch your teeth while using it, a reasonable idea, as vibrating hard plastic bouncing on tooth enamel is not a good thing. All the research I have found is quite positive about the benefits of these brushes, and there have been no reported problems healthwise. I consider this brush a very good addition to one&#x27;s health care regimen.    There is no information about the sonic mechanism. I would like to have known more about how it worked, what frequencies are used, etc. (Yeah, I know, real geek stuff.) The research I found talked about the speed of the bristles and how the brush set up fluid shockwaves that even disrupted plaque a bit beyond the actual reach of the bristles. Studies show sonic brushes are better than manual or other powered types of brushes, while being better for your gums.    There is a possibility that the specific frequencies could have a health impact, but allopathic medicine has not advanced far enough to recognize that (or prefers to ignore it). In any case, there are specific frequencies that would be benign to a person but deadly to specific germs, and that would make this brush doubly beneficial. Probably not a consideration at this stage, though. That would open too many doors that some would prefer remain shut.    WaterPik did a great job designing and building this brush, and proves their confidence in it with a two year warranty. This brush tooka skeptic and made him a convert. I am convinced. I like it a lot. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Ultreo electric toothbrush for some time.  And if you&#x27;ve checked, you&#x27;ll see that their sticker price is quite high.  Now, I love it, but I was willing to give this baby a try.  I&#x27;m very, very picky about my teeth...and what I really was interested in trying about the Waterpik was the Interdental attachment that you can use for hard to reach places and for between you teeth and gums.  WOW!!  I&#x27;m so thrilled I tried this toothbrush.  For the price, $69.99, you are SO getting a DEAL!!  This toothbrush is just as good, if not better than the Ultreo...and it has the added bonus of the attachment.  It has 2 speeds, low and high, a 2 min. timer, with 30 sec. interval pauses.  It has an ergonomic handle that fits perfectly in your hand, and the on/off switch is high enough up that you don&#x27;t have problems with accidentally switching it off mid brush.  It gives you a very thorough brushing, leaving you with that super clean, just left the dentist office feeling, and THEN you use the Interdental attachment...I love this!!  It&#x27;s so great.  I can get between all my teeth, around my gums...down in the grooves of my teeth.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  Oh...and the replacement head is only $10.99!!  Which is another bonus!!  If you&#x27;ve been thinking about buying an electric toothbrush, this is the way to go.  For the price, you&#x27;re getting an excellent toothbrush, with the added bonus of the attachment, for a great price.  It holds an excellent charge, and actually has room on the base for an additional head if you have someone else you&#x27;d like to also share it with you.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this, Waterpik had made a convert out of me!!</li>
            <li> Having been a user of the Oral-B ProfessionalCare series for many years, I was eager to give Waterpik&#x27;s product entry into the uber-competitive electric toothbrush market a try.  For users accustomed to Oral-B&#x27;s products the Sensonic Professional will surprise you with just how gentle it feels, making Oral-B&#x27;s experience almost violent in comparison.  While the Sensonic Pro does provide 2 brush-speeds (low and high) - the low is almost too gentle, ideally suited for young children or those with sensitive gums.  The high-speed does provide a satisfactory cleanse while still maintaining that overall gentle sensation throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is standard with most powered toothbrushes these days, the Sensonic Pro will pulse every 30 seconds to remind you to switch to the next quadrant in your mouth.  Interestingly though, the brush itself will turn off after two minutes which may or may not be an annoyance to some.  Physically, the unit itself is quite handsome and in terms of design stands well on par with the high end Oral-B and Sonicare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its current price, the Sensonic Pro provides great value and is a terrific budget alternative to Oral-B and Sonicare while providing (for the most part) almost equal results in terms of cleaning your teeth.  This product also conveniently comes with 2 brush-heads, an inderdental cleaner as well as a wall mount insuring that you&#x27;re good to go for a few months before having to dip into the accessories market.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this waterpik product very much and am so very glad to have it for my daily use. I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to brush and massage you gums at the same time. I use it in tandem with my waterpik  and am having great results according to my dentist</li>
            <li> This is the third Waterpik electric toothbrush I have owned in the past 10 years.  They just keep getting better.  I love this one.  It does a great job of cleaning and in combination with the Waterpik Ultra Waterjet, my mouth feels very clean.  In combination and regular use my teeth and gums have shown noticeable improvement according to my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is comfortable to hold and on both speeds it is comfortable to use.  I can feel the higher speed as it has a noticeable difference, but it is not unpleasant.  The quad timer is useful and the unit looks great.  Compared to the older model I had, it is much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another one.  I tried an Oral B and did not feel my teeth were clean after using.  The Sonicare is just too expensive for the slimmer model.  Waterpik gets it right - great product for a great price.  The replacement brushes are inexpensive compared to the other two as well.  An added bonus.  I hope Waterpik keeps participating in this market segment despite the other 2 getting all the press.</li>
            <li> I think the Waterpik brand electric toothbrushes have the best design, but they are very hard to find. I&#x27;m glad Amazon had this for me because my old one stopped working after about 6 years.</li>
            <li> This is only my second electric toothbrush.  I am extremely pleased with it&#x27;s quality of performance and ease of usage.    I would purchase a Waterpik Sensonic Brush again!</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush for our daughter.  She loves it!  It really cleans her teeth and gets between the teeth well.  She said she notices the difference.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush on December 31, 2011 after years of owning, and loving, Sonicare brushes.  I&#x27;d read that this brush vibrated at a rate 25% faster than the Sonicare&#x27;s I&#x27;d used over the years and considering Water Pik is an established brand I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  Well, for a while it was a fine substitute for the Sonicare, being every bit as good as the products I&#x27;d owned from the competing brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little over 18 months I noticed the speed began to vary occasionally.  Over the course of just a few weeks it went from the odd speed dip to an outright failure to start save for a half-second \\&quot;blip\\&quot; of operation.  As of now I have to keep it on the charger constantly and I&#x27;m lucky to get a 2-minute cycle out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the many years Sonicare has been making their brushes, I&#x27;ve only owned 3 of them, but they&#x27;ve all lasted well over 5 years before needing to be replaced due to the batteries wearing out.  One brush even lasted me nearly 10 years, which I know is unusual, but this Sensonic dying in under 2 years is unforgivable considering the steep price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the old, reliable Sonicare brushes.  The Water Pik was fine while it lasted, but it cost me more than the Sonicare brushes I&#x27;d been using and proved to be far less durable.  Also, every Sonicare I&#x27;ve ever owned came with a travel case.  The Water Pik Sensonic did not, so there&#x27;s even more value from a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and with Water Pik in general.  I thought it was a brand I could trust, but I either got a faulty brush or they&#x27;re just not building these with quality components.  Either way, they&#x27;ve lost me and I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell anyone who is reading this just how much this has helped the health of my teeth and gums.  I am a healthy 23-year old, who has luckily gone through life with only one cavity.  That having been said, I have always had trouble with puffy, sensitive bleeding gums.  Flossing was nearly impossible, as it was excruciatingly painful and resulted in a bloody mouth. I had given up flossing from the bloody mess, and subsequently given up mouthwash because of how badly it burned.  My dental hygiene routine was pitiful at best.  Every dental visit I dreaded, knowing that they would admonish me for failing to form good oral hygiene routines, and I would always promise that I would do better.  Of course I never did.  Dental hygiene beyond a quick brushing seemed tedious, and I just didn&#x27;t have the patience to commit myself to it.  That is, until the day I noticed what looked like little &#x27;cuts&#x27; at the base of 2 of my teeth.  It was the beginning of my gums receding.  It scared me to find myself so young and already going through issues those much older than me were tackling.  That is when I resolved to make a change.    I had wanted the pricier, more well-known brand of electric sonic toothbrushes, but decided the smart thing to do (mainly because I am unemployed...) was fully research it online to find the best deal, whether or not that meant getting the big name brand.  The reviews for this toothbrush were great, and gave me a lot of hope that it would help me with my teeth and gums as much as it had helped others.  Well whaddya know?  It did!  I have had the toothbrush for about one month now, and the difference in my mouth is astonishing.  No more do my gums bleed, no more gum recession, and awesomely clean feeling teeth!  It is probably a combination of several things: it forces me to brush for 2 minutes, instead of my old 30 second crap job; I use Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s \\&quot;Complete Care\\&quot; toothpaste with it, which is just gritty enough that when combined with thesonic vibrations of the brush, does an amazing job at scrubbing my teeth sparkly clean; I use the massage head to give my gums a massage after brushing, to promote circulation and reduce swelling.   I cannot, of course, promise the same results for everyone that buys this toothbrush, but it has done wonders for me and my health!   Bottom Line: Wonderful toothbrush + Great Price &#x3D; One of my best purchases of 2009!</li>
            <li> It works great. My hygienist is impressed. But, and it&#x27;s a big one, the brush head gets bonded to the brush stem it sits on and cannot be changed after that. Buy the extended warranty if it is offered.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to so you don&#x27;t spray the mirror, but your mouth feels so much cleaner! My hygienist will be proud.</li>
            <li> I bought this two months ago to replace a Phillips Sonicare which just stopped taking a charge.  The Waterpik is MUCH better.  It has better features and feels good in your hand. I recommend it without qualification.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and its worth every penny. When i combine this with a whitening rinse my teeth brightens noticeably. I use the high setting and it leaves my mouth feeling great. Its the perfect size and feel without the bulky handle. It may be to big for kids but adult hands it&#x27;s great. Mine is dying but will repurchase this one again.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended the Waterpik over others because the brush is just a bit larger than the other popular brands. We &#x27;ve been using the Waterpiks for years with good results.</li>
            <li> I got this one because the other brand seems to have a design flaw: there&#x27;s a leak between the brush and the handle where toothpaste gets in.  Also, the replacement brushes are a little less expensive, so the long-term cost could be lower.  The two-speed feature allowed me to get used to the action without damaging the gum line.  I used the low speed for a week, but might not have needed to.  Gum sensitivity was not a problem at all.  Now I use the high speed all the time.  I like the timer feature; I think I brush longer now.  Battery life is over a week using it twice a day.  I try to remember to recharge on weekends.  There&#x27;s no battery life indicator telling when it needs to be recharged.  Charging takes most of a day before the indicator stops flashing.  So far I really like it.  We&#x27;ll see what the dentist thinks...</li>
            <li> lot faster than previous version</li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks now.  Feels like its doing all sorts of things that I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush do before.  I usually use the faster speed for my normal brushing.  I like how it has a built in timer so that I get all the areas the attention they need.  For someone who isnt the best brusher, I think this might save my teeth.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for almost two years, and its still going strong. No battery life issues, or anything else to complain about</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally get all mushy about personal hygiene products, but I&#x27;m going to gush about this toothbrush. I have very sensitive gums, stemming from years of horrible braces, retainers and other assorted unpleasant dental procedures so I was worried that a sonic toothbrush would be more hassle than it was worth. I was thrilled to discover that I have fewer problems with brushing now than I did before. My teeth look and feel cleaner and I feel more confident that I am doing a thorough job. The timed reminders help you make sure you are giving equal attention to each area of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some brands, this toothbrush comes with everything you need (except for toothpaste, lol) right out of the box. It even has 2 brush heads to get you started. I was pleased to not have to spend money right away on chargers or brush heads to try it out. It did take a long time to charge initially (the manual says to charge it 16 hours before using it), but after that, it seems to hold a charge well and doesn&#x27;t need recharging after every use. I like that I can mount the charger to the wall so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my kids knocking it into the sink.</li>
            <li> I keep going for the professional dental cleaning every 6 months because my dental insurance provider reccommends it.  Everytime I go to the dentist, I have to sit on the dental chair for over 30 mins and come back with a fresh clean feeling - but it also comes with bleeding gums.    Having suffered many tooth problems over the last couple of years (and $1000 of dollars in insurance copay) I have tried many different kinds of toothbrush, flosses - from the $10 Oral B and the painful process of flossing all the way to ultrasonic toothbrushes.    The Waterpik Sensonic is something which really stands out from the rest of them - I have the same fresh feeling like that I get from getting my teeth cleaned with a dentist - mainly because of the using both the toothbrush and the interdental cleaner.    Pros  + You get a deep cleaning feeling everytime after cleaning your tooth  + No damage to gum as long as you apply the right pressure while cleaning - it takes 3-4 days to get used to the brush.  + 2 people can use the same unit, but different brush heads with different colors  + Can easily last over 3 nights without a re-charge (maybe longer, but never tested it)    Cons  - Does not fully replace flossing for cleaning deep cavities - but not always required.  You may need to floss only when you have been chewing hard/fibrous stuff that gets stuck up in between your teeth  - The intensity of the high speed is very high, I rarely use this setting, but it really depends, some people may be comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of sonic brushes, and I like this one. IT leaves my teeth as clean as any of the others, and I like the small brush-head size. That makes it easier to reach the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush comes with two regular head and one pointy head for between-teeth cleaning. I love this head because I hate to floss. IT seems to do a great job getting between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush offers a 25% increase in bristle speed over other brushes. I assume that should help in cleaning your teeth. I do like the two power settings, which are missing from some high-end brushes. Most brushes come with a 2 minute timer and 30 second quadrant reminder, so nothing new here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a price point well below some other sonic brushes, this brush wins hands down for value.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one month. Before this, I used and loved the Sonicare.  Overall I prefer ultrasonic type toothbrushes over the electric models that scrub and rub and they are better than hand brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is very similar to the Sonicare. It is an electric toothbrush that vibrates at high frequencies. This model comes with a regular toothbrush head and a pointy shaped tool that can be used to clean the gum line or where the teeth meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush operates on two levels, a lower vibration and a higher vibration. I could not handle the faster vibrations as it made all my teeth rattle in my jaw in a scary way! (The Sonicare also has two levels.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush pauses after each 30 second time interval has passed. You are supposed to focus on one quadrant of your teeth then switch to the next when the 30 seconds is up, spending a total of two minutes on the entire mouth. (The Sonicare does the same thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik Sensonic did a good job and I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I prefer the Sonicare is the size. The Sonicare&#x27;s handle is more narrow/smaller around and is easier for my (female) hand to hold. The toothbrush shaft is thinner on the Sonicare and it therefore is easier to reach to my back teeth with less bulk. The toothbrush head on the Waterpik is wider, so wide that it scrubs at my gums, cleans my teeth and then hits &#x60;the air&#x27;. I think the width is too wide and I have to focus to try to not over scrub my gums. The Sonicare is just sized better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used an ultrasonic style toothbrush I highly recommend it. It does such a better job than hand brushing. You&#x27;ll never want to go back to hand brushing again because after each brushing,  the ultrasonic toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling as clean and polished just as it does after a professional teeth cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electronic brush before, so I can only compare it to manual brushing, something I&#x27;ll never do again.  The Waterpik does all the work for me and leaves my teeth and gums with that slick, firm feeling I associate with leaving the dentist&#x27;s office.  Programmed to stop after 30 seconds of brushing, the device also has a built in reminder of how long you should brush each quadrant of your mouth.   So, there&#x27;s really no excuse for not giving your teeth the attention they need.      The Waterpik comes operates on two vibration levels, low and high.  The high setting is a little too close to the dentist&#x27;s devices of torture (I have sensitive teeth), so I only use the low setting.  It seems to work just fine.  I can&#x27;t imagine any brushing on high, but I can only imagine that a person&#x27;s gums will become very tough and healthy if they can handle the top setting.      There may be a psychological benefit to using this product.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I focused more on brushing my teeth (and spent more time doing it) with the Waterpik than when I used to brush manually, but I don&#x27;t think that will simply be a \\&quot;trend\\&quot;.  The 30 second timer, the professional design and the financial investment will ensure that I&#x27;ll be more motivated to give my teeth their proper attention at each brushing.</li>
            <li> I think the Sensonic tooth brush is great.  It is fast and efficient.  It will allow people to clean their teeth without effort and yet very efficiently.  The cost is well within reason for such a wonderful instrument.    tj</li>
            <li> Was not sure I would like the Sonic, but it turns out that it was a good choice. I no longer beat up my gums with a manual and the vibrating versus the conventional electric is gum stimulating.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use.  Great for travel, especially short trips you don&#x27;t need to bring the charger.  Was in Barbardos for a week and it help up the whole time.  I like the product and I will purchase it all the time.</li>
            <li> After using this for at least a month, my teeth and gums are in much better condition.  At first I only used the low setting because it seemed to harsh on my gums.  Now that I&#x27;m used to it, I love the high.  My teeth are so smooth and I&#x27;d NEVER go back to a regular toothbrush.  My dentist noticed a big difference even.  This was the very model he suggested.  As far as other reviews go about keeping it clean, I think they are ridiculous.  After brushing I just pull off the brush part, rinse,  and put them in my drawer.  Since I only have to charge it every two weeks it stays in the cabinet.  There&#x27;s no reason to store it daily on the charger.  It&#x27;s not that stable plus it&#x27;s just a waste of counter top space.  If you pull of the top after brushing, rinse it off, and keep it somewhere separated where each piece can dry, there will never be a problem.  I&#x27;d absolutely buy this again and feel it&#x27;s well worth the money.  My dentist was very happy too.</li>
            <li> PROS: Excellent plaque removal after only 1-2 brushings.  I was using an older electric toothbrush before that left plaque behind. After using the Waterpik twice I noticed marked reduction in the plaque deposits.  The interdental brush is a very useful adjunct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two settings on the brush (low and high).  Even those that already use an electric toothbrush, the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting might be too vigorous, and takes a little while to get used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The only con to the product is the base.  While it does hold the toothbrush and 4 different toothbrush heads, it is light weight and easily topples over (minor gripe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/2013 - the charging base has developed significant cracks and is disintegrating. The toothbrush remains great but I cannot use the base anymore.  I will have to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over two years after my dentist recommended changing to an electric toothbrush. I did a lot of research and determined Water Pik was the best value for the money. Replacement heads are less expensive than other &amp;#34;sensonic&amp;#34; toothbrushes and it cleans my teeth really well. You will probably want to use the low speed to begin with until you are used to the motion. After a week or two I was using the high speed daily. I especially like the quadran timer...it keeps me on task!</li>
            <li> I got this on the advice of my dentist, who said I need to use a sonic brush.  I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare in the past, but didn&#x27;t like it.  I received it a couple weeks ago, and I must say I really like it.  I can tell it&#x27;s getting my teeth cleaner than a manual brush.  We&#x27;ll see whether it really has the next time I have a dental cleaning and check-up.</li>
            <li> In comparing to the Sonicare, it got more power and I feel cleaner. Anyway, its brush head is small for me. Its handle is quite a bit big and heavier than some of the Sonicare models. I&#x27;m not sure how long its brush head will last. The Sonicare is designed to last for 1-2 months and they are not cheap to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife after getting a good deal through our health insurance. This product did not live up to expectations. The brush worked fine out of the box and for about 1 year. The metal piece that hold the toothbrush head started to corrode and rust after about 1 year. It got to the point that it was difficult to remove the brush head. Once I removed the brush head I noticed the rust and had to sand it down in order to get a new brush head on. Shortly after the 2 year warranty expired, the brush stopped charging. We found a work around for that, but it eventually stopped vibrating all together. It&#x27;s clear that the metal piece was misaligned and no longer functioned properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned an older model Oral B toothbrush for 5 years and it is still going strong (the battery doesn&#x27;t hold as long of a charge, but still completes all the cleanings). I preferred the Oral B because I could get Generic replacement heads at 20% of the cost. This Waterpik has expensive replacement heads and I have to throw away 2 of them ($12 worth) because the toothbrush stopped working.</li>
            <li> I think these sonic brushes do a great job.  I like this one&#x27;s form.  You need to get used to turning in on in your mouth so it doesn&#x27;t fling toothpaste.  I wish there was a better way to manage the speeds (perhaps a separate button for each speed instead of a multi-press.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s actually the 2nd one we&#x27;ve purchased. This way my wife and I can brush at the same time and not have to race to get to the bathroom first.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST brush out there, I believe I have tried most if not all of the others, they do not compare.</li>
            <li> I guess I am one of those people who cannot use an electric toothbrush as much as I&#x27;d love to.  This item cause an excess amount of saliva production in my mouth.  Just could not use it and returned it. for full refund.</li>
            <li> Ill never go back to manual again! I had a hundred-dollar Sonicare electric toothbrush before this one, &amp; didn&#x27;t feel like I was downgrading at all. In fact, this brush came with 2 smaller, addition brush heads than my pricy Sonicare did, and the power of the brush is fabulous! I tried going on vacation once with one of those cheap, battery operated brushes &amp; was miserable. Please--especially if you&#x27;ve never experience this level of awesome toothbrush--BUY THIS BRUSH! :)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot to like and very little to dislike with regard to the waterpik sensonic. First, I&#x27;m not going to deal with cost, assuming two things:  first that anybody looking at these has already decided to spend more than the 1/49 for a toothbrush (or waiting for the free one at the dentist) and second, that they&#x27;ll price compare and decide what their range is.  The price is upfront on this so it&#x27;s up to you    Second, I&#x27;m not a dentist, nor do I play one on TV. I did do some independent research online and found several studies (non-industry) showing these type of brushes are more efficient at removing plaque and my dentist, who doesn&#x27;t sell them, agrees and recommends them.    So what is good about this particular one?  A common, but necessary attribute is the 2-minute timer, which pretty much ensures you&#x27;ll brush that long (c&#x27;mon--admit it--you don&#x27;t usually). I like the nice touch of the brief pause telling you 30 second has gone by and it&#x27;s time to move on. This also works wonders for my six-year-old who now brushes happily for the full length.    Two speeds: the fast is quite fast and leaves a great feeling in the mouth (fair warning--put it in your mouth and close your mouth before hitting the high speed if you want to avoid a mess).  There is no added sensitivity as far as I felt with the  high speed. The low speed is fine for the interdental brushing and my six-year-old    charger:  it takes 16 hrs for the first then charges almost immediately after that,   I just leave it plugged in now since we have the space, but it does hold a charge for about a week.  It does come with a wall mount, which would be nice if you have a small space to work with in your bathroom    Weight:  a nice heft to it without at all feeling heavy. My six-year-old handles it fine, but it doesn&#x27;t at all feel overly light or cheaply made. The width fits nicely into your hand--there is no awkwardness at all in manipulating the  brush.    Noise:  It&#x27;s noticeable from outside the bathroom but not at all loud or annoying.  It&#x27;s what I would call a pleasant, noticeable buzz    The holder, unlike the brush itself, does feel cheaply made and flimsy, and the brush heads don&#x27;t fit great on their holders.  If you have it off to the side it&#x27;s no big deal, but if it&#x27;s someplace that gets vibrated a lot or if you jostle it slightly, the brushes will fall off    In the box:  the charger,  brush, two brush heads (nice to use with family) and an in-between brush head (which my six-year-old also likes to use so the kid is now brushing happily for four  minutes--that alone is worth it!)</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product.  If you are tired of your old electric toothbrush and want something that&#x27;ll get the job done fast and easy, then look no further.  The Sensonic Waterpik is a remarkable product that&#x27;ll leave you and your mouth happy.  I have never felt my teeth and gums so clean (except after my twice a year cleaning and check-up from my dentist).  The Waterpik comes with two brush head, a pick head (for the gums) and a convienient charger stand that fits nicely on the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one thing that bothers me about about the brush.  It has a habit of stopping right in the middle of a teeth cleaning.  Sometimes if you&#x27;re not paying attention, you&#x27;ll forget what spped you have it on when it shuts off and you&#x27;ll accidentally turn it on fast.  The fast mode is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth. But if you enjoy electric toothbrushes and you want your money&#x27;s worth, I advise you to seriously think about picking up a Sensonic Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> $70 for a toothbrush?!  Holy molars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who&#x27;s always had perfect teeth (ahem), I guess I take things like toothbrushes and floss for granted.  After all, our ancestors were, to my understanding, once brushing their teeth with old pine cones.  What&#x27;s some bristles and little elbow grease when you&#x27;re talking about a set of healthy chompers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life is getting faster, and we are getting busier, and teeth are getting yellower (hey, Starbucks, how about getting to work on inventing Clear Coffee?).  There are days when I just don&#x27;t have the time to scrub my chompers, or when I do, but not long enough.  As the girl on the beach once said to her mom, \\&quot;Do you ever have those days when you just don&#x27;t feel fresh?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik is an excellent toothbrush, and if you use it, you&#x27;ll get that Straight From The Dentist feel (and you don&#x27;t even have to use that tantalizingly tasty grape dentifrice they always warn the kids not to swallow).  It&#x27;s slick and sassy and comes with three separate heads (replacement heads are $11 a pop).  I was bothered by how tiny the heads were; I have pretty big teeth, generally speaking, and I like have a nice fat set of bristles to work with.  These heads are barely bigger than a couple of pencil erasers, so my usual brushing style meant I kept banging the buzzing plastic back against my teeth.  If you don&#x27;t mind a tiny toothing area, then you won&#x27;t mind these fellas.  It also has two separate speeds (Pager Buzz and Weekend In Thailand), and although it might be a bit rough for those of you with mushy gums, there&#x27;s no doubting that it takes the guesswork out of brushing your teeth.  Not that there was much guesswork to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point being this: the toothbrush works, and works well.  If your regular brush just ain&#x27;t cutting it, and if your elbows are sore from all of the backbreaking pressure you apply to your dental work morning and night, then seventy dollars might be worth the price of admission.  I think the product is fantastic, but the price needs some serious work.fantastic, but the price needs some serious work.</li>
            <li> Like a massage for  your mouth, the Waterpik doth  buzz the plaque away.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush tickles at first, but has serious cleaning power, though it is supposed to take 2 minutes, with easily recognizable pauses every 30 seconds, reminding the user to switch to the next \\&quot;zone\\&quot; for brushing.  It takes a while to get used to letting the brush do the work, but my teeth feel thoroughly cleaned after each use, probably more than when I use a regular brush.  The packaging and instructions were user-friendly, and I have used the brush for several weeks without needing a second charge.  My only complaint is the time one is supposed to brush for...I feel guilty if I don&#x27;t wait for the brush to turn off after two minutes.</li>
            <li> it work great, its quite even if it close to u, it didnt wakeup the kids if the door was open. it even tell u when to changes sides. reasonable price too</li>
            <li> Product does an excellent job of cleaning teeth and massaging gums. Holds charge quite well and is very compact in terms of it&#x27;s footprint.</li>
            <li> This unit has two speed, both useful and without injury to gums. The 30 second alert is helpful to urge user to brush one quarter of teeth per 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  I&#x27;m a Dental Hygienist and I recommend this brush a lot.  The price is great for both the unit and the replacement heads.  A great brush at a great price</li>
            <li> this product costs less than most, but it has the features. it has the 30 second pauses to move the brush to another quandrant which is a nice feature. it takes up very little space. it compares favorably to the pricier models.</li>
            <li> I had to send back the first one because it did not work at all.  After waiting, I received another one (I think the same one rewrapped) it does not work well.  The heads come out to easily and it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li> If you have bleeding gums on low setting you have gingivitis. If they bleed a lot, you have severe gingivitis and should see a dentist. The bleeding will stop once the gingivitis clears up. This is the third one I have bought in 10 years. They last 4 to 5 years of daily use if you don&#x27;t remove the brush head after each brushing. If you remove the brush head and allow the chrome plated stem to dry, they will last even longer as the stem that does the vibrating will ultimately start to rust if you leave the brush head on all the time. My dental hygienist has always had much less work since I started using the WaterPik and my gums never bleed and I only brush using the high setting. I leave it in its holder and the battery has never been an issue and if I travel for 7 days or less, I only have to bring the brush as it will easily hold a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product at first, but shortly after purchase, the base began to crack. Water eventually seeped through the cracks and into the main panel, which began to short out and smoke. I had to unplug so this did not cause a fire, and therefore I can no longer charge or use the brush.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> First off - Sonic toothbrushes are great.  Dentist was pushing for me to switch in order to get better cleaning, less plaque buildup and reduce abrasion (I brushed too hard which is bad for tooth enamel).  Switch to the Sensonic Toothbrush took care of all three.  My family has been using these for 3 years now.  Cleaning results are terrific.  Durability has been mostly good.  Battery charge is good for several days to a week after being fully charged.  Toothbrush comes with 4 heads - 2 regular, 1 small and 1 interdental.  Although replacement heads are available for the regular heads [[ASIN:B00132H4P8 Waterpik 2SRB-2W Sensonic Replacement Toothbrushes]] and the interdental head [[ASIN:B00132H4Q2 Waterpik 2SIP-2W Sensonic Replacement Toothbrushes]], I have not been able to find replacement heads for the small head - although this might be it [[ASIN:B005ZE92DC Sensonic Compact Brush Heads (2)]] (UPDATE Nov. 2012 - compact heads are no longer available on Amazon so the link is dead.  Link may reactivate if compact heads are offered again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had 2 toothbrushes in the house for the last 3 to 4 years.  There are no serviceable parts on these brushes.  Both toothbrushes failed around the 3 to 3.5 year mark due to corrosion (chrome-like coating flaking off) on the shaft to attach the toothbrush head.  Once the corrosion sets in, it is next to impossible to change toothbrush heads.  Also, one of the chargers failed after 2 years but we managed to use one charger for both brushes which worked fine since battery life has not been an issue.  Due to the corrosion issue, I have had to replace both sonic toothbrushes this year but I stayed with the Waterpiks since 3+ year product life seemed a reasonable, although not ideal, product life expectancy and it has done a great job of meeting the dental cleaning needs for me and my family.</li>
            <li> After years of perfecting my manual toothbrushing circular motion technique, I was reluctant to try an electric toothbrush. I had heard it was better, but I was skeptical. When I finally decided to try one, it wasn&#x27;t a positive experience.  The Waterpik SR-1000 requires an excessive 16 hour recharge time. This means I still need to rely on a manual toothbrush when it is charging. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to rely on two toothbrushes. If I could put it back on the base between brushing that would be great. However, I&#x27;ve read that it uses a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery, which means that memory issues occur if it is removed from power before the charge is complete. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for me to knowingly shorten the battery&#x27;s life.  I find the manual to be very ambiguous because it doesn&#x27;t say anything specific on usage. It doesn&#x27;t recommended a charging behavior, except that the first charge must be 16 hours. What about subsequent charges? (I don&#x27;t know.) It doesn&#x27;t mention a brushing technique, except that you should pass over your teeth. (I have to do that to clean them! What a shocker!) It describes the 2 bristles speeds as follows: Use speed 1 for gentle cleaning; Use speed 2 for superior plaque removal. Which one is the normal speed? The manual should be a good reference to people who are new to electric toothbrushes or the brand, not just multilingual eye-candy. (It does look nice.)  The stand/base/charger feels very cheap. It only grips on the front, so light pulling of the power cord will slide it out of position. The toothbrush and toothbrush heads fit loosely on the stand, which looks cheap when they wobble around.  The button to turn it on is too sensitive. It seems to activate before I feel like I&#x27;ve pressed it. I&#x27;ve even pressed it accidentally by what seemed like just a touch.  According to the manual, the 2 minute brushing time doesn&#x27;t consider brushing the crowns of the teeth. After the 2 minutes runtime on Speed 1, the toothbrush stops. Since I still have the crowns to brush, I press the button to turn the toothbrush on again. However, the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t return to Speed 1, it goes to Speed 2. This bad design makes the toothbrush less predictable, because the toothbrush can start into 2 modes from the Off mode without user indication. When the toothbrush stops, it should go to state 0, where it should always proceed to state 1 at the press of the button.  After dealing with all these issues for half a month, I encountered plaque on my teeth. That broke the camel&#x27;s back. I thought electric toothbrushes were supposed to make life more simple, my experience did not show that to be the case.  Update 4-08-2017: I&#x27;ve had better results with the Oral-B Pro 1000. I prefer it to manual tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this to replace an identical model that died after about 4-5 years. It&#x27;s a simple straight-forward design that works and fits in my mouth. Although there are two features I don&#x27;t like much (hence 4 instead of 5 stars), overall it does a great job and I decided I can live with the annoyances when I bought the same model. Because I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I am ok having fewer office cleanings. On performance alone, I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great unless water happens to get into the mechanism that holds the brush onto the body.  The seal is not very tight, so this can easily happen.  If not caught early, the replacement brush head can get stuck and the toothbrush is ruined.  It has happened a second time to me and I won&#x27;t be buying this toothbrush again for this same reason.  Once my replacement heads are used up, and hopefully the toothbrush lasts another year, I will be getting a different toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve wasted $60 on a second toothbrush for this same problem.</li>
            <li> This does not clean between my teeth very well.  I&#x27;m keeping it because I do like to use the small interdental after I floss, but if it was the toothbrush alone I would return it.  I had a Sonicare for several years and it finally quit, thought I&#x27;d try this because it was cheaper and had good reviews.  I&#x27;ll use it, but would not purchase a second.</li>
            <li> like the 30 second pause. think the second speed is a little strong but figure it is working. Have to try hard not to have toothbrush hit my teeth, just the brushed.</li>
