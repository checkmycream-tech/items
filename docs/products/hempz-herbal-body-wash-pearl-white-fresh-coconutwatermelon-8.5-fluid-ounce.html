            <li>I can kind of smell watermelon (although it is an artificial watermelon scent if that makes sense) and I can kind of smell coconut (although not really.)</li>

            <li>It is a weird mix, and is kind of a little too sweet.</li>

            <li> This is okay.  I thought based on the reviews this stuff would smell amazing.  It stinks.  I mean it&#x27;s soap...what can I say, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like watermelon or coconut.  I&#x27;m not sure what genius was thinking they would be great mixed together, but I actually stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t stand the scent.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because we use the shampoo &amp; condition or which is so good. But the smell NASTY</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. Not only does it smell wonderful but it leaves your skin feeling good..</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Smells great, arrived as described</li>
            <li> it does have a different smell then i imagined</li>
            <li> Did not prefer the smell</li>
            <li> Love this body wash, especially when used in conjunction with the Hempz Coconut and Watermelon body lotion. Will definitely reorder.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin, makes a nice lather and leaves me feeling fresh and clean and the fragrance is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash. It makes your skin feel so soft &amp; smooth. It is great. The price is reasonable also. You can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Felt it smelled more like a white melon, than watermelon... I returned product.</li>
            <li> I Love the Smell, the feel, this is a great product, Thanks, seems to calm my skin. I am glad that I found this.</li>
            <li> I really like the Hempz brand and bought this on a whim online. I had never used their shower gel before this product, but I thought the coconut/watermelon scent would smell heavenly and had to try it! Overall I like it. It lathers well, and I have no complaints about the consistency of the product at all. It just didn&#x27;t smell as good as I imagined it would. I can kind of smell watermelon (although it is an artificial watermelon scent if that makes sense) and I can kind of smell coconut (although not really.) It is a weird mix, and is kind of a little too sweet. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just smells alright. And for the price of this product, I think I will definitely make sure I go to a store and smell the other scents first before I purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used other Hempz scents and as much as I like the way this body wash feels, I did not care for the scent. I didn&#x27;t think it smelled particulary like coconut or watermelon. This was the only reason I gave this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. Natural. Leaves my skin soft and feeling great. Their lotion is also fantastic. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff because it&#x27;s organic.but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut or watermelon . The price could be better.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Smell is not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I feel like it has less weird chemicals in it too.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful! Also have the body lotion. It keeps my skin from drying out and I smell fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Wow. This smells so good! I bought another onefor backup! And one for my daughter! I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash. I go through a couple of them every summer. leaves my skin soft and smells  wonderful.</li>
            <li> Beyond fabulous. Smells and feels great...!  Skin super soft&lt;br /&gt;☆☆☆☆☆ STARS</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  It is light but creamy.  The smell is divine!  I would certainly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> for some reason this does not work with my chemistry; got with the lotion and gave away after first use,  I love Hempz in the other flavors, though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works as advertised</li>
