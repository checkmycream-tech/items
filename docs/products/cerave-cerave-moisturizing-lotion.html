            <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion I use now. Great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past several years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  I like it better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  I got some as gifts for my sisters and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my daughter&#x27;s skin. She has eczema.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema but I do have dry and irritable skin. I works great on face and sensitive body areas.&lt;br /&gt;Like after exfoliating a little too much or after shaving. Its great for preventing razor bumps too.&lt;br /&gt;I got my boyfriend to use it too and now he keeps up with it every single day.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!!! Nice to be able to buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Cerave is great for my dry skin.  It is silky and doesn&#x27;t make the skin sticky.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Our dermatologist told us about it.</li>
            <li> The finest moisturizing lotion I have found.  I have an extremely dry skin problem with my lower legs and this lotion has really solved the problem.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and it works very well on my dry skin. It&#x27;s very light and just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I can use because all the others have  the preservative thimerasol in them, which I am allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;The price remains steep.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this to me several years ago.  Living in the Southwest is hard on your skin.  This has proven to be my only all-purpose moisturizer: after sun, shower, shave, hand washing, and for repair of dry skin.  Good stuff.  Worth the extra $ over the familiar brands because it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years after my dermatologist recommended it to me &amp; my skin has not been dry since or left greasy feeling when I put it on. And the super fast delivery with a great price doesn&#x27;t hurt either :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few years now and love it.  I have extremely dry skin and have loved this product.  however in the coldest parts of winter I use the CeraVe creme after a shower instead of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Used before. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> The Best lotion for me and my skin</li>
            <li> Love this lotion because my skin is so sensitive ! I bought the three pack bundle! I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> I have had a flare up of dermatitis and was using another lotion.  I started using this lotion and it helped my out break with in 6 hours.  I stronly recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin or issues with dermatitis.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff as far as lotion is concerned. Helps with healing and protecting my winter skin without any greasyness or overpowering fragrance. I liked it enough when I tried my Sister&#x27;s that I immediately bought myself enough to keep some at home and some at the office. And if that doesn&#x27;t carry me through to the end of the season, I&#x27;ll buy more after that. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> ...who needs to leave home anymore?...work from home and we love our home...do not like to venture out to go buy little bits or large bits...Amazon is making life a lot easier...even our UPS drive is a Amazon Prime member...ha!...</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as advertised and promptly.</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon after it had been recommended by my doctor for dry skin. Living in the southwest leads causes dry skin and all help is welcome so this lotion is a welcome find. It is light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I live by this lotion, it is truly the best out there for any skin type and for any need.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion to me as one that is good for adding moisture and keeping it in the skin. I have some sort of genetic issue with dryness and getting these brown spots on my legs. Though not the normal brown spots that people get as they age, these are little brown spots that are drier than normal skin and feel sort of like plastic or like a spot of crazy glue was dropped onto my skin. Very icky. So I use this every day now.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I&#x27;ve been using for over a year now.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Was completely taken back as a couple of months ago the TODAY show had this brand as a top recommended lotion/series.  I was very pleased with my dermatologist.  Hard to find in stores so just get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> As with all Cerave products, I found that this moisturizing lotion makes my skin feel wonderful, silky and smooth. Nice.</li>
            <li> This lotion does hydrate your skin! After applying the lotion, your skin will feel smooth and look younger. I use it daily to keep my skin looking good.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face/body.  This is an inexpensive face/body lotion.</li>
            <li> Great skin lotion. Goes on smoothly and moisturizes well. Nice scent, very neutral</li>
            <li> Cerave is by far the best product on the market for those of us with truly dry skin.  This entire line had dermatologic expertise in its development, and it shows.  This particular lotion absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy, sticky residue, and re-hydrates dry skin extremely well.  A small amount goes a long way.  My only gripe is the cost, but this is a case where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and loving it. Fast delivery. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and my Dermatologist recommended this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for four months now and found it is the only product that helps relieve the itch.</li>
            <li> Having used this product a few years and paying a high price at local retailers I found purchasing the 3 pack from Amazon was like getting one FREE!!!</li>
            <li> The best lotion around.  I have tried many for my extremely dry skin.  This soaks in quickly, lasts for the day and never &amp;#34;crumbles&amp;#34; ot gets on my clothes.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great buy! My Dermatologist highly recommends this. Now I know why, Its amazing. I am a women over 50 and it is nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry skin. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lotion that goes on smooth and clean.  Does not have an oily feeling unlike some of the other lotions out there.  Has a slight &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; smell to it; however, it is not as strong as some lotions that contain perfumes.  The smell does not linger after it is washed off.</li>
            <li> Reccomended by dermatologist for dry skin. Works great and is not greasy!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and received very quickly. No issues would recommend this firm for future customers.</li>
