            <li>I was so happy to find a xylitol gum for my children any myself.</li>
            <li>It blows great bubbles and holds it&#x27;s flavor.  </li>
            <li>It makes great bubbles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for kids, and adults - nice to know it&#x27;s not rotting anyone&#x27;s teeth!  </li>
            <li>The taste is amazing!</li>

            <li>Taste good.</li>
            <li>This is the best sugar free bubble gum I have ever tasted.  </li>
            <li>This gum is so good.  </li>
            <li>Fun, delicious, and healthful!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li>What mother doesn&#x27;t love that!</li>
            <li>But this one blows great bubbles too (though you really need to have two pieces to blow good bubbles)!</li>
            <li>The pieces are nice and fat</li>
            <li>Honestly, this gum lasts me for 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li>okay, not as good as Spry&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>More important is its healthy and is good for thier teeth!</li>
            <li>This is the greatest all natural gum!</li>
            <li>Would be better if the flavor lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a better vegan gum out there.</li>
            <li>Love the bubblegum flavor ...</li>
            <li>I did a lot of searching for gum that is made with a healthy alternative to sugar.</li>
            <li>This gum is great for balancing the ph in your mouth and xylitol has been shown to be good for your teeth, but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I really love this gum.</li>
            <li>Fifty pieces is much better, but even with that, I order a couple of bottles at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A winner! :)</li>
            <li>My search for the perfect all natural, GMO free gum continues.</li>
            <li>Just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li>so what more do you want ( free would be nice )</li>
            <li>However I LOVE cinnamon in this brand.</li>
            <li>Gotta love it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a lot better...</li>
            <li>Crunchy, with ok flavor.  </li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>Makes pretty good bubbles though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing and so tasty and so full of vitamins!</li>
            <li>My son is really picky, and doesn&#x27;t like stuff that is \\&quot;good for you\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The bubble gum flavor reminds me strongly of Wrigley&#x27;s Juicy Fruit, and is created with all-natural fruit oils.</li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s healthy, but it is delicious.  </li>
            <li>I just timed it again to be accurate.  </li>
            <li>We go through it fast so the big size is perfect.</li>
            <li>They get so excited when it arrives.</li>
            <li>Super friendly company.</li>
            <li>so you only need 2 pieces for a good chew.  </li>
            <li>This is the best, actually the only sugar free bubble gum that is aspartame-free I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Its not too sweet.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a treat to chew, but it&#x27;s also good for you.</li>
            <li>I am not chewing as much as I used to, but still love it.</li>
            <li>Flavor is good, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Alot of the gums with nutrasweet last 3x longer although they are not that good for you.</li>
            <li>Maybe that is an adequate trade-off for having something that claims to be Vegan, non-GMO, 100% xylitol, or whatever, but I&#x27;m sticking with some Wrigley&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And no artificial flavors.</li>
            <li>Worth checking into</li>
            <li>I order this bubble gum for my young grandchildren and they love it.</li>
            <li>The pieces are pretty huge though, so even for half a piece, you still get a good amount.</li>
            <li>We chew this gum to cut down on cavities but it taste super good.</li>
            <li>Looses flavor pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Nothing that I&#x27;d found made with xylitol was any kind of decent replacement (looking at you, Spry and Epic).  </li>
            <li>It tastes really good, and has that soft, yummy, traditional bubble gum feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>This is the only sugar free, and also aspertame free gum I can find.  </li>
            <li>My son loves this gum...uses it in school for those times he needs to really concentrate!</li>
            <li>...two minutes and 10 seconds to be exact.</li>
            <li>cause I really like bubble gum flavor!</li>
            <li>The first burst of flavor is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>it makes amazing slightly pink bubbles!....</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have other flavors that are good such as [[ASIN:B000RL4UNA B-Fresh Inc - Cool Spearmint Gum (Bottle), 100 gum]], but I prefer the bubble gum.</li>
            <li>Do you know how hard it is to find soy free, artificial sweetener free, sugar free, cohesive, delicious, pliable gum???</li>
            <li>I like the large bottle.</li>
            <li>gum &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Meaning gum becomes hard to chew fairly</li>
            <li>But he really loves this bubble gum.</li>
            <li>The bubbles are real, too.</li>
            <li>but this really keeps its strength.</li>
            <li>gum is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I need my chewing gum, and I really like this bubble gum flavor from bfresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK now; it is on par with all the other xylitol gums.</li>
            <li>The company said they they were having a problem with the &amp;#34;flavor house&amp;#34; and that they would send me new jar when it was corrected, which they did!</li>
            <li>My kids live it!</li>
            <li>It also has the added benefit of being sweetened with Xyletol which is nothing less than miraculously healthy for your mouth and teeth (and body).</li>
            <li>the sugar sweetened gums, Dentyne contained High Frutose Corn Syrup, Bazooka Class contained Corn Syrup, and Beemans contained Glucose Syrup.</li>
            <li>and though it does not last as long as the Bazooka, it&#x27;s does ok.</li>
            <li>The flavor is refreshing, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Nice big chunky tablets - one for a simple chew, two for extra flavor and giganto bubbles.</li>
            <li>Taste great but loses flavor and gets hard quickly.</li>
            <li>Blows a solid bubble, but the flavor fades so fast!  </li>
            <li>The flavor lasts a good amount of time, you can blow bubbles, none of the bad stuff in the ingredients and it helps keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>B-Fresh is (so far)</li>
            <li>I also bought a number of Xylitol based gums, including Epic Spearment, Xyloburst Spearment, Spry Fruit Flavored, and B-Fresh Bubble</li>
            <li>B-Fresh is such a classic fruity, and almost intoxicating flavor...</li>
            <li>I was originally introduced to this product when a friend picked a pack up for me that only had 8 pieces, which just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>

            <li> yummy &amp; long lasting taste gum</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long, either in flavor or &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Firm but not hard texture.</li>
            <li> Soft at first and then gets a little hard after chewing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white with a tiny pink</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because I want to avoid sugar AND artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> But the flavor doesn&#x27;t las long and it costs a fortune.</li>
            <li> I recently experimented and purchased a number of chewing gums that don&#x27;t have artificial sweeteners, including Dentyne Classic, Bazooka Classic Bubble Gum, and Beemans.</li>
            <li> Most gums contain a gum base that is all but natural.  </li>
            <li> This jar seems to be worse for the gum getting hard and losing flavor VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve noticed that the gum isn&#x27;t pink anymore.</li>
            <li> Well, this and the other ones sold in Vitamin Shoppe.  </li>
            <li> something not right had this gum before</li>
            <li> You might be confused looking at the gyrating 1-5 star reviews; the straight story is simple: If you&#x27;re used to commercially available gums,  naturally sweetened or artificial, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Often health food gum us pretty pathetic when it comes to the fun stuff, like blowing bubbles,</li>
            <li> It covers up the slight xylitol flavor well.</li>
            <li> Ever, I cut the pieces in half and dole them out to my kids that way.</li>
            <li> We continue to buy it as it is one of the few gums that does not contain soy.</li>
            <li> buy this, it&#x27;s far too expensive for 2 minutes of flavor.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say really.</li>
            <li> Also, added vitamins are usually synthetic.  </li>
            <li> Stopped chewing Trident, and voila -- no more headaches.  </li>
            <li> No gum gives you long-lasting flavor unless it&#x27;s loaded with artificial and chemical additives so ignore the reviews focusing specifically on &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34;  If you are, however, looking for a natural product with Xylitol</li>
            <li> /&gt;B-Fresh gum is usually about Chiclet size, but this bubble gum flavor is twice the size.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the flavor is not nearly what it used to be.</li>
            <li> Not too hard though.</li>
            <li> Had  no flavor and was hard to chew.  </li>
            <li> I chew one piece till the flavors is gone, add another one and then blow bubbles for at least a hour before I have to start over.</li>
            <li> I guess they decided rather than up the price, they would make a shoddy product.</li>
            <li> This is the only gum that I let my daughter chew because it is sweetened with xylitol and does not contain any artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> Not sure why gum has to be this expensive.</li>
            <li> but alas, after 130 seconds, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m chewing a rubber band.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good flavor and bubblegum texture. Would be better if the flavor lasted longer. And vitamins too!</li>
            <li> This gum tastes GREAT!  I has a wonderful texture and does not promote tooth decay.  What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> The texture is great. The pieces are nice and fat so you only need 2 pieces for a good chew.  The taste is amazing! Blows a solid bubble, but the flavor fades so fast!  It&#x27;s all-natural so what else can you expect? All things considered, it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> B-Fresh is (so far) the best all-natural sugar-free gum I&#x27;ve found. The bubble gum flavor reminds me strongly of Wrigley&#x27;s Juicy Fruit, and is created with all-natural fruit oils. It covers up the slight xylitol flavor well. The bubble gum variety of B-Fresh is noticeably softer than their other varieties; it might not be quite as soft as artificial bubble gums, but for an all natural gum it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to blow bubbles with. Fun, delicious, and healthful!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because I want to avoid sugar AND artificial sweeteners. But the flavor doesn&#x27;t las long and it costs a fortune. Not sure why gum has to be this expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this gum in the foil packs.  This jar seems to be worse for the gum getting hard and losing flavor VERY quickly.  Wish there was a better vegan gum out there. The flavor is great, but it goes away in about a minute.</li>
            <li> I recently experimented and purchased a number of chewing gums that don&#x27;t have artificial sweeteners, including Dentyne Classic, Bazooka Classic Bubble Gum, and Beemans. I also bought a number of Xylitol based gums, including Epic Spearment, Xyloburst Spearment, Spry Fruit Flavored, and B-Fresh Bubble Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the sugar sweetened gums, Dentyne contained High Frutose Corn Syrup, Bazooka Class contained Corn Syrup, and Beemans contained Glucose Syrup. The Dentyne also contained cottenseed oil...and I haven&#x27;t figured that one out. But all 3 contained BHT...up to 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The B-Fresh is such a classic fruity, and almost intoxicating flavor...and though it does not last as long as the Bazooka, it&#x27;s does ok. No residual bitterness. And it&#x27;s great for blowing bubbles. Firm but not hard texture. Great stuff. And no artificial flavors.</li>
            <li> This is the only Xyletol Bubble Gum I have found. Its delicious and makes great bubbles. It also has the added benefit of being sweetened with Xyletol which is nothing less than miraculously healthy for your mouth and teeth (and body). It will alkalizes your mouth... which is necessary for healing, as opposed to sugar which is acidic and rots your teeth and damages your body. If you want to know its effect on the teeth read \\&quot;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye!\\&quot; written by a dentist who says this stuff has been shown to not only NOT cause damage but actually repair teeth. Worth checking into and you can buy Xyletol on Amazon.  Tastes virtually the same as sugar by the way. No funky taste like some of the \\&quot;fake\\&quot; sweeteners. This stuff is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Rector&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;A Painful Truth - The Entrapment of America&#x27;s Sick\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;(How Being Ill Got Me Arrested)</li>
            <li> This is a great gum for kids! They can blow bubbles and it tastes great. More important is its healthy and is good for thier teeth! What mother doesn&#x27;t love that!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this gum lasts me for 8 minutes.  I just timed it again to be accurate.  The gum base hardens and the flavor evaporates.  Maybe that is an adequate trade-off for having something that claims to be Vegan, non-GMO, 100% xylitol, or whatever, but I&#x27;m sticking with some Wrigley&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Taste good. Looses flavor pretty quick.</li>
            <li> We chew this gum to cut down on cavities but it taste super good. Love the bubblegum flavor ...yummy...it rocks!</li>
            <li> Delicious and the healthiest gum that I could find. I did a lot of searching for gum that is made with a healthy alternative to sugar. This sweetner is made from trees in the USA not China.</li>
            <li> This gum is great for balancing the ph in your mouth and xylitol has been shown to be good for your teeth, but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last.  We continue to buy it as it is one of the few gums that does not contain soy.</li>
            <li> I really love this gum. Being that it is the Most Expensive Gum Ever, I cut the pieces in half and dole them out to my kids that way. The pieces are pretty huge though, so even for half a piece, you still get a good amount. The flavor is excellent, and my kids love that they can blow bubbles with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best, actually the only sugar free bubble gum that is aspartame-free I&#x27;ve found. It tastes really good, and has that soft, yummy, traditional bubble gum feeling in your mouth. My son is really picky, and doesn&#x27;t like stuff that is \\&quot;good for you\\&quot;. But he really loves this bubble gum. I like the large bottle. I was originally introduced to this product when a friend picked a pack up for me that only had 8 pieces, which just doesn&#x27;t last long. Fifty pieces is much better, but even with that, I order a couple of bottles at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have other flavors that are good such as [[ASIN:B000RL4UNA B-Fresh Inc - Cool Spearmint Gum (Bottle), 100 gum]], but I prefer the bubble gum.</li>
            <li> My son loves this gum...uses it in school for those times he needs to really concentrate! A winner! :)</li>
            <li> A great product.  The gum contains xylitol, calcium and B12.  Great to give to kids as an after meal treatment.</li>
            <li> I decided not to buy this gum, so my review is not based on flavor, but on the ingredients and customer service.  \\&quot;Gum base\\&quot; is listed as one of their ingredients and I was wondering what is used in their gum base.  Most gums contain a gum base that is all but natural.  I e-mailed customer service to try and find out and got not response.  Also, added vitamins are usually synthetic.  My search for the perfect all natural, GMO free gum continues.</li>
            <li> This is the only sugar free, and also aspertame free gum I can find.  Well, this and the other ones sold in Vitamin Shoppe.  But this one blows great bubbles too (though you really need to have two pieces to blow good bubbles)!</li>
            <li> This is the best bubble gum. It keeps me from snacking on sugary treats during the day. I chew one piece till the flavors is gone, add another one and then blow bubbles for at least a hour before I have to start over. This has been my gum of choice for a year now. Just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li> ...two minutes and 10 seconds to be exact. I timed it. I always chew two pieces at a time. The moment I put the pieces in my mouth and start chewing, my taste buds are bursting with that great bubble gum flavor...but alas, after 130 seconds, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m chewing a rubber band. The flavor doesn&#x27;t even leave gradually, it&#x27;s as sudden as a car wreck. Makes pretty good bubbles though.</li>
            <li> yummy &amp; long lasting taste gum</li>
            <li> Its not too sweet. Soft at first and then gets a little hard after chewing. Not too hard though. Neutral flavor. Nothing bad to say really.</li>
            <li> Luv luv luv , I wanted to get away from fake sweaters plus its got B in it plus good for teeth plus made in USA plus the taste great plus you can blow a good size bubble  so what more do you want ( free would be nice ) so until that day you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I order this bubble gum for my young grandchildren and they love it. They get so excited when it arrives.</li>
            <li> okay, not as good as Spry&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was suffering from horrible morning sickness and wanted to chew gum without terrible chemicals. This was terrible. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Grandkids aren&#x27;t impressed with the flavor. I don&#x27;t do bubblegum anything.</li>
            <li> The best gum out there that is wholesome!  Nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> Taste good. Too expensive to reorder.</li>
            <li> something not right had this gum before and it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> I did not like this gum at all.  Had  no flavor and was hard to chew.  However I LOVE cinnamon in this brand.</li>
            <li> Years ago I realized the cause of my debilitating headaches was artificial sweetener (thank you, neurologist, for never inquiring about this).  Stopped chewing Trident, and voila -- no more headaches.  This was after MRIs, CT Scans, etc.  Shame on the FDA.  However, I simply adore bubble gum.  Nothing that I&#x27;d found made with xylitol was any kind of decent replacement (looking at you, Spry and Epic).  Until this product.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.  Flavor lasts, blows bubbles, delish all around.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This gum used to be the best. I was so happy to find a xylitol gum for my children any myself. But they changed the flavor. The company said they they were having a problem with the &amp;#34;flavor house&amp;#34; and that they would send me new jar when it was corrected, which they did! Super friendly company. Sadly, the flavor is not nearly what it used to be. It&#x27;s OK now; it is on par with all the other xylitol gums. I wish they would make it what it used to be.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest all natural gum! No food coloring or BHT! And it&#x27;s bubble gum too! My kids live it!</li>
            <li> This gum is great! It&#x27;s so refreshing and so tasty and so full of vitamins! Not only is it a treat to chew, but it&#x27;s also good for you. The bubbles are real, too. Often health food gum us pretty pathetic when it comes to the fun stuff, like blowing bubbles, but this really keeps its strength. Also, takes away hunger pains if you are in between meals.</li>
            <li> Yummy!  not sure if it&#x27;s healthy, but it is delicious.  I am not chewing as much as I used to, but still love it.</li>
            <li> Flavor is good, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chewed this gum for years.&lt;br /&gt;Usually the flavor lasts about 15-30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve noticed that the gum isn&#x27;t pink anymore. It&#x27;s white with a tiny pink tinge.&lt;br /&gt;And the flavor is GONE. I guess they decided rather than up the price, they would make a shoddy product. The flavor lasts about 2 minutes, then it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;Spry gum is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s far too expensive for 2 minutes of flavor.</li>
            <li> Sorry. I hate this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It is more expensive than commercial brands.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Size of each piece is 2 to 3x larger than commercial brands.&lt;br /&gt;(3) It may contain vitamin B and xylitol, they may be organic, etc. but boy! the flavor lasts 3 seconds and the off flavors show after 1 minute of senseless chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing: it makes amazing slightly pink bubbles!....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I recommend for lasting flavor (up to 2 minutes) and similar bubbling capacity is Trident bubble gum:&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B000KOSXI2 Trident Bubblegum 18 Stick Packs Pack]]</li>
            <li> I need my chewing gum, and I really like this bubble gum flavor from bfresh. The flavor lasts a good amount of time, you can blow bubbles, none of the bad stuff in the ingredients and it helps keep your teeth clean. Gotta love it.</li>
            <li> Yuck. Not the best tasting gum.</li>
            <li> Taste great but loses flavor and gets hard quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best sugar free bubble gum I have ever tasted.  The flavor is refreshing, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> You might be confused looking at the gyrating 1-5 star reviews; the straight story is simple: If you&#x27;re used to commercially available gums,  naturally sweetened or artificial, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  No gum gives you long-lasting flavor unless it&#x27;s loaded with artificial and chemical additives so ignore the reviews focusing specifically on &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34;  If you are, however, looking for a natural product with Xylitol this is the one to try.  Supremely tasty and superb for bubble blowing.  Nice big chunky tablets - one for a simple chew, two for extra flavor and giganto bubbles.</li>
            <li> Sweetness and taste doesn&#x27;t last on the bubble gum flavor, but the mint and cinnamon, it&#x27;s a lot better...</li>
            <li> Crunchy, with ok flavor.  Doesn&#x27;t last long, either in flavor or &amp;#34; gum &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Meaning gum becomes hard to chew fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give some hydration to the mouth.  I was bummed cause I really like bubble gum flavor!</li>
            <li> This gum is so good.  It blows great bubbles and holds it&#x27;s flavor.  It also contains calcium.  AND it&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li> The first burst of flavor is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  It almost makes me gag the longer I&#x27;m chewing.  I would say it provides five minutes of chewing, if that.  Alot of the gums with nutrasweet last 3x longer although they are not that good for you. Still I think some improvements could be made somehow.</li>
            <li> Great for kids, and adults - nice to know it&#x27;s not rotting anyone&#x27;s teeth!  We go through it fast so the big size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Do you know how hard it is to find soy free, artificial sweetener free, sugar free, cohesive, delicious, pliable gum??? Almost impossible. This stuff is magic. It makes great bubbles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B-Fresh gum is usually about Chiclet size, but this bubble gum flavor is twice the size. That&#x27;s why only 50 come in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only gum that I let my daughter chew because it is sweetened with xylitol and does not contain any artificial sweeteners.</li>
