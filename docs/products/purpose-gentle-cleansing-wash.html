            <li>Then you get home and try on the new sweaters but none feel as good as that old one.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and even removes mascara with ease.</li>

            <li> This is the best face wash for my S/O&#x27;s sensitive skin and my teens fussy skin as well. I don&#x27;t have to use it more than once a week (I&#x27;m lucky in that department) but they need to use it pretty much daily.

            <li> Have been using this product for a few years consecutively. Absolutely love it! I have combination skin more on the dry side. I am a licensed cosmetologist and have tried several expensive products that our salon supported like Murad. Murad is an amazing product and I still enjoy using their peels. I still use the Murad peels but I&#x27;m so pleased with Purpose face wash that I skimp on Murads wash and use Purposes&#x27;. This is by far a simple yet superior product and I will happily vouch for them.</li>
            <li> Leaves hands and face very soft.  Non-drying.</li>
            <li> Good quality cleanser for sensitive skin.  Not much us needed for each wash.  Lasts a long time.  Hard to find in stores around here.</li>
            <li> Gentle, didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  Perfect for morning, I use glycolic acid wash for the night.  Even used it on my toddler when I was in a crunch.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely simple - it cleans your face. No lasting scent, no clogged pores, no scrubbing beads, no residue, no foaming action, no tingling sensation, and no reason not to use it. I&#x27;m male and still deal with occasional pimples in my thirties, but for years this has been the best solution for keeping my face clean and healthy. A year ago I started putting a couple squirts of Purpose on an electric face brush and that has cut the number of breakouts I have in half. It creates a very light lather and rinses away clean. Also great for other general purpose cleaning, like say, cleaning your nails with a brush. A bottle this size lasts months using a couple of squirts a day. Supplement your routine with an exfoliating cleanser if necessary, but for everyday use this is great choice for your skin and your wallet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facewash for more than 20 years as it was recommended to me by my dermatologist when I was a teenager. I have never had any problems with it (tingling, stinging, etc).</li>
            <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
            <li> Words don&#x27;t do this product justice. You have to try it to appreciate this gentle but effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purpose for about 8 years now. It is my constant in a ever changing world of beauty regimens. Purpose is like that sweater that always comforts you but you aren&#x27;t crazy about it so you go around looking for new sweaters. Then you get home and try on the new sweaters but none feel as good as that old one. That is Purpose face soap to me. Clean, light and doesn&#x27;t over dry. It&#x27;s perfect for a cleaner... just kind of boring but I&#x27;ll never get rid of him, I mean it.</li>
            <li> Best soap free cleanser for the price.</li>
            <li> I have always used Purpose as my facial cleanser since my teenage years and was very glad to find it on amazon for $4.20 cheaper per bottle than the price i was paying. I will always use this wonderful product.  It cleans away oil without drying my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts because it&#x27;s oil-free and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> Great for the face, ...my Dermatologist recommened it to me over two years ago for a natural face cleanser and it works great.....</li>
            <li> Great product, very gentle on skin, especially sensitive skin. It does not cause dryness or irritation. I love how my face feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years as a face wash after reacting badly to so many others and haven&#x27;t used anything else since. A little goes a long way, it&#x27;s gentle, does not dry my skin, and it&#x27;s unscented. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It does not dry out my skin and does not cause my acne to reoccur. This is also a great price unless you have a coupon. I just wish it was back on subscribe and save!!</li>
            <li> Nice economy size for a great facial soap!  Great value.</li>
            <li> Great soap!!! Everyone in our house uses it. It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and it is wonderful to be able to buy it at Amazon.  Very gentle on facial skin and cleans well.</li>
            <li> This is the only face soap I have used for years.  I am 60 years old and have people telling me how young I look a lot.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and even removes mascara with ease. I have very sensitive skin and have this shipped to me rather than switch face soap since my local store does not carry it.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, but since using this product, my breakouts have lessened dramatically. It also came with a $2 off coupon for future orders.</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin and this works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Been my face wash for years. Gentle, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t burn eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a great product! The seller shipped it immediately!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and is the only thing I use to wash my face.  Gentle and effective.  I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin prone to break-outs and have difficulty finding a product that will both remove all traces of make-up without being too harsh.  It cleans better than Cetaphil or Ivory and other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, but isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap, was recommended by my derm and it works great and is very gentle</li>
            <li> My 12 y/o has really sensitive skin and this cleanser works wonderfully. While her friends are starting to have breakouts, her skin stays clear. We have run out before and I can tell a difference in her skin. I have used it on occasion and it cleans really well without drying my skin. Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
