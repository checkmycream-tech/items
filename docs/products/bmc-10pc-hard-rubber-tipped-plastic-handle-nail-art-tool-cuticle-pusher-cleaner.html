            <li>They are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They work great for smoothing out the wraps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect size - shorter than most cuticle pushers.  </li>
            <li>I figured the rubber tip would be easy than the metal cuticle pusher to start them off with, and they work great!!!</li>
            <li>Good thing they come in bulk.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Nail wrap&amp;#34; ladies you&#x27;ll love these for home parties &amp; give always!</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li>The rubber tip isn&#x27;t quite as soft/plyable as the one that comes in a jamberry application kit, but for the price, FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for applying nail wraps. :)</li>
            <li>I buy these for my Jamberry parties and as a cheap favorite in my Hostess gift.</li>
            <li>These are amazing little tools that work great for at home manicures.</li>
            <li>The rubber is sturdy and the opposite plastic end does great at getting under the nail.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re already a fantastic bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>So cheap and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Cheap looking, cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even give them away for free to my customers.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>That being said, they are great little tools.</li>
            <li>Just as expected, good quality.</li>
            <li>When it eventually wore out, I found these BMC pushers - a great price for a pack of 10 - and I now use these daily when pushing back my cuticles and applying cuticle oil.</li>
            <li>Shipping is from Hawaii and takes 1-2 weeks, but if you have the time and are stocking up, these should be your first choice.</li>
            <li>The rubber isn&#x27;t all that &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; like the title says - they&#x27;re not quite as squishy as my old Jamberry pusher but nearly so, which makes them gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>But they come in decent packaging and are consistent.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable for a bulk item.</li>
            <li>At 3 &amp; 3/4 inches long, they&#x27;re somewhat short but a pretty reasonable and comfortable length.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have as much give or &amp;#34;squish&amp;#34; as I would have thought, but having applied the nail wraps with my fingers and regular wooden orange sticks, I have to say I strongly prefer the rubber cuticle pushers.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on fragile cuticles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are fantastic little cuticle pushers!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Timely shipping and product as expected</li>
            <li> Love these! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Received my plastic cuticle pushers as stated in the Tracking. It works just like the Jamberry cuticle pusher although different color. The price was reasonable for a bulk item. I will make future purchases from Bundle Monster via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this and is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality! I love them!</li>
            <li> They are great. They are gentle on fragile cuticles.</li>
            <li> My title says it all.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> These are amazing little tools that work great for at home manicures. The rubber is sturdy and the opposite plastic end does great at getting under the nail. I keep one in my purse for when I go eat foods that involve using my hands like hard shell crabs.</li>
            <li> These are the same size and quality as the brand-name ones. I buy these for my Jamberry parties and as a cheap favorite in my Hostess gift. Shipping is from Hawaii and takes 1-2 weeks, but if you have the time and are stocking up, these should be your first choice.</li>
            <li> Thse are geat and a good price!</li>

            <li> Perfect for preparing nails for manicures.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I have quite a lot of nail products including plenty of cuticle pushers and other similar products and these ones are STILL my favourite. They&#x27;ve lasted quite a while and I&#x27;ve only had the white tips fall off when I&#x27;m pressing pretty hard with slippery cuticle oils. I have been using them daily for over a year and I don&#x27;t plan to switch brands if I don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fantastic little cuticle pushers! I was firm on orange sticks only until I got my hands on a soft rubber Jamberry pusher that changed everything. When it eventually wore out, I found these BMC pushers - a great price for a pack of 10 - and I now use these daily when pushing back my cuticles and applying cuticle oil. At 3 &amp; 3/4 inches long, they&#x27;re somewhat short but a pretty reasonable and comfortable length. The rubber isn&#x27;t all that &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; like the title says - they&#x27;re not quite as squishy as my old Jamberry pusher but nearly so, which makes them gentle and easy to use. The white tips come off of the sticks when they start to wear out (and when worn out and slippery from oils), but some rubber cement (or tape?) might extend the life of them... but they&#x27;re already a fantastic bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Love these! So cheap and inexpensive. I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores anywhere and wanted some for applying my Jamberry nails. Work perfectly!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my vinyl nail wrap business at parties and each person gets to keep theirs. Cost is perfect too! Definitely will be reordering these when needed!</li>
            <li> Very nice and works excellent</li>
            <li> these are the best ones on amazon - best value and work great!</li>

            <li> Great quality!  Exactly what I wanted!  Shipped very quickly!</li>

            <li> Perfect for my purposes!  Well made &amp; sturdy. Perfect size - shorter than most cuticle pushers.  &amp;#34;Nail wrap&amp;#34; ladies you&#x27;ll love these for home parties &amp; give always!</li>
            <li> The rubber tips slide off a bit when you use them.  But they come in decent packaging and are consistent.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, good quality. I use them for give aways for customers, so I hope all will be happy!</li>
            <li> I love these tools for putting on my Jamberry nail wraps!!!  I&#x27;m so glad I bought four packages!!!</li>
            <li> Be warned: these  are mini cuticle pushers so don&#x27;t expect long handles. That being said, they are great little tools. I bought them especially for using with jamberry nail wraps as it is suggested to use a rubber cuticle pusher for application. They don&#x27;t have as much give or &amp;#34;squish&amp;#34; as I would have thought, but having applied the nail wraps with my fingers and regular wooden orange sticks, I have to say I strongly prefer the rubber cuticle pushers. They work great for smoothing out the wraps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever give jamberry wraps or a nail set as a gift, I will definitely be giving one or two of these as well.</li>
            <li> I bought these to start teaching my nieces how to do thier nails when they come over. I figured the rubber tip would be easy than the metal cuticle pusher to start them off with, and they work great!!! Will definitely order these again when needed.</li>
