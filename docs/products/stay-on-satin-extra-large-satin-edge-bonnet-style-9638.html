    <ol>
            <li>and it was excellent.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>The band is the perfect fit, wonderful and comfy.</li>
            <li>The pillow keeps a nice shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the colour, but it would be nice to be able to choose what colour you want.</li>
            <li>I like this bonnet better than the kind sold at Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>This is the third size I tried, if you have a bob and a lot of hair, this is the best size.</li>
            <li>Will buy more and recommend to all my curly peeps.</li>
            <li>Most importantly for me it stayed put with NO</li>
            <li>I can fit curlformers under this bonnet if I fall asleep in them</li>
            <li>FYI, Unless you sleep on your face, I don&#x27;t recommend sleeping with curlformers, but this will fit rods, rollers, etc.</li>
            <li>, it is good, my head is not big</li>
            <li>I really liked this product because it helped a lot in keeping my curls soft and defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>comfortable and large size</li>
            <li>I really like these for what they are, a cheap, washable bonnet for shrunken styles.  </li>
            <li>They feel of such great quality and have a zipper to complete the look.</li>
            <li>This one is larger so it accommodates my growing hair much better.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is really large so be ready!</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing my Stay On Satin - Extra Large Satin Edge Bonnet Style 9638, except the picture is gold and that is why I ordered it</li>
            <li>As my hair grew out, I needed to upgrade my bonnet to one that wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smash&amp;#34; my curls too much.  </li>
            <li>thing I really like is that there is no elastic band.  </li>
            <li>These were so reasonably priced that i gave them a try.</li>
            <li>so I had to loosen it by unstitching it a bit, which might in the end spoil the whole thing if it keeps on unstitching</li>
            <li>extra large was the right size it came in as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The biggest issue I have is that the band gave me a headache and puts pressure on sensitive areas even though it doesn&#x27;t fit super tight.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a high quality bonnet, but I prefer it over the pricier options because it&#x27;s lightweight, breathable and doesn&#x27;t have the elastic band that could pull your hair out.</li>
            <li>tried using it a few more times, hoping that it might &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; a bit.  </li>
            <li>and I find that as my hair grows longer this bonnet accommodates the length better when I am lazy and stuff my hair under without wrapping.  </li>
            <li>large enough so that my hair would not be &amp;#34;squashed&amp;#34; while I slept.  </li>
            <li>Soft to the touch, but sturdy material.  </li>
            <li>Read other reviews and decided to order extra large.  </li>
            <li>this is a regular satin bonnet; it is not large or extra large by any means</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this is a regular satin bonnet; it is not large or extra large by any means</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a extra large cap here locally</li>
            <li> I had elastic around my forehead all night long.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that sometimes gets smashed at night while I sleep.</li>
            <li> They are long and I needed to cover all of them for sleeping.</li>
            <li> but when I received it, it was black, disappointed because of the color they sent, but it looks and wears good, will try to find a gold one in the stores.</li>
            <li> The elastic was so tight that I had creases in my forehead the next morning.  </li>
            <li> The satin part is o.k., but the tight band left me with a headache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only downside is that the elastic band that goes around your head is too tight</li>
            <li> so I received this product in black.</li>
            <li> but I have a long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Was way too tight on my head and cut off the blood circulation.</li>
            <li> My complaint about the bonnet is that it is uncomfortably tight around the hairline.</li>
            <li> Hurts your head and way too small.  </li>
            <li> This thing would be large only on a small child - very disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, I like it, I didn&#x27;t find it tight or annoying</li>
            <li> This made no difference for my curls and in fact, my hair looked worse.</li>
            <li> Alas, it did not stretch and I have been unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when this one arrived.  </li>

            <li> My complaint about the bonnet is that it is uncomfortably tight around the hairline. Also it does not appear to be \\&quot;extra large.\\&quot; Fits like a regular size bonnet.</li>
            <li> The band is the perfect fit, wonderful and comfy. The bonnet is really large so be ready!</li>
            <li> This thing would be large only on a small child - very disappointed with this purchase.  I can&#x27;t ear it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing my Stay On Satin - Extra Large Satin Edge Bonnet Style 9638, except the picture is gold and that is why I ordered it but when I received it, it was black, disappointed because of the color they sent, but it looks and wears good, will try to find a gold one in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, I like it, I didn&#x27;t find it tight or annoying, it is good, my head is not big but I have a long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I like this bonnet better than the kind sold at Sally Beauty Supply. This one is larger so it accommodates my growing hair much better. I had no choice in what color I received from the seller so I received this product in black. I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I really like these for what they are, a cheap, washable bonnet for shrunken styles.  As my hair grew out, I needed to upgrade my bonnet to one that wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smash&amp;#34; my curls too much.

            <li> This is the third size I tried, if you have a bob and a lot of hair, this is the best size.</li>
            <li> I can fit curlformers under this bonnet if I fall asleep in them and I find that as my hair grows longer this bonnet accommodates the length better when I am lazy and stuff my hair under without wrapping.  FYI, Unless you sleep on your face, I don&#x27;t recommend sleeping with curlformers, but this will fit rods, rollers, etc.</li>
            <li> I recently got a perm and was having problems with my hair being all matted in the mornings after a night&#x27;s sleep.  So, I decided to try this.  And, it does help keep your curls from getting all mushed up in a matted mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like is that there is no elastic band.  This has does not leave a line on your face!  But, it stretches and stays on all night.  And, I have a lot of hair (shoulder length.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to pack this up and take it with me when I travel also.</li>
            <li> The stay on satin extra large was the right size it came in as advertised.  It is hard to find a extra large cap here locally and it was excellent.</li>
            <li> I never knew what a difference a satin pillowcase would make to my curly hair. These were so reasonably priced that i gave them a try. They feel of such great quality and have a zipper to complete the look. The pillow keeps a nice shape. Will buy more and recommend to all my curly peeps.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Read other reviews and decided to order extra large.  Hey, so I have a big head and lots of hair.  Soft to the touch, but sturdy material.  No hair on the pillow in the morning.  Most importantly for me it stayed put with NO, I repeat NO sign I had elastic around my forehead all night long.  Love it, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> comfortable and large size</li>
            <li> this is a regular satin bonnet; it is not large or extra large by any means</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that sometimes gets smashed at night while I sleep. This made no difference for my curls and in fact, my hair looked worse. The biggest issue I have is that the band gave me a headache and puts pressure on sensitive areas even though it doesn&#x27;t fit super tight.</li>
            <li> I have a short hairstyle and an average-size head.  I needed a sleep bonnet just to keep my hair in place at night, and I wanted&lt;br /&gt;one large enough so that my hair would not be &amp;#34;squashed&amp;#34; while I slept.  I was so disappointed when this one arrived.  The elastic was so tight that I had creases in my forehead the next morning.  The satin part is o.k., but the tight band left me with a headache.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it a few more times, hoping that it might &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; a bit.  Alas, it did not stretch and I have been unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Was way too tight on my head and cut off the blood circulation. I cannot even use it.</li>
            <li> Hurts your head and way too small.  Put it on my daughter and it comes off during the night.</li>
            <li> This bonnet works well with my Sister Locs.  They are long and I needed to cover all of them for sleeping.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because it helped a lot in keeping my curls soft and defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They only downside is that the elastic band that goes around your head is too tight so I had to loosen it by unstitching it a bit, which might in the end spoil the whole thing if it keeps on unstitching itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the colour, but it would be nice to be able to choose what colour you want.</li>
