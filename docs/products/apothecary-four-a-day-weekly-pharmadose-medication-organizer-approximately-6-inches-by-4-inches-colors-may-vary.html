            <li>Just a nice product for the money.</li>
            <li>These pill organizers are the absolute BEST...</li>
            <li>This pill keeper is a nice size and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I got these for my parents, they take many meds.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill and easy to dispense medications.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and keep everything organized.  </li>
            <li>Compact and easy to use for him.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill</li>
            <li>Easy to refill since it has a pull-out tray.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to load and fill.</li>
            <li>Great organizer for your daily pill dispensing.  </li>
            <li>There it was available and for sail.  </li>
            <li>pleased to receive the items early and packaged well!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such great service!</li>
            <li>Very useful, helped me plan my meds for a four-week trip.</li>
            <li>The tray that holds all the meds is a bit flimsy, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 3, but being able to remove the tray all at once makes it much easier to fill.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the optional lock that can be engaged to prevent children from gaining access to the colorful pills.</li>
            <li>Nice sheet in back to display medication names, strengths, etc.</li>
            <li>They use it to hold a month&#x27;s worth of pills.</li>
            <li>I originally bought mine at a nearby large pharmacy chain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the right size med box for years.</li>
            <li>This case is ok except for the fact its small and seems kind of flimsy....</li>
            <li>I have three very similar ones, but the ones I use have hinged covers, which makes loading them very easy.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s busy so its easy to forget.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but they can be hard to find, so it was great to find them at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I got my first Pharmadose at a local drugstore, and wanted more</li>
            <li>By transferring all my pills from Rx bottle to Pharmadose case immediately when I get a Rx, I can see exactly what I have</li>
            <li>I have had one for several years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>The locking feature also seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>No flippy little lids that pop up unexpectedly, no spills, easy to see each days medications, this is great.</li>
            <li>My Rx&#x27;s are small pills and a capsule that fit easily into a Pharmadose compartment (vitamins really don&#x27;t fit).</li>
            <li>It might be good for someone who takes small pills.</li>
            <li>If your pills are small this would be a good unit.</li>
            <li>there is no way an older person, in frail health, is going to be able to get this container open..</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this item and would highly recommend it for anyone with multiple medications.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I use them and now the whole family does too.</li>
            <li>Pills can look so much alike and can bounce into another compartment when you&#x27;re filling the boxes.</li>
            <li>Very reliable.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily, of course, and appreciate being able to slide the clear cover from the day&#x27;s pills one compartment at a time.  </li>
            <li>This is mainly because I want it to fit in a smaller purse.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Nice looking box, just big enough for my daily needs.</li>
            <li>With the hinged cover, I can overload the compartments, then close the cover and shake to make the pills settle down; can&#x27;t as easily do that with the slide-out trays.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased because I can be forgetful about remembering if I took my medicine.  </li>
            <li>After years of use; I went to get a new one, but they do not sell this brand anymore.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the snap shut type of pill boxes you usually see for sale.</li>
            <li>This little guy is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My old ones were over 20 yrs old.</li>
            <li>They have been using these for about a year now, and so far no breakage.</li>
            <li>but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the safety and security features that allow me to leave my meds close to my personal chair; but, are not a problem when company comes by suddenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I had one similar to this one before ,only it was made in&lt;br /&gt;Sweden and was a little better quality.</li>
            <li>Not too big yet big enough to hold my daily medications for a full week.  </li>
            <li>This is my third one, broke the first one, recently lost the second one.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I love that I can fill the entire thing once a month, and that even my tiny little cut-in-half pills don&#x27;t spill from day to day bins when the entire organizer is inverted each morning to put the days pills into a cup.</li>
            <li>problem recently noticed is some of what I am being asked to take now don&#x27;t fit into the compartments of this size unit, checking to see if they have a larger unit, or some other solution for big things like vitamin and calcium tablets.</li>
            <li>why I only gave it 4 stars) is that you have to pull out the whole inside tray to put the pills in instead of sliding the daily doors open.</li>
            <li>Also, distributing pills for the week is convenient because the clear inner tray slides out so that seven individual cover slides need not be opened one by one to receive the pills.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned the small size would not fit all their daily pills, but I was greatly surprised everything fit!  </li>
            <li>May be difficult to open at first for some, depending on how much pressure you can use to depress the upper right to open, but overall fairly simple.  </li>
            <li>This is my third unit over years, and though I have used other makes and styles, I still come back to this particular case.  </li>

            <li> To small for my fish pills and vitamins.  </li>
            <li> The tray is weak as well as the little door that keeps it in.</li>
            <li> compartments to small and to shallow</li>
            <li> It is hard to get into it, but i think it will loosen up with use.</li>
            <li> and they are very hard to find&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is child proof-a NECESSITY if you have small children or will have visitors with kids!!!  </li>
            <li> so I can preload my meds for two weeks which saves me a lot of tedious tasking.  </li>
            <li> Terrible Boxes.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got my first Pharmadose at a local drugstore, and wanted more but they can be hard to find, so it was great to find them at Amazon. My Rx&#x27;s are small pills and a capsule that fit easily into a Pharmadose compartment (vitamins really don&#x27;t fit). I have 2 Pharmadose cases, and I treat the 28 compartments as 28 days (rather than 4 doses per day for 7 days) so that represents 2 months. By transferring all my pills from Rx bottle to Pharmadose case immediately when I get a Rx, I can see exactly what I have and when I&#x27;ll be needing to renew. Each family member who has an Rx has his/her own Pharmadose case. Keeps it all manageable and sane.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small.  I use it anyway and it keeps me on track with my daily meds.</li>
            <li> I like how you have diffrent sizes, that they can be locked or not locked. They are durable. Shipping was fast. I use them and now the whole family does too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this organizer for years.  Easy to fill and easy to dispense medications. Not mix up of pills.  The inside tray is removable so you do not have to open each door to fill.  Just a nice product for the money.</li>
            <li> Had an accident Thanksgiving Day 1990, began having seizures afterwards. Used for taking multiple different meds at different times and doses since then. Convenient to load for the week, day slides are a little tight at first but break in shortly. This is my third one, broke the first one, recently lost the second one.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem recently noticed is some of what I am being asked to take now don&#x27;t fit into the compartments of this size unit, checking to see if they have a larger unit, or some other solution for big things like vitamin and calcium tablets.</li>
            <li> I have three very similar ones, but the ones I use have hinged covers, which makes loading them very easy.  These have slide-out trays, which I don&#x27;t like.  With the hinged cover, I can overload the compartments, then close the cover and shake to make the pills settle down; can&#x27;t as easily do that with the slide-out trays.  Can&#x27;t seem to find the hinged-cover ones anymore, not even on the company website (there seem to be larger boxes with hinged covers, but not ones this size anymore).</li>
            <li> This case is ok except for the fact its small and seems kind of flimsy....I tried to use it for a few weeks, but ended up putting it in the recycling bin.  It might be good for someone who takes small pills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and they&#x27;re marvelous!  I fill 5 or 6 at a time, and I don&#x27;t have to think about it again for what seems like a long time.  The containers are very secure; great for home and travel.</li>

            <li> there is no way an older person, in frail health, is going to be able to get this container open.. I returned it</li>
            <li> Perfect tool to organize meds.</li>
            <li> Finally!  Something that keeps me on target with my meds!</li>
            <li> Great organizer for your daily pill dispensing.  My cousin wanted this for his pills.  Compact and easy to use for him.</li>
            <li> perfect size for those of us who can&#x27;t see anything!!</li>
            <li> These pill organizers are the absolute BEST...bar none.  I originally bought mine at a nearby large pharmacy chain.  After years of use; I went to get a new one, but they do not sell this brand anymore.  Amazon is wonderful!! There it was available and for sail.  I originally purchased because I can be forgetful about remembering if I took my medicine.  It is child proof-a NECESSITY if you have small children or will have visitors with kids!!!  I ordered two this last time so I can preload my meds for two weeks which saves me a lot of tedious tasking.  Great for travel.  Labeled with the weekdays, so you know if you took the med or not.</li>
            <li> compartments to small and to shallow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the right size med box for years. My old ones were over 20 yrs old. This box is perfect. Easy to fill but you have to push the side button in for the day to open. No more digging in your purse or suitcase for your meds that came out when the box opened accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;As an RN I can recommend this box. Even I have trouble remembering if I took the morning or evening pills and with this box you have only to look to tell. Everyone&#x27;s busy so its easy to forget.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend filling med boxes when you&#x27;re fully awake and have no distractions. Also when you pour your pills into your hand double check. Pills can look so much alike and can bounce into another compartment when you&#x27;re filling the boxes. Always check the bottle, the time of day and the dosage. Any questions ask your Nurse or Pharmacist.</li>
            <li> I got these for my parents, they take many meds.  I was concerned the small size would not fit all their daily pills, but I was greatly surprised everything fit!  They say this is a great size for traveling.  They use it to hold a month&#x27;s worth of pills. They have been using these for about a year now, and so far no breakage.</li>
            <li> I have had one for several years and absolutely love it.  I purchased this one for my daughter and she loves in too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help organize my moms medication.the organizer worked out perfectly I even bought one for myself excellent</li>
            <li> This pill keeper is a nice size and sturdy.  Not too big yet big enough to hold my daily medications for a full week.  I have two of these so I can organize my pills for two weeks at one sitting.</li>
            <li> Terrible Boxes.  Too small and very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for I have one just like this and they are very hard to find&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item and would highly recommend it for anyone with multiple medications.  I particularly like the safety and security features that allow me to leave my meds close to my personal chair; but, are not a problem when company comes by suddenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was pleased to receive the items early and packaged well!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such great service!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a medication holder that was like the one I have used for years. Well this is the closest I have found. The only difference (and why I only gave it 4 stars) is that you have to pull out the whole inside tray to put the pills in instead of sliding the daily doors open. The tray is weak as well as the little door that keeps it in.</li>
            <li> Nice looking box, just big enough for my daily needs. I had one similar to this one before ,only it was made in&lt;br /&gt;Sweden and was a little better quality. Alas, I cannot find one exactly like the one I had but this is a very close second. the only drawback to it, is the release mechanism to get into the box is a little tight. It is hard to get into it, but i think it will loosen up with use. Much better than the snap shut type of pill boxes you usually see for sale.</li>
            <li> I bought one several years ago and used it daily.  Easy to refill since it has a pull-out tray.  Very reliable.  I decided to buy a second one so I have to re-fill less often and in case someday, it does break.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and does its job.</li>
            <li> To small for my fish pills and vitamins.  If your pills are small this would be a good unit.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I wish this was a bit smaller. This is mainly because I want it to fit in a smaller purse. My pills are all small, so I could do with a smaller organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the truth is, this does everything it&#x27;s supposed to. The tray that holds all the meds is a bit flimsy, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 3, but being able to remove the tray all at once makes it much easier to fill. The locking feature also seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Very useful, helped me plan my meds for a four-week trip. Visiting grandchildren, I&#x27;m very glad this product has child-resistant features.</li>
            <li> This little guy is fantastic. Two of us take seven and five pills per day, respectively, and this dispenser has NO problem holding them all. I love that I can fill the entire thing once a month, and that even my tiny little cut-in-half pills don&#x27;t spill from day to day bins when the entire organizer is inverted each morning to put the days pills into a cup. No flippy little lids that pop up unexpectedly, no spills, easy to see each days medications, this is great. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great pill organizer.  We use it for my forgetful teenage daughter who has to take a pill every night.  Now we can look at a glance to see if she&#x27;s taken it or not.  It is easy to load and fill.</li>
