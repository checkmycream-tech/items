            <li>(: the color blends nice as well.</li>
            <li>The colour is perfect and they are so soft.</li>
            <li>and I will probably put some layers in it to make it blend better.  </li>
            <li>Perfect #613 blonde.</li>
            <li>Also they were delivered about 2 weeks before the estimated delivery date! :)</li>
            <li>And overall, the color was perfect.</li>
            <li>I also wish they were an inch or two wider because I have to place them more towards one side of my head and pin hair to one side</li>
            <li>Would love to try it out.</li>
            <li>and I love it .</li>
            <li>My daughter is enjoying them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my hair extensions.</li>
            <li>The extensions are nice and soft and the color is amazing!</li>
            <li>That can easily be taken care of though, just need to order another set.</li>
            <li>So pretty and the clips are very strong.</li>
            <li>I wear wigs &amp; hair pieces...&amp;&amp; for the price I paid, this piece is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Would not have paid more than the $12 and don&#x27;t think they were even worth that</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not quite as light as they appear on screen tho  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re a bit more golden</li>
            <li>Soft, bright, clips stay in place</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be a full head piece</li>
            <li>only good if you every get what you ordered.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it and would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Color is accurate and they feel almost like real hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good but color was not as expected</li>
            <li>and I have golden brown/blond hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth your money too.</li>
            <li>,I love them,plus they came super fast now I&#x27;m buying a pink one:))</li>
            <li>and you can just brush it right out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s perfect for blonde bombshells who want to add a little thickness to their hair.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast, considering it was coming all the way from China.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone, and may buy more.</li>
            <li>BUT the hair looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I went and bought the nessicary clips and sewed them on, but if you aren&#x27;t willing to do that then don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li>It is just ONE PIECE, I expected more but the sellers are fantastic and fixed the problem quick.</li>
            <li>Such a shame since this hair is absolutely beautiful; silky straight and very long.</li>
            <li>FAST shipping (I also paid for fast shipping) but it was worth it</li>
            <li>The thickness is decent and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them!</li>
            <li>I ordered color #613 which is a light blonde however, once I received the hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>I am very dissappointed to report that it looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li>I was very disappionted.</li>
            <li>Other than that, im satisfied.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re like real hair nice and thick and very long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I was super hesitant about getting this because I want my extensions to look as natural as possible.</li>
            <li>it was not the correct color I had ordered it was a honey blonde #22 instead of light blonde</li>
            <li>It gets very tangeled but only because it&#x27;s very soft synthetic hair!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color but a little too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li>They feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really straight and long, goes down to my lower back (which I love), but of course you can cut it whatever length you wish.</li>
            <li>Major fall out cant brush without loads of hair coming out.</li>
            <li>The blonde was a little more yellow than in the pictures, but ill make it work &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is they&#x27;re not thick enough.</li>
            <li>but boy was I shocked at how beautifully it blended into my hair and my human extensions!</li>
            <li>The color was exactly as picture (platinum blonde) and they arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I got this clip-in because it was cheap, so if it looked fake it was not too much money lost...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of extensions over the years, human and synthetic, good and bad quality</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair is so thin that I would like at least one more for it to look realistic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 3 because it took so long to come in.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use flat iron on them.</li>
            <li> Other than that its thick and the way the clips are they&#x27;re perfect for thin or thick hair I like</li>
            <li> Blow dry?</li>
            <li> There are no clips to clip it in, just a single comb.</li>
            <li> They do tangle quickly though and were too heavy for my thin hair and hurt after about an hour of being in.</li>
            <li> I love the color and length of them but they shed so badly.</li>
            <li> clips all have came off and had to redo them again and again the hair is falling out and breaking off in the center.</li>
            <li> A lot longer than I expected</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that when I opened the package I was ready to expect the worse.</li>
            <li> Not even remotely close to what the pic shows.</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed because I waited about a month to recieve this item and was extremely exited to use it</li>
            <li> As for the other reviews on here, yes it tangles it is 23&amp;#34; of hair...</li>
            <li> three of the other clips became lose.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money....</li>
            <li> After wearing the extensions(regular wear, just hair down with extensions in)</li>
            <li> I would choose half a star if I could.</li>
            <li> Got them in just a little over a week.</li>
            <li> and I actually had to thin it</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money,why get these extensions if you can&#x27;t curl it with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> After waiting a month for it to come by mail, it was the complete wrong color.</li>
            <li> but there is a very ugly ribbon attached to the top of the track?</li>
            <li> literally got them in a little over a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m annoyed and extremely disapointed.</li>
            <li> But I wish it was a little bit thinner since my hair is kinda thin.</li>
            <li> I am delicate with it...</li>
            <li> thick</li>
            <li> it is thick though</li>
            <li> so I already have thick hair as it is.</li>
            <li> Looks so fake don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Its very thick .</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> Not happy the color is totally wrong.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t since I received the wrong color.</li>
            <li> When I received my extensions one of the clips was placed backwards making it unable to clip onto hair.</li>
            <li> The product I received is wrong.</li>
            <li> the hair is a disgusting yellow gold.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t headbang or go crazy shaking your head</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was very skeptical about buying this product...</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> Very fake looking and feeling!!!</li>
            <li> but these are the worst when it comes to shedding.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Loveee it! Perfectly!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Bought on Christmas, here jan 3rd! You&#x27;re gunna get what you paid for. The blonde was a little more yellow than in the pictures, but ill make it work &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast, considering it was coming all the way from China. The product arrived in perfect condition and I love it. Would definitely recommend to anyone, and may buy more.</li>
            <li> Came 15 days early&lt;br /&gt;Very thick and I actually had to thin it alittle&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it wasnt synthetic</li>
            <li> I love these! They&#x27;re like real hair nice and thick and very long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But want to know if anyone has tried dying them!?</li>
            <li> Once I saw this item I immediately knew I had to purchase it. I ordered color #613 which is a light blonde however, once I received the hair it was not the correct color I had ordered it was a honey blonde #22 instead of light blonde definitely not #613. I was so dissapointed because I waited about a month to recieve this item and was extremely exited to use it but I can&#x27;t since I received the wrong color. Such a shame since this hair is absolutely beautiful; silky straight and very long. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with my purchase I feel as if I just got ripped off. I have no idea what color chart the seller is using but please fix it, it&#x27;s faulty!</li>
            <li> Got them in just a little over a week. Color is accurate and they feel almost like real hair. No one could tell I was wearing extensions. They feel so soft. Would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Can you style these extensions??? Like curl? Straighten? Crimp? Blow dry? Wash them? Doesn&#x27;t put isn&#x27;t information about that at all..</li>
            <li> It is just ONE PIECE, I expected more but the sellers are fantastic and fixed the problem quick. Thank you! Even though it is just one piece, it is gorgeous. My hair is so thin that I would like at least one more for it to look realistic and I will probably put some layers in it to make it blend better.  You can obviously see where my hair stops. BUT the hair looks exactly like the picture. Perfect #613 blonde. It was packaged great, no dent in the hair. FAST shipping (I also paid for fast shipping) but it was worth it, I got it in like 3 days. Sellers communicate well. I am glad I bought it and would definitely buy more. As for the other reviews on here, yes it tangles it is 23&amp;#34; of hair...of course it tangles. Don&#x27;t headbang or go crazy shaking your head and you can just brush it right out. I have brushed it 3x and no hair has fallen out. I am delicate with it...I don&#x27;t brush it like I am beating it to death. I wear wigs &amp; hair pieces...&amp;&amp; for the price I paid, this piece is fantastic. I just wish it was a set. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not happy the color is totally wrong. I ordered a #613  and got some orangy looking blonde. it is thick though</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money,why get these extensions if you can&#x27;t curl it with a curling iron. Never buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 3 because it took so long to come in. Other than that, im satisfied. Deffinately what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> clips all have came off and had to redo them again and again the hair is falling out and breaking off in the center.</li>
            <li> Love them!!! So pretty and the clips are very strong. Match almost identical to my hair color. Ordering more soon! Also they were delivered about 2 weeks before the estimated delivery date! :)</li>
            <li> Did not like it! What else is there to say about a product u don&#x27;t like??? Make sure u read the details good I guess!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was very skeptical about buying this product...&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, they arrived about 4 days ahead of time. Second, they were neatly packaged. And overall, the color was perfect. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is they&#x27;re not thick enough. That can easily be taken care of though, just need to order another set. I would recommend this product, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!  I&#x27;m a hairstylist , this hair is NOT HUMAN HAIR it&#x27;s not even animal hair ! Can&#x27;t put any heat to it! Can&#x27;t even color it! I will meet buy hair online ever again!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.... Very fake looking and feeling!!!</li>
            <li> I received my track today in the mail. I am very dissappointed to report that it looks nothing like the picture. There are no clips to clip it in, just a single comb. Not only that but there is a very ugly ribbon attached to the top of the track? Unsure of what this is supposed to be for? I guess I will try and find a way to fix it but it ended up being not what I believed I was ordering. :( I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> I would choose half a star if I could. It doesn&#x27;t curl like it said it doesn&#x27;t dye and it is not a clip. It&#x27;s a pony tail extension. I&#x27;m annoyed and extremely disapointed.</li>
            <li> Not reall hair like they said it smells like a wig and feels like horse hair  got here on time but didnt like the way they were emailing me</li>
            <li> Good but color was not as expected</li>
            <li> When I received my extensions one of the clips was placed backwards making it unable to clip onto hair. After wearing the extensions(regular wear, just hair down with extensions in) three of the other clips became lose. Would not have paid more than the $12 and don&#x27;t think they were even worth that</li>
            <li> A lot longer than I expected but it shed a lot* and since it&#x27;s synthetic it does have a shine to it.</li>
            <li> Looks so fake don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The product I received is wrong. It was supposed to be a full head piece and what came was a one piece part. Never order from this place, they don&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that when I opened the package I was ready to expect the worse. I was amazed by what I got! The extensions are nice and soft and the color is amazing! The thickness is decent and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> These are great, a lot thicker than I was expecting...they&#x27;re not quite as light as they appear on screen tho  they&#x27;re a bit more golden</li>
            <li> The color looks lighter in the picture so I didn&#x27;t think it would match I&#x27;ve worn them for 2 days and they matched perfectly with my hair,I love them,plus they came super fast now I&#x27;m buying a pink one:))</li>
            <li> The color was exactly as picture (platinum blonde) and they arrived earlier than expected. They do tangle quickly though and were too heavy for my thin hair and hurt after about an hour of being in. I also wish they were an inch or two wider because I have to place them more towards one side of my head and pin hair to one side or they don&#x27;t blend as good.</li>
            <li> So impressed on how quickly I got them! When I ordered them it said a month to get them... literally got them in a little over a week! Was so happy to see them in the mail! The colour is perfect and they are so soft. Just bought a second set.</li>
            <li> Major fall out cant brush without loads of hair coming out. Other than that its thick and the way the clips are they&#x27;re perfect for thin or thick hair I like that they had five on one weft</li>
            <li> Not even remotely close to what the pic shows. It almost brassy brown . Not happy at all..I was very disappionted.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could dye it purple because it was cheaper that way, but the product image is notthe product I ordered. It came with a comb like clip instead of the ones in the picture. I went and bought the nessicary clips and sewed them on, but if you aren&#x27;t willing to do that then don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> After waiting a month for it to come by mail, it was the complete wrong color. But the texture and length was amazing and on point but it came bleach blond and I have golden brown/blond hair so it didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> only good if you every get what you ordered. Never returned emails or inquires.  So how can I rate or even like this product. Would love to try it out.</li>
            <li> the hair is a disgusting yellow gold. would not reccomend to anyone. i dont think anyone would wear this.  ew</li>
            <li> I love the color and length of them but they shed so badly. I&#x27;ve had lots of extensions over the years, human and synthetic, good and bad quality but these are the worst when it comes to shedding.</li>
            <li> My extension just came in yesterday and I love it . Its very thick . But I wish it was a little bit thinner since my hair is kinda thin. But I love it and it looks great (: ♡</li>
            <li> I was super hesitant about getting this because I want my extensions to look as natural as possible. After spending $100+ on some blonde human hair, the thickness just wasn&#x27;t there. I got this clip-in because it was cheap, so if it looked fake it was not too much money lost... but boy was I shocked at how beautifully it blended into my hair and my human extensions! It&#x27;s now a &amp;#34;MUST WEAR&amp;#34; anytime I clip my extensions  in, in fact, I kind of want one more! It&#x27;s really straight and long, goes down to my lower back (which I love), but of course you can cut it whatever length you wish. I have never tried using a straighter or curling iron on it though, I imagine it wouldn&#x27;t survive... but it&#x27;s perfect for blonde bombshells who want to add a little thickness to their hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is enjoying them. Can&#x27;t use flat iron on them. The ends are already fried and need to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but a little too thick for my liking. I&#x27;m Italian so I already have thick hair as it is.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my hair extensions. I definitely recommend it. it&#x27;s worth your money too.</li>
            <li> I wear this hair for princess parties that I do! Works great! It gets very tangeled but only because it&#x27;s very soft synthetic hair! Love the hair! (: the color blends nice as well.</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed with this. I get that I only paid $8 for it, but come on... I had to wait almost 2 months to get it and then what was supposed to be blond ended up being ORANGE.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing. Soft, bright, clips stay in place</li>
