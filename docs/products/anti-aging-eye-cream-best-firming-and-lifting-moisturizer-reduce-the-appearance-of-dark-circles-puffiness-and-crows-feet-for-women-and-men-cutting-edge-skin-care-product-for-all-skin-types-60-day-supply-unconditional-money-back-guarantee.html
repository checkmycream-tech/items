            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>A great product!</li>
            <li>Great value &amp; very effective!!</li>
            <li>I was impressed compare to the price and good ingredients they use.</li>
            <li>Great deal on Eye cream.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is that this is a great product -</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Is a great eye product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>I applied the eye cream around my eyes, it felt good - not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just started using and seems to be a good quality product.</li>
            <li>Three stars for being a good moisturizer but no luck with firming.</li>
            <li>Very Pleased.</li>
            <li>The dryness around my eyes have improved, but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the firming, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say that it is the BEST firming cream.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>Again, however, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it--and more than that, did I mention is smells really good?</li>
            <li>Mingfinity really is the best!</li>
            <li>It has nice texture, smooth, very light smell and</li>
            <li>I loved it at first sight!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than some others I&#x27;ve tried, but don&#x27;t use it in the daytime, as it has no SPF.</li>
            <li>is my favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the refreshing feeling that I get from this eye</li>
            <li>Most creams tend to be on the oily side.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing</li>
            <li>It works great for me and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and i totally love it.</li>
            <li>Well I was impressed with the reviews until I checked and saw that 8 out of 10 of the 5 star reviews I checked were all from people who had only one review!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>often indicates some kind of quid pro quo arrangement where people get free product in exchange for a review, or sometimes it indicates the accounts are created just for the purchase of the review - which is either a review by the company itself or</li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream I have used--have been using for several weeks</li>
            <li>I love the feel and the smell of this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I like the softness and the feel of the skin around my eyes after using it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this eye cream smells.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spread out around eye area.</li>
            <li>I dont get sunburn easily even though I go to the beach a lot.</li>
            <li>Silky, smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I am a huge butterfly lover and purple</li>
            <li>Mingfinity&#x27;s eye cream goes on smooth and is so light and fresh</li>
            <li>Love the easy light manageable pump action.  </li>
            <li>I generally use very famous brand.</li>
            <li>Look more awake fast results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now - I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
            <li>and she is constantly commenting on how good it feels when applying.</li>
            <li>My wife has been looking for a good and reasonable priced eye cream for her sensitive skin for a while.</li>
            <li>I can say with confidence that it works even better than the high priced brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, but I am interested in &amp;#34;delaying&amp;#34; the effects of aging too!</li>
            <li>, I received an email from them with details about the main ingredients and what they do which was very cool.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that I love the natural, non chemical formula.  </li>
            <li>My wife tried many product before, but this one seems to agree with her sensitive skin with its natural and healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>My GF appreciates that it smells fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>of all I love how this makes my skin feel - soft and</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian and I have nice tanned skin.</li>
            <li>I read ingredients right away when I got it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are just right.</li>
            <li>In the short time she has had this product it has quickly become her favorite</li>
            <li>cream.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very slight pleasant smell, the scent is almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Mingfinity.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly and makes my cute asian eyes feel &#x27;soft&#x27; around the edges.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps with wrinkles, and I really don&#x27;t have any major fine lines at this point to tell if it&#x27;s helping with those either, but part of using an eye cream is prevention</li>
            <li>This cream leaves my skin super soft and hydrated feel.</li>
            <li>I will almost certainly buy this eye cream again.</li>
            <li>This cream is very hydrating without the slimy feel.  </li>
            <li>And the price is reasonable</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see anything in the ingredients that really would prevent or remove wrinkles, but since I do feel firmer, healthier skin when I use it, perhaps that&#x27;s how it does it.</li>
            <li>I have decided to write a review for this product because I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need oil, but not too much oil.</li>
            <li>The cream is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>So far I love it and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Her skin is very sensitive, so she is very particular about the kinds of creams and lotions she uses.  </li>
            <li>I also like the scent-with aloe in it, this eye cream has a soft, delicate scent that smells really good when using it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Light, delicate and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, feels gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days, I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>So I think it works for what it&#x27;s advertised to do, but not as harshly or as strongly as some more expensive creams.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am afraid of getting a rash or wasting money every time I tried a new product, I am happy to report that I did not break out or get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a gift for my wife who is very particular in the types of creams and lotions she will use, especially on her face and around her eyes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this for long, but so far I have noticed that the morning Dark Circles and Puffiness are diminished, leaving me looking more alive.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a friend who as sensitive skin like myself.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too light nor too heavy.  </li>
            <li>When I was hanging around at Amazon looking  for natural creams.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, taking only seconds to apply and in very small amount.  </li>
            <li>it soaked into my skin well, very moisturizing without being heavy or sticky, plus it&#x27;s not irritating my eyes.  </li>
            <li>That has to mean something as presentation is soo important today.</li>
            <li>a high-quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used an Olay eye cream that used to really make my skin feel tight</li>
            <li>The one thing in particular I have noticed is; prior to her using this product she was starting to develop just the slightest hint of dark circles under her eyes (don&#x27;t tell her</li>

            <li> She has been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now, and so far she likes it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps eyes free from dark lines and that over all tired look.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really not convinced it helps remove existing wrinkles</li>
            <li> Since my skin is oily in the T zone, I have to be careful when choosing any skin care product.</li>
            <li> I wish other companies felt that way.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream does make my eyes feel tight like that, but not nearly as much.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, dark circles and brown spots.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles have almost gone away as well.  </li>
            <li> I have insomnia due to medications and have the eye cream has saved me from looking like the Walking Dead.</li>
            <li> After 7 days, I see less crow feet on my face.  </li>
            <li> My Crows Feet still exist, but I believe they look less noticeable because my skin doesn&#x27;t look so dehydrated.</li>
            <li> It seems slightly lift and brighten my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight firming on my hooded eyes.  </li>
            <li> The pump bottle is a pleasure to use, and the cream absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave me a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> My eyes feel tight from the cleansers I use.  </li>
            <li> Even so, I DO like the way my skin feels and the way it makes my eyes feel less tired when I use it, so it&#x27;s definitely</li>
            <li> Thank you for making an eye cream without a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Living in California could be a blessing and a curse as skin damage caused by the sun is one of the issues I have to deal with everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> You know what I mean, the heavy, &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; feeling that some creams and lotions leave on your skin.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It works for me.  After 7 days, I see less crow feet on my face.  Will shop again.</li>
            <li> Just received this so I&#x27;m not qualified to make any judgements that are pro, or con.  What I can say is that I love the natural, non chemical formula.  Obviously, this company cares about what their customers are putting on their face.  I wish other companies felt that way.  The pump bottle is a pleasure to use, and the cream absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave me a greasy mess.  I will almost certainly buy this eye cream again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t di anything for me!</li>
            <li> Love the easy light manageable pump action.  Tap for the desired amount.  Keeps eyes free from dark lines and that over all tired look.  Look more awake fast results.</li>
            <li> The dryness around my eyes have improved, but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the firming, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say that it is the BEST firming cream.  This is my second bottle.  I wanted to give it a fair chance.  It&#x27;s better than some others I&#x27;ve tried, but don&#x27;t use it in the daytime, as it has no SPF.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first sight! I am a huge butterfly lover and purple is my favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied the eye cream around my eyes, it felt good - not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now - I love it and highly recommend it! I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Just started using and seems to be a good quality product. I haven&#x27;t been using this for long, but so far I have noticed that the morning Dark Circles and Puffiness are diminished, leaving me looking more alive. My Crows Feet still exist, but I believe they look less noticeable because my skin doesn&#x27;t look so dehydrated. I love the texture and the refreshing feeling that I get from this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very slight pleasant smell, the scent is almost nonexistent. So far I love it and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased. Thank you for making an eye cream without a heavy scent. Absorbs nicely into the skin. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great deal on Eye cream.  Most creams tend to be on the oily side.  This cream is very hydrating without the slimy feel.  It&#x27;s refreshing and I can feel the difference.  My eyes feel tight from the cleansers I use.  After hydrating with this eye cream, I can say that the skin around my eyes do go, &amp;#34;Ahhhhhhh&amp;#34;.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either.  Great deal!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream. It feels wonderful. I already see a bit of change. The product is very easy to use, taking only seconds to apply and in very small amount.  It has nice texture, smooth, very light smell and it soaked into my skin well, very moisturizing without being heavy or sticky, plus it&#x27;s not irritating my eyes.  I have oily skin, dark circles and brown spots.  This cream leaves my skin super soft and hydrated feel. It seems slightly lift and brighten my eyes.  I can say with confidence that it works even better than the high priced brand. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. This is just what I have been looking for. Great value &amp; very effective!!</li>
            <li> Silky, smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who as sensitive skin like myself.  All I can say is that this is a great product - it&#x27;s not too light nor too heavy.  It works great for me and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I was hanging around at Amazon looking  for natural creams. This product name caught my eyes. &amp;#34;Mingfinity Naturals&amp;#34; I like this name. And the price is reasonable so I decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;  Shipping is fast. I read ingredients right away when I got it. No Mineral Oil, No Petroleum ( Mary Kay, La Mer...  use those toxic,our skin can&#x27;t absorb ingredients) No Parabens ( a lot of big brands still use it). I was impressed compare to the price and good ingredients they use. (I am a big ingredients reader. i don&#x27;t follow the brands because during the years i realize we pay the brands name not ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;  I tried on the same day I got. It is easy to spread out around eye area. I&#x27;ve been using over a week and i totally love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it but I try it. Obviously it does work for decreasing some wrinkle after a couple of weeks. It looks like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!  I generally use very famous brand. Now I believe everything is possible not only from big brand. I would&lt;br /&gt;like to recommend to my friend. Tks for the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, but I am interested in &amp;#34;delaying&amp;#34; the effects of aging too! So my girlfriend and I are both using this moisturizer.  Her skin is very sensitive, so she is very particular about the kinds of creams and lotions she uses.  Applying creams around the eyelids you do NOT want to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the product.  You know what I mean, the heavy, &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; feeling that some creams and lotions leave on your skin.  Mingfinity&#x27;s eye cream goes on smooth and is so light and fresh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;We have both noticed the difference in the look and feel of this product with a smoother appearance to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy we chose Mingfinity Anti-aging eye cream!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my wife who is very particular in the types of creams and lotions she will use, especially on her face and around her eyes. In the short time she has had this product it has quickly become her favorite and she is constantly commenting on how good it feels when applying. The one thing in particular I have noticed is; prior to her using this product she was starting to develop just the slightest hint of dark circles under her eyes (don&#x27;t tell her I said that), but since she&#x27;s been using this product it has all but disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... she loves it so I will definitely be ordering this again</li>
            <li> My wife has been looking for a good and reasonable priced eye cream for her sensitive skin for a while. I found this one on Amazon and after reading the reviews I decided to get it for her.  She has been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now, and so far she likes it.  Her skin is definitely softer. I&#x27;ve also noticed that her skin looks younger. My wife tried many product before, but this one seems to agree with her sensitive skin with its natural and healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Well I was impressed with the reviews until I checked and saw that 8 out of 10 of the 5 star reviews I checked were all from people who had only one review!&lt;br /&gt;This often indicates some kind of quid pro quo arrangement where people get free product in exchange for a review, or sometimes it indicates the accounts are created just for the purchase of the review - which is either a review by the company itself or its employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I smell something fishy here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream almost a month now and see NO CHANGES in the lines under my eyes...will use it until I run out but will not be buying anymore!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> After using the Anti Aging Eye Cream for a week, twice a day, I actually see a difference! I know it will take longer on my left eye since that&#x27;s the side I sleep on. I have insomnia due to medications and have the eye cream has saved me from looking like the Walking Dead. Wonderful product! I will be stocking up!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have used--have been using for several weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight firming on my hooded eyes.  My dark circles have almost gone away as well.  Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Mingfinity. I have used the eye cream for 2 weeks, no allergenic reactions at all,  and I have definitely noticed skin around my eyes is smoother and hydrated! A great product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the feel and the smell of this eye cream. It&#x27;s soft, feels gentle and soothing. The cream goes on smoothly and makes my cute asian eyes feel &#x27;soft&#x27; around the edges. I don&#x27;t know if it helps with wrinkles, and I really don&#x27;t have any major fine lines at this point to tell if it&#x27;s helping with those either, but part of using an eye cream is prevention and I will l say that my eyes feel tighter... that is, the skin around my eyes feels tighter and firmer when using the cream. Definitely cuter!  That has to mean something as presentation is soo important today. Mostly, I like the softness and the feel of the skin around my eyes after using it. I also like the scent-with aloe in it, this eye cream has a soft, delicate scent that smells really good when using it. Some eye creams smell chemically and this one doesn&#x27;t.  My GF appreciates that it smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 5 stars but I&#x27;m really not convinced it helps remove existing wrinkles and it&#x27;s being sold as a wrinkle cream. I can&#x27;t see anything in the ingredients that really would prevent or remove wrinkles, but since I do feel firmer, healthier skin when I use it, perhaps that&#x27;s how it does it. Even so, I DO like the way my skin feels and the way it makes my eyes feel less tired when I use it, so it&#x27;s definitely a high-quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used an Olay eye cream that used to really make my skin feel tight and I felt it had some wrinkle-prevention effects to it. This eye cream does make my eyes feel tight like that, but not nearly as much. So I think it works for what it&#x27;s advertised to do, but not as harshly or as strongly as some more expensive creams. Again, however, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it--and more than that, did I mention is smells really good? LOL Well, it does. I love the way this eye cream smells. Light, delicate and clean. Mingfinity really is the best!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products over the years, but I haven&#x27;t written any reviews. I have decided to write a review for this product because I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and I am allergic to some products. I am afraid of getting a rash or wasting money every time I tried a new product, I am happy to report that I did not break out or get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all I love how this makes my skin feel - soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I received an email from them with details about the main ingredients and what they do which was very cool.</li>
            <li> My Co-worker suggested this eye cream, so I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. After using it for a few days, I have to say I love it. The ingredients are just right. I need oil, but not too much oil. I dont like breakouts, nor dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian and I have nice tanned skin. I dont get sunburn easily even though I go to the beach a lot. Living in California could be a blessing and a curse as skin damage caused by the sun is one of the issues I have to deal with everyday. Since my skin is oily in the T zone, I have to be careful when choosing any skin care product.</li>
            <li> Is a great eye product. Help ease some lines around my eyes and puffiness also.  Would. Uh again</li>
            <li> The cream is very moisturizing but I do not notice any difference in my physical appearance. I do not sleep well and always wake up with bags under my eyes. I have been using twice daily as suggested. Since I have started using the cream I have been told by several co-workers that I look more tired than usual. That tells me it&#x27;s not working. Three stars for being a good moisturizer but no luck with firming.</li>
