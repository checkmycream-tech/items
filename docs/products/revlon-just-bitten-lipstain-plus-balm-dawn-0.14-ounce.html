    <ol>
            <li>I have a nut brown complexion and it perfectly complements my look.</li>
            <li>sure what I&#x27;ll do when they run out of this!!!</li>
            <li>I find this to be a good dupe in quality and color for MF Lipfinity 190.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip color!</li>
            <li>I love this lip stain!</li>
            <li>You are better off just buying a long-lasting lipstick.</li>
            <li>3\14\15&#x3D; I still love this color &amp; I use it</li>
            <li>I like the &#x27;gloss&#x27; that goes on top.  </li>
            <li>(Read my review under that color for the &amp;#34;full story&amp;#34; :) Then, I thought I&#x27;d try this shade, the darkest one I have, as eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I have 2 of these and just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>This is perfect if u love a natural soft look that gives u an understated finished look.</li>
            <li>It reads as light brown on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lip stains but this one has been the most natural.  </li>
            <li>I have 7 different lip tints and this, by far, is the best color.</li>
            <li>Very nice lip stain, easy to apply and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This lipstain does not last more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Pretty color though.</li>
            <li>Received item on time and was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Great, long lasting, color.</li>
            <li>I loved the color, but it dried out in two days.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very comfortable to wear and is soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>However, this particular color was too dark for me, fair skin, light brown hair, blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again, and it got here super fast!!</li>
            <li>I have purchased a slew of shades and really like how the stain stays in place and doesn&#x27;t melt in this heat</li>
            <li>Very drying remember to reapply the balm often.</li>
            <li>What I really like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t settle in the creases.</li>
            <li>This is a very drying lip stain to my lips.  </li>
            <li>Natural Color - which is EXACTLY what i was seeking.</li>
            <li>I apply different lip glosses and colors on top 2 create different looks.</li>
            <li>I suggested to Revlon that they create a line of eyeshadow colors formulated like this product, but so far no go.</li>
            <li>I really I like to put it on actually under my lipstick</li>
            <li>The color was awesome but even with the balm my lips dried out bad.</li>
            <li>They stopped selling MF products in the US and they are so hard to find, and super pricey when you do find them.</li>

            <li> This color is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I wish someone would because I&#x27;d like a little color variety.</li>
            <li> It performs the function of a liner without the harsh artificial look of lip liner pencils.</li>
            <li> The weird thing is that I also like using it as eyeshadow.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lip stains but this one has been the most natural.  The stain last longer than others and does not build up.</li>
            <li> The colors are deceiving. This lipstain does not last more than 2 hours. Not worth your money. You are better off just buying a long-lasting lipstick.</li>
            <li> Did not last long on me. Pretty color though.</li>
            <li> This color is hard to find locally. It&#x27;s usually sold out when I do finally find it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased another one &amp; I&#x27;ll be buying more!!&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3\14\15&#x3D; I still love this color &amp; I use it all the time!!&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what I&#x27;ll do when they run out of this!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a slew of shades and really like how the stain stays in place and doesn&#x27;t melt in this heat</li>
            <li> Very drying remember to reapply the balm often.</li>

            <li> Received item on time and was exactly what I was expecting.  Great, long lasting, color.</li>
            <li> Very nice lip stain, easy to apply and long lasting.  I like the &#x27;gloss&#x27; that goes on top.  However, this particular color was too dark for me, fair skin, light brown hair, blue eyes.  I will order again in a different color.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my lips. It performs the function of a liner without the harsh artificial look of lip liner pencils. The weird thing is that I also like using it as eyeshadow. One day I tried the lighter shade, Instinct, on my brows. (Read my review under that color for the &amp;#34;full story&amp;#34; :) Then, I thought I&#x27;d try this shade, the darkest one I have, as eyeshadow. It reads as light brown on my eyes. What I really like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t settle in the creases. Powder shadow irritates my eyes and settles in the creases. Cream eyeshadow is less irritating but REALLY settles in the creases. This stuff is very comfortable to wear and is soft and natural looking. I suggested to Revlon that they create a line of eyeshadow colors formulated like this product, but so far no go. I wish someone would because I&#x27;d like a little color variety.</li>
            <li> This is a very drying lip stain to my lips.  The color was awesome but even with the balm my lips dried out bad.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if u love a natural soft look that gives u an understated finished look. I have a nut brown complexion and it perfectly complements my look.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip color! But, Revlon is discontinuing it so it can&#x27;t be bought in stores any longer. I hope they decide to bring it back to their line up.</li>
            <li> There are times where lip pencil just doesn&#x27;t do it and this lipstick plus gloss does this.  It goes on like gloss but stays on your lips.</li>
            <li> I used to use Max Factor lipfinity in 190 Indulgent. They stopped selling MF products in the US and they are so hard to find, and super pricey when you do find them. I find this to be a good dupe in quality and color for MF Lipfinity 190. Will definitely buy again, and it got here super fast!!</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain!</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these and just ordered 2 more. The color lasts and doesnt feather. I apply different lip glosses and colors on top 2 create different looks. I have 7 different lip tints and this, by far, is the best color. It&#x27;s brown NOT orangy.</li>
            <li> I loved the color, but it dried out in two days. sucked</li>
            <li> I really I like to put it on actually under my lipstick it helps it to last longer than it would without it. I also use it along with a light shimmer gloss for just a casual look.</li>
