    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has everything for the best price.</li>
            <li>me, this was an excellent purchase.</li>

            <li>Great Price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that we can whiten our teeth at home whenever we need a touchup!</li>
            <li>It works great for whitening teeth that are stained from soda ( in my case).</li>
            <li>It is a great gift (gave it to my mom for mother&#x27;s day).</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the product</li>

            <li>I bought this for my daughter and she loved it and got great results.</li>
            <li>One that I trust and have had good service from.  </li>
            <li>Good result.</li>
            <li>One good thing I will say about this product, and</li>
            <li>After 5 days, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it--in fact, I just about to use it right now.  </li>

            <li>and my teeth look so much better!</li>
            <li>Better than going to the dentist!</li>
            <li>However, I found the Glo easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>its amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing....</li>
            <li>so you are kind of &amp;#34;trapped&amp;#34; into completing the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;The power device held the charge</li>
            <li>and id rather stick to my own chapstick instead of the one included.</li>
            <li>Impressive and much cheaper and easier than the dentist</li>
            <li>Well, kind of.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect device for people with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>The best part is my teeth, gums and lips aren&#x27;t sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>I love this and find it to be incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li>I remember whitening strips being more effective with quicker results.</li>
            <li>If you see her, please be sure to tell your wife that you think my wife&#x27;s teeth look amazing.</li>
            <li>Does not hold battery charge for more then a couple days.</li>
            <li>The GLO teeth Whitening system worked better than I&#x27;d even hoped.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I think you will be pleased with the device.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Like a lot of reviews on here, I&#x27;ve also tried many bleaching products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most products on the market and from my dentist.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Just a note, though, make sure you apply the (included) lip treatment.  </li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the groduct.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this.</li>
            <li>Am using it on top up once every 2weeks and whitening is maintained.</li>
            <li>and I am still able to return it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I went for it.</li>
            <li>I used it for 6 consecutive days and got a really bright smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my results - my teeth are several shades whiter.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that it will work just as well as mine does.  </li>
            <li>so my teeth were already in pretty good shape</li>
            <li>My dentist sells this for $300 and the results are quick and amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this , easy to use and portable</li>
            <li>The trick to getting the best whitening is to put the gel on dry teeth and keep saliva + gums from rubbing it</li>
            <li>Love this thing - it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>After two days, you start getting more accurate.</li>
            <li>worked perfectly and does exactly what it says without making your teeth sensitive....</li>
            <li>Last year, I purchased the GLO Science Brilliant Teeth Whitening system from an Amazon seller.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear, easy to follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>You can easily get 5 - 6 generous uses out of one vial if you do it this way.  </li>
            <li>System is easy to use, but like anything else, takes a bit of practice.  </li>
            <li>Does a fairly good job, but not quite as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Great product def see major improvement.</li>
            <li>It was easy to fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li>I have had to use between three and four containers to accurately do the four applications each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Mouthpiece was comfortable.</li>
            <li>do like the heat and light mouthpiece</li>
            <li>Another great thing about it is that you can share the actual device.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this since it also uses light and product to do the whitening--just like my dentist.  </li>
            <li>The light goes off when the timer ends</li>
            <li>But over all a safe and fun way to lighten your teeth.  </li>
            <li>importantly, I have results.  </li>
            <li>Why easier to do using custom fit mouth trays and syringe.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I saw results - even after the first day!!</li>
            <li>I gave my original system to my cousin and bought myself this one...</li>
            <li>I also originally saw this product being displayed on one of the HSN shows and saw the demo&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Five days in my teeth look better than they have since I first started smoking.  </li>
            <li>for the original price of $199, you should got 10  g-vials whitening gel according to GLO science and Sephora.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the point of completing all 10 original treatments, as I have seen zero improvement after 8.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m on day 3 and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>I drink lots of coffee and red wine, so my teeth aren&#x27;t always bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine at first.</li>
            <li>I would recommend looking for a quick tutorial on YouTube if you want a frame of reference.  </li>
            <li>super* sleek looking- like an Ipod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no sensitivity while using the product, but I can&#x27;t really speak to the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that the product is good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>luckily I bought this a saphora</li>
            <li>Its fast and easy....</li>
            <li>loved this product for the first 8 treatments that I used it and could definitely notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I plan to use a different product with the mouthpiece to see if the effects are more positive and will report a follow-up review if it&#x27;s more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is why I gave two stars instead of one, is that I have experienced relatively little tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to complete each treatment</li>
            <li>and I can smile.  </li>
            <li>The staff raved about it, so I decided it might be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use Glo more frequently than the up</li>
            <li>Most of those comments were from reviews that were over a year old, so I don&#x27;t know if they have made improvements on the dispensers since, but I have not had any issues at all.  </li>
            <li>you can see the difference and it doesn&#x27;t make you teeth sensitive :)</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep any stray gel from damaging your lips but it makes it easier to get your lips around the mouthpiece (a kind of lube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions did say to use it for about a week straight so perhaps that&#x27;s when it would yield the best results, but so far, I&#x27;m not really liking this product.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall, the device worked as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t see it as being significantly more effective than something like Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li>I have used this one a few times successfully (all 4 cycles)</li>
            <li>It warms very gently but seals well.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were, thanks to four years of smoking, still a bit yellow despite my best previous whitening efforts (including strips, trays, pastes, paste additives, and gum)</li>
            <li>The first set of G-vials - the thing that contains the whitening agent - exploded inside the package.</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>My boyfriend got so interested in it that I got him a mouth piece</li>
            <li>I got a whitening kit from my dentist and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The whitening starts after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Be aware, there is no satisfaction guarantee for this product.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that the majority of Amazon sellers are not authorized by GLO Science to sell their products.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really asess it&#x27;s abilities to whitten my teeth!</li>
            <li>However, the 32 minute time investment isn&#x27;t too onerous, particularly when you quickly see an effect.  </li>
            <li>The GLO product is so much better because it takes only 30 minutes, once a day for 5 days.</li>
            <li>I am also going to put vaseline on the part of the mouthpiece that comes in contact with my upper lip and hope that will make this experiment more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>A cosmetic dentist in my hometown recently recommended the GLO Science Teeth Whitening Device and said his patients had very good results with little or no discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Each packet is good for four 8-minute sessions which are recommended to be done back to back.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t preform as well as whitening strips and wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as what I have gotten at my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The trey doesn&#x27;t fit well to the mouth and is sloppy.</li>
            <li>First off I should start out by saying that I am very conscious about my teeth, to the point where you could call me \\&quot;smile</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and the kit is the only way to go.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are super sensitive and I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate the whitening strips, trays or toothpastes.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and do work by lightening several shades.  </li>
            <li>I often found that the device wouldnt hold a strong enough charge for all 4 applications</li>
            <li>so I have seen a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I could give the product a great review because I actually do believe using GLO has made my teeth a few shades whiter.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really works on my teeth, even I stopped using it for months.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>haha).</li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter and brighter.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I took them back to the dentist and was told this is an issue with the glue used to secure the cap on the tube during manufacturing and is a known issue.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and i really hope it works for me.</li>
            <li>i really wanna have a shining smile.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that this device would be a much easier whitening system than strips</li>
            <li>The Glo comes in luxury packaging much like an iPhone or iPod making opening it an experience.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>but the blue glowing light would keep going out.  </li>
            <li>Bought the glow kit through sephora and it worked straight out the box.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference before vs after.</li>
            <li>If you are set on investing money into this product, you are much better off protecting your investment by purchasing it directly from the GLO Science website for the same price as sold by Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li>each gel capsule holds four (or more, I can usually get five) treatments, so you get more than it appears for your money with the actual gels.</li>
            <li>The second one arrived 15% full.</li>
            <li>First of all I had this done professionally at a dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for only 3 days now and the results are what I would see after a full 2 weeks of whitestrips.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I believe the GLO Science Brilliant system is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li>First, I was surprised to learn that it had to be used four times a day.  </li>
            <li>The sides of my teeth now have white streaks which make the rest of the teeth look even more yellow than before.  </li>
            <li>Which is the main reason I decided to spend the money on Glo, it doesn&#x27;t strip the enamel off your teeth &amp; therefore there is no sensitivity/pain</li>
            <li>I had my teeth professionally whitened at my dentist eleven years ago, where I sat in the chair with the blue light device on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The first one simply wouldn&#x27;t stay on from the first use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The gel is very thick, which is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Gel applicator/brush was kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>my teeth are not like they were when I was young, but the device worked really well on tea and coffee stains.  </li>
            <li>My upper lip was really sore, until I learned to apply the salve more carefully.  </li>
            <li>This was a fun present for the kids that have everything.</li>
            <li>The only nice thing about GLO versus whitening strips was that there was less sensitivity to my teeth after use.</li>
            <li>I am reentering the workforce and am self-conscious about my smile, so I will complete the remaining five treatments (I have taken two days off to allow my lip to heal as much as possible) in the hopes that perhaps my teeth just need a little more work before they show improvement.  </li>
            <li>I used as instructed and saw little to no color change in my teeth; they remain a more natural looking cream shade.</li>
            <li>I noticed and asked about the Glo system, which was a new offering at the practice.</li>
            <li>mouthpiece itself is relatively comfortable and easy to keep in without feeling the need to clamp down the entire time (which hurts, especially after 32 minutes).  </li>
            <li>The initial investment is worth it completely because you can use it over and over again and just buy new gel vials.</li>
            <li>So, against my better judgement I just purchased a new remote only from an Amazon seller for $79.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced if the blue light actually does anything.  </li>
            <li>but today the blue light went out on the third cycle and the mouthpiece also kept pulling away from the hand held GLO device as well.  </li>
            <li>I also have VERY sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>There is very little discomfort - just be sure to use lots of lip and gum protection either with the gel included with the device, or you can use Vaseline or lots of Chapstick</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the gels last a long time​</li>
            <li>But... the crazy bright blue light toasts your gums and lips in the process.  </li>
            <li>You first use the product for every day for up to ten days.</li>
            <li>What would my teeth be like at 80 years old then?!  </li>
            <li>I used this for 3 days straight and barely saw any changes to my teeth.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li>So if your teeth are already super white you may not see an enormous difference.  </li>
            <li>It comes with 10 little packets of 8.5% hydrogen perioxide which you need to apply to your teeth and then activate with the attached light.  </li>
            <li>Sure it may actually make your teeth a little whiter.  </li>
            <li>My teeth went from dull yellow to bright white.</li>
            <li>I bought this in late April and it completely stopped being able to charge in June.</li>
            <li>Keep unused portions in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer as these gels are getting more expensive by the month to refill.</li>
            <li>initially purchased it at Sephora (the no sensitivity, but in-office results really got me).</li>
            <li>At the age of 70 plus, this device has whitened my teeth considerably.  </li>
            <li>All of them made my teeth SO SENSITIVE that just smiling sometimes would give me shooting pains.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are ultra sensitive and i cannot use the crest strips even for a minute without pain.  </li>
            <li>(I have had them done professionally, so I know my teeth can get lighter.)  </li>
            <li>I bought the device via Amazon and have used five of the whitening gel packets so far.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone- especially those who have had problems with sensitivity</li>
            <li>I have had none so far with this</li>
            <li>I had my teeth professionally whitened about 5 years ago</li>
            <li>Reviews aren&#x27;t allowed to discuss price, but I purchased this elsewhere and paid nearly twice what the price is on amazon.  </li>
            <li>They do really work, you can have paper white teeth in a week or so.</li>
            <li>, you will see very noticeable results after the third day.</li>
            <li>the user manual recommends &amp; it not only works great, but I have no sensitivity or other negative side effects.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product from my dentist at a higher cost than here on Amazon (the refills are also more expensive through the dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are married/live with someone you can also buy an additional mouth piece (or even use the same one if it doesn&#x27;t gross you out) and really get a bang for your buck!  </li>
            <li>My dentist offers free bleaching for life, but I couldn&#x27;t work up any enthusiasm for trays (mess, sensitivity) and after the in-office treatment that left me with blisters on my gums from the bleach,I won&#x27;t ever do that again.</li>
            <li>In addition,there is simply not enough gel in each capsule to apply the product four times, plain and simple (as many others noted here).</li>
            <li>there are other products that work much better and are less money</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with the whole procedure was not using enough of the salve on the inside of my lips.  </li>
            <li>The initial cost is really the only major expense.  </li>
            <li>Saving an open packet isn&#x27;t recommended and I did notice the clear gel begins to yellow if left open for hours, so it probably is important to use each packet in a single session.  </li>
            <li>had a little trouble gauging how much bleach to dispense the first 2 days and didn&#x27;t have enough in the first 2 tubes for the 4th treatment of the sessions.</li>
            <li>the light should turn blue and it&#x27;s just dead!</li>
            <li>It does caveat that it can only whiten you teeth to the whitest they NATURALLY can get-</li>
            <li>Definitely am a sensitive tooth person and this product proved to be for such a person .</li>
            <li>do admit that this product did whiten my teeth and has enough gel for 2 complete whitening sessions but</li>
            <li>(The remaining bit of yellow is old composite filling that can&#x27;t be bleached, but my dentist is going to restore it.)</li>
            <li>A majority of the hefty cost is paying for elaborate packaging and completely unnecessary accessories.</li>
            <li>So while I am very conscious about my oral healthcare and don&#x27;t have stained teeth, they definitely were not \\&quot;pearly\\&quot; white either.  </li>
            <li>Over all, this product turned out to be a huge waste of time, a huge waste of money and a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>Only my second day but can already see the difference and my teeth aren&#x27;t getting sensitive yet.  </li>
            <li>After the first few times, I got my method dialed in.  </li>
            <li>To give some background;  I smoke regularly (which I hate to say) and also love my strong Spanish coffee with the consistency of maple syrup, daily.  </li>
            <li>Well, the new GLO Science remote arrived today.  </li>
            <li>There was a slight tingly and stingy sensation that really bugged me.</li>
            <li>GLO Science does not sell the remote only-just an entire new system for another $199.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loved it and got great results.</li>
            <li> One that I trust and have had good service from.  </li>
            <li> Good result.</li>
            <li> One good thing I will say about this product, and</li>
            <li> After 5 days, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it--in fact, I just about to use it right now.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and my teeth look so much better!</li>
            <li> Better than going to the dentist!</li>
            <li> However, I found the Glo easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> its amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing....</li>
            <li> so you are kind of &amp;#34;trapped&amp;#34; into completing the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;The power device held the charge</li>
            <li> and id rather stick to my own chapstick instead of the one included.</li>
            <li> Impressive and much cheaper and easier than the dentist</li>
            <li> Well, kind of.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect device for people with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> The best part is my teeth, gums and lips aren&#x27;t sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> I love this and find it to be incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li> I remember whitening strips being more effective with quicker results.</li>
            <li> If you see her, please be sure to tell your wife that you think my wife&#x27;s teeth look amazing.</li>
            <li> Does not hold battery charge for more then a couple days.</li>
            <li> The GLO teeth Whitening system worked better than I&#x27;d even hoped.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I think you will be pleased with the device.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Like a lot of reviews on here, I&#x27;ve also tried many bleaching products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most products on the market and from my dentist.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Just a note, though, make sure you apply the (included) lip treatment.  </li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the groduct.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this.</li>
            <li> Am using it on top up once every 2weeks and whitening is maintained.</li>
            <li> and I am still able to return it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I went for it.</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 consecutive days and got a really bright smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my results - my teeth are several shades whiter.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that it will work just as well as mine does.  </li>
            <li> so my teeth were already in pretty good shape</li>
            <li> My dentist sells this for $300 and the results are quick and amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this , easy to use and portable</li>
            <li> The trick to getting the best whitening is to put the gel on dry teeth and keep saliva + gums from rubbing it</li>
            <li> Love this thing - it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> After two days, you start getting more accurate.</li>
            <li> worked perfectly and does exactly what it says without making your teeth sensitive....</li>
            <li> Last year, I purchased the GLO Science Brilliant Teeth Whitening system from an Amazon seller.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear, easy to follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> You can easily get 5 - 6 generous uses out of one vial if you do it this way.  </li>
            <li> System is easy to use, but like anything else, takes a bit of practice.  </li>
            <li> Does a fairly good job, but not quite as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product def see major improvement.</li>
            <li> It was easy to fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li> I have had to use between three and four containers to accurately do the four applications each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Mouthpiece was comfortable.</li>
            <li> do like the heat and light mouthpiece</li>
            <li> Another great thing about it is that you can share the actual device.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this since it also uses light and product to do the whitening--just like my dentist.  </li>
            <li> The light goes off when the timer ends</li>
            <li> But over all a safe and fun way to lighten your teeth.  </li>
            <li> importantly, I have results.  </li>
            <li> Why easier to do using custom fit mouth trays and syringe.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I saw results - even after the first day!!</li>
            <li> I gave my original system to my cousin and bought myself this one...</li>
            <li> I also originally saw this product being displayed on one of the HSN shows and saw the demo&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Five days in my teeth look better than they have since I first started smoking.  </li>
            <li> for the original price of $199, you should got 10  g-vials whitening gel according to GLO science and Sephora.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the point of completing all 10 original treatments, as I have seen zero improvement after 8.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m on day 3 and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> I drink lots of coffee and red wine, so my teeth aren&#x27;t always bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine at first.</li>
            <li> I would recommend looking for a quick tutorial on YouTube if you want a frame of reference.  </li>
            <li> super* sleek looking- like an Ipod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no sensitivity while using the product, but I can&#x27;t really speak to the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that the product is good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> luckily I bought this a saphora</li>
            <li> Its fast and easy....</li>
            <li> loved this product for the first 8 treatments that I used it and could definitely notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use a different product with the mouthpiece to see if the effects are more positive and will report a follow-up review if it&#x27;s more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is why I gave two stars instead of one, is that I have experienced relatively little tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to complete each treatment</li>
            <li> and I can smile.  </li>
            <li> The staff raved about it, so I decided it might be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use Glo more frequently than the up</li>
            <li> Most of those comments were from reviews that were over a year old, so I don&#x27;t know if they have made improvements on the dispensers since, but I have not had any issues at all.  </li>
            <li> you can see the difference and it doesn&#x27;t make you teeth sensitive :)</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep any stray gel from damaging your lips but it makes it easier to get your lips around the mouthpiece (a kind of lube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions did say to use it for about a week straight so perhaps that&#x27;s when it would yield the best results, but so far, I&#x27;m not really liking this product.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Overall, the device worked as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t see it as being significantly more effective than something like Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> I have used this one a few times successfully (all 4 cycles)</li>
            <li> It warms very gently but seals well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were, thanks to four years of smoking, still a bit yellow despite my best previous whitening efforts (including strips, trays, pastes, paste additives, and gum)</li>
            <li> The first set of G-vials - the thing that contains the whitening agent - exploded inside the package.</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got so interested in it that I got him a mouth piece</li>
            <li> I got a whitening kit from my dentist and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The whitening starts after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Be aware, there is no satisfaction guarantee for this product.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that the majority of Amazon sellers are not authorized by GLO Science to sell their products.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really asess it&#x27;s abilities to whitten my teeth!</li>
            <li> However, the 32 minute time investment isn&#x27;t too onerous, particularly when you quickly see an effect.  </li>
            <li> The GLO product is so much better because it takes only 30 minutes, once a day for 5 days.</li>
            <li> I am also going to put vaseline on the part of the mouthpiece that comes in contact with my upper lip and hope that will make this experiment more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> A cosmetic dentist in my hometown recently recommended the GLO Science Teeth Whitening Device and said his patients had very good results with little or no discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Each packet is good for four 8-minute sessions which are recommended to be done back to back.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t preform as well as whitening strips and wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as what I have gotten at my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The trey doesn&#x27;t fit well to the mouth and is sloppy.</li>
            <li> First off I should start out by saying that I am very conscious about my teeth, to the point where you could call me \\&quot;smile</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and the kit is the only way to go.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive and I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate the whitening strips, trays or toothpastes.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and do work by lightening several shades.  </li>
            <li> I often found that the device wouldnt hold a strong enough charge for all 4 applications</li>
            <li> so I have seen a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could give the product a great review because I actually do believe using GLO has made my teeth a few shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really works on my teeth, even I stopped using it for months.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> haha).</li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter and brighter.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I took them back to the dentist and was told this is an issue with the glue used to secure the cap on the tube during manufacturing and is a known issue.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and i really hope it works for me.</li>
            <li> i really wanna have a shining smile.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this device would be a much easier whitening system than strips</li>
            <li> The Glo comes in luxury packaging much like an iPhone or iPod making opening it an experience.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> but the blue glowing light would keep going out.  </li>
            <li> Bought the glow kit through sephora and it worked straight out the box.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference before vs after.</li>
            <li> If you are set on investing money into this product, you are much better off protecting your investment by purchasing it directly from the GLO Science website for the same price as sold by Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> each gel capsule holds four (or more, I can usually get five) treatments, so you get more than it appears for your money with the actual gels.</li>
            <li> The second one arrived 15% full.</li>
            <li> First of all I had this done professionally at a dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only 3 days now and the results are what I would see after a full 2 weeks of whitestrips.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I believe the GLO Science Brilliant system is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> First, I was surprised to learn that it had to be used four times a day.  </li>
            <li> The sides of my teeth now have white streaks which make the rest of the teeth look even more yellow than before.  </li>
            <li> Which is the main reason I decided to spend the money on Glo, it doesn&#x27;t strip the enamel off your teeth &amp; therefore there is no sensitivity/pain</li>
            <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened at my dentist eleven years ago, where I sat in the chair with the blue light device on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The first one simply wouldn&#x27;t stay on from the first use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The gel is very thick, which is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Gel applicator/brush was kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> my teeth are not like they were when I was young, but the device worked really well on tea and coffee stains.  </li>
            <li> My upper lip was really sore, until I learned to apply the salve more carefully.  </li>
            <li> This was a fun present for the kids that have everything.</li>
            <li> The only nice thing about GLO versus whitening strips was that there was less sensitivity to my teeth after use.</li>
            <li> I am reentering the workforce and am self-conscious about my smile, so I will complete the remaining five treatments (I have taken two days off to allow my lip to heal as much as possible) in the hopes that perhaps my teeth just need a little more work before they show improvement.  </li>
            <li> I used as instructed and saw little to no color change in my teeth; they remain a more natural looking cream shade.</li>
            <li> I noticed and asked about the Glo system, which was a new offering at the practice.</li>
            <li> mouthpiece itself is relatively comfortable and easy to keep in without feeling the need to clamp down the entire time (which hurts, especially after 32 minutes).  </li>
            <li> The initial investment is worth it completely because you can use it over and over again and just buy new gel vials.</li>
            <li> So, against my better judgement I just purchased a new remote only from an Amazon seller for $79.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced if the blue light actually does anything.  </li>
            <li> but today the blue light went out on the third cycle and the mouthpiece also kept pulling away from the hand held GLO device as well.  </li>
            <li> I also have VERY sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> There is very little discomfort - just be sure to use lots of lip and gum protection either with the gel included with the device, or you can use Vaseline or lots of Chapstick</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the gels last a long time​</li>
            <li> But... the crazy bright blue light toasts your gums and lips in the process.  </li>
            <li> You first use the product for every day for up to ten days.</li>
            <li> What would my teeth be like at 80 years old then?!  </li>
            <li> I used this for 3 days straight and barely saw any changes to my teeth.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li> So if your teeth are already super white you may not see an enormous difference.  </li>
            <li> It comes with 10 little packets of 8.5% hydrogen perioxide which you need to apply to your teeth and then activate with the attached light.  </li>
            <li> Sure it may actually make your teeth a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> My teeth went from dull yellow to bright white.</li>
            <li> I bought this in late April and it completely stopped being able to charge in June.</li>
            <li> Keep unused portions in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer as these gels are getting more expensive by the month to refill.</li>
            <li> initially purchased it at Sephora (the no sensitivity, but in-office results really got me).</li>
            <li> At the age of 70 plus, this device has whitened my teeth considerably.  </li>
            <li> All of them made my teeth SO SENSITIVE that just smiling sometimes would give me shooting pains.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are ultra sensitive and i cannot use the crest strips even for a minute without pain.  </li>
            <li> (I have had them done professionally, so I know my teeth can get lighter.)  </li>
            <li> I bought the device via Amazon and have used five of the whitening gel packets so far.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone- especially those who have had problems with sensitivity</li>
            <li> I have had none so far with this</li>
            <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened about 5 years ago</li>
            <li> Reviews aren&#x27;t allowed to discuss price, but I purchased this elsewhere and paid nearly twice what the price is on amazon.  </li>
            <li> They do really work, you can have paper white teeth in a week or so.</li>
            <li> , you will see very noticeable results after the third day.</li>
            <li> the user manual recommends &amp; it not only works great, but I have no sensitivity or other negative side effects.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product from my dentist at a higher cost than here on Amazon (the refills are also more expensive through the dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are married/live with someone you can also buy an additional mouth piece (or even use the same one if it doesn&#x27;t gross you out) and really get a bang for your buck!  </li>
            <li> My dentist offers free bleaching for life, but I couldn&#x27;t work up any enthusiasm for trays (mess, sensitivity) and after the in-office treatment that left me with blisters on my gums from the bleach,I won&#x27;t ever do that again.</li>
            <li> In addition,there is simply not enough gel in each capsule to apply the product four times, plain and simple (as many others noted here).</li>
            <li> there are other products that work much better and are less money</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the whole procedure was not using enough of the salve on the inside of my lips.  </li>
            <li> The initial cost is really the only major expense.  </li>
            <li> Saving an open packet isn&#x27;t recommended and I did notice the clear gel begins to yellow if left open for hours, so it probably is important to use each packet in a single session.  </li>
            <li> had a little trouble gauging how much bleach to dispense the first 2 days and didn&#x27;t have enough in the first 2 tubes for the 4th treatment of the sessions.</li>
            <li> the light should turn blue and it&#x27;s just dead!</li>
            <li> It does caveat that it can only whiten you teeth to the whitest they NATURALLY can get-</li>
            <li> Definitely am a sensitive tooth person and this product proved to be for such a person .</li>
            <li> do admit that this product did whiten my teeth and has enough gel for 2 complete whitening sessions but</li>
            <li> (The remaining bit of yellow is old composite filling that can&#x27;t be bleached, but my dentist is going to restore it.)</li>
            <li> A majority of the hefty cost is paying for elaborate packaging and completely unnecessary accessories.</li>
            <li> So while I am very conscious about my oral healthcare and don&#x27;t have stained teeth, they definitely were not \\&quot;pearly\\&quot; white either.  </li>
            <li> Over all, this product turned out to be a huge waste of time, a huge waste of money and a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Only my second day but can already see the difference and my teeth aren&#x27;t getting sensitive yet.  </li>
            <li> After the first few times, I got my method dialed in.  </li>
            <li> To give some background;  I smoke regularly (which I hate to say) and also love my strong Spanish coffee with the consistency of maple syrup, daily.  </li>
            <li> Well, the new GLO Science remote arrived today.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight tingly and stingy sensation that really bugged me.</li>
            <li> GLO Science does not sell the remote only-just an entire new system for another $199.  </li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical, since most of the other products I had tried really didn&#x27;t work for me and this one clearly tries to impress with its packaging.  </li>
            <li> I knew that Amazon&#x27;s return policy would at least cover me for the first 30 days after purchase.  </li>
            <li> pretty pissed to say the least that i sent $300 on a product that just broke for what appears to be no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> I have had this product about a week, long enough to provide a descriptive review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It snapped out of the tub easily, but it was difficult to know if you are using 1/4 of the material for each 8 minute treatment or if you were getting an even application over your teeth.</li>
            <li> Personally, I always have INCREDIBLE sensitivity after any whitening treatment, to the point where it&#x27;s miserable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having done bleaching in the past (trays, whitening strips and also an in-office session years ago) with less than exciting results, I have arrived at the point where I am looking into veneers.</li>
            <li> I saw a subtle difference after the first time.  </li>
            <li> Common sense, really.  </li>
            <li> Strips have never worked for me and they actually scare me a bit because I have a friend who was using Crest whitestrips and fell asleep with them on and now all of the nerves in her teeth are completely messed up and she cannot eat anything too hot or too cold (it has been SUCH a fiasco for her).</li>
            <li> and then I swear breathing hurt my teeth for a long time afterwards</li>
            <li> product arrived earlier then expected.  </li>
            <li> There was minimal tooth sensitivity, something I really had trouble with, when using other whitening products.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of treatments, the back of my upper lip was starting to feel sore, and by the fifth day it was burning, raw and puffy.  </li>
            <li> I personally, pull my lips aside with one hand and use the other hand to apply the gel.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth have to be dry so that the gel sticks to the tooth.</li>
            <li> I wish I believed in other ratings and not waste my money on such a pointless product, did not see any results .</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the syringes of gel that you put in a tray and keep in your mouth several hours (purchased from my dentist), but I found that inconvenient and didn&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li> Had custom trays made at my dentists office &amp; tried several different brands of bleaching gels that I purchased at my dentist&#x27;s office over the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> BTW, just cut the vial open, remove the silly plastic brush without squeezing any gel into it at all and use a cotton swab to gently brush the gel onto your (preferably) dry teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to say if this product is any good, but you should probably buy it direct from the manufacturer so you may have some recourse if you receive a useless product.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use traditional whitening products because I have hypersensitive teeth, and I am certain that those with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; teeth would experience no discomfort with this product at all.  </li>
            <li> I carry a tooth brush in my purse and brush my teeth throughout the day to make sure I&#x27;m not \\&quot;that girl\\&quot; with the bad breath.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the gel refills turn yellow.</li>
            <li> , it has worked as expected for me.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz - a big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The whitening gel that you then purchase is really minimal</li>
            <li> You must also register both the remote and mouth piece separately on the GLO Science website.  </li>
            <li> When I attempted to use my GLO Science system for the third time, it was dead.  </li>
            <li> Just another defective GLO Science remote which I&#x27;m returning tomorrow.</li>
            <li> works great&lt;br /&gt;need to be careful with lips, put on cream so you do not damage them</li>
            <li> I wish I had known I could have bought it here, but I&#x27;m not really too upset since it worked for me.  </li>
            <li> If tooth is wet, the gel slides off the tooth hence no whitening.</li>
            <li> I have called Sephora and they don&#x27;t seem to want to take it back because it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve bought it</li>
            <li> I ordered this system and carefully read all the instructions etc.  </li>
            <li> I completed treatments for five consecutive days, with no positive results.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit cold feeling when I first apply them to my teeth but other than that it&#x27;s totally comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> problems doing other activities, however, every 8-minutes you do have to re-apply</li>
            <li> to gauge correct amount of bleach per treatment out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;Harsh on the lips - don&#x27;t forget to use included lip cream (or some other barrier, like chapstick)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth were never really any whiter!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of other things I wanted to point out.  1.</li>
            <li> The process was excruciating due to the pain and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> My issue with the other products that I had tried was never sensitivity, but rather they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Please do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this rip-off.</li>
            <li> One complaint is if you use the the machine once a month you will have to charge it when you use it even if you had battery the last time you used it.</li>
            <li> Apparently you had to compromise having white teeth for unhealthy teeth!  </li>
            <li> I would press the center button and after a few seconds it would go out.  </li>
            <li> but I felt ridiculous when I had to explain to the person I was talking to why I just reacted like a bee stung me in the middle of a conversation.  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the individual gel containers being difficult to open &amp; paint on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Approximately, nine months after my initial purchase I spent an additional $135 on boxes of whitening gel, lip balm, and a mouth piece for my husband.  </li>
            <li> The custom applicator is more difficult to use and difficult to get out all of the gel.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel comes in very oddly shaped and hard to open capsules.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used several of the very expensive vials (about $40 - $50 for new vials after you use your set that&#x27;s included).  </li>
            <li> I never had any issues with zingers, but my gums did feel a bit raw (temporarily) due to contact with the gel.  </li>
            <li> this can be a little bit of a hassle</li>
            <li> I will put the little iPod looking dock around my neck, paint the gel on my teeth, pop the tray in and start the 8 minute whitening, then proceed to do the dishes, laundry, play on the computer, etc.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect the world, just a little help.  </li>
            <li> it is a little tanning bed for your gums and lips.  </li>
            <li> Each applicator must be cut open to get the amount needed to complete the four back-to-back treatments required each day, and it is impossible to not get any of the goopy stuff on your gums, lips and tongue.  </li>
            <li> The charging dock is completely useless since the device can be charged directly into the wall</li>
            <li> gel is messy to deal with and pricey to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Results were marginal:</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, your lips will get a raw, dehydrated feeling.</li>
            <li> The at home trays are uncomfortable and really messy (the product always gets all over my mouth and onto my gums and The biggest problem for me however, was the immense pain (zingers aaah)</li>
            <li> Hard to apply to bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> The mouthpiece doesn&#x27;t sit tight against the teeth, so difficult to coat your uppers + lowers while keeping the teeth dry.</li>
            <li> Disappointed i paid so much for this product that doesnt work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and wanted to wait awhile before I posted a review in case there were any negative changes, equipment failures, etc.</li>
            <li> and I have NOTHING NEGATIVE to say at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;d mean a lot to us.)</li>
            <li> Furthermore, all of this has been incredibly expensive and clearly not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth hurt and was not what I expected .... did not whiten ...... very disappointed with the product nothing like all the hype on the Talk ...... as far as I am concerned .....</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than what my dentist charges for one in-office whitening</li>
            <li> The application of the whitening gel is messy and difficult.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re thinking this will get your teeth that dentist bleached white look please prepare to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yes they have some dumb chapstick you use</li>
            <li> 100% worse than they were before.  </li>
            <li> The in-office whitening was the absolute worst for me and the pain</li>
            <li> of my bleach tubes were discolored (yellow) at the base of the brush (not the gel itself).</li>
            <li> I also go to the dentist twice a year for cleanings to try to counter the effects of my unhealthy habits.  </li>
            <li> I imagine it won&#x27;t work for everybody, but I had come to suspect all these products were a rip-off since the others didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> false advertising ......waste of  money ...</li>
            <li> Buy it if you want an effortless way to whiten teeth with immediate and dramatic results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and obviously poorly made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a whitening obsessed person.</li>
            <li> but i was sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> : Cost, difficult to use.</li>
            <li> gel containers are very difficult to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a whitening system you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The results were horrific.  </li>
            <li> That scared the crap out of me!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use Crest whitestrips because they zing my gums and cause terrible bolts of pain.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My kit only came with lip balm and charger! No gels, mouthpiece, or the iPod looking thing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m on day 3 and the difference is amazing. The best part is my teeth, gums and lips aren&#x27;t sensitive at all. The lip balm helps!</li>
            <li> This works.  Buy it if you want an effortless way to whiten teeth with immediate and dramatic results.</li>
            <li> The first set of G-vials - the thing that contains the whitening agent - exploded inside the package. The second one arrived 15% full. It&#x27;s impossible to say if this product is any good, but you should probably buy it direct from the manufacturer so you may have some recourse if you receive a useless product.</li>
            <li> Overall, the device worked as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t see it as being significantly more effective than something like Crest White Strips. The big benefit seems to be 3-5 days versus 7-10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear, easy to follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;No teeth sensitivity after use&lt;br /&gt;Mouthpiece was comfortable. Pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;No problems doing other activities, however, every 8-minutes you do have to re-apply so you are kind of &amp;#34;trapped&amp;#34; into completing the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;The power device held the charge and I was able to complete each treatment easily.&lt;br /&gt;It worked. My teeth were whiter after 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Gel applicator/brush was kind of hard to use. It snapped out of the tub easily, but it was difficult to know if you are using 1/4 of the material for each 8 minute treatment or if you were getting an even application over your teeth. After two days, you start getting more accurate. Hard to apply to bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Can be a bit messy. After each 8-minute treatment, there is a lot of saliva/gel mixture to spit out.&lt;br /&gt;You definitely have to use the supplied lip balm. If you don&#x27;t, your lips will get a raw, dehydrated feeling.</li>
            <li> First of all I had this done professionally at a dentist&#x27;s office.  One that I trust and have had good service from.  The results were horrific.  100% worse than they were before.  I followed the after treatment instructions to the letter and I had never had any whitening done before.  The sides of my teeth now have white streaks which make the rest of the teeth look even more yellow than before.  It looks like I have a mouthful of coconut all the time. Please do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this rip-off.</li>
            <li> I have had this product about a week, long enough to provide a descriptive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel containers are very difficult to squeeze out. In addition,there is simply not enough gel in each capsule to apply the product four times, plain and simple (as many others noted here). I have had to use between three and four containers to accurately do the four applications each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the heat and light mouthpiece, it has worked as expected for me. I plan to use a different product with the mouthpiece to see if the effects are more positive and will report a follow-up review if it&#x27;s more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works great for whitening teeth that are stained from soda ( in my case). My only complaint is the gel refills turn yellow. You first use the product for every day for up to ten days. Each treatment is done in 8 minute sessions. So you must reapply gel three times in each treatment this can be a little bit of a hassle but it works. Then every month use one vial for maintenance. Store vials in the fridge. The vials will start to turn yellow but this does not affect the efficiency of the product. I called the company to verify this statement. Also if you don&#x27;t want to buy online I have seen this product at Sephora. If you sign up your email once a year they send you a 15% off coupon. I used this coupon to buy the refill vials for about 35.00. One complaint is if you use the the machine once a month you will have to charge it when you use it even if you had battery the last time you used it. Does not hold battery charge for more then a couple days.</li>
            <li> I bought this in late April and it completely stopped being able to charge in June. I gave my original system to my cousin and bought myself this one... I can&#x27;t believe how it stopped working already!  the light should turn blue and it&#x27;s just dead!</li>
            <li> It really works on my teeth, even I stopped using it for months.</li>
            <li> First off I should start out by saying that I am very conscious about my teeth, to the point where you could call me \\&quot;smile obsessed.\\&quot; I have tried a lot of whitening products - in-office whitening, at home custom trays, strips, you name it I&#x27;ve tried it. I also have VERY sensitive teeth. Strips have never worked for me and they actually scare me a bit because I have a friend who was using Crest whitestrips and fell asleep with them on and now all of the nerves in her teeth are completely messed up and she cannot eat anything too hot or too cold (it has been SUCH a fiasco for her). The at home trays are uncomfortable and really messy (the product always gets all over my mouth and onto my gums and The biggest problem for me however, was the immense pain (zingers aaah) I would get from these trays and the gum irritation. The in-office whitening was the absolute worst for me and the pain I would get I couldn&#x27;t endure (I actually had to stop mid-visit because I couldn&#x27;t handle the zingers haha and then I swear breathing hurt my teeth for a long time afterwards haha). Furthermore, all of this has been incredibly expensive and clearly not worth the expense. And then I found Glo.&lt;br /&gt;I initially purchased it at Sephora (the no sensitivity, but in-office results really got me). So I went home that day and used the device and to my luck there was NO sensitivity. I used it as directed for five consecutive days (4 8-minute applications and each day I saw results - even after the first day!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the device and I am even happier that I can use it again when I feel my teeth need it. The initial investment is worth it completely because you can use it over and over again and just buy new gel vials. It is less expensive than what my dentist charges for one in-office whitening and you get countless whitenings! Another great thing about it is that you can share the actual device. My boyfriend got so interested in it that I got him a mouth piece and how he shares it with me! It is a great gift (gave it to my mom for mother&#x27;s day). I am so happy with the product and I truly recommend it.es it with me! It is a great gift (gave it to my mom for mother&#x27;s day). I am so happy with the product and I truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The GLO teeth Whitening system worked better than I&#x27;d even hoped.  The instructions were easy to follow.  There was minimal tooth sensitivity, something I really had trouble with, when using other whitening products.  I&#x27;m 60, so my teeth are not like they were when I was young, but the device worked really well on tea and coffee stains.  My teeth are much whiter and brighter.  I use the device for one 8-minute period every week to maintain the whiteness.  The only problem I had with the whole procedure was not using enough of the salve on the inside of my lips.  My upper lip was really sore, until I learned to apply the salve more carefully.  I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I drink lots of coffee and red wine, so my teeth aren&#x27;t always bright and shiny.  I got a whitening kit from my dentist and it worked pretty well.  I let the dentist do it once in the office and it was great--except of course for the cost!  I decided to try this since it also uses light and product to do the whitening--just like my dentist.  I am very impressed with how effective this product is and how well it works.  One use and you have paid for the device (and probably saved some bucks besides) compared to what my dentist charges for this procedure.  I am very happy with it--in fact, I just about to use it right now.  I think you will be pleased with the device.  (Another bonus is that if you have someone else in your life, you can share the device because it comes with a second set of trays!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only 3 days now and the results are what I would see after a full 2 weeks of whitestrips.  Looking forward to finishing with the gel that comes with the device and then doing a treatment once a week or so to maintain.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz - a big waste of money.  Just use peroxide and water which works just as well.</li>
            <li> All that I have to say is no sensitivity!</li>
            <li> I wish I believed in other ratings and not waste my money on such a pointless product, did not see any results .</li>
            <li> It worked fine at first. Then the mouth part stop working. I&#x27;m in progress of trying to get a refund from Brookstone.Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and the kit is the only way to go.  It has everything for the best price.</li>
            <li> At the age of 70 plus, this device has whitened my teeth considerably.  Each individual user will undoubtedly have different results but even my dentist commented on the whiteness of my teeth.  And in dealing with the company (I lost a cord.), they were considerate and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this was an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive and I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate the whitening strips, trays or toothpastes. This takes 30 minutes a month and I can smile.  The whitening starts after the first use.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Results above expectations! Makes your teeth whiter and brighter in just five days. No sensitivity or pains. I recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from my dentist at a higher cost than here on Amazon (the refills are also more expensive through the dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having done bleaching in the past (trays, whitening strips and also an in-office session years ago) with less than exciting results, I have arrived at the point where I am looking into veneers. After a discussion with my dentist, bleaching was recommended prior to placement of the veneers. My dentist offers free bleaching for life, but I couldn&#x27;t work up any enthusiasm for trays (mess, sensitivity) and after the in-office treatment that left me with blisters on my gums from the bleach,I won&#x27;t ever do that again. I noticed and asked about the Glo system, which was a new offering at the practice. The staff raved about it, so I decided it might be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little trouble gauging how much bleach to dispense the first 2 days and didn&#x27;t have enough in the first 2 tubes for the 4th treatment of the sessions. Still, by the end of the second day of using Glo,I was definitely seeing improvement in my teeth. After 5 days, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I plan to finish up the 5 remaining tubes of bleach as part of my initial whitening. Depending on how my teeth look then, I may buy another set of refills and continue through that and reconsider whether to go ahead with veneers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Easy and doesn&#x27;t take a great investment of time or effort&lt;br /&gt;No sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;Fast results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to gauge correct amount of bleach per treatment out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;Harsh on the lips - don&#x27;t forget to use included lip cream (or some other barrier, like chapstick)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;3 of my bleach tubes were discolored (yellow) at the base of the brush (not the gel itself). I took them back to the dentist and was told this is an issue with the glue used to secure the cap on the tube during manufacturing and is a known issue. It does not affect the efficacy of the bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about it!  To give some background;  I smoke regularly (which I hate to say) and also love my strong Spanish coffee with the consistency of maple syrup, daily.  I carry a tooth brush in my purse and brush my teeth throughout the day to make sure I&#x27;m not \\&quot;that girl\\&quot; with the bad breath.  I also go to the dentist twice a year for cleanings to try to counter the effects of my unhealthy habits.  So while I am very conscious about my oral healthcare and don&#x27;t have stained teeth, they definitely were not \\&quot;pearly\\&quot; white either.  Like a lot of reviews on here, I&#x27;ve also tried many bleaching products.  Had custom trays made at my dentists office &amp; tried several different brands of bleaching gels that I purchased at my dentist&#x27;s office over the past 10 years.  All of them made my teeth SO SENSITIVE that just smiling sometimes would give me shooting pains.  Not only did it hurt but I felt ridiculous when I had to explain to the person I was talking to why I just reacted like a bee stung me in the middle of a conversation.  I also have used the over the counter whitening strips and the Colgate one you paint on your teeth.  The sensitivity wasn&#x27;t as severe, but still there.  And to add to it my teeth were never really any whiter! Not that I noticed anyways.  Once my dentist fully explained what that pain meant &amp; that the enamel was being stripped from my teeth during the whitening process; I stopped bleaching my teeth entirely.  That scared the crap out of me!  Apparently you had to compromise having white teeth for unhealthy teeth!  What would my teeth be like at 80 years old then?!  Which is the main reason I decided to spend the money on Glo, it doesn&#x27;t strip the enamel off your teeth &amp; therefore there is no sensitivity/pain either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also give the Glo system 5 stars for simplicity &amp; ease of use.  I will put the little iPod looking dock around my neck, paint the gel on my teeth, pop the tray in and start the 8 minute whitening, then proceed to do the dishes, laundry, play on the computer, etc. The light goes off when the timer ends and I&#x27;m on to the next 8 minutes.  I also use Glo more frequently than the up keep schedule the user manual recommends &amp; it not only works great, but I have no sensitivity or other negative side effects.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and wanted to wait awhile before I posted a review in case there were any negative changes, equipment failures, etc. and I have NOTHING NEGATIVE to say at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of other things I wanted to point out.  1. If you are married/live with someone you can also buy an additional mouth piece (or even use the same one if it doesn&#x27;t gross you out) and really get a bang for your buck!  The initial cost is really the only major expense.  The whitening gel that you then purchase is really minimal and I recently have seen it at Sephora as well.  I purchased mine on HSN.com (Home Shopping Network) and saved almost $100.  2. I read some reviews about the individual gel containers being difficult to open &amp; paint on your teeth.  Most of those comments were from reviews that were over a year old, so I don&#x27;t know if they have made improvements on the dispensers since, but I have not had any issues at all.  I also originally saw this product being displayed on one of the HSN shows and saw the demo&#x27;s.  I would recommend looking for a quick tutorial on YouTube if you want a frame of reference.  I personally, pull my lips aside with one hand and use the other hand to apply the gel.  Otherwise I end up getting it on my lips.  Common sense, really.  3. Don&#x27;t expect your teeth to look like Jessica Simpson&#x27;s or the model on the tooth paste carton.  If that&#x27;s the only thing that is going to satisfy you, go get veneers.  But if you want to them NOTICEABLY whiter &amp; brighter without compromising the health &amp; sensitivity of your teeth, this is a beauty must!  I would say my teeth are 3-5 shades whiter and have actually been complimented, out of the blue, by both strangers and my friends.d, out of the blue, by both strangers and my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After using the Glo system five times I was getting complements in how white my teeth were getting. It&#x27;s quick and easy! I would recommend this product to anyone. You really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this...I&#x27;m somewhat of a whitening obsessed person. I&#x27;ve tried most products on the market and from my dentist. This didn&#x27;t preform as well as whitening strips and wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as what I have gotten at my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The trey doesn&#x27;t fit well to the mouth and is sloppy. I was really disappointed. Also, there was some sensitivity where none was promised.</li>
            <li> Now I think this is great.  They are easy to use and do work by lightening several shades.  My teeth are ultra sensitive and i cannot use the crest strips even for a minute without pain.  For me that is the greatest relief.  I only gave 4 stars because I do not like that each time you have to use for 7 minutes and then reapply.  And also the teeth only are three to four shades lighter, not 7-10, which is what you get in the dentist office (I have had them done professionally, so I know my teeth can get lighter.)  But over all a safe and fun way to lighten your teeth.  Just don&#x27;t expect the world, just a little help.  :)</li>
            <li> Be aware, there is no satisfaction guarantee for this product. I purchased it through Amazon after reading reviews here and on Sephora.com. I used as instructed and saw little to no color change in my teeth; they remain a more natural looking cream shade. So if you&#x27;re thinking this will get your teeth that dentist bleached white look please prepare to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> its amazing and i really hope it works for me. i really wanna have a shining smile.&lt;br /&gt;and its so cooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i used this product as the instructions had said to, but i didnt see any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  It&#x27;s as if I didn&#x27;t do anything.  Disappointed i paid so much for this product that doesnt work</li>
            <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened at my dentist eleven years ago, where I sat in the chair with the blue light device on my teeth.  The process was excruciating due to the pain and sensitivity.  I had tried various whitening products in the years since then, but they either caused pain and/or didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth.  A cosmetic dentist in my hometown recently recommended the GLO Science Teeth Whitening Device and said his patients had very good results with little or no discomfort.  I bought the device via Amazon and have used five of the whitening gel packets so far.  My teeth are noticeably whiter and deep stains have been removed.  There is very little discomfort - just be sure to use lots of lip and gum protection either with the gel included with the device, or you can use Vaseline or lots of Chapstick - otherwise, you will get sores on your lips and gums.  Wonderful product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> worked perfectly and does exactly what it says without making your teeth sensitive....Breaksdown in about 10-15 uses</li>
            <li> I like it. you can see the difference and it doesn&#x27;t make you teeth sensitive :)</li>
            <li> Last year, I purchased the GLO Science Brilliant Teeth Whitening system from an Amazon seller.  Please be aware that the majority of Amazon sellers are not authorized by GLO Science to sell their products.  By doing so makes your one year warranty with GLO Science null and void.  GLO Science provides a list of the authorized sellers on their website.  If you are set on investing money into this product, you are much better off protecting your investment by purchasing it directly from the GLO Science website for the same price as sold by Amazon sellers. By doing so, it ensures that your warranty will be honored for one year from date of purchase.  You must also register both the remote and mouth piece separately on the GLO Science website.  Personally, I believe the GLO Science Brilliant system is a total waste of money.  Approximately, nine months after my initial purchase I spent an additional $135 on boxes of whitening gel, lip balm, and a mouth piece for my husband.  When I attempted to use my GLO Science system for the third time, it was dead.  So, I got two uses out of it at a cost of $199. My purchase was through an Amazon seller who told me that nothing could be done since my warranty had expired two weeks prior.  I later learned that the Amazon seller was not authorized to sell the GLO Science system and my warranty had been null and void from the day I purchased it.  So, against my better judgement I just purchased a new remote only from an Amazon seller for $79.  Since I already had invested so much money into the extra mouthpiece and expensive gel, I thought it would be worth the $79 investment.  I knew that Amazon&#x27;s return policy would at least cover me for the first 30 days after purchase.  GLO Science does not sell the remote only-just an entire new system for another $199.  Well, the new GLO Science remote arrived today.  Surprise, surprise.  Just another defective GLO Science remote which I&#x27;m returning tomorrow.</li>
            <li> You have to use it a lot to get it to do the whitening.  I don&#x27;t have time to sit with peroxide on my teeth, but it does work.  I think it is a bit pricey for what it does.</li>
            <li> My dentist sells this for $300 and the results are quick and amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this , easy to use and portable</li>
            <li> Perfect device for people with sensitive teeth! Had no sensitivity like I would get from using a whitening tooth paste and noticeably whiter teeth after the third use. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall- I love this and find it to be incredibly effective.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone- especially those who have had problems with sensitivity before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: The device itself is *super* sleek looking- like an Ipod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel states that you get no sensitivity because it stays on your teeth and doesn&#x27;t get to your gums.  Personally, I always have INCREDIBLE sensitivity after any whitening treatment, to the point where it&#x27;s miserable.  I have had none so far with this (I am on my fifth day).  They say to store your gels in the fridge and it&#x27;s a bit cold feeling when I first apply them to my teeth but other than that it&#x27;s totally comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthpiece itself is relatively comfortable and easy to keep in without feeling the need to clamp down the entire time (which hurts, especially after 32 minutes).  It warms very gently but seals well.  Just a note, though, make sure you apply the (included) lip treatment.  Not only does it keep any stray gel from damaging your lips but it makes it easier to get your lips around the mouthpiece (a kind of lube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I have results.  My teeth are DEFINITELY whiter.  It does caveat that it can only whiten you teeth to the whitest they NATURALLY can get- that is different for everyone.  So if your teeth are already super white you may not see an enormous difference.  My teeth were, thanks to four years of smoking, still a bit yellow despite my best previous whitening efforts (including strips, trays, pastes, paste additives, and gum) so I have seen a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I highly recommend this.  Five days in my teeth look better than they have since I first started smoking.  It is expensive but I am glad I bought it and would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note- each gel capsule holds four (or more, I can usually get five) treatments, so you get more than it appears for your money with the actual gels.</li>
            <li> product arrived earlier then expected.  I&#x27;ve noticed the results by the second day. Definitely am a sensitive tooth person and this product proved to be for such a person .</li>
            <li> I used this for 3 days straight and barely saw any changes to my teeth. I remember whitening strips being more effective with quicker results. The only nice thing about GLO versus whitening strips was that there was less sensitivity to my teeth after use. I quit using GLO after three days because I started to notice some sensitivity to my tongue and gums. There was a slight tingly and stingy sensation that really bugged me. The instructions did say to use it for about a week straight so perhaps that&#x27;s when it would yield the best results, but so far, I&#x27;m not really liking this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nifty gadget.  Its like an i pod for teeth whitening. Its fast and easy.... and it works.  Its like sitting in a dentist office getting the Zoom whitening treatment,  but you&#x27;re in the comfort of your home.  The only downfall is the lack of a warranty.</li>
            <li> First thing: This product does work but no better than whitening strips in my opinion. A majority of the hefty cost is paying for elaborate packaging and completely unnecessary accessories. The charging dock is completely useless since the device can be charged directly into the wall and id rather stick to my own chapstick instead of the one included. The whitening gel comes in very oddly shaped and hard to open capsules. I was under the impression that this device would be a much easier whitening system than strips but i was sadly mistaken. Each application is 4 back to back 8 minute sessions; having to reapply the gel each time. I often found that the device wouldnt hold a strong enough charge for all 4 applications and i&#x27;d have to wait for it to charge back up to finish the fourth 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I do admit that this product did whiten my teeth and has enough gel for 2 complete whitening sessions but next time i&#x27;d stick with the strips and save myself over $100.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loved it and got great results. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> works great&lt;br /&gt;need to be careful with lips, put on cream so you do not damage them&lt;br /&gt;need time to do process</li>
            <li> No.  Just dont buy it.  Basically what this is... it is a little tanning bed for your gums and lips.  Sure it may actually make your teeth a little whiter.  But... the crazy bright blue light toasts your gums and lips in the process.  Yes they have some dumb chapstick you use but it doesnt do anything.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Stick to Crest whitestrips and within a month of using you will have whiter teeth and NO burnt sun tanned lips and gums.</li>
            <li> No sensitivity!!!! This product is amazing....love it...and my teeth look so much better!</li>
            <li> after using this product once,charged it up and used it for one 8minute cycle and now it won&#x27;t go on! can&#x27;t really asess it&#x27;s abilities to whitten my teeth! can&#x27;t reach glo coustomer help line,nobody there to talk with,keep on leaving messages.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the groduct.</li>
            <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened about 5 years ago so my teeth were already in pretty good shape and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this. After just 3 applications of the Glo treatment, my teeth are noticeably whiter. I can&#x27;t use Crest whitestrips because they zing my gums and cause terrible bolts of pain. There was no sensitivity at all with this product.</li>
            <li> The Glo comes in luxury packaging much like an iPhone or iPod making opening it an experience.  I was initially skeptical, since most of the other products I had tried really didn&#x27;t work for me and this one clearly tries to impress with its packaging.  However, I found the Glo easy to use and very effective.  It comes with 10 little packets of 8.5% hydrogen perioxide which you need to apply to your teeth and then activate with the attached light.  Each packet is good for four 8-minute sessions which are recommended to be done back to back.  However, the 32 minute time investment isn&#x27;t too onerous, particularly when you quickly see an effect.  Saving an open packet isn&#x27;t recommended and I did notice the clear gel begins to yellow if left open for hours, so it probably is important to use each packet in a single session.  I had no sensitivity while using the product, but I can&#x27;t really speak to the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that the product is good for sensitive teeth.  My issue with the other products that I had tried was never sensitivity, but rather they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Reviews aren&#x27;t allowed to discuss price, but I purchased this elsewhere and paid nearly twice what the price is on amazon.  I wish I had known I could have bought it here, but I&#x27;m not really too upset since it worked for me.  Its a bargain at this price.  I imagine it won&#x27;t work for everybody, but I had come to suspect all these products were a rip-off since the others didn&#x27;t work for me.  This one did and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product to whiten her teeth. If you see her, please be sure to tell your wife that you think my wife&#x27;s teeth look amazing. (It&#x27;d mean a lot to us.)</li>
            <li> Used it Wednesday through Sunday , somewhat of a difference. Whitening was only about 2-3 steps brighter. Will continue to use it .</li>
            <li> Good result. Shared the device with my daughters and we all found a noticeable whitening. I did have sensitivity but they did not. Am using it on top up once every 2weeks and whitening is maintained. Impressive and much cheaper and easier than the dentist</li>
            <li> Made my teeth hurt and was not what I expected .... did not whiten ...... very disappointed with the product nothing like all the hype on the Talk ...... as far as I am concerned ..... false advertising ......waste of  money ... there are other products that work much better and are less money</li>
            <li> loved this product for the first 8 treatments that I used it and could definitely notice a difference.  But after three months of it sitting back in its box (because i Moved) I went to use it again and nothing. wouldn&#x27;t turn on wouldn&#x27;t charge nothing. pretty pissed to say the least that i sent $300 on a product that just broke for what appears to be no apparent reason. luckily I bought this a saphora and I am still able to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement to custom trays + syringe that I used 7-8 years ago. GLO is a step backwards in terms of useability. The custom applicator is more difficult to use and difficult to get out all of the gel. The gel is very thick, which is good. Well, kind of. Your teeth have to be dry so that the gel sticks to the tooth. If tooth is wet, the gel slides off the tooth hence no whitening. The mouthpiece doesn&#x27;t sit tight against the teeth, so difficult to coat your uppers + lowers while keeping the teeth dry. Why easier to do using custom fit mouth trays and syringe.  I&#x27;m not convinced if the blue light actually does anything.  The trick to getting the best whitening is to put the gel on dry teeth and keep saliva + gums from rubbing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Cost, difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This was a fun present for the kids that have everything. I bought two!  They do really work, you can have paper white teeth in a week or so.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I was hesitant about the cost but I&#x27;m so glad I went for it. I had previously tried the syringes of gel that you put in a tray and keep in your mouth several hours (purchased from my dentist), but I found that inconvenient and didn&#x27;t really see much difference. The GLO product is so much better because it takes only 30 minutes, once a day for 5 days. It was easy to fit into my schedule. My teeth went from dull yellow to bright white. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. See my before and after pic! (The remaining bit of yellow is old composite filling that can&#x27;t be bleached, but my dentist is going to restore it.)</li>
            <li> I wish I could give the product a great review because I actually do believe using GLO has made my teeth a few shades whiter.  The problem is that I am now experiencing connection issues with my second whitening device.  The first one simply wouldn&#x27;t stay on from the first use.  I would press the center button and after a few seconds it would go out.  I recharged it another 4 hours having just charged it all night but the blue glowing light would keep going out.  I returned it through the Amazon merchant and bought another through Sephora.  I have used this one a few times successfully (all 4 cycles) but today the blue light went out on the third cycle and the mouthpiece also kept pulling away from the hand held GLO device as well.  Finally I got it to stay on by holding it in my hand horizontally and not moving at all while it was in my mouth.  I wonder if it will work at all next time I try to use it.  I have called Sephora and they don&#x27;t seem to want to take it back because it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve bought it and I&#x27;ve used several of the very expensive vials (about $40 - $50 for new vials after you use your set that&#x27;s included).  BTW, just cut the vial open, remove the silly plastic brush without squeezing any gel into it at all and use a cotton swab to gently brush the gel onto your (preferably) dry teeth.  You can easily get 5 - 6 generous uses out of one vial if you do it this way.  Keep unused portions in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer as these gels are getting more expensive by the month to refill.</li>
            <li> device works great, you will see very noticeable results after the third day. I used it for 6 consecutive days and got a really bright smile.</li>
            <li> My teeth became noticeably whiter with each use.  I saw a subtle difference after the first time.  I never had any issues with zingers, but my gums did feel a bit raw (temporarily) due to contact with the gel.  System is easy to use, but like anything else, takes a bit of practice.  After the first few times, I got my method dialed in.  I&#x27;m very happy with my results - my teeth are several shades whiter.</li>
            <li> Giving this product one star because it arrived and never turned on despite hours of charging. Bought the glow kit through sephora and it worked straight out the box. Great product def see major improvement. My teeth are finally white</li>
            <li> Does a fairly good job, but not quite as good as I expected. It is easy to use and the gels last a long time​</li>
            <li> The package should have contain 10 g-vials whitening gel, but this one only had 5! watch out! for the original price of $199, you should got 10  g-vials whitening gel according to GLO science and Sephora. So don&#x27;t be tricked by them! I think I will return this!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a whitening system you will not be disappointed. It is absolutely worth the money. I had great results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this system and carefully read all the instructions etc.  First, I was surprised to learn that it had to be used four times a day.  After I resigned myself to that, I began my use.  I only got two uses before it broke.  The mouth piece stopped working after two uses.  I called the company and they said it \\&quot;must be defective.\\&quot;  After two uses??  I would not recommend this product.  It&#x27;s expensive and obviously poorly made.</li>
            <li> Waste of money does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> Wish I had my money back :-(&lt;br /&gt;The gel is messy to deal with and pricey to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Results were marginal: I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference before vs after.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Only my second day but can already see the difference and my teeth aren&#x27;t getting sensitive yet.  Yeh/!!!</li>
            <li> Great Price! Better than going to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I completed treatments for five consecutive days, with no positive results.  The application of the whitening gel is messy and difficult.  Each applicator must be cut open to get the amount needed to complete the four back-to-back treatments required each day, and it is impossible to not get any of the goopy stuff on your gums, lips and tongue.  The lip balm they provide does nothing to protect the back side of the lips that come into contact with the mouthpiece.  After a couple of treatments, the back of my upper lip was starting to feel sore, and by the fifth day it was burning, raw and puffy.  It hurt to eat and brush my teeth.  All of this and my teeth have not whitened... not even one shade.  I am reentering the workforce and am self-conscious about my smile, so I will complete the remaining five treatments (I have taken two days off to allow my lip to heal as much as possible) in the hopes that perhaps my teeth just need a little more work before they show improvement.  One good thing I will say about this product, and it is why I gave two stars instead of one, is that I have experienced relatively little tooth sensitivity.  I am unable to use traditional whitening products because I have hypersensitive teeth, and I am certain that those with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; teeth would experience no discomfort with this product at all.  I am also going to put vaseline on the part of the mouthpiece that comes in contact with my upper lip and hope that will make this experiment more tolerable.  I will update this review following the remaining five treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/23/2013:  I completed another 3 treatments, out of the five that were left.  I didn&#x27;t see the point of completing all 10 original treatments, as I have seen zero improvement after 8.  Putting vaseline on the outside of the mouthpiece did help reduce upper lip pain, but it did not eliminate it.  Over all, this product turned out to be a huge waste of time, a huge waste of money and a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love this thing - it works just fine.  We ordered the extra mouthpiece so that my husband and I could both use the Glo .  He hasn&#x27;t tried his mouthpiece yet but I&#x27;m sure that it will work just as well as mine does.  It&#x27;s great that we can whiten our teeth at home whenever we need a touchup!</li>
