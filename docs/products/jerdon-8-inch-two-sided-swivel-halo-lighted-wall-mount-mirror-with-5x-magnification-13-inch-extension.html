            <li>It works and looks great.</li>
            <li>, 5X-1X Magnification, Bright Brass</li>
            <li>One bit of good advice is to install the height at the chin of the shortest person who will use it.  </li>
            <li>The mirror works well and it looks good.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good time.  </li>

            <li>I love this mirror!  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>Great product and very quick service.</li>
            <li>The bright brass finish is lovely and the mirror gives a nice magnification.  </li>
            <li>Now I have my own.  </li>
            <li>The intensity of light is perfect ... too much light would create a glare and be counter-productive.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Love the lighted feature....very nice.</li>
            <li>It does not give good light.</li>
            <li>Great, just the right amount of magnification.</li>
            <li>The mirrors are good quality, and the ring lighting is perfectly adequate.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned buying the lighted version because although I loved them when I used them at hotels, I saw many reviews talking about low light levels which I believe may be a problem if your bathroom lights are very bright.</li>
            <li>I use the magnifying side the most.</li>
            <li>It provides excellent images with no distortion in either the regular or magnification sides.  </li>
            <li>Though, the mounting hardware did not do the job so, I had to go and get better hardware</li>
            <li>Sturdy and elegant looking, it matches my bath remodel AND allows my presbyopic eyes to see up close without my reading glasses.</li>
            <li>mirror is self is ok.</li>
            <li>The light is not too bright, but is adequate for the purpose.  </li>
            <li>We have bright brass fixtures, and a matching lighted mirror was one of the choices (most are stainless).  </li>
            <li>(As others have noted, not overly bright, but bright enough.)</li>
            <li>mirror looks very nice in my bathroom, and the bright brass compliments other brass fixtures.</li>
            <li>This mirror was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>This mirror was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>It installed fairly easily .</li>
            <li>well, easy to install&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>It was easy to install.</li>
            <li>Easy directions for installation</li>
            <li>was packed very carefully, easy install</li>
            <li>Easy mounting.  </li>
            <li>bright, high quality</li>
            <li>It folds away nice and does not take up much room...easy to install!</li>
            <li>Hinges work fine.</li>
            <li>If your bathroom is very bright the light may seem dim, but in that case you won&#x27;t really need the light anyways.</li>
            <li>I feel that the light is plenty though.  </li>
            <li>The light works well.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a replacement light bulb.</li>
            <li>Light is functional for illuminating your face when doing the face-magnification thing.</li>
            <li>Maybe they should consider having an adjustable dimmer to accommodate both the customers that like more light vs. the reviewers who thought it was plenty bright enough.  </li>
            <li>BE SURE TO GET THE EXACT LENGHT</li>
            <li>Bulb isn&#x27;t bright enough for me</li>
            <li>Saw a similar mirror at Ritz-Carlton and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is how all those lovely wrinkles show up now!</li>
            <li>stellar!</li>
            <li>It matches the bright brass faucets on my sinks and the towel bars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hands free for putting on my make up every morning, now much faster than before.</li>
            <li>It is also useful as a night light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to install, drill 2 3/8 holes, high quality mollies included.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, strong and attractive enough, but it sure is thick.  </li>
            <li>This is something I was looking for and could not find the right one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This mirror was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love magnifying mirrors, I love them in hotels because with them you can actually see and treat your face properly!</li>
            <li>My husband uses it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need a super high powered magnifier, you&#x27;ll probably like this.</li>
            <li>The light is of some help but just supplements the other bath light that I use.</li>
            <li>TABLE TOP IS WIDER THAN THE ARMS ARE LONG.</li>
            <li>The magnification is adequate for me and gives a clear image.</li>
            <li>Well I guess it has to be, because it uses a fairly large lamp inside, rather than slim LEDs.  </li>
            <li>It brings the view of your face very close and is two sided so you have a choice of 2 magnifications.  </li>
            <li>I bought this upon returning from Panama City, Panama in September 2013 where my hotel bathroom had the same mirror in chrome but without the light.  </li>
            <li>Also did not have as much amplification as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I would say the light is definitely sufficient.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to getting this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I was able to run 14 gauge coaxial wire inside the wall from a nearby outlet to the center of the mounting fixture (no wall studs in between) and splice the cord to the wire</li>
            <li>It is nice and heavy duty.</li>
            <li>The soft light is enough to highlight the face to reveal details not usually seen.</li>
            <li>Everyday, when I put my makeup on, I am so satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Light was so weak, it might as well not have a light.</li>
            <li>It cost less on Amazon and with free shipping, a no brainier.</li>
            <li>The swing arm is solid and the overall construction is pretty high quality.</li>
            <li>Both sides offer a clear view.  </li>
            <li>Either plug in or direct wire.</li>
            <li>After having cataract surgery (I am early 50&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>We had existing electrical box (old phone junction) in bathroom, but it can just be screwed to the wall and plugged into a nearby receptacle.</li>
            <li>The lighting is a tad dim but works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value as I was skeptical at first due to the low price</li>
            <li>The curly clear cord plug (plugs into a wall outlet) is barely noticeable, and convenient.</li>
            <li>You should mount it in a well lighted room, because the light is not very bright.  </li>
            <li>and her comment was it was too dim to make a difference from what we currently have.  </li>
            <li>I also went through the extra effort to put a new electrical box on the wall to mount it at eye level, have it next to me and have internal wiring vs. plugging it in with a cord hanging out.</li>

            <li> Mounted it yesterday by my female 53 year old self (used honeys tools) in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have noticed is the same one that other people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> They are especially helpful as we get a little older and our vision needs a little help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked on line and saw other models from other stores and vendors approaching up to $300, so for $68</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE MIRROR IS  HEAVY AND THE ARMS ARE VERY SHORT, SO YOU ARE LIMITED TO WHERE IT CAN BE INSTALLED.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a year now with absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Received the mirror and had to send it back - it is SO heavy!  </li>
            <li> Not suitable for Australia - cannot convert to our electric current.</li>
            <li> It was half of the price that I had paid for the other brand , but the other one&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li> Would like to return it but probably have left it too late.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I probably should have bought the 10&amp;#34; vs an 8&amp;#34; model.</li>
            <li> My husband installed it to the side of my bathroom cabinet and ran the electrical cord down under the sink so it doesn&#x27;t show at all.</li>
            <li> Having used these mirrors in a few hotels where they were installed over the years, I wanted one at home too.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday to put my makeup on, etc.</li>
            <li> The mirror is heavy and well-made.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday to shave with.</li>
            <li> Compare to others, it does not have that ugly cord hanging straight from the mirror.</li>
            <li> No more squinting or guessing about what is in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s about 2 1/8 inches thick, so it seems rather &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; or just plain &amp;#34;dated&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize from the description and pictures how thick the mirror casing is.  </li>
            <li> mirror itself is quite a bit wider than it&#x27;s non-lighted cousin, however I was disappointed in the screws provided and the instructions.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>

            <li> This mirror was easy to install.  It is wired for a plug-in so it has to be close enough that you can plug it in. No internal wiring needed.</li>
            <li> This mirror is as decorative as it is functional.  No more squinting or guessing about what is in the mirror.  Both sides offer a clear view.  The lighting highlights either side.  Great product and very quick service.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  The only problem that I have noticed is the same one that other people have mentioned.  You should mount it in a well lighted room, because the light is not very bright.  Other than that, this is a great mirror.</li>
            <li> Having used these mirrors in a few hotels where they were installed over the years, I wanted one at home too.  It is very easy to install.  Either plug in or direct wire. It brings the view of your face very close and is two sided so you have a choice of 2 magnifications.  It came with screws and everything I needed to install it.  One bit of good advice is to install the height at the chin of the shortest person who will use it.  Of course you can just hold it up and test your planned location.  The light is of some help but just supplements the other bath light that I use. I installed one last year and am just now buying another so that I can have the use of it too.&lt;br /&gt;update 2015&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the bulb size is.  It came with the same bulb that is in it now and has never worn out.  I feel that the light is plenty though.  Meanwhile I will say that the finish has not held up too great.</li>
            <li> This is something I was looking for and could not find the right one. This is. Beautiful design, shiny edges and look so elegant. Compare to others, it does not have that ugly cord hanging straight from the mirror. It bends whichever direction you need. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this upon returning from Panama City, Panama in September 2013 where my hotel bathroom had the same mirror in chrome but without the light.  Everyday, when I put my makeup on, I am so satisfied with my purchase.  I use the magnifying side the most.</li>
            <li> After having cataract surgery (I am early 50&#x27;s) I coudn&#x27;t see to put my make up on. Purchased this mirror and use it daily. My husband installed it to the side of my bathroom cabinet and ran the electrical cord down under the sink so it doesn&#x27;t show at all. It matches the bright brass faucets on my sinks and the towel bars. I use it everyday to put my makeup on, etc. The magnification is adequate for me and gives a clear image. The light works well. It also comes with a replacement light bulb. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> We were provided a Jerdon mirror at a B&amp;B recently, and my wife said, \\&quot;This is wonderful\\&quot;.  I copied the manufacturer info from the back of the mirror.  With Christmas coming, and taking a chance of violating the \\&quot;nothing with a plug\\&quot; principle, I looked for them at Amazon.  We have bright brass fixtures, and a matching lighted mirror was one of the choices (most are stainless).  Installation was simple because the back bracket comes off for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This mirror was easy to install.  It provides excellent images with no distortion in either the regular or magnification sides.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for Australia - cannot convert to our electric current. I cannot use this.  Would like to return it but probably have left it too late.</li>
            <li> The Jerdon magnification lighted mirror is great. Though, the mounting hardware did not do the job so, I had to go and get better hardware so the mirror would not pull away from the drywall. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It&#x27;s hands free for putting on my make up every morning, now much faster than before.</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for. It cost less on Amazon and with free shipping, a no brainier. Mounted it yesterday by my female 53 year old self (used honeys tools) in just a few minutes. Sturdy and elegant looking, it matches my bath remodel AND allows my presbyopic eyes to see up close without my reading glasses. Lovin&#x27; it!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my mothers house so that she can see to put in her makeup. Great quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize from the description and pictures how thick the mirror casing is.  Well I guess it has to be, because it uses a fairly large lamp inside, rather than slim LEDs.  Well it&#x27;s about 2 1/8 inches thick, so it seems rather &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; or just plain &amp;#34;dated&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s well made, strong and attractive enough, but it sure is thick.  The mirrors are good quality, and the ring lighting is perfectly adequate.  (As others have noted, not overly bright, but bright enough.)</li>
            <li> It installed fairly easily . I will start actually using it tomorrow . It seems to magnify enough for now.</li>
            <li> I could not install this mirror with bolts and fasteners supplied. They just didn&#x27;t hold. So, I went to the hardware store and bought some that could hold the weight of it. That worked well. The mirror works well and it looks good. If you don&#x27;t need a super high powered magnifier, you&#x27;ll probably like this.</li>
            <li> Just installed it today and my wife loves it.  It is nice and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Saw a similar mirror at Ritz-Carlton and loved it.  Now I have my own.  The bright brass finish is lovely and the mirror gives a nice magnification.  The light is not too bright, but is adequate for the purpose.  The only problem is how all those lovely wrinkles show up now!</li>
            <li> Received the mirror and had to send it back - it is SO heavy!  Also did not have as much amplification as I wanted.  Light was so weak, it might as well not have a light.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002HRENUC Jerdon HL65G Eclipse 5X Halo Lighted Mirror, 8\\&quot;, 5X-1X Magnification, Bright Brass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MIRROR IS  HEAVY AND THE ARMS ARE VERY SHORT, SO YOU ARE LIMITED TO WHERE IT CAN BE INSTALLED.  I HAVE NOT INSTALLED MINE YET BECAUSE I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I AM GOING TO KEEP IT.  MY BATHROOM TABLE TOP IS WIDER THAN THE ARMS ARE LONG. NOT CONVIENENT. BE SURE TO GET THE EXACT LENGHT YOU NEED BEFORE PURCHASING. LENGTH WAS NOT LISTED ON THIS ITEM WHEN I ORDERED.</li>
            <li> This is a well made and attractive mirror.  My husband and I both have one mounted on the wall next to our bathroom sink.  They are especially helpful as we get a little older and our vision needs a little help.</li>
            <li> Great, just the right amount of magnification.</li>
            <li> I love magnifying mirrors, I love them in hotels because with them you can actually see and treat your face properly! I was concerned buying the lighted version because although I loved them when I used them at hotels, I saw many reviews talking about low light levels which I believe may be a problem if your bathroom lights are very bright. In that case, why do you need a lighted mirror then?&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is quite a bit wider than it&#x27;s non-lighted cousin, however I was disappointed in the screws provided and the instructions. I ended up replacing the screws because they were wobbly but it was a very simple thing (just a trip to the local Target to buy different nails) and now I&#x27;m very pleased with the way it&#x27;s turned out. I would say the light is definitely sufficient. If your bathroom is very bright the light may seem dim, but in that case you won&#x27;t really need the light anyways.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting this mirror.  It arrived in good time.  I was in the process of moving and it&lt;br /&gt;was only installed last week.  By then all of the packing material, receipts, etc were gone.  It was then that I realized that&lt;br /&gt;there is no way this is 5X magnification - even with the 5X sticker on the mirror.  It might be 1X maybe.  I was so disappointed.  I would not have ordered 5X if I didn&#x27;t need it.  Kaki</li>
            <li> Great Product!  My husband uses it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Love the lighted feature....very nice. It folds away nice and does not take up much room...easy to install! Hinges work fine.</li>
            <li> Good price, good function. We had existing electrical box (old phone junction) in bathroom, but it can just be screwed to the wall and plugged into a nearby receptacle. Light is functional for illuminating your face when doing the face-magnification thing. It is also useful as a night light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent value for its price, and it performs its function in style.</li>
            <li> The Jerdon wall mounted mirror looks very nice in my bathroom, and the bright brass compliments other brass fixtures. The mirror is heavy and well-made. The curly clear cord plug (plugs into a wall outlet) is barely noticeable, and convenient. The intensity of light is perfect ... too much light would create a glare and be counter-productive. The soft light is enough to highlight the face to reveal details not usually seen. The arm has a double swivel, and the mirror rotates on a horizontal attachment 360 degrees. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Always wanted a lighted mirror in my bathroom , like in hotels.  Well I finally got them for all my bathrooms.  This is in mine.  It has magnification on one side.  The lighting is a tad dim but works.  I am very happy with this purchase..</li>
            <li> Bulb isn&#x27;t bright enough for me but it does do a good job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s would be a 5 star if it was brighter.  I read the revues about the lack of brightness but everyone has a different opinion on what is &amp;#34;bright enough&amp;#34; so I got it for my wife for the holiday to replace a non-lighted Jerdon mirror we have mounted on the wall and her comment was it was too dim to make a difference from what we currently have.  The quality of construction is excellent and if we didn&#x27;t have a mirror already we would have kept it.  Maybe they should consider having an adjustable dimmer to accommodate both the customers that like more light vs. the reviewers who thought it was plenty bright enough.  I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> This is the second identical mirror we have now&lt;br /&gt;works well, easy to install&lt;br /&gt;love the 5X mirror for close up work</li>
            <li> A great product. I was impressed with the quality of this mirror. It was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of the product. Have used it for a year now with absolutely no complaints. I would recommend this product to anyone. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after just buying a different brand for my daughter for Christmas. Easy directions for installation and she was please with the look. It was half of the price that I had paid for the other brand , but the other one&lt;br /&gt;had different features. She uses it daily and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, drill 2 3/8 holes, high quality mollies included. Wife says perfect, can do my eyebrows now !!</li>
            <li> was packed very carefully, easy install extra bulb was a plus nice gold finish mirror quality seems excellent ,wife very happy</li>
            <li> It does not give good light. mirror is self is ok. would not buy it again. jjjj jjjj jjj jj</li>
            <li> stellar! bright, high quality</li>
            <li> Beautifully made. N very good.</li>
            <li> Easy mounting.  I was able to run 14 gauge coaxial wire inside the wall from a nearby outlet to the center of the mounting fixture (no wall studs in between) and splice the cord to the wire so there&#x27;s no external wiring.  It works and looks great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain about this purchase. It&#x27;s a great value as I was skeptical at first due to the low price but it&#x27;s performed well and I use it everyday to shave with. I also went through the extra effort to put a new electrical box on the wall to mount it at eye level, have it next to me and have internal wiring vs. plugging it in with a cord hanging out. The swing arm is solid and the overall construction is pretty high quality. Doesn&#x27;t look like it will break or bend anytime soon with regular daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked on line and saw other models from other stores and vendors approaching up to $300, so for $68 this is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I probably should have bought the 10&amp;#34; vs an 8&amp;#34; model.</li>
