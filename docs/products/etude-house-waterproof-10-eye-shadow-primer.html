            <li>This is a great eyeshadow primer for its price.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t remember lol..</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, not cakey or chalky and feels great on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li>well i love it !!</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow and eyeliner sticks amazingly!</li>

            <li>Which is interesting thing!</li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>but I have seen people with oily eyelids claiming this to be amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice experience</li>
            <li>This eye primer is the best one i&#x27;ve had it works really</li>
            <li>primer is reasonably priced and is without question the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Really its very nice !</li>
            <li>Great for people with super oily eyelids.</li>
            <li>The primer&#x27;s consistency is nice - easy to apply without pulling your eyelid.  </li>
            <li>Even with oily lids, I noticed mild creasing after 8 hours, so definitely a good one.</li>
            <li>Has a very very light perfumey smell to me :).</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan!</li>
            <li>It works OK in keeping the shadow put, but I do better without it now</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did because it does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Will edit soon and add if it managed to stop my makeup from running when swimming :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend NYX as a better option.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelids oily, which I love .</li>
            <li>I do think you can probably find a better primer</li>
            <li>but it will probably cost more.</li>
            <li>Makes your eye oil free!</li>
            <li>and this makes my eyeshadow (even the cheap ones!)</li>
            <li>stick like magic.</li>
            <li>The thinner the layer, the better results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and does its job pretty well, some days I find that it works better than others.</li>
            <li>Works great, decent price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone on 14 hours with plane trips and other stressful things and my eyeshadow is still perfect at the end.</li>
            <li>Easy application from applicator wand.</li>
            <li>UDPP is a lot more effective and the price difference isn&#x27;t that much.</li>
            <li>It has a gel-like consistency that applies smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>I brought this eye primer because it&#x27;s cheap and according to many supposed to be as good as urban decay primer potion.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li>I genuinely like this product.</li>
            <li>I have my fat product eyelid and lasts me all day in the shade in place thanks !!!</li>
            <li>At 9:00 p.m., my eye makeup looked just like it did when I first put it on at 5:00 a.m. that morning !!  </li>
            <li>keeps my super oily eyelids AND brows from sweating all my makeup off :) worth the wait</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye primers and haven&#x27;t found a single one I&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>And it came pretty fast :)</li>
            <li>Although most start off fine, by the end of the day, and especially after I&#x27;ve exercised, my shadow is creased.  </li>
            <li>It enhances my shadows, allows them to last longer, and has a nice doe-foot applicator.</li>
            <li>It took a while to get, since it ships from Korea, but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>It makes cheap eyeshadow look high end .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and will definitely purchase more when I run out of this !</li>
            <li>It glides on very smooth and helps my eyeshadow and eyeliner last longer than without it.</li>
            <li>It is only very lightly pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t correct any redness or discoloration.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented too, which is nice since many Korean cosmetics are heavily scented and I wouldn&#x27;t want that near my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>way better for me than Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Urban decays primer potions are much better</li>
            <li>Have been searching for an alternative to the Urban Decay primer as it has become hard to get and incredibly</li>
            <li>This eye shadow primer doesn&#x27;t work for me very well.</li>
            <li>Keeps the shade much longer.</li>
            <li>.. portion is pretty small but its cheaper than those urban decay primer potions .. works great.</li>
            <li>However, it only keeps makes my eye makeup bolder and smudge free for about 4-6 hours before it starts to crease.</li>
            <li>I have very oily lids and always have issues with creasing.</li>
            <li>I live in a hot climate 80-115 F .</li>
            <li>Even in high heat and humidity it doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>Eye shadow goes on evenly, is blendable and lasts a long time but is easy to remove with a regular eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s make the colors clearly!.</li>
            <li>A decent dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s primer potion.</li>
            <li>I also find it clumpy a bit hard to smooth onto my eyes (maybe old product?)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so it will last a long time I think.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper and affordable than a lot of these other primers though.</li>

            <li> Delivered faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was a little strange was how little of the product appears to be in the jar.</li>
            <li> expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I had found it in a cheaper alternative, as the other product worked for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I would say I can get an average of 10 hours of my makeup not smudging/creasing.</li>
            <li> The Urban Decay and Too Faced ones are ridiculously over priced and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good eye primer, I would stick with the urban decay one.</li>
            <li> The price of it less than the others primers but the quality stronger!.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied, to me it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I used to just use moisturizer on my eyes cuz that was expensive enough.</li>
            <li> I mean my eye lids are oily</li>
            <li> my eyeshadow had gone all creased and horrible looking which is just not good enough especially since I can use NARS eye primer and go without creasing all day.</li>
            <li> is a little awkward for putting the product all over your eyelid.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I brought this eye primer because it&#x27;s cheap and according to many supposed to be as good as urban decay primer potion. However having tried it out for a week it doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. I mean my eye lids are oily but I have seen people with oily eyelids claiming this to be amazing so I&#x27;m not why it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I put it on about 7am and by 11am my eyeshadow had gone all creased and horrible looking which is just not good enough especially since I can use NARS eye primer and go without creasing all day.</li>
            <li> It works OK in keeping the shadow put, but I do better without it now</li>
            <li> The primer&#x27;s consistency is nice - easy to apply without pulling your eyelid.  Eye shadow goes on evenly, is blendable and lasts a long time but is easy to remove with a regular eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeshadow primer for its price. It makes eyeshadow and eyeliners last way longer. Great for people with super oily eyelids.</li>
            <li> This works so well eyeshadow stays on till I wash off! Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good eye primer, I would stick with the urban decay one.</li>
            <li> What more can I say? It works well. It enhances my shadows, allows them to last longer, and has a nice doe-foot applicator. The only thing that was a little strange was how little of the product appears to be in the jar. Oh well.....</li>
            <li> Really its very nice ! Its make the eye shadow longet time without movement!. Also it&#x27;s make the colors clearly!. The price of it less than the others primers but the quality stronger!. Which is interesting thing! I like it! Nice experience</li>
            <li> Fabulous. It glides on very smooth and helps my eyeshadow and eyeliner last longer than without it. It also helps it not smudge. I would say I can get an average of 10 hours of my makeup not smudging/creasing. It took a while to get, since it ships from Korea, but it was worth the wait and I will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and I&#x27;m so glad I did because it does what it is supposed to.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, so it will last a long time I think.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow primer doesn&#x27;t work for me very well. I don&#x27;t think that I would buy it again. I will find other eye primer for mature age to use.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Has a very very light perfumey smell to me :). Keeps my makeup on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it might be waterproof, I don&#x27;t remember lol.. Will edit soon and add if it managed to stop my makeup from running when swimming :)</li>
            <li> Not satisfied, to me it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Delivered faster than expected. Great base for eyeshadow. Keeps the shade much longer. Love it</li>
            <li> Amazing. waterproof, rub-proof. keeps my super oily eyelids AND brows from sweating all my makeup off :) worth the wait</li>
            <li> This eye primer is the best one i&#x27;ve had it works really well i love it !! And it came pretty fast :)</li>
            <li> The primer okay.  It doesn&#x27;t hold very long for people with oily lids. Easy application from applicator wand. It&#x27;s much cheaper and affordable than a lot of these other primers though. I would recommend NYX as a better option. But if your on a budget I would go for this one.</li>
            <li> The primer works well enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to. The only problem I had was the shipping charge but it&#x27;s from Korea so I understand.</li>
            <li> OMG!! I have my fat product eyelid and lasts me all day in the shade in place thanks !!!</li>
            <li> Even though I am 51, I have oily skin and eyelids.  I also exercise.  I have tried multiple eyeshadow bases.  Although most start off fine, by the end of the day, and especially after I&#x27;ve exercised, my shadow is creased.  I used this product for the first time yesterday.  I exercised two different times during the course of the day for a total of over 2 hours.  At 9:00 p.m., my eye makeup looked just like it did when I first put it on at 5:00 a.m. that morning !!  It is lightweight, not cakey or chalky and feels great on the eyelid.  I would highly recommend it and will definitely purchase more when I run out of this !</li>
            <li> I love this primer! 😍😍😍. It makes cheap eyeshadow look high end . I have oily eyelids , yet this is an oily consistensy but it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelids oily, which I love . It last all day , I apply my eyshadow at 10 am and remove it at 11 pm and it still looks the same!!!. I live in a hot climate 80-115 F . And my eyeshadow still stays on. Best primer ever! .</li>
            <li> I would say that it definitely improved the staying power of my eye makeup.  It is a pretty thin, runny consistency and the doe foot applicator is a little awkward for putting the product all over your eyelid. I simply use the applicator to remove the product from the bottle, tap on my eye and then use my finger to apply all over my eyelid.  The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a lot of product, but overall it works as described.  I do think you can probably find a better primer but it will probably cost more. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Your shadow and eyeliner will stay on all day with this primer.. portion is pretty small but its cheaper than those urban decay primer potions .. works great.</li>
            <li> Makes your eye oil free! Eyeshadow and eyeliner sticks amazingly! It&#x27;s waterproof which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have combo/oily skin and this makes my eyeshadow (even the cheap ones!) stick like magic. Even with oily lids, I noticed mild creasing after 8 hours, so definitely a good one. A decent dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s primer potion.</li>
            <li> I dunt satisfied about this order because when i opened it, it.looks like its been opened and used!!!</li>
            <li> I used to just use moisturizer on my eyes cuz that was expensive enough. But now that I&#x27;ve tried this, I will be using it now on. It&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and does its job pretty well, some days I find that it works better than others. I also find it clumpy a bit hard to smooth onto my eyes (maybe old product?) and it makes my eyelashes white so I either have to spend time cleaning them out of my lashes or wear mascara.</li>
            <li> I genuinely like this product. However, it only keeps makes my eye makeup bolder and smudge free for about 4-6 hours before it starts to crease. The thinner the layer, the better results.</li>
            <li> lasts for long periods of time.. makes my eyeshadows stick, and hey.. cost efficient!!</li>
            <li> UDPP is a lot more effective and the price difference isn&#x27;t that much.</li>
            <li> best primer ever. way better for me than Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Works well but not as well as my urban decay primer. But I still like it as a sub</li>
            <li> Works great, decent price.</li>
            <li> Urban decays primer potions are much better</li>
            <li> Even though I have dry skin I have very oily lids and always have issues with creasing. I have tried many eye primers and haven&#x27;t found a single one I&#x27;ve liked. The Urban Decay and Too Faced ones are ridiculously over priced and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer is reasonably priced and is without question the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a gel-like consistency that applies smoothly and easily. It is only very lightly pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t correct any redness or discoloration. I have yet to find the point that my eyeshadows wear off or crease with this primer. I&#x27;ve gone on 14 hours with plane trips and other stressful things and my eyeshadow is still perfect at the end. Even in high heat and humidity it doesn&#x27;t budge. I am a huge fan! It&#x27;s unscented too, which is nice since many Korean cosmetics are heavily scented and I wouldn&#x27;t want that near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have been searching for an alternative to the Urban Decay primer as it has become hard to get and incredibly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I had found it in a cheaper alternative, as the other product worked for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Then back to greasy creased eyes and smeared eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;Gave this one a shot and it is working REMARKABLY well. Matte look still and have been through a downpour and my eye makeup was flawless. Wish the rest of me was.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect alternative. Recommend!</li>
