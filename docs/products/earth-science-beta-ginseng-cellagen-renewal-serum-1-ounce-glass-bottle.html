            <li>It&#x27;s extremely effective.</li>
            <li>I should also point out that my mother gave this a try and liked it as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product three times so far, and I am very impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it mostly evenings, but</li>
            <li>I will see if it is better than a serum I had before.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended to my mom and will be telling many others about it...</li>
            <li>and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I like this product much more than the I-cream from Earth Science.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it a try, but have been looking for something better now.</li>
            <li>, it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, easily applies.</li>
            <li>but in the winter time, I tend to get noticeable fine lines around my eyes, my mouth, and sometimes even my forehead.</li>
            <li>I expect no miracles, but this formula both tightens and fills in the fine</li>
            <li>I noticed fine wrinkles not so visible.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have have found such a great product that&#x27;s more natural than most cosmetics and is so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first because I was expecting it to be moisturizing as hyaluronic acid is renown for being able to hold</li>
            <li>Excellent all natural facial product.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, makes the skin smooth and helps make it more elastic.</li>
            <li>I am not yet 30, so I don&#x27;t have many fine lines, but the lines near my eyes are visibly reduced by this product.</li>
            <li>A new favorite.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, liked the previous formula better.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I noticed the difference in my face skin tone by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to find this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo much better than I expected :).  </li>
            <li>I use Cellagen in combination with the A/B Night Rejunevator, and results have been well worth the money.</li>
            <li>No side effects and is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Once I realized that applying a moisture over it was necessary, I started liking this serum much more.  </li>
            <li>I first tried their Azulene eye treatment, but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first one at the Choices store.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference after using this product.</li>
            <li>I really think that it helps to maintain my skin in balanced and moisturized condition.</li>
            <li>I really like it:</li>
            <li>Nothing to really say-seems to work somewhat</li>
            <li>plump* up my skin, making the fine lines under my eyes less noticeable and my skin more overall brightened.  </li>
            <li>It is by no means a miracle product, but I liked it enough to come buy more of it from Amazon (sadly my local Whole Foods is too small to carry this).  </li>
            <li>I bought this product a few months back from Whole Foods, and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>To Amazon&#x27;s credit, it was not only very simple to return both bottles, but their replacements arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also helps with the aging process I find as I am stepping into the early 30s.</li>
            <li>I will buy this product again especially for the decent value.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Earth Science&#x27;s facial lotions as well, so when I went searching for a night time cream or facial treatment, I looked to this particular company.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be on dry side, especially after washing face, and this product really helps out.</li>

            <li> I looked rather long to find a simple serum featuring Gensing. Here it is. Feels great on my skin. I&#x27;ve used it mostly evenings, but once in a while on dry days i use it in the morning,</li>
            <li> Excellent all natural facial product.  Delievered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> I just got it and used it once last night.  It feels good on my skin.  I will see if it is better than a serum I had before.</li>
            <li> I use this under my Mary Kay moisturizer as I want to minimize use of chemicals. It works really well, makes the skin smooth and helps make it more elastic. Mary Kay helps to moisturize all day, so this is for me a great combination.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite beauty products. Few products deliver on their promises, so this serum really stands out. I&#x27;m only 30 and I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, but in the winter time, I tend to get noticeable fine lines around my eyes, my mouth, and sometimes even my forehead. I noticed a difference in as little as a week after using this. It&#x27;s extremely effective. It&#x27;s also lightweight enough to use in the summer time. I plan on sticking with this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, fast absorbing g and leaves a great feeling throughout the day. I&#x27;m using it daily and my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to determine if this product is working. It is too expensive for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well!....I can&#x27;t believe it.  It&#x27;s sooo much better than I expected :).  It&#x27;s like a primer, treatment, and skin tone evener all in one!!  Gives your skin a great glow and more color.  You can wear it alone, under moisturizer, moisturizer and makeup, or just makeup.  I&#x27;m so excited to have have found such a great product that&#x27;s more natural than most cosmetics and is so inexpensive.  I have already recommended to my mom and will be telling many others about it... you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months back from Whole Foods, and liked it very much.  As a serum it has about the same consistency as a *very* thin gel (almost water-like) and it dries feeling slightly sticky.  I didn&#x27;t like it at first because I was expecting it to be moisturizing as hyaluronic acid is renown for being able to hold 1,000 times it&#x27;s weight in water (per molecule).  However, skin&#x27;s moisture content comes from both water and oil, and this serum lacks oil.  Once I realized that applying a moisture over it was necessary, I started liking this serum much more.  I believe it does *plump* up my skin, making the fine lines under my eyes less noticeable and my skin more overall brightened.  It is by no means a miracle product, but I liked it enough to come buy more of it from Amazon (sadly my local Whole Foods is too small to carry this).  I should also point out that my mother gave this a try and liked it as well (she didn&#x27;t react negatively to it, which considering how sensitive her skin is should mean anyone can use this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered two of these, one for me and one for her, and after a rather lengthy delay, I finally received both.  However because of how cold it was, I found that both bottles had frozen solid, and one had cracked open from the pressure.  To Amazon&#x27;s credit, it was not only very simple to return both bottles, but their replacements arrived quickly.  The content&#x27;s have a slight green tint instead of being clear, but I&#x27;ve seen other pictures of the serum looking like that, and it appears to work just as well.  So nice job people at Amazon!  I&#x27;d recommend both buying this product and buying it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I noticed the difference in my face skin tone by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to find this product.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason to spend money for expensive serum products from famous brands.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Earth Science&#x27;s facial lotions as well, so when I went searching for a night time cream or facial treatment, I looked to this particular company. I first tried their Azulene eye treatment, but it did nothing for me. I then tried a Source Naturals creme and then some drugstore Revlon creme. None of them felt like they were improving the quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally gave this a try and I am quite pleased. I expect no miracles, but this formula both tightens and fills in the fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells pretty good. A new favorite.</li>
            <li> I like this item and have used it for a long time. No side effects and is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference after using this product. It also makes my skin feel greasy and tight after application.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I use it sparingly around my eye area and the area around my mouth and it smoothes the lines. I use it under moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t change how my makeup goes on at all. It is a little sticky and you really have to be careful about getting too much out when you press down on the nozzle.</li>
            <li> This is already my 2nd bottle. I purchased the first one at the Choices store. I really think that it helps to maintain my skin in balanced and moisturized condition. It also helps with the aging process I find as I am stepping into the early 30s. I will buy this product again especially for the decent value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times so far, and I am very impressed by the results. I am not yet 30, so I don&#x27;t have many fine lines, but the lines near my eyes are visibly reduced by this product. It firms and tightens the skin noticably. I like this product much more than the I-cream from Earth Science. I use Cellagen in combination with the A/B Night Rejunevator, and results have been well worth the money. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this product morning and night. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like it: it works as in directions. It is not greasy, easily applies. My skin tends to be on dry side, especially after washing face, and this product really helps out. I noticed fine wrinkles not so visible.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, although they changed the formula a few years ago and I have to say, liked the previous formula better. With that one I (in the blue dropper bottle) I saw a dramatic difference in my skin and with the current formula, not so much. I&#x27;m still giving it a try, but have been looking for something better now. I do love Earth Science Almond Aloe Day Cream!</li>
            <li> Nothing to really say-seems to work somewhat but no real benefits that I saw after a couple of months of use.</li>
