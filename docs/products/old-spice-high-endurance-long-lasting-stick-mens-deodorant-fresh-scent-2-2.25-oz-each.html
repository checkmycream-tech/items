            <li>Good price when I got it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a good deal, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Am not a fan of anti-perspirants and am always on the lookout for good deodorants that do not have anti-perspirant chemicals,</li>
            <li>and this is a good one.</li>
            <li>Good stuff...</li>
            <li>Just not as good as the Wolfthorn line...</li>
            <li>This works to keep him smelling good even when we are doing yard work.</li>
            <li>My arm pit smells good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good scent too.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Still a good deal.</li>
            <li>It is very effective and the scent is nice</li>
            <li>and it is nice to have them smell nice using this great deodorant that blocks BO</li>
            <li>Just a fun company that makes an awesome product.</li>
            <li>works good and nice smell</li>
            <li>Great Product at a great price and very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>great product at a great economical price</li>
            <li>This scent is great; it&#x27;s not too strong or headache-inducing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really nice.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, and works very well.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite scent but a good deal.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to any Axe body spray or any kind of deodorant spray any day.</li>
            <li>I like that they have a nice selection of deodorants and it is not just all antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>my father liked it too.</li>
            <li>Smells good, Fiji smelled much better.</li>
            <li>The gel is nice and keeps the stink off all day.</li>
            <li>This stuff is quite nice.</li>
            <li>It seems most deoderants are good for a day, but by the end of the day it might need a refresh.</li>
            <li>Works well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>This is a steal, because its a great smelling deodorant and its an add on item, so it ends up being very economical.</li>
            <li>I used this, and it works remarkable against really strong sweat smell.</li>
            <li>I do not always want an antiperspirant as even your &amp;#34;pits&amp;#34; need to &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34;, but smelling good is NOT a bad thing!</li>
            <li>old spice is the best product.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice Deodorant is the best!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and good quality still.</li>
            <li>All of the scents I&#x27;ve tried are fresh and great smelling as well.</li>
            <li>Old Spice the best.</li>
            <li>I smell great now and price is right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And if you want to play it safe with regard to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease find a suitable alternative to aluminum-containing deodorants.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and people say I smell</li>
            <li>Glad I can order this item online, makes it convenient.</li>
            <li>for the deodorant, this works way better yuan a Speedstick.</li>
            <li>Oh sure, I&#x27;ve had flirtation with sticks, roll ons, powder</li>
            <li>I love the scent and have never had an issue with smell.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure you knew that.</li>
            <li>maybe for a sweaty day of yard work it will be okay.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>You have to look around for quite a while to figure out which deodorant option is actually a better deal than if you bought in stores, but this is one of those situations</li>
            <li>If anything, with this product I&#x27;ve had women smell my armpits and actually love the smell, and have caught one using it because it works (as an antiperspirant) so much better than her brand.</li>
            <li>and my husband never runs out :)</li>
            <li>I remember these used to have more product in each unit.  </li>
            <li>I get that the company is making more money, but that&#x27;s more trash that gets tossed in the dump.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, like this smell better.</li>
            <li>Okay product, but buying it from Amazon causes it to be an even better product.</li>
            <li>Works better than AXE.</li>
            <li>No issues ever! :)</li>
            <li>The benefit of the antiperspirant is that it lasts longer and does a better job.</li>
            <li>Here in Greece, it is not produced any more</li>
            <li>Love the scent, can&#x27;t find it here in Singapore.</li>
            <li>Quality product priced right and smells really really good.</li>
            <li>it smells really good, and more importantly my wife loves the way it smells, she encourages me to switch to this full time.</li>
            <li>very clean, and no odor</li>
            <li>Good - not sticky and will easily clean off in shower.. does keep fresh scent during the day..</li>
            <li>A very good product that I can not get enough of.</li>
            <li>However, you have to order $50 or more to get free shipping from Walmart</li>
            <li>those don&#x27;t do much good from the very start of application.</li>
            <li>This smells very cologne like and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>He loves how it applies easily and does not leave marks on his clothes.</li>
            <li>All I know is it rolls on easy</li>
            <li>Good price for the value pack; I&#x27;ve liked the Old Spice Fresh scent for a long time, great to find it more affordable.</li>
            <li>, it works fine too...</li>
            <li>so finding a twin pack for less then 4 is an awesome deal for me.</li>
            <li>A very good price for a fresh and lasting product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on the Amazon product page, the manufacturer claims that if you light yourself on fire and stand within the blast radius of a nuclear bomb, the deodorant won&#x27;t stop working.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the only product my husband has ever used all his life.</li>
            <li>Would pick up another group if it was available.  </li>
            <li>Available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After Shave, use it, lightly sprinkled, in a bowl of water in which I dip my towel as I shave my face-I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>cheap.  </li>
            <li>Basically, you buy one and get one free.</li>
            <li>He smells fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for fast delivery of a great product!!</li>
            <li>this product already knows how good Old Spice products are.</li>
            <li>Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Deodorant is the best, been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Good long lasting deo and very good price.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s clear, it smells awesome (ladies love it), and it keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li>It has very mild smell, not aggressive or overwhelming, but it masks perspiration scent very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy on the pits and gives off the nice aroma of the Old Spice family of fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Been using the fresh scent for 12 years now!</li>
            <li>Even after a long day of work, I still smell great.</li>
            <li>I believe i priced them cents more than at large superstore, but for free shipping i am willing to pay 15-20 cents more, plus i can do subscribe and save</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and not too overwhelming like some other brands.  </li>
            <li>There is no overpowering &#x27;manly&#x27; smell; just a refreshingly clean scent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a silky smooth feel which I like very well.</li>
            <li>You can get these for super cheap on Amazon too when they have sales (much cheaper than most stores).</li>
            <li>I like the Pure Sport scent better.</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>As a person who likes smelling nice, I always use Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>But I’m here to tell you that isn’t true.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 packs that bring 2 each at a good price cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t need much convincing.</li>
            <li>I have FULL confidence in this product.</li>
            <li>Old Spice is nice.  </li>
            <li>This deoderant not only smells good but does just what deoderant should do.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s good for anyone on a budget looking to add an extra item to their order to get some quick shopping done.</li>
            <li>Old Spice stated that these must be aged products that Amazon acquired at a discount and now is reselling as perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very potent and from one use can last for days without re-applying.</li>
            <li>i wore it out with friends the first weekend, and instantly when i got in the car that picked me up, a girl asked if i was wearing my grandads cologne and laughed.  </li>
            <li>Got to love old spice!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very crisp and fresh scent (hence the name).</li>
            <li>The problem with doing this - of course - is the fact that those deodorants that contain aluminum compounds such as Mitchum, etc. are usually the ones that work best and are the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Old Spice!</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t any real savings with this, but it was free shipping.  </li>
            <li>But what I like best about Old Spice is that their value packs lasts me for a few months and it saves me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love old spice</li>
            <li>fresh.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite deodorants from old spice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old favorite....</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a problem with Old Spice for many years.</li>
            <li>Always love the old spice smells, they&#x27;re not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells FRESH and prevents perspiring!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Old Spice makes much better deodorants that work as antiperspirants AND deodorants.  </li>
            <li>i realized that definetely worth its money</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been an Old Spice user for over a decade and love it.</li>
            <li>if u want to smell like fresh laundry and soap this is the right deo for you</li>
            <li>price was better than most of the other products.</li>
            <li>I like it much more than most other deodorants.</li>
            <li>Moved to the High Endurance stuff and it has always kept me smelling fine - or</li>
            <li>I am happily satisfied with my purchase of this product, i strongly suggest it, the scent Old Spice delivers in it&#x27;s products is one every man will enjoy when it comes to personal hygiene.</li>
            <li>Looks like I found the right deodorant for me.</li>
            <li>The size is right for traveling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it gets the job done and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I can live with the strong scent because of the price</li>
            <li>same product many have become familiar with, just smaller packaging more convenient for quickly getting thru TSA checkpoints &amp; gym bag.</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a crisp fresh smell and I feel fresh now.  </li>
            <li>The Old Spice deodorant is the next best product; lasts the entire day and the perfume is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>these are OK as a backup but the smell is overwhelming to wear everyday.</li>
            <li>A little more freshness than I&#x27;m used to in my deodorant, but overall good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Old Spice fan (I have their deodorant, body wash, shampoo, cologne, aftershave, and body spray).</li>
            <li>its exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>I could always smell a funny smell after exercising, but this deodorant solved that problem.</li>
            <li>While it has a nice scent, he doesn&#x27;t like how wet it goes on</li>
            <li>Tried this deodorant for the first time about a year ago, and liked the scent and also that is does not go on wet or sticky.  </li>
            <li>twin pack price with Add-on shipping makes this a bargain - much better than in our local market</li>
            <li>The price is pretty competitive.</li>
            <li>Even in hot, humid climate...</li>
            <li>Should have smelled it first.</li>
            <li>I have no issues with either the fresh fragrance or the effectiveness of this particular stick deodorant.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be the same person as the ads with the black Old Spice guy (which are awesome ads).</li>
            <li>deodorant with a most pleasing fragrance available here on Amazon.com that meets all of the aforementioned requirements is the following:</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and the smell is good.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care for the strong smell of this product&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34;, but it was cheaper than my regular brand is in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would hope.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good enough, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts.</li>
            <li>and I also like the \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; scented ones too</li>
            <li>Also seems to last a good long time, which is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blue color of these stains all located in the armpits makes it very easy to deduce their source, namely this particular type of Old Spice deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each stick lasts for about 12 to 16 months, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Fresh Scent Deodorant (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li>This is all I really use anymore.</li>
            <li>Very upset about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this blue-colored stick deodorant is the \\&quot;absolute pits\\&quot; with regard to permanently staining clothing.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>; feature that Amazon has for when you need just a few more $ to meet the necessary $35 for free shipping!</li>
            <li>Plus it smells amazing and ill use only this and people will tell me i smell good all day.</li>
            <li>Leaves arm pits very itchy.</li>
            <li>Very pungent smell.</li>
            <li>Product does work very well though</li>
            <li>Really like this deodorant</li>
            <li>I wish they make clear ones, I will be buying them again and again regardless and love the fact I can get it to my home without going to local store.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had it for about a few days and its good.</li>
            <li>It has some kind of extra ingredient (maybe extra alcohol) that doesn&#x27;t react well in the saltwater.  </li>
            <li>would you plug any other orifice on your body to stop you from expelling poisons for 12 hours or more?</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something new, I get positive responses from this.</li>
            <li>The size is smaller than the regular ones, but they are two and both still last a good while.</li>
            <li>I rubbed it on and made them smell less like taco bell and more like a well perfumed business man.</li>
            <li>Simply a classic.</li>
            <li>It smells decent and it works well.  </li>
            <li>scent is decent.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of high school.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like high school, this is it.</li>
            <li>Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant Twin Pack 4.5 Oz]]).</li>
            <li>I think in the end it cost a little more than what you would pay at retail store.</li>
            <li>This stuff really takes care of the old stink.</li>
            <li>I also very much like the fact that it does not contain any aluminum in light of a potential link between the long-term use of aluminum-containing products (such as most commonly used deodorants) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a real throw back still use a  straight razor.</li>
            <li>but either they simply didn&#x27;t get the job done or were sold on brand appeal and, if I&#x27;m going to put on cologne, under my arm isn&#x27;t the first, or tenth,</li>
            <li>But with Old Spice, I never have any of those issues!</li>
            <li>First deodorant that I ever used, and 50 years later, the go-to brand.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of the scent, whenever I wear Old Spice I usually get a comment from someone of the opposite sex of how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothes or on my.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is clear on the size</li>
            <li>and i am just about out of my old stuff</li>

            <li>I do, however, have a penchant for Old Spice</li>
            <li>Yes, as I put it on it was clear it was an Old Spice product but never during the day did anyone comment on my scent and it was a day when I hadn&#x27;t shaved.</li>
            <li>Been using Old Spice for years.</li>
            <li>been using old spice all my life.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use anti-antiperspirant anymore, just the old spice deodorant line.</li>
            <li>i told her no, then someone else said you&#x27;re wearing old spice or brute or something.  </li>
            <li>been using old spice for years.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t smell like the old spice cologne.  </li>
            <li>Old spice has been my deorderant since I was 14.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice has a lot of history.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for years &amp; years.</li>
            <li>If you like Old Spice, order this with confidence.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Old Spice brand since I was a a baby.</li>
            <li>I smell like old spice every time I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m in 30s); I guess that&#x27;s because my dad also used it, and got me started on it.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice is an old brand I used when I was in high school (53 - 57) and used it to attract women in college, and finally, got a 22  year old beauty when I was 30.  </li>
            <li>As a kid there was a stigma that Old Spice was only for older men and that if you used it you would smell like a an old man.  </li>
            <li>- I would strongly recommend always purchasing a clear or white product (no colorful dyes of any sort!)</li>
            <li>thats the main reason why i have to rate this so low</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something similar, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Have noticed &amp;#34;blue-ing&amp;#34; of armpits in some undershirts, but that seems to be heavily dependent on the color (only happens to white shirts) and material (happens mostly to 100% cotton shirts).</li>
            <li>I have historically only used white stick deodorant, as the other kind did not last as long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a whole lot, but I have recently noticed that my white t shirts have blueish-yellow pit stains.</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with different deodorants lately and found this to be the one I dislike the most.</li>
            <li>I was afraid I was going to get old overstock but all good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a fan of this particular scent and not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is a classic that I&#x27;ve been using off and on for a long time.</li>
            <li>however, this stuff is meant for 1 day only, you cannot skip a shower because even if you double up the next day there is still a very sweet funky aroma emitting from your pits.. however, i suppose i should be showering everyday anyhow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the color blue, and anyway, it&#x27;s clear once it&#x27;s on the skin.</li>
            <li>you like Old Spice deodorant products - or if you prefer a different product line</li>
            <li>It is the old packaging and design but still same product.</li>
            <li>I switched from my old smell (pure sport) because this pack was less cost per pack.</li>
            <li>Old Spice High Endurance doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, (not chalky, or slimy like other brands) and works all day.  </li>
            <li>Not a single stain on my shirts.</li>
            <li>Not the white solid stick or the soft gel.</li>
            <li>, I love Old Spice, and won&#x27;t ever change, especially those other white deodorants that are hard to rub on, they flake off, yuck....</li>
            <li>On a day when it was 87-cool for around here-I never felt more than slightly moist, there was no clumping, and no overwhelming odor.</li>
            <li>Its a value for money, you should not be expecting enough under this price, a light scent last at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>From a teen up until now, 15 years later, I always come back to Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that each stick contains 2.25 oz of deodorant, for a TOTAL of 4.5 oz; some customers thought at first that each stick was 4.5 oz, because the title is a little confusing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the course of some 2-3 years of regular daily use, the white undershirts that I regularly wear all have developed blue stains that will not go away with proper laundering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed it up with a few of the scents before; the only one I don&#x27;t like is the Pure Sport because it will burn my pits when I get in the ocean.  </li>
            <li>Also it has not much of a residue, it does not leave marks on clothes nor does it cause any discoloration like I had from some clear gel ones.</li>

            <li> Good price when I got it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Am not a fan of anti-perspirants and am always on the lookout for good deodorants that do not have anti-perspirant chemicals,</li>
            <li> and this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...</li>
            <li> Just not as good as the Wolfthorn line...</li>
            <li> This works to keep him smelling good even when we are doing yard work.</li>
            <li> My arm pit smells good</li>

            <li> and it is nice to have them smell nice using this great deodorant that blocks BO</li>
            <li> Just a fun company that makes an awesome product.</li>
            <li> works good and nice smell</li>
            <li> Great Product at a great price and very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> great product at a great economical price</li>
            <li> This scent is great; it&#x27;s not too strong or headache-inducing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, and works very well.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite scent but a good deal.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to any Axe body spray or any kind of deodorant spray any day.</li>
            <li> I like that they have a nice selection of deodorants and it is not just all antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> my father liked it too.</li>
            <li> Smells good, Fiji smelled much better.</li>
            <li> The gel is nice and keeps the stink off all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is quite nice.</li>
            <li> It seems most deoderants are good for a day, but by the end of the day it might need a refresh.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is a steal, because its a great smelling deodorant and its an add on item, so it ends up being very economical.</li>
            <li> I used this, and it works remarkable against really strong sweat smell.</li>
            <li> I do not always want an antiperspirant as even your &amp;#34;pits&amp;#34; need to &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34;, but smelling good is NOT a bad thing!</li>
            <li> old spice is the best product.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice Deodorant is the best!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and good quality still.</li>
            <li> All of the scents I&#x27;ve tried are fresh and great smelling as well.</li>
            <li> Old Spice the best.</li>
            <li> I smell great now and price is right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And if you want to play it safe with regard to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease find a suitable alternative to aluminum-containing deodorants.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and people say I smell</li>
            <li> Glad I can order this item online, makes it convenient.</li>
            <li> for the deodorant, this works way better yuan a Speedstick.</li>
            <li> Oh sure, I&#x27;ve had flirtation with sticks, roll ons, powder</li>
            <li> I love the scent and have never had an issue with smell.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure you knew that.</li>
            <li> maybe for a sweaty day of yard work it will be okay.  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> You have to look around for quite a while to figure out which deodorant option is actually a better deal than if you bought in stores, but this is one of those situations</li>
            <li> If anything, with this product I&#x27;ve had women smell my armpits and actually love the smell, and have caught one using it because it works (as an antiperspirant) so much better than her brand.</li>
            <li> and my husband never runs out :)</li>
            <li> I remember these used to have more product in each unit.  </li>
            <li> I get that the company is making more money, but that&#x27;s more trash that gets tossed in the dump.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others, like this smell better.</li>
            <li> Okay product, but buying it from Amazon causes it to be an even better product.</li>
            <li> Works better than AXE.</li>
            <li> No issues ever! :)</li>
            <li> The benefit of the antiperspirant is that it lasts longer and does a better job.</li>
            <li> Here in Greece, it is not produced any more</li>
            <li> Love the scent, can&#x27;t find it here in Singapore.</li>
            <li> Quality product priced right and smells really really good.</li>
            <li> it smells really good, and more importantly my wife loves the way it smells, she encourages me to switch to this full time.</li>
            <li> very clean, and no odor</li>
            <li> Good - not sticky and will easily clean off in shower.. does keep fresh scent during the day..</li>
            <li> A very good product that I can not get enough of.</li>
            <li> However, you have to order $50 or more to get free shipping from Walmart</li>
            <li> those don&#x27;t do much good from the very start of application.</li>
            <li> This smells very cologne like and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> He loves how it applies easily and does not leave marks on his clothes.</li>
            <li> All I know is it rolls on easy</li>
            <li> Good price for the value pack; I&#x27;ve liked the Old Spice Fresh scent for a long time, great to find it more affordable.</li>
            <li> , it works fine too...</li>
            <li> so finding a twin pack for less then 4 is an awesome deal for me.</li>
            <li> A very good price for a fresh and lasting product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on the Amazon product page, the manufacturer claims that if you light yourself on fire and stand within the blast radius of a nuclear bomb, the deodorant won&#x27;t stop working.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the only product my husband has ever used all his life.</li>
            <li> Would pick up another group if it was available.  </li>
            <li> Available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After Shave, use it, lightly sprinkled, in a bowl of water in which I dip my towel as I shave my face-I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> cheap.  </li>
            <li> Basically, you buy one and get one free.</li>
            <li> He smells fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for fast delivery of a great product!!</li>
            <li> this product already knows how good Old Spice products are.</li>
            <li> Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Deodorant is the best, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Good long lasting deo and very good price.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s clear, it smells awesome (ladies love it), and it keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li> It has very mild smell, not aggressive or overwhelming, but it masks perspiration scent very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy on the pits and gives off the nice aroma of the Old Spice family of fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Been using the fresh scent for 12 years now!</li>
            <li> Even after a long day of work, I still smell great.</li>
            <li> I believe i priced them cents more than at large superstore, but for free shipping i am willing to pay 15-20 cents more, plus i can do subscribe and save</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and not too overwhelming like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> There is no overpowering &#x27;manly&#x27; smell; just a refreshingly clean scent.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of a silky smooth feel which I like very well.</li>
            <li> You can get these for super cheap on Amazon too when they have sales (much cheaper than most stores).</li>
            <li> I like the Pure Sport scent better.</li>
            <li> Nothing special</li>
            <li> As a person who likes smelling nice, I always use Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> But I’m here to tell you that isn’t true.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs that bring 2 each at a good price cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t need much convincing.</li>
            <li> I have FULL confidence in this product.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is nice.  </li>
            <li> This deoderant not only smells good but does just what deoderant should do.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s good for anyone on a budget looking to add an extra item to their order to get some quick shopping done.</li>
            <li> Old Spice stated that these must be aged products that Amazon acquired at a discount and now is reselling as perfect.  </li>
            <li> Very potent and from one use can last for days without re-applying.</li>
            <li> i wore it out with friends the first weekend, and instantly when i got in the car that picked me up, a girl asked if i was wearing my grandads cologne and laughed.  </li>
            <li> Got to love old spice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very crisp and fresh scent (hence the name).</li>
            <li> The problem with doing this - of course - is the fact that those deodorants that contain aluminum compounds such as Mitchum, etc. are usually the ones that work best and are the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Old Spice!</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any real savings with this, but it was free shipping.  </li>
            <li> But what I like best about Old Spice is that their value packs lasts me for a few months and it saves me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love old spice</li>
            <li> fresh.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite deodorants from old spice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an old favorite....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a problem with Old Spice for many years.</li>
            <li> Always love the old spice smells, they&#x27;re not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells FRESH and prevents perspiring!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Old Spice makes much better deodorants that work as antiperspirants AND deodorants.  </li>
            <li> i realized that definetely worth its money</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been an Old Spice user for over a decade and love it.</li>
            <li> if u want to smell like fresh laundry and soap this is the right deo for you</li>
            <li> price was better than most of the other products.</li>
            <li> I like it much more than most other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Moved to the High Endurance stuff and it has always kept me smelling fine - or</li>
            <li> I am happily satisfied with my purchase of this product, i strongly suggest it, the scent Old Spice delivers in it&#x27;s products is one every man will enjoy when it comes to personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> Looks like I found the right deodorant for me.</li>
            <li> The size is right for traveling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it gets the job done and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I can live with the strong scent because of the price</li>
            <li> same product many have become familiar with, just smaller packaging more convenient for quickly getting thru TSA checkpoints &amp; gym bag.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a crisp fresh smell and I feel fresh now.  </li>
            <li> The Old Spice deodorant is the next best product; lasts the entire day and the perfume is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> these are OK as a backup but the smell is overwhelming to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> A little more freshness than I&#x27;m used to in my deodorant, but overall good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Old Spice fan (I have their deodorant, body wash, shampoo, cologne, aftershave, and body spray).</li>
            <li> its exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li> I could always smell a funny smell after exercising, but this deodorant solved that problem.</li>
            <li> While it has a nice scent, he doesn&#x27;t like how wet it goes on</li>
            <li> Tried this deodorant for the first time about a year ago, and liked the scent and also that is does not go on wet or sticky.  </li>
            <li> twin pack price with Add-on shipping makes this a bargain - much better than in our local market</li>
            <li> The price is pretty competitive.</li>
            <li> Even in hot, humid climate...</li>
            <li> Should have smelled it first.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with either the fresh fragrance or the effectiveness of this particular stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be the same person as the ads with the black Old Spice guy (which are awesome ads).</li>
            <li> deodorant with a most pleasing fragrance available here on Amazon.com that meets all of the aforementioned requirements is the following:</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and the smell is good.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care for the strong smell of this product&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34;, but it was cheaper than my regular brand is in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would hope.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good enough, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts.</li>
            <li> and I also like the \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; scented ones too</li>
            <li> Also seems to last a good long time, which is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blue color of these stains all located in the armpits makes it very easy to deduce their source, namely this particular type of Old Spice deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each stick lasts for about 12 to 16 months, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Fresh Scent Deodorant (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> This is all I really use anymore.</li>
            <li> Very upset about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this blue-colored stick deodorant is the \\&quot;absolute pits\\&quot; with regard to permanently staining clothing.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> ; feature that Amazon has for when you need just a few more $ to meet the necessary $35 for free shipping!</li>
            <li> Plus it smells amazing and ill use only this and people will tell me i smell good all day.</li>
            <li> Leaves arm pits very itchy.</li>
            <li> Very pungent smell.</li>
            <li> Product does work very well though</li>
            <li> Really like this deodorant</li>
            <li> I wish they make clear ones, I will be buying them again and again regardless and love the fact I can get it to my home without going to local store.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it for about a few days and its good.</li>
            <li> It has some kind of extra ingredient (maybe extra alcohol) that doesn&#x27;t react well in the saltwater.  </li>
            <li> would you plug any other orifice on your body to stop you from expelling poisons for 12 hours or more?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something new, I get positive responses from this.</li>
            <li> The size is smaller than the regular ones, but they are two and both still last a good while.</li>
            <li> I rubbed it on and made them smell less like taco bell and more like a well perfumed business man.</li>
            <li> Simply a classic.</li>
            <li> It smells decent and it works well.  </li>
            <li> scent is decent.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of high school.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like high school, this is it.</li>
            <li> Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant Twin Pack 4.5 Oz]]).</li>
            <li> I think in the end it cost a little more than what you would pay at retail store.</li>
            <li> This stuff really takes care of the old stink.</li>
            <li> I also very much like the fact that it does not contain any aluminum in light of a potential link between the long-term use of aluminum-containing products (such as most commonly used deodorants) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a real throw back still use a  straight razor.</li>
            <li> but either they simply didn&#x27;t get the job done or were sold on brand appeal and, if I&#x27;m going to put on cologne, under my arm isn&#x27;t the first, or tenth,</li>
            <li> But with Old Spice, I never have any of those issues!</li>
            <li> First deodorant that I ever used, and 50 years later, the go-to brand.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of the scent, whenever I wear Old Spice I usually get a comment from someone of the opposite sex of how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothes or on my.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is clear on the size</li>
            <li> and i am just about out of my old stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;T.S. Charles&lt;br /&gt;Author of young adult book, &amp;#34;Consumed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I do, however, have a penchant for Old Spice</li>
            <li> Yes, as I put it on it was clear it was an Old Spice product but never during the day did anyone comment on my scent and it was a day when I hadn&#x27;t shaved.</li>
            <li> Been using Old Spice for years.</li>
            <li> been using old spice all my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use anti-antiperspirant anymore, just the old spice deodorant line.</li>
            <li> i told her no, then someone else said you&#x27;re wearing old spice or brute or something.  </li>
            <li> been using old spice for years.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t smell like the old spice cologne.  </li>
            <li> Old spice has been my deorderant since I was 14.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice has a lot of history.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for years &amp; years.</li>
            <li> If you like Old Spice, order this with confidence.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Old Spice brand since I was a a baby.</li>
            <li> I smell like old spice every time I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m in 30s); I guess that&#x27;s because my dad also used it, and got me started on it.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice is an old brand I used when I was in high school (53 - 57) and used it to attract women in college, and finally, got a 22  year old beauty when I was 30.  </li>
            <li> As a kid there was a stigma that Old Spice was only for older men and that if you used it you would smell like a an old man.  </li>
            <li> - I would strongly recommend always purchasing a clear or white product (no colorful dyes of any sort!)</li>
            <li> thats the main reason why i have to rate this so low</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something similar, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have noticed &amp;#34;blue-ing&amp;#34; of armpits in some undershirts, but that seems to be heavily dependent on the color (only happens to white shirts) and material (happens mostly to 100% cotton shirts).</li>
            <li> I have historically only used white stick deodorant, as the other kind did not last as long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a whole lot, but I have recently noticed that my white t shirts have blueish-yellow pit stains.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different deodorants lately and found this to be the one I dislike the most.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was going to get old overstock but all good.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a fan of this particular scent and not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a classic that I&#x27;ve been using off and on for a long time.</li>
            <li> however, this stuff is meant for 1 day only, you cannot skip a shower because even if you double up the next day there is still a very sweet funky aroma emitting from your pits.. however, i suppose i should be showering everyday anyhow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the color blue, and anyway, it&#x27;s clear once it&#x27;s on the skin.</li>
            <li> you like Old Spice deodorant products - or if you prefer a different product line</li>
            <li> It is the old packaging and design but still same product.</li>
            <li> I switched from my old smell (pure sport) because this pack was less cost per pack.</li>
            <li> Old Spice High Endurance doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, (not chalky, or slimy like other brands) and works all day.  </li>
            <li> Not a single stain on my shirts.</li>
            <li> Not the white solid stick or the soft gel.</li>
            <li> , I love Old Spice, and won&#x27;t ever change, especially those other white deodorants that are hard to rub on, they flake off, yuck....</li>
            <li> On a day when it was 87-cool for around here-I never felt more than slightly moist, there was no clumping, and no overwhelming odor.</li>
            <li> Its a value for money, you should not be expecting enough under this price, a light scent last at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> From a teen up until now, 15 years later, I always come back to Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that each stick contains 2.25 oz of deodorant, for a TOTAL of 4.5 oz; some customers thought at first that each stick was 4.5 oz, because the title is a little confusing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the course of some 2-3 years of regular daily use, the white undershirts that I regularly wear all have developed blue stains that will not go away with proper laundering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed it up with a few of the scents before; the only one I don&#x27;t like is the Pure Sport because it will burn my pits when I get in the ocean.  </li>
            <li> Also it has not much of a residue, it does not leave marks on clothes nor does it cause any discoloration like I had from some clear gel ones.</li>
            <li> I have used old Spice brand for last 5 years and will never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> i count to 10 and patch the holes in the dry wall from where i blacked out and apparently punched them.</li>
            <li> Refuses all other products, will only wear Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I recommend old spice to any other bros out there.</li>
            <li> Used old spice because it&#x27;s what my dad had used, and frankly other deodorants dont compare.</li>
            <li> Will order larger ones next time, as these don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> I think next time around I&#x27;m going to try Degree after being an Old Spice user for the past decade.</li>
            <li> As long as I’m getting the compliments, I have no plans on changing brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer.  </li>
            <li> It is not loud.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, some will give me rashes and irritation, some don&#x27;t last all day, some stink, some will stain.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a particular dislike for the color blue, you might not be able to stand looking at a blue stick of deodorant every morning, and might go insane.</li>
            <li> This will give you the confidence to ask thousands of girls to dance in a single song.</li>
            <li> all four of them (two sets of two packs).&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Old Spice and complained....</li>
            <li> Arrived and packaged as expected.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I tried a few of the white/dry sticks or performance gels</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> No, not really.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a new formal or a bad batch or what, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other comments about leaving a &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; stain</li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t feel like it works as well as some of his other brands that he has used.</li>
            <li> not really sure how it&#x27;s possible?</li>
            <li> Extreme burn and itch.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the hard blue gel stick.</li>
            <li> Blasted my stink monsters into oblivion with powerful smell lasers.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for over ten years, and never once heard a complaint about having BO.</li>
            <li> , now it&#x27;s down to 2.25?  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Old Spice!!</li>
            <li> As long as it stays less expensive than my regular brand, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My husband works hard and he keeps dry using this product.</li>
            <li> Plus their insane commercials are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> i wore this a few times to work and no one said anything.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;ll throw in that this happened after years of heavy sweating in Texas summers.</li>
            <li> Even worse it feels gross when applying it as it is a gel like consistency</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what it came down to when compared to the prices around me.</li>
            <li> They usually think its some type of cologne, even though it’s just my deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and how it behaves I am not sure I can help you.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, small but useable.</li>
            <li> Check the price, as these are small (2.25 oz) sticks.  </li>
            <li> However, just keep in mind that the ones you usually buy at the store are 3.0 Oz</li>
            <li> I bought this for its price point, but this stuff absolutely ruins my skin; red, blotchy, raw and painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a deodorant that does not contain aluminium these days.  </li>
            <li> I think it used to be at least 3.5 oz each</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what folks tell me.  </li>
            <li> And now that their ads are so edgy, I get to feel like a hipster.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to be disappointed or switch to a new brand.</li>
            <li> The only other place I have ever seen this two-for-one deal is at Wal-Mart and since I hate having to get all dressed up to go there, amazon has saved me once again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had a problem with deodorant failure from this product.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> Also, the script on the back about midgets with lasers is absolutely stupid.  </li>
            <li> Very durable, protects from morning till evening (in worst</li>
            <li> These are overage and outdated product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands a couple times and was always disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> ANd then ill tell them</li>
            <li> Buy it you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> in fact if you ask a doctor they would tell you that plugging up sweat pores is a really bad idea.</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm I no longer suffer from bad odder from the pits.</li>
            <li> I HATE</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any deodorant for about a week and my stench was awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Havent used it yet bought because there was a coupon and i am just about out of my old stuff</li>
            <li> Leaves underarms sticky.</li>
            <li> old spice is the best product.  why go to the store and buy 1 when you can buy 2 for the price of 1!  didnt expect to get such a deal!</li>
            <li> It made a man out of my son</li>
            <li> This stuff really takes care of the old stink. I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice. It smells awesome, and works very well. Each stick lasts for about 12 to 16 months, depending on how much you use. Keep in mind that each stick contains 2.25 oz of deodorant, for a TOTAL of 4.5 oz; some customers thought at first that each stick was 4.5 oz, because the title is a little confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic container may be red, but the deodorant itself appears blue. I don&#x27;t mind the color blue, and anyway, it&#x27;s clear once it&#x27;s on the skin. However, if you have a particular dislike for the color blue, you might not be able to stand looking at a blue stick of deodorant every morning, and might go insane. Just a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on the Amazon product page, the manufacturer claims that if you light yourself on fire and stand within the blast radius of a nuclear bomb, the deodorant won&#x27;t stop working. I have not tested that yet, but once I have I&#x27;ll try to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this deodorant, consider purchasing [[ASIN:B00BL18JA0 Old Spice Fresh Scent Deodorant (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> I love old spice its is the only deodorant i use and prefer  and it came when i needed it to</li>
            <li> Its a value for money, you should not be expecting enough under this price, a light scent last at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the only product my husband has ever used all his life. Refuses all other products, will only wear Old Spice. Great smell, works well on spouse. He is happy so I am happy. Price was good too. Glad I can order this item online, makes it convenient. Would recommend to others at all cost. No complaints what so ever!!</li>
            <li> I have used old Spice brand for last 5 years and will never go back to any other brand. Only thing I dont like is the blue stains it can make sometimes on white shirts. I wish they make clear ones, I will be buying them again and again regardless and love the fact I can get it to my home without going to local store.</li>
            <li> A deodorant that does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Got to love old spice! Been using the fresh scent for 12 years now! Amazon saved me a trip to Walmart!</li>
            <li> Old Spice Deodorant is the best!  The smell is pleasant and not too overwhelming like some other brands.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Old Spice!!</li>
            <li> Thought this was antiperspirant... its not. Its just a gel deodorant. I suppose this works if you don&#x27;t sweat, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is all I really use anymore. Very potent and from one use can last for days without re-applying. Just what I need. Very good price also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using this for a few years now. Smell good. No surprises. its exactly what you would expect. two things of deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a crisp fresh smell and I feel fresh now.  I recommend old spice to any other bros out there.</li>
            <li> this is a deodorant only, which i prefer. i don&#x27;t have a job where i sweat in people faces so not concerned about the anti-perspreant part. in fact if you ask a doctor they would tell you that plugging up sweat pores is a really bad idea. would you plug any other orifice on your body to stop you from expelling poisons for 12 hours or more? think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the deodorant, this works way better yuan a Speedstick. those don&#x27;t do much good from the very start of application. wish i had been using this one all along, does well to reduce odor, not cover it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a whole lot, but I have recently noticed that my white t shirts have blueish-yellow pit stains. Very upset about it. Now i wear undershirts when I can</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any real savings with this, but it was free shipping.  I think in the end it cost a little more than what you would pay at retail store.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have ever used. Very durable, protects from morning till evening (in worst cases)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and good quality still.</li>
            <li> Great deal, Prime shipping. Smells good. No reason not to like it.&lt;br /&gt;The price was better than most of the other products.</li>
            <li> It took me years to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t make me break out when I applied it to my underarms. Then I found this product. I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, but it doesn&#x27;t. Then the genius marketers decided that it didn&#x27;t sell enough and pulled it from the shelves and I could not find it all over again. Then I looked on Amazon and lo &amp; behold. This stuff works great for me.</li>
            <li> Good price for this twin pack but I&#x27;m not a fan of this particular scent and not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Blasted my stink monsters into oblivion with powerful smell lasers.  Keeps the ladies beating at my door day and night.</li>
            <li> This work great on my pit&#x27;s. I rubbed it on and made them smell less like taco bell and more like a well perfumed business man.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price when coming in as an addon.  Would pick up another group if it was available.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I been using this brand for years. The only thing that Walmart have a bigger size (also twin pack) so It&#x27;s a bit cheaper in Walmart. However, you have to order $50 or more to get free shipping from Walmart</li>
            <li> As a person who likes smelling nice, I always use Old Spice.  As a kid there was a stigma that Old Spice was only for older men and that if you used it you would smell like a an old man.  But I’m here to tell you that isn’t true.  Regardless of the scent, whenever I wear Old Spice I usually get a comment from someone of the opposite sex of how nice I smell.  They usually think its some type of cologne, even though it’s just my deodorant.  As long as I’m getting the compliments, I have no plans on changing brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.S. Charles&lt;br /&gt;Author of young adult book, &amp;#34;Consumed.&amp;#34; Available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for its price point, but this stuff absolutely ruins my skin; red, blotchy, raw and painful. PLEASE be careful about your purchase, even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is NOT an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Have you ever even smelled (smelt?) Zeus? Of course you haven&#x27;t. So take my word for it. He smells like this. This will give you the confidence to ask thousands of girls to dance in a single song. Just don&#x27;t strike them with lightning bolts. They tend to kick you out of the club for shenanigans like that.</li>
            <li> I am a spray on man, have been for decades. Oh sure, I&#x27;ve had flirtation with sticks, roll ons, powder but either they simply didn&#x27;t get the job done or were sold on brand appeal and, if I&#x27;m going to put on cologne, under my arm isn&#x27;t the first, or tenth, place I&#x27;ll put it. I do, however, have a penchant for Old Spice After Shave, use it, lightly sprinkled, in a bowl of water in which I dip my towel as I shave my face-I&#x27;m a real throw back still use a  straight razor. Brand loyalty over took me-as well as their being offered on sale-thinking, well, if I don&#x27;t like it I&#x27;ll stick in my guest bedroom for those arrive without everything they need. But now I&#x27;ve used it and will put my sprays in the guest bedroom. This works. On a day when it was 87-cool for around here-I never felt more than slightly moist, there was no clumping, and no overwhelming odor. Yes, as I put it on it was clear it was an Old Spice product but never during the day did anyone comment on my scent and it was a day when I hadn&#x27;t shaved. So it works. I&#x27;ve read other comments about leaving a &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; stain but I haven&#x27;t noticed it and I was wearing a white shirt under a suit coat. Six months later I&#x27;ll let you know if there&#x27;s been a change.</li>
            <li> if u want to smell like fresh laundry and soap this is the right deo for you&lt;br /&gt;its blue as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this reorder ant for years!! I love the scent and have never had an issue with smell. Even playing football and basketball. If you are looking for something that will stop sweat I would recommend Sweat Block, I use that along with this item, and never have an issue.</li>
            <li> Great value, and lasts for quite sometime! Haven&#x27;t noticed any lack of perspiration protection whatsoever! Would recommended to those who are on the job or athletes.</li>
            <li> Been using Old Spice for years. Not a single stain on my shirts. Good protection. Good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Old Spice fan (I have their deodorant, body wash, shampoo, cologne, aftershave, and body spray). This scent is great; it&#x27;s not too strong or headache-inducing. It&#x27;s a very crisp and fresh scent (hence the name). You can get these for super cheap on Amazon too when they have sales (much cheaper than most stores).</li>
            <li> Reminds me of high school. If you want to smell like high school, this is it. But I&#x27;m sure you knew that.</li>
            <li> This smells very cologne like and not in a good way.  Not something I will use when going to work or in public...maybe for a sweaty day of yard work it will be okay.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> been using old spice all my life. no surprises here. just what you expect. i just wish amazon sold a variety pack.</li>
            <li> this is a great deodorant and very good value. stores uslaly charge somewhere around $8.00 for the same thing that i can get in this add on for $4.00. great smell to the product personally it&#x27;s the only thing that i don&#x27;t have a reaction to.</li>
            <li> Came on time.&lt;br /&gt;Standard size and product as grocery or pharmacy carry.&lt;br /&gt;Price was right.&lt;br /&gt;Was fresh. I was afraid I was going to get old overstock but all good.</li>
            <li> lots of boys at our house and it is nice to have them smell nice using this great deodorant that blocks BO</li>
            <li> this is the stuff.....ever since switching over to this deodorant, ALL of the ladies have been flocking to me. they all can&#x27;t stop getting up  on me ...it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s the axe body spray effect you see in commercials, but it&#x27;s better, because it&#x27;s not a spray, you dont smell like an ax (they smell like trees and wood), and you don&#x27;t blind people with the amount/intense odor with axe.</li>
            <li> I am happily satisfied with my purchase of this product, i strongly suggest it, the scent Old Spice delivers in it&#x27;s products is one every man will enjoy when it comes to personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> Simply a classic. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with either the fresh fragrance or the effectiveness of this particular stick deodorant. I also very much like the fact that it does not contain any aluminum in light of a potential link between the long-term use of aluminum-containing products (such as most commonly used deodorants) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this blue-colored stick deodorant is the \\&quot;absolute pits\\&quot; with regard to permanently staining clothing. Over the course of some 2-3 years of regular daily use, the white undershirts that I regularly wear all have developed blue stains that will not go away with proper laundering. The blue color of these stains all located in the armpits makes it very easy to deduce their source, namely this particular type of Old Spice deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Old Spice deodorant products - or if you prefer a different product line - I would strongly recommend always purchasing a clear or white product (no colorful dyes of any sort!) to avoid any such potential staining problems in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you want to play it safe with regard to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease find a suitable alternative to aluminum-containing deodorants. The problem with doing this - of course - is the fact that those deodorants that contain aluminum compounds such as Mitchum, etc. are usually the ones that work best and are the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deodorant with a most pleasing fragrance available here on Amazon.com that meets all of the aforementioned requirements is the following: \\&quot;Herban Cowboy Forest Deodorant Maximum Protection, 2.8 Ounce\\&quot; (see my review). Perhaps you too should take it for a spin like I am doing at the moment?</li>
            <li> Not my favorite scent but a good deal. I don&#x27;t even use anti-antiperspirant anymore, just the old spice deodorant line.</li>
            <li> The size of the stick inside keeps shrinking.... Still, good quality deodorant</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion and was shipped as described. Good price when I got it. If you don&#x27;t already know what this si and how it behaves I am not sure I can help you.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is an old brand I used when I was in high school (53 - 57) and used it to attract women in college, and finally, got a 22  year old beauty when I was 30.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It is very effective and the scent is nice</li>
            <li> i wore this a few times to work and no one said anything.  i wore it out with friends the first weekend, and instantly when i got in the car that picked me up, a girl asked if i was wearing my grandads cologne and laughed.  i told her no, then someone else said you&#x27;re wearing old spice or brute or something.  then when i was out that night at our friends house, another girl made a comment about the way i smelled, that i smelled like her dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, if you wanna smell like grandad, buy this</li>
            <li> I though this product was two 4.5oz, it is actually two 2.25 Oz deodorant. I thought I was getting a good deal, but I didn&#x27;t. Product is good and smells great.</li>
            <li> ...according to my Dad! I purchased this product for my Dad and he loves it (for some reason, he prefers colored deodorants instead of white ones; I do not know why, though). So, if my Dad is happy, then that makes me happy, too! Also, the price is very similar to that in inexpensive stores. Good buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Old Spice. It smells great and it lasts throughout the day. I prefer this to any Axe body spray or any kind of deodorant spray any day. But what I like best about Old Spice is that their value packs lasts me for a few months and it saves me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product and who knows, you&#x27;re girlfriend, wife or any girl that passes your way may too.</li>
            <li> Arrived and packaged as expected.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it for about a few days and its good. I didn&#x27;t have any deodorant for about a week and my stench was awful. I used this, and it works remarkable against really strong sweat smell. I bought 2 packs that bring 2 each at a good price cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with my purchase. This deodorant works great. I could always smell a funny smell after exercising, but this deodorant solved that problem. It is long lasting and the smell is good. Looks like I found the right deodorant for me.</li>
            <li> The only other place I have ever seen this two-for-one deal is at Wal-Mart and since I hate having to get all dressed up to go there, amazon has saved me once again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-shirtless and deodorized</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  While it has a nice scent, he doesn&#x27;t like how wet it goes on and he doesn&#x27;t feel like it works as well as some of his other brands that he has used.</li>
            <li> cheap.  been using old spice for years.  very clean, and no odor</li>
            <li> Basically, you buy one and get one free. At least that&#x27;s what it came down to when compared to the prices around me. Really didn&#x27;t need much convincing.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t smell like the old spice cologne.  It smells decent and it works well.  I prefer the powder variety but this is my backup stick.</li>
            <li> I like it. I definitely don&#x27;t love it. I like the Pure Sport scent better. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. I&#x27;m definitely not smelling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; by the end of the day. I think next time around I&#x27;m going to try Degree after being an Old Spice user for the past decade.</li>
            <li> I love Old Spice! I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it. From a teen up until now, 15 years later, I always come back to Old Spice. I have tried other brands, some will give me rashes and irritation, some don&#x27;t last all day, some stink, some will stain. But with Old Spice, I never have any of those issues! I like that they have a nice selection of deodorants and it is not just all antiperspirants. All of the scents I&#x27;ve tried are fresh and great smelling as well.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is looking sy this product already knows how good Old Spice products are. They&#x27;re the only deodorant I use!</li>
            <li> Very cheap and people say I smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GUESS it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it works. And it&#x27;s good for anyone on a budget looking to add an extra item to their order to get some quick shopping done.</li>
            <li> works good and nice smell</li>
            <li> Better than expected. I have historically only used white stick deodorant, as the other kind did not last as long. Because of the great price on these, I gave it a go.  This product is very good and lasts all day. Smells great as well. I would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> (see the pun there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the strong smell of this product&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34;, but it was cheaper than my regular brand is in the stores.  I can live with the strong scent because of the price (Yes, I know I&#x27;m cheap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it works fine too...I&#x27;ve not had a problem with deodorant failure from this product. As long as it stays less expensive than my regular brand, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I have every used and the only I ever imagine myself using. Great price when bought in bundle...</li>
            <li> Good price for the value pack; I&#x27;ve liked the Old Spice Fresh scent for a long time, great to find it more affordable.</li>
            <li> Awesome vaule! Waay cheaper than in the store.. not really sure how it&#x27;s possible? But I&#x27;ll stock up while I can...</li>
            <li> Very Nice product....Must buy</li>
            <li> A very good product that I can not get enough of. Quality product priced right and smells really really good.</li>
            <li> These are overage and outdated product.  When I opened them, they crumbled and flaked....all four of them (two sets of two packs).&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Old Spice and complained....Old Spice stated that these must be aged products that Amazon acquired at a discount and now is reselling as perfect.  Scam Amazon.</li>
            <li> You have to look around for quite a while to figure out which deodorant option is actually a better deal than if you bought in stores, but this is one of those situations</li>
            <li> Tried this deodorant for the first time about a year ago, and liked the scent and also that is does not go on wet or sticky.  Also seems to last a good long time, which is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This twin pack price with Add-on shipping makes this a bargain - much better than in our local market and I also like the \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; scented ones too ([[ASIN:B008CC3NHK Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant Twin Pack 4.5 Oz]]). The size is right for traveling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am not a fan of anti-perspirants and am always on the lookout for good deodorants that do not have anti-perspirant chemicals, and this is a good one. If you are looking for something similar, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over ten years, and never once heard a complaint about having BO. When I was younger I tried a few of the white/dry sticks or performance gels but I either get clumps or just feel like I&#x27;ve coated my armpit in grease. If anything, with this product I&#x27;ve had women smell my armpits and actually love the smell, and have caught one using it because it works (as an antiperspirant) so much better than her brand. Have noticed &amp;#34;blue-ing&amp;#34; of armpits in some undershirts, but that seems to be heavily dependent on the color (only happens to white shirts) and material (happens mostly to 100% cotton shirts). Plus, I&#x27;ll throw in that this happened after years of heavy sweating in Texas summers. This isn&#x27;t enough to detract from my preference for this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff... Just not as good as the Wolfthorn line...</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deodorant my husband will use. He loves how it applies easily and does not leave marks on his clothes. He smells fantastic as well. There is no overpowering &#x27;manly&#x27; smell; just a refreshingly clean scent. This works to keep him smelling good even when we are doing yard work.</li>
            <li> i thought i was receiving 2 4.5oz but instead it was a combined 4.5Oz total. thats the main reason why i have to rate this so low i might just stick to swagger</li>
            <li> Great Product at a great price and very fast shipping!  Will definitely purchase again from this company.</li>
            <li> it smells really good, and more importantly my wife loves the way it smells, she encourages me to switch to this full time. however, this stuff is meant for 1 day only, you cannot skip a shower because even if you double up the next day there is still a very sweet funky aroma emitting from your pits.. however, i suppose i should be showering everyday anyhow.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would hope.</li>
            <li> My arm pit smells good I swear</li>
            <li> Does not clog pores,,,,,works well...</li>
            <li> Do a great job with oder</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a deodorant that does not contain aluminium these days.  I used to buy the Gillette gel deodorant, but can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere.  The Old Spice deodorant is the next best product; lasts the entire day and the perfume is not overpowering.  I also like the convenience of getting these delivered thru Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save service.  The price is pretty competitive.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite deodorants from old spice. It is the old packaging and design but still same product. One stick of this sells for almost 5 dollars at my local store so finding a twin pack for less then 4 is an awesome deal for me. Works great and smells great. Even after a long day of work, I still smell great. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> great value for the convenience. I believe i priced them cents more than at large superstore, but for free shipping i am willing to pay 15-20 cents more, plus i can do subscribe and save and my husband never runs out :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 22 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands a couple times and was always disappointed.  Old Spice High Endurance doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, (not chalky, or slimy like other brands) and works all day.  My only qualm is that they keep shrinking the size of each product.  I remember these used to have more product in each unit.  I think it used to be at least 3.5 oz each, now it&#x27;s down to 2.25?  I get that the company is making more money, but that&#x27;s more trash that gets tossed in the dump.  Also, the script on the back about midgets with lasers is absolutely stupid.  Please fire the person that came up with this.  It can&#x27;t be the same person as the ads with the black Old Spice guy (which are awesome ads).</li>
            <li> A gift for my son&#x27;s stocking.  His preference. I do like the &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; feature that Amazon has for when you need just a few more $ to meet the necessary $35 for free shipping!</li>
            <li> same product many have become familiar with, just smaller packaging more convenient for quickly getting thru TSA checkpoints &amp; gym bag.</li>
            <li> My husband like this and wears it all the time. It&#x27;s an old favorite.... my father liked it too.</li>
            <li> Good long lasting deo and very good price.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a problem with Old Spice for many years. Opened up this pack and after a couple days my pits had chemical burns! I don&#x27;t know if this is a new formal or a bad batch or what, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Never using this again!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I didn&#x27;t read closely enough. I wanted &amp;#34;Antiperspirant&amp;#34; deoderant</li>
            <li> Good - not sticky and will easily clean off in shower.. does keep fresh scent during the day..</li>
            <li> Smells and works great</li>
            <li> Smells good, Fiji smelled much better. Dolce &amp; Gabanna smells best.</li>
            <li> Used old spice because it&#x27;s what my dad had used, and frankly other deodorants dont compare. Plus their insane commercials are AMAZING. and the warning lable on the container is awesome. Just a fun company that makes an awesome product. Plus it smells amazing and ill use only this and people will tell me i smell good all day. ANd then ill tell them oh i just farted, then they never talk to me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE THING I HATE THOUGH is when i get to like the last 1/4 THE DEODORANT FALLS OFF (or out depending on your life views and philosophy) and its so frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i count to 10 and patch the holes in the dry wall from where i blacked out and apparently punched them.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different deodorants lately and found this to be the one I dislike the most. Leaves arm pits very itchy.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Been using for over a decade and I have yet to be disappointed or switch to a new brand.</li>
            <li> Old Spice the best. I&#x27;ve tried many others, like this smell better.</li>
            <li> Always love the old spice smells, they&#x27;re not too overpowering. I do prefer the sprays, but this was on sale, so I couldn&#x27;t resist buying.</li>
            <li> The size is smaller than the regular ones, but they are two and both still last a good while. It&#x27;s a good scent too.</li>
            <li> Old spice has been my deorderant since I was 14.  I will be a life long customer.  The gel is nice and keeps the stink off all day.</li>
            <li> This is a steal, because its a great smelling deodorant and its an add on item, so it ends up being very economical. Okay product, but buying it from Amazon causes it to be an even better product.</li>
            <li> I smell great now and price is right.  I am getting all the ladies now with this great smell.  Works better than AXE.</li>
            <li> Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Deodorant is the best, been using it for years. Old Spice has a lot of history. Buy it you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for years &amp; years. I have FULL confidence in this product. Even in hot, humid climate...IT WORKS !!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pungent smell. A little more freshness than I&#x27;m used to in my deodorant, but overall good.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for fast delivery of a great product!!</li>
            <li> My go to deodorant ! No issues ever! :)&lt;br /&gt;Smells FRESH and prevents perspiring!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and last all day</li>
            <li> If you sweat a lot, try switching from an antiperspirant to a deodorant.  That was my problem.  antiperspirants irritate my underarms and make me sweat.  This stuff smells good enough, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is nice.  Doesn&#x27;t leave stains in the shirt and keeps the goat smell out of you for almost a day...</li>
            <li> If you like Old Spice, order this with confidence.  If you&#x27;re looking for something new, I get positive responses from this.</li>
            <li> Note: this is the gel stick. Not the white solid stick or the soft gel. It&#x27;s the hard blue gel stick.</li>
            <li> This is a sticky blue gel that my husband said did not work at all.  Even worse it feels gross when applying it as it is a gel like consistency but in a stick deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Old Spice makes much better deodorants that work as antiperspirants AND deodorants.  This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> A while ago I became concerned regarding the metals contained in antiperspirants. I realized, in my case, I can stand to sweat because I am always in the heat anyway, but I don&#x27;t want to smell. I tried this product and you know what? This stuff is quite nice. It is not loud. It does not smell like perfume. And anyone who has traveled in the Middle East can appreciate, it doesn&#x27;t smell as if someone is trying to &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; body odor with scent. It is a good product and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, small but useable. Will order larger ones next time, as these don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Not their best sent, but good value</li>
            <li> This is a classic that I&#x27;ve been using off and on for a long time. I keep switching to anti antiperspirant, then my undershirts and even some t-shirts start to get pit stain and I switch back. The benefit of the antiperspirant is that it lasts longer and does a better job. It seems most deoderants are good for a day, but by the end of the day it might need a refresh. If you don&#x27;t like pit stain and want something with a pleasant smell. This is a great choice!</li>
            <li> Just what my son wanted</li>
            <li> Check the price, as these are small (2.25 oz) sticks.  I love the product, but this size wasn&#x27;t the greatest value.</li>
            <li> Here in Greece, it is not produced any more so I decided to buy for amazon anr i realized that definetely worth its money</li>
            <li> I do not always want an antiperspirant as even your &amp;#34;pits&amp;#34; need to &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34;, but smelling good is NOT a bad thing!</li>
            <li> I picked the pack of petite priciness and potentially propagated a perilous problem.  I switched from my old smell (pure sport) because this pack was less cost per pack. I also bought like 20 of them. Should have smelled it first. don&#x27;t make that mistake. Product does work very well though, I just don&#x27;t like this scent. I have been using Old Spice brand since I was a a baby.</li>
            <li> Good value. scent is decent.</li>
            <li> I like it much more than most other deodorants. It has very mild smell, not aggressive or overwhelming, but it masks perspiration scent very well. Also it has not much of a residue, it does not leave marks on clothes nor does it cause any discoloration like I had from some clear gel ones. It also does not have that sticky-dry feel when you touch your underarms, it&#x27;s more of a silky smooth feel which I like very well.</li>
            <li> I smell like old spice every time I use this stuff. 10/10 would Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> great product at a great economical price</li>
            <li> Works well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, can&#x27;t find it here in Singapore.</li>
            <li> Nothing special but it gets the job done and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Really like this deodorant it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Made me break out.  Plain and simple.  Extreme burn and itch.  Wowzer.</li>
            <li> I bought because they were on sale and needed something to travel with in case the TSA wanted to make me pitch it. I&#x27;m a lifetime speedstick guy and these are OK as a backup but the smell is overwhelming to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Got this pack through subscribe and save.  It does its job and has a great smell.  Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothes or on my.  I like it.</li>
            <li> A very good price for a fresh and lasting product. Took me a while to find a deodorant that would work. This product works like a charm I no longer suffer from bad odder from the pits.</li>
            <li> First deodorant that I ever used, and 50 years later, the go-to brand.  Moved to the High Endurance stuff and it has always kept me smelling fine - or at least that&#x27;s what folks tell me.  Do not like anti-perspirants that irritate.  This stuff is easy on the pits and gives off the nice aroma of the Old Spice family of fragrances.  And now that their ads are so edgy, I get to feel like a hipster.  No, not really.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been an Old Spice user for over a decade and love it. However, just keep in mind that the ones you usually buy at the store are 3.0 Oz and this is only 2.25 per stick. Amazon is clear on the size but I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. Still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking i was getting 2- 4.5 oz containers but it was 2.25 oz I will learn i read and still can&#x27;t  see anything</li>
            <li> This deoderant not only smells good but does just what deoderant should do. My husband works hard and he keeps dry using this product. He has used it for years with great results. This comes automatically through subscribe and ship. If you haven&#x27;t gotten product using this feature you should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m in 30s); I guess that&#x27;s because my dad also used it, and got me started on it.  All I know is it rolls on easy, it&#x27;s clear, it smells awesome (ladies love it), and it keeps me dry.  I&#x27;ve changed it up with a few of the scents before; the only one I don&#x27;t like is the Pure Sport because it will burn my pits when I get in the ocean.  It has some kind of extra ingredient (maybe extra alcohol) that doesn&#x27;t react well in the saltwater.  Other than that, I love Old Spice, and won&#x27;t ever change, especially those other white deodorants that are hard to rub on, they flake off, yuck....don&#x27;t know how people do that.</li>
