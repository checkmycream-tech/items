    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>When I use this I get compliments on my hair (from women, lol!,</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best.</li>
            <li>So researched &amp; found Fekkai hair mask, the best stuff on earth!</li>
            <li>but I find this conditioner to be close to perfect.  </li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>My hair came out looking beautiful because I used this conditioner between dye jobs that day.  </li>
            <li>and it smells great.</li>
            <li>the smell is great and it does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>And I know that over time it greatly improves my hair quality.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Loved the price too.</li>
            <li>(regardless of how matted from teasing your hair has become).&lt;br /&gt;- This product does have a strong smell, but it is one that I find very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I use this product during shower once a week and my hair gets very smooth, shiny and looks great.</li>
            <li>very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased &amp; will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li>This goop is nice and smells good</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>my hair is almost healthy!</li>
            <li>My hair has been healthier, shinier, &amp; more manageable than ever!</li>
            <li>The product has a nice smell and leaves my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li>, you know how hair is supposed to flow and be all nice?</li>
            <li>It was the best protein treatment ever, smelled wonderful like warm vanilla, rich cream texture, lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product if you want quick results.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best protein conditioner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair and nothing has worked better than this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>With this Fekkai product, I&#x27;m now able to abuse my hair in all manner of ways without having to face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I was glad I did</li>
            <li>I would have to compare it to a broomstick most of the time.</li>
            <li>so I could have it in most the day with a shower cap on.</li>
            <li>Now, after the 4 months of having used it and making my hair quality a lot better</li>
            <li>I felt like maybe there was another product out there that was better and cheaper (don&#x27;t we always feel that way?)</li>
            <li>A better product is ApHogee Two-Step Protein Treatment.</li>
            <li>I have used Fekkai Protein Rx anti breakage treatment mask for many years.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a better conditioner.</li>
            <li>Overall it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>pros: great smell, made my hair soft for a day, need vvv litt amount  </li>
            <li>At the time I felt that it didn&#x27;t completely stop hair breakage, it did lessen it a great deal though.</li>
            <li>Rinse out and style brilliantly shiny hair that keeps its condition for several days.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not claiming that it makes my hair super perfect and like virgin hair again, because frankly after everything I&#x27;ve done to it the only way that&#x27;s going to happen is if I stop dying my hair period and leave it alone.</li>
            <li>It does have a very strong fragrance, but I believe the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it not that great for the price.</li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I can&#x60;t tell the difference, the new one is great and all, but why it is so much more money, not sure.</li>
            <li>, so therefor I didn&#x27;t repurchase and instead bought 5+ other conditioners that also had great reviews etc but were a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>although I do color my hair, my hair was usually in decent shape because I avoided doing anything else with it - no blow-drying, hair-curling, elaborate hairstyles, etc.</li>
            <li>The cost is a bit high, but for using it sparingly I guess its ok.  </li>
            <li>After trying it one time, I decided that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this is the best deep conditioner treatment out there that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>One day while doing one of my diligent searches online for hair care products, I stumbled on this Treatment mask and just had to purchase right away.</li>
            <li>The price difference is huge, the new one is $49 at the stores while this one was $30.</li>
            <li>I have to have change pretty often.  </li>
            <li>Along with this, I use some other hair products and take biotin supplements with a healthy diet and lots of water!</li>
            <li>So if you want to spend a pretty penny on a hair treatment, you could get this Fekkai one.  </li>
            <li>Overall over time the Frederic Fekkai Protein Rx Reparative Treatment Mask greatly improved my hair as well though and left it very soft and manageable.   </li>
            <li>After leaving the product on for ten minutes (sometimes using a blow-dryer with high heat), I always make sure to THOROUGHLY wash it out of my hair.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me personally but for people that don&#x27;t care for strong smells</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, buy it, it will really help with protein without making your hair dry... :-)</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>The Fekkai mask instantly coats your hair, making it tangle-free and smooth</li>
            <li>but I have a Loreal treatment in a similar jar that is a fraction of the price and makes my hair feel just as smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>, I also tried L&#x27;Oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme, Brazilian Tech Deep Penetrating Conditioning Treatment, Silk Elements Mega Conditioning Treatment and a couple cheap drugstore ones</li>
            <li>this might be a bit much.</li>
            <li>Still have 1/4 of jar left, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, it leaves my hair smooth (for at least 3 days without washing it, and a week in between treatments) it has really helped my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, not like other protein treatments, this one didn&#x60;t make your hair dry but soft and super moisturized (more like the Color Care mask from Fekkai!).</li>
            <li>I use much less of the Fekkai for considerably better results.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I think it does not do any wonders if you already have decent manageable hair.</li>
            <li>I guess this comes down to personal preference, however this product is so effective that even if I didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>My hair is very fragile and fine, and I dye it constantly.  </li>
            <li>I wound up repurchasing it recently and was reminded of why I liked it so much in the past and that I should&#x27;ve never strayed from it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been breaking off and it&#x27;s super dry</li>
            <li>(platinum blonde just wouldn&#x27;t look right on me with my complexion and as my natural color is a medium brown).</li>
            <li>Other conditioners seem to require much more effort on your part - you have to work the conditioner through each strand of hair and physically detangle the hair with your fingers, etc.</li>
            <li>( I wash my hair as little as possible as the natural oils keep hair healthy).</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I take to the max&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>and it doesnt really feel any different than something like Aussie 3 minute miracle.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>None of the cheaper products even combined worked anything near what this one does.</li>
            <li>Expensive to not see any good results.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and it controlled my frizz and left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, colored hair and always sit in an office; so I feel like the hair is always dry.</li>
            <li>After my hair dresser told me I had major hair damage</li>
            <li>Only mask that makes my curls look soft.</li>
            <li>(having said that I&#x27;ve recently found that the ApHogee Two Step Protein Treatment completely stops my hair from breaking)</li>
            <li>My wife has long hair, is Brazilian, and has tried every chemical, natural treatment on earth</li>

            <li> My wife has long hair, is Brazilian, and has tried every chemical, natural treatment on earth</li>
            <li> blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are very dry and brittle due chemical straightening (I am Black and have very corase hair</li>
            <li> This product allows me to detangle nearly instantaneously (and while using only a small amount).</li>
            <li> But this product definitely makes it way closer to that than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> and this stuff has saved my hair from dry, brittle, and split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry and it moisturizes it well.</li>
            <li> I tried the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque, which is still slightly pricey</li>
            <li> Works well during the winter as we have a wood burning stove, and tends to get very dry in our home even if we use a humidifier.  </li>
            <li> If you want to save some money and get equivalent results, go to the drugstore and get L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Deep Replenishing Masque in the green jar.</li>
            <li> I noticed that other reviewers mentioned that it made their hair sticky and heavy - this is a deep conditioning mask, and not a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The next day my hair was a little softer and less sticky.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I also make sure to wash it off using very cold water...</li>
            <li> My hair is in such ridiculously bad shape, I have thick, yet fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using it a week and a half now</li>
            <li> Needless to say my hair has been fried a number of times in those processes (I&#x27;ve gone back and forth quite a few times) and earlier this year I decided to try this product.   </li>
            <li> In fact, when I bought this product, my hair was having a harder time than usual because my hairdresser accidentally gave me the wrong color hair dye causing me to have my hair completely dyed twice in one day.  </li>
            <li> I had heard somewhere that using cold waterafter conditioning helps to \\&quot;seal the cuticle off\\&quot; and helps you retain benefits from the conditioner much longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> When teasing my hair or using a ton of hair-spray, I usually turn to conditioners to take out next-day tangles.</li>
            <li> Not to be used as a conditioner as this can be too heavy on those with thin hair.</li>
            <li> but my hair is still really unhealthy</li>
            <li> vvvvvvvvvvv expensive,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by this product.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very expensive I will buy it again because it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I received a very bad perm &amp; my hair was fried!</li>
            <li> the repairs that the Fekkai mask had done before had basically been voided and my hair was once again ridiculously terrible.</li>

            <li> I have long hair and this is the best deep conditioner treatment out there that I&#x27;ve tried. It makes your hair very shiny. When I use this I get compliments on my hair (from women, lol!, so you know it works.)</li>
            <li> pros: great smell, made my hair soft for a day, need vvv litt amount  cons: vvvvvvvvvvv expensive, next day my hair was greasy    Overall, it not that great for the price. I think it does not do any wonders if you already have decent manageable hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  You only have to use once in a while.  Doesnt weigh down my hair.  I do a lot to my hair, coloring etc.  so gets brittle.  I have to have change pretty often.  Works well during the winter as we have a wood burning stove, and tends to get very dry in our home even if we use a humidifier.  The cost is a bit high, but for using it sparingly I guess its ok.  It is worth it.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair and nothing has worked better than this. i suffered from anorexia and my weight was restored a year ago but my hair is still really unhealthy and then I bleached it, used sun-in, and lifeguarded this summer. This doesn&#x27;t repair your hair..nothing can repair it but it keeps it from breaking anymore and it smells great. I use this for thirty minutes 1 time a week ( I wash my hair as little as possible as the natural oils keep hair healthy). Along with this, I use some other hair products and take biotin supplements with a healthy diet and lots of water! All these things helped but this provides instant shine and strength. WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> After my hair dresser told me I had major hair damage I went on the search for a treatment to help repair it. And I found it! I love this stuff. Not only does it smell amazing, it leaves my hair smooth (for at least 3 days without washing it, and a week in between treatments) it has really helped my hair. I have naturally curly hair that I take to the max&lt;br /&gt;With blow drying and flat ironing and this stuff has saved my hair from dry, brittle, and split ends. Wish it was a tad cheaper, but it&#x27;s the cheapest price I have found and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> After trying it one time, I decided that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without it for the rest of my life. I have long-ish platinum blonde hair - although I do color my hair, my hair was usually in decent shape because I avoided doing anything else with it - no blow-drying, hair-curling, elaborate hairstyles, etc. With this Fekkai product, I&#x27;m now able to abuse my hair in all manner of ways without having to face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;- I purchased this bottle with a separate bottle of Nexxus Humectress Deep Conditioner. While both deep conditioners are for different purposes (Nexxus for \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; and Fekkai for \\&quot;strengthening\\&quot; with protein), there is a definite difference in quality. I use much less of the Fekkai for considerably better results.&lt;br /&gt;- When teasing my hair or using a ton of hair-spray, I usually turn to conditioners to take out next-day tangles. This product allows me to detangle nearly instantaneously (and while using only a small amount). Other conditioners seem to require much more effort on your part - you have to work the conditioner through each strand of hair and physically detangle the hair with your fingers, etc. The Fekkai mask instantly coats your hair, making it tangle-free and smooth (regardless of how matted from teasing your hair has become).&lt;br /&gt;- This product does have a strong smell, but it is one that I find very pleasant. I guess this comes down to personal preference, however this product is so effective that even if I didn&#x27;t like the smell I would still use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;- After leaving the product on for ten minutes (sometimes using a blow-dryer with high heat), I always make sure to THOROUGHLY wash it out of my hair. I noticed that other reviewers mentioned that it made their hair sticky and heavy - this is a deep conditioning mask, and not a leave-in conditioner. It was meant to be put on the hair - and then taken off. I also make sure to wash it off using very cold water... I had heard somewhere that using cold waterafter conditioning helps to \\&quot;seal the cuticle off\\&quot; and helps you retain benefits from the conditioner much longer. After using for ten minutes, the effects of the conditioner last me well over a week (while washing and conditioning (with regular conditioners) on a daily basis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product. Hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and am very happy with the results.  The product has a nice smell and leaves my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> This goop is nice and smells good but I have a Loreal treatment in a similar jar that is a fraction of the price and makes my hair feel just as smooth.  So if you want to spend a pretty penny on a hair treatment, you could get this Fekkai one.  If you want to save some money and get equivalent results, go to the drugstore and get L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Deep Replenishing Masque in the green jar.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it a week and a half now and it doesnt really feel any different than something like Aussie 3 minute miracle.  Not worth the price. As for the seller shipment was received in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> very pleased with the product. A little bit goes a long ways. Does work well on my hair. My hair is extremely dry and it moisturizes it well. I use it about once a week or so.</li>
            <li> I have straight, colored hair and always sit in an office; so I feel like the hair is always dry. However, regular usage of this product once every two weeks make my hair shiny and manageable. Stop wasting money and time on oil/protein/Keratin treatments at the salon and give this a shot. It does have a very strong fragrance, but I believe the results are worth it. Not to be used as a conditioner as this can be too heavy on those with thin hair.</li>
            <li> It does have the effect as it showed in website. It does reinforce hair and add back essential strength and manageability.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are very dry and brittle due chemical straightening (I am Black and have very corase hair so i use a hair texturizer). I needed something that would condition my hair from root to tip. I searched every beauty supply store, used practically every brand name product I know, while spending hundreds for things that didn&#x27;t work and are now sitting on the shelf collecting dust. One day while doing one of my diligent searches online for hair care products, I stumbled on this Treatment mask and just had to purchase right away. I was glad I did the smell is great and it does wonders for my hair. I use it at every hair wash. My hair comes out soft and manageable. It is a definite must use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by this product.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice now and both times my hair was sticky and it did not control the frizz.  The next day my hair was a little softer and less sticky.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.  All in all, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I have naturally curly hair and it controlled my frizz and left my hair very soft.  Although it&#x27;s very expensive I will buy it again because it works.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Only mask that makes my curls look soft. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed it has been discontinued. They should bring it back</li>
            <li> My wife has long hair, is Brazilian, and has tried every chemical, natural treatment on earth it seems to condition her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best.</li>
            <li> I use this product during shower once a week and my hair gets very smooth, shiny and looks great. It&#x27;s a great product if you want quick results. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received a very bad perm &amp; my hair was fried! The salon refunded my money &amp; gave only one treatment! So researched &amp; found Fekkai hair mask, the best stuff on earth! In combination with macadamian oil my hair is almost healthy! Using it 3X per week for 2monthes. Still have 1/4 of jar left, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best protein conditioner I&#x27;ve used! My hair has been healthier, shinier, &amp; more manageable than ever! I admit it is a bit pricey for the quantity but it&#x27;s worth it! Besides, you get what you pay for. I am very pleased &amp; will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> My hair is in such ridiculously bad shape, I have thick, yet fine, wavy hair. It&#x27;s been breaking off and it&#x27;s super dry, you know how hair is supposed to flow and be all nice? Mine does not to that. I would have to compare it to a broomstick most of the time. I&#x27;ve been dying it since I was 15 and have had it the darkest brown to a medium blonde (platinum blonde just wouldn&#x27;t look right on me with my complexion and as my natural color is a medium brown). Needless to say my hair has been fried a number of times in those processes (I&#x27;ve gone back and forth quite a few times) and earlier this year I decided to try this product.   I used it once a week for I think around 4 months (this came out to 2 jars with my shoulder length hair) and left it in on a day I had off so I could have it in most the day with a shower cap on. At the time I felt that it didn&#x27;t completely stop hair breakage, it did lessen it a great deal though. (having said that I&#x27;ve recently found that the ApHogee Two Step Protein Treatment completely stops my hair from breaking) Overall over time the Frederic Fekkai Protein Rx Reparative Treatment Mask greatly improved my hair as well though and left it very soft and manageable.   Now, after the 4 months of having used it and making my hair quality a lot better I felt like maybe there was another product out there that was better and cheaper (don&#x27;t we always feel that way?), so therefor I didn&#x27;t repurchase and instead bought 5+ other conditioners that also had great reviews etc but were a lot cheaper. I tried the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque, which is still slightly pricey but it has 8.5oz vs the 5.5oz this one has, I also tried L&#x27;Oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme, Brazilian Tech Deep Penetrating Conditioning Treatment, Silk Elements Mega Conditioning Treatment and a couple cheap drugstore ones I can&#x27;t recall the names of. For comparison sake of more expensive products as well the 2 I had tried before this one was the Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask and Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment as well as a few others I can&#x27;t remember anymore.   In this time period of trying out the cheaper products I had a hair color mishap and had to have my hair dyed 4 times in the span of a couple weeks, the repairs that the Fekkai mask had done before had basically been voided and my hair was once again ridiculously terrible. None of the cheaper products even combined worked anything near what this one does. I wound up repurchasing it recently and was reminded of why I liked it so much in the past and that I should&#x27;ve never strayed from it. Now, I&#x27;m not claiming that it makes my hair super perfect and like virgin hair again, because frankly after everything I&#x27;ve done to it the only way that&#x27;s going to happen is if I stop dying my hair period and leave it alone. But this product definitely makes it way closer to that than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried. And I know that over time it greatly improves my hair quality. Obviously everyone&#x27;s hair is different so what works for me might not work for you but I find this conditioner to be close to perfect.  The only cons I can think of are price, and maybe the smell. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me personally but for people that don&#x27;t care for strong smells this might be a bit much. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson anyways and will be buying this from now on, if your hair is anything like mine I suggest you try it too!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. Expensive to not see any good results. A better product is ApHogee Two-Step Protein Treatment.</li>
            <li> You can still find this item on the Fekkai website but it is disappeared from the stores. I loved it! It was the best protein treatment ever, smelled wonderful like warm vanilla, rich cream texture, lasted a really long time. Also, not like other protein treatments, this one didn&#x60;t make your hair dry but soft and super moisturized (more like the Color Care mask from Fekkai!). Loved the price too. Seems like they re-invented the line and came out with the PrX Reparatives line. I have just bought the mask. The price difference is huge, the new one is $49 at the stores while this one was $30. To be honest, I can&#x60;t tell the difference, the new one is great and all, but why it is so much more money, not sure. If you can afford it, buy it, it will really help with protein without making your hair dry... :-)</li>
            <li> I have used Fekkai Protein Rx anti breakage treatment mask for many years. I have never tried a better conditioner. Just a tiny bit softens and conditions hair in about ten minutes. Rinse out and style brilliantly shiny hair that keeps its condition for several days.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fragile and fine, and I dye it constantly.  In fact, when I bought this product, my hair was having a harder time than usual because my hairdresser accidentally gave me the wrong color hair dye causing me to have my hair completely dyed twice in one day.  My hair came out looking beautiful because I used this conditioner between dye jobs that day.  From then on it has become my staple for every time after I dye my hair.  Overall it is an excellent product.</li>
