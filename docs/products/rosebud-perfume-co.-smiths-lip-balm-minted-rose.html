            <li>The scent/flavor is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of potpourri and that is very pleasant to me.</li>

            <li>The tin is gorgeous....</li>
            <li>It has a spice smell for than an orange smell, but still works as good as Rosebud save.</li>
            <li>Good  </li>
            <li>Bravo!!\\&quot; I love keeping my wife so happy and her lips so supple.</li>
            <li>but my first experience with the mandarin orange scent which is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing -- and delicious.</li>
            <li>The texture is a bit looser than the the product in the tins I already own and the smell reminds me of the orange spice candles that you see in abundance around the beginning of Fall.</li>
            <li>smells really nice and comes in a nicely packaged and ornate mini tin.</li>
            <li>it also blends and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>The smell to me is actually nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice balm.</li>
            <li>so to find this Rosebud lip balm with mandarin in it was nice.  </li>
            <li>this balm keep my lip nourished and smooth, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>This product is very light (almost melts) and is neither sticky nor gummy.  </li>
            <li>This has a lovely old-fashioned aroma.</li>
            <li>The formula glides on smoother and feels slightly more emollient.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I ran across this smell by accident.</li>
            <li>Love this, gives lips a luxe feeling</li>
            <li>I like this much better for the lips.</li>
            <li>It has a spiciness to it that I love and</li>
            <li>The tin is really cute also.</li>
            <li>but I love citrus and when I saw this</li>
            <li>The scent and feel is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>Much more the flavor of orange zest than the orange itself.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep it out of the heat though.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this lip balm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Amazon quickly and courteously refunded my money.</li>
            <li>I have the original rosebud salve, love it, and may even like this one a tad more.</li>
            <li>so I just sit the lid on top lightly.</li>
            <li>i love the original Smith&#x27;s Rosebut Lip Balm but the scent of this stuff</li>
            <li>is WAY too strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li>smells a bit strong</li>
            <li>but it has an aroma (kind of like fruit tea, smells sweet but doesn&#x27;t taste sweet).</li>
            <li>It is a unique take on the original Rosebud!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like rose and mandarin.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really bothered to try any of the variations (Minted Rose, Strawberry, etc)</li>
            <li>Smooth not sticky.</li>
            <li>Once I put the product in another container though, it has transformed my lips into soft, healthy, orange-scented rose petals.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, but it&#x27;s formula is a bit runnier than the original.</li>
            <li>The balm itself is just like the original.  </li>
            <li>After buying the original Rosebud balm I thought I would give this and try.</li>
            <li>Mandarin and Rose are such a lovely combination.</li>
            <li>You really have to love orange to like this.</li>
            <li>lips are nice and soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>i dont really taste the flavor though so the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is more of a scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and it keeps my lips really soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy on the mandarin - rose mixes in to make a mild, scented, excellent dry skin lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick as always and shipping package was done well.</li>
            <li>However, the strong fragrance and mixture of ingredients creates a smell that is more similar to a hair pomade than a lip balm.</li>
            <li>Worth trying</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this product for my self and as gifts as it is so unique.</li>
            <li>I am in no way sensitive to smells but this has a super strong potpourri smell that made me feel nauseous the minute I opened the tin.</li>
            <li>I like to put it on right before I got to bed.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Good, but the box is too tight</li>
            <li>Flavor is a little stonger than I would like but still good.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I love citrus scents and was delighted to find it a bit spicy also, not in a bad way but some clove for sure.</li>
            <li>Pretty.  </li>
            <li>Love this flavor--very different.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, lasts long, and I love the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Only let down is the tin, if I close it I have great difficulty opening it again -</li>
            <li>I like this so much I bought a tube of it</li>
            <li>but I just thought it was too much.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips very moist.</li>
            <li>Very pungent.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and keeps my lips moist.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Sure enough, if you look in the list of ingredients you&#x27;ll see &#x27;Orange Spice All Natural Blend.</li>
            <li>Feels and works the same as the original but in an orange sorbet-like scent.</li>
            <li>The seller even wrote \\&quot;Thank You!\\&quot; on the packing slip which made me feel really special like they personally cared about me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Smith&#x27;s classic Rosebud Salve for years</li>
            <li>A good balm but tough to carry in the pocket and the can tends to seep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re expecting straight up mandarin and rose you may be a little surprised to note the extra spices, but for me this is a hit.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this like all of the other salves by Rosebud but definitely not the case.</li>
            <li>I love their lip balms, I usually apply maybe twice and my lips stay moist all day.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like using reviews because everybody has different experiences-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fresh and crisp as citrus typically plays into things so much as it&#x27;s just pretty</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the smell to smell like orange, its slightly smoky with a very slight rose smell.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more although these tins usually last me for at least a year.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all the balms, it is my secret, OG lip saver salve.</li>
            <li>It melts much quicker in my purse than any of the other Rosebud lip balms I have used and the tin is super hard to open.  </li>

            <li> Get it if you&#x27;re not sensitive to orange oil!!!!</li>
            <li> Petrolatum: made from Petroleum, other ingredients are also synthetic including the coloring</li>
            <li> Hard to open  </li>
            <li> Mine showed up all melted to one side and in turn made the lid hard to open.</li>
            <li> half is in the box.</li>
            <li> and another half stuck in the cover.</li>
            <li> I have a slight addiction to Smiths perfume co. products.</li>
            <li> The tint is so slight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a slightly tinted and scented Vaseline type of balm.</li>
            <li> star less because the following issue could be my fault: this little canister is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I ordered two kinds and both were very hard to pry open after removing the plactic seal and both were a mess.</li>
            <li> Feels a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Really slick, but not sticky.</li>
            <li> They are very difficult to open, I always drop it, and this one was no exception.</li>
            <li> The smell and taste isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> why put this crap in something that is going on your lips?</li>
            <li> But I hate all the Smith&#x27;s tins.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and would never purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> It is terrible!</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting!</li>

            <li> I like this so much I bought a tube of it so I could toss it in my bag and use it as often as I need without getting it on my fingers.</li>
            <li> i love the original Smith&#x27;s Rosebut Lip Balm but the scent of this stuff is WAY too strong in my opinion. I guess it&#x27;s a preference but I just thought it was too much. The balm itself is just like the original.  Worth trying I guess but the scent was overpowering.</li>

            <li> I have a slight addiction to Smiths perfume co. products. This product has a rosey citrus spice scent. It goes on smooth, but it&#x27;s formula is a bit runnier than the original.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely old-fashioned aroma. It&#x27;s not fresh and crisp as citrus typically plays into things so much as it&#x27;s just pretty (almost potpourri like, though without being pungent). I have the original rosebud salve, love it, and may even like this one a tad more. The formula glides on smoother and feels slightly more emollient. My guy noticed the softness of my lips with this one.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Don&#x27;t expect the smell to smell like orange, its slightly smoky with a very slight rose smell. It reminds me of potpourri and that is very pleasant to me. It keeps my lips very moist. So glad I ran across this smell by accident.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, lasts long, and I love the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;One star less because the following issue could be my fault: this little canister is difficult to open. I think I have massive fingers, though. Maybe there should be a &amp;#34;easy open canister&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> My wife says: \\&quot;This is is my second purchase of a Smith&#x27;s Rosebud salve tin but my first experience with the mandarin orange scent which is very pleasant. It reminds me of the orange Creamsicles I used to eat as a child. I will definitely be ordering more of this product for my self and as gifts as it is so unique. Delivery was quick as always and shipping package was done well. The seller even wrote \\&quot;Thank You!\\&quot; on the packing slip which made me feel really special like they personally cared about me. Bravo!!\\&quot; I love keeping my wife so happy and her lips so supple. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love citrus scents and was delighted to find it a bit spicy also, not in a bad way but some clove for sure. The tin is gorgeous.... Reorder!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like rose and mandarin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing -- and delicious.</li>
            <li> Love this, gives lips a luxe feeling</li>
            <li> Best salve out there!  We use it for everything from chapped lips to burns to make-up remover!!</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Feels great on my lips!</li>
            <li> I use Rosebud Smith&#x27;s lip balm before bedtime and my lips stay moisturized throughout the day. Sometimes I apply the balm twice a day, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell or flavor</li>
            <li> Use lip balm every night.</li>
            <li> It has a spice smell for than an orange smell, but still works as good as Rosebud save.</li>
            <li> Pretty.  Moisturizing.  delicious.  Good  &#x27;purse&#x27;  item</li>
            <li> After buying the original Rosebud balm I thought I would give this and try. I like this much better for the lips. It has a great scent and the flavor is good too. It has a spiciness to it that I love and it moisturizes well. I like to put it on right before I got to bed. The tin is really cute also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Smith&#x27;s classic Rosebud Salve for years and I haven&#x27;t really bothered to try any of the variations (Minted Rose, Strawberry, etc) but I love citrus and when I saw this I couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed! The texture is a bit looser than the the product in the tins I already own and the smell reminds me of the orange spice candles that you see in abundance around the beginning of Fall. Sure enough, if you look in the list of ingredients you&#x27;ll see &#x27;Orange Spice All Natural Blend.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re expecting straight up mandarin and rose you may be a little surprised to note the extra spices, but for me this is a hit. I will definitely buy more although these tins usually last me for at least a year.</li>
            <li> The scent and feel is quite lovely. Smooth not sticky. The only thing I dislike is that it&#x27;s not quite as solid as one would want for a lip balm that you&#x27;d carry in your pocket. Heat and this product don&#x27;t mix.</li>
            <li> Love this flavor--very different. You really have to love orange to like this. Much more the flavor of orange zest than the orange itself. Very pungent.</li>
            <li> Feels and works the same as the original but in an orange sorbet-like scent. Doesn&#x27;t have a taste but it has an aroma (kind of like fruit tea, smells sweet but doesn&#x27;t taste sweet).</li>
            <li> Great product, love the smell! I put this on everynight on going to bed and lips are nice and soft in the morning. Only let down is the tin, if I close it I have great difficulty opening it again - so I just sit the lid on top lightly.</li>
            <li> Flavor is a little stonger than I would like but still good.</li>
            <li> But I hate all the Smith&#x27;s tins. They are very difficult to open, I always drop it, and this one was no exception. Once I put the product in another container though, it has transformed my lips into soft, healthy, orange-scented rose petals. Legit. This is my favorite of all the balms, it is my secret, OG lip saver salve. Get it if you&#x27;re not sensitive to orange oil!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting! I wanted to love this like all of the other salves by Rosebud but definitely not the case. I am in no way sensitive to smells but this has a super strong potpourri smell that made me feel nauseous the minute I opened the tin. Very disappointed and would never purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> I just started using it.  It melts much quicker in my purse than any of the other Rosebud lip balms I have used and the tin is super hard to open.  However, I like the smell and the way it feels on my lips.  I really don&#x27;t like using reviews because everybody has different experiences- try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> smells really nice and comes in a nicely packaged and ornate mini tin. i dont really taste the flavor though so the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is more of a scent. it also blends and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I am using my husband&#x27;s account. I really like this lip balm. I leave it by my bed to apply to my lips before I go to sleep at night. It is very hydrating and keeps my lips moist. I feel it prevents my lips from chaffing to. The smell is kind of strong but not overwhelming. The smell to me is actually nice. It is very smooth and easy to apply! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love their lip balms, I usually apply maybe twice and my lips stay moist all day. The smell and taste isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> The tin is defective and I couldn&#x27;t open it.  Amazon quickly and courteously refunded my money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice balm. It smells so good! Mandarin and Rose are such a lovely combination. The tint is so slight it&#x27;s almost unnoticeable on the lips. It&#x27;s like a slightly tinted and scented Vaseline type of balm. Really slick, but not sticky. Make sure you keep it out of the heat though. Mine showed up all melted to one side and in turn made the lid hard to open.</li>
            <li> Good, but the box is too tight</li>
            <li> Love everything about this lip balm. It keeps my lips moisturized for a long time which means I don&#x27;t have to worry about constant reapplication. The scent is nice and it keeps my lips really soft and conditioned. This is a must for anybody to use! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like mandarin anything so to find this Rosebud lip balm with mandarin in it was nice.  It isn&#x27;t heavy on the mandarin - rose mixes in to make a mild, scented, excellent dry skin lip balm.  It is a unique take on the original Rosebud!</li>
