            <li>This system is wonderful.</li>
            <li>i especially love the pore vacuming tip</li>
            <li>The massage tip will allow you to put the moisturizer into the skin deeper than just applying it and of course the brush and polishing tips do a wonderful job!  </li>
            <li>Was impressed w/ the sunction in fact I have 2 scars where it pulled out my skin</li>

            <li>This one works great and did not break the bank.</li>
            <li>Its great for people who wear make up a lot because you dont have to scrub with a washcloth for 5 min.</li>

            <li>i love the massage head of this!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>There is one that has beads to massage, but it kind of hurts.</li>
            <li>The variety of heads allows me to use a variety of cleansing products of my own choosing.</li>
            <li>Pretty great product :P</li>
            <li>But the brushes and pads were nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of this product, but this one does not work well.  </li>
            <li>Reaally nice work.</li>
            <li>The system is very easy to use and it is so versatile.</li>
            <li>The system comes with 5 interchangeable heads that are very easy to interchange.</li>
            <li>Very cheap built doesn&#x27;t do anything  </li>
            <li>It makes washing and exfoliating easy and handy.</li>
            <li>it is overall a GREAT ITEM!!!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product instead of spending much more for the \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I really noticed any great improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am able to customize my beauty routine to my skin&#x27;s ever changing needs.</li>
            <li>and my skin did feel much more softer after.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom after my grand daughter got one.</li>
            <li>I love the looks of it.</li>
            <li>AND you get more head options.</li>
            <li>Or if you want to spend $200 on another product to feel better, well that&#x27;s on you :)</li>
            <li>I think most will notice a difference in a week of use.</li>
            <li>Brush gets smoshed after only 3 washed but great product for the money!</li>
            <li>I gave mine away and bought some manual brushes that do a much better job.</li>
            <li>The price is appropriate.  </li>
            <li>The extra sponge is perfect as this item is used the most.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is just OK.  </li>
            <li>I would return it, but its more of a hassle and bother if anything.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to change and love the two speeds.</li>
            <li>If you use an exfoliant of any kind, even the gentle kind, it will feel like sandpaper against your skin.</li>
            <li>and it was also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel great after using and soft.</li>
            <li>A good time to use a gentle lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>, I loved how gentle it was</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put the head you want on, take it off, switch, etc.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using the Revlon Skin Renewal cleansing system my face feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I must say my skin is so smooth after just one use.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic.</li>
            <li>easy to clean</li>
            <li>there has four choose to use, i like use the sponge use with clean milk, it easy to remove your foundationã€‚&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li>so far so good....</li>
            <li>The Revlon skin cleansing system has more attachments than any of the higher priced units on the market.  </li>
            <li>a little bit more power would be great.</li>
            <li>The foam sponge feels like it polished my face,  but didn&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li>leaves her skin feeling clean but not stripped of all oils.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most amazing tools for facial cleansing ever!</li>
            <li>The unit is just the right size; which makes it easy to take with me when I am away from home.</li>
            <li>This is a good quick daily clean and cleans up well too.</li>
            <li>I would DEFinitely recommend this product for those on a budget yet lookin for a good skin care system.</li>
            <li>that didnt work, for some reason when the thing works and the brush spins properly it does your skin good , cleans the pores works well.</li>
            <li>The suction head was iffy, but perhaps if it were a stronger machine (but for $15 or so, that&#x27;s not bad -</li>
            <li>Stopped working fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Looses battery charge quickly.  </li>
            <li>Every other day I like to have a good scrub and clean out my pores.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect for facial cleansing and care without making a huge mess.</li>
            <li>With the versatile heads available you can gently massage your face and you feel like you&#x27;ve had a spa treatment.</li>
            <li>It worked great for a few months then is just quit.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and encourages you to be a \\&quot;lady\\&quot; (to wit: gentle) while using it.</li>
            <li>and I have had many complements on how young I look.  </li>
            <li>I would say to anyone that it is worth a try to see for yourself.</li>
            <li>I guess I got my moneys worth but this product no longer works.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it, it does the job,</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you worth</li>
            <li>its worth the price.</li>
            <li>You should defiantly try it and it was well worth the price~</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going right in the trash.</li>
            <li>The marketing department for this company got it right.  </li>
            <li>Overall I saw a great improvement on my skin especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The scrubs were great, especially for those wearing a lot of makeup or those low on time for cleaning the face.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend it to all women.</li>
            <li>After researching many similar products I chose Revlon&#x27;s Skin Renewal Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>Provides a gentle application that is suitable for daily home use.</li>
            <li>I tried the blemish extractor on one of my blemishes, and I didn&#x27;t feel anything at first, as soon as I pulled away</li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks, it worked well</li>
            <li>something*).</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in this product!  </li>
            <li>exactly what my wife wanted</li>
            <li>Its loud and the attachments don&#x27;t  seem to be to secure.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a \\&quot;reasonably priced, effective facial cleanser.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The device is not very powerful, but is more than adequate for the price.</li>
            <li>Love my order am very please and will order from you in the future if you have something that I can use.</li>
            <li>When I first got this product, I was really into the scrubber with the bristles.</li>
            <li>When this one finally gives out I will definitely invest in the real deal, but its a good starter.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I just opened the package and took out the brush heads and the main part to the hand-held device.</li>
            <li>It comes with 5 different attachments that you easily snap on and off.</li>
            <li>One bit of advice tho...if you use it in the shower make sure to take out the battereies after you&#x27;re done with it and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to rinse it out (off the device) and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>It is much softer to  the  touch</li>
            <li>My face is so much smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really like this gadget.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t really have much &#x27;umph&#x27; to it..</li>
            <li>and it was the one part that I really wanted to work.</li>
            <li>, I dont really see the purpose of them..</li>
            <li>It looks cute but not very practical.</li>
            <li>The pore sucker is kind of fun too.</li>
            <li>the brush and massager feels good on my skin but the suction tool sucks..</li>
            <li>I was very interested in the idea of the facial brush, and didn&#x27;t want to try it for the first time with one that was $150.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this item and the price is really accessible.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and refreshed and the spinning massage head after you are done cleaning your face is the ultimate finish to your cleaning routine.  </li>
            <li>My skin is usually pretty clear, but this definitely helped me with maintaining and keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once a day or for very long.</li>
            <li>Only half of the attachments are really usable, and I feel like mine kind of lost a lot of its power after the first week.</li>
            <li>This give my face a nice tone feeling and diminishes the small lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not exactly sure how effective it is for what that piece is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The brush was soft for the skin and the attachment with little balls massaged the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Im sure this products would cost less if they didnt exist.</li>
            <li>My last system had rechargeable batteries on a charger and when they finally stopped being able to take a charge, I had to toss the unit.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend A++++++</li>
            <li>I have another cleaning system similiar that I like a little better.  </li>
            <li>I started using this system with my cleansing liquid when I received it, I am happy with the system, it is doing the job as the company described on the box, it is clearing my black heads and exposing the hairs underneath those areas, which in turn are allowing me to tweeze them out and be in less pain.</li>
            <li>The idea behind the product is a good one, however.</li>
            <li>This product you use to clean your face plus exfoliating brush that you literally see the dry skin flake off!</li>
            <li>After the first use of the system, the battery seems to be really sensitive and will cut out at times, especially if I don&#x27;t have my finger on the &#x27;on&#x27; button, which makes it a little bit of a pain to use, but it&#x27;s nothing more than an inconvenience,</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft and assists with preventing breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliator brush had soft bristles  that did go deep in my skin and made the biggest difference, I felt so much brighter and felt so much smoother as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards my skin feels so smooth and less oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I pretty much only use that attachment and the soft foam pad now</li>
            <li>Its a special treat to get anything deep down and really tone up the skin.  </li>
            <li>I sometime treat myself and use some exfoliating scrub and gently use the brushes on low.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for professional results than this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so loud and came with a holder.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>My skin is now vey soft and the chafing problem I had is now gone.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t sent it back as it will cost me just as much in postage</li>
            <li>The extra heads don&#x27;t do much of anything.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t rotate fast enough.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that can be purchased for young teens as well as adults.  </li>
            <li>The brush is short and gentle.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the other attachments, though I have used the massaging attachment a few times to apply moisturiser and seems OK.</li>
            <li>I only got to use it a few times and it broke a waste it twenty dollars better off buying something worth spending money on</li>
            <li>Yes, I get a little red, but I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>An older model of the same product had a case but this device is bigger than the old one.</li>
            <li>This little brush doesn&#x27;t have enough power to really clean.</li>
            <li>I use the massager on some old zit scars as I was told the only thing that will make them disappear is time and massage.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a seal around the battery door and it does get wet in there.</li>
            <li>The brush is too soft and the power is too low.  </li>
            <li>though it veyr expensive, but when bought it as a gift, afffordabl and she loving it.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, after all the pain, my skin was quite smooth, but it&#x27;s still not worth it.</li>
            <li>I havent really used the other peices yet</li>
            <li>I like this product very much except it exfoliating brush, because it&#x27;s not so firm.</li>
            <li>- it sucks the blackheads right out!  </li>
            <li>The system comes with a few different heads, but only the brush is remotely useful.</li>
            <li>the thought that something could just suck up the oil, Especially for those problem areas ( Nose and chin), seemed great :( .</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use the suction attachment, as I don&#x27;t generally break out due to my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is it need more power, if you press to firm it would slow down too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom after my grand daughter got one.</li>
            <li> I love the looks of it.</li>
            <li> AND you get more head options.</li>
            <li> Or if you want to spend $200 on another product to feel better, well that&#x27;s on you :)</li>
            <li> I think most will notice a difference in a week of use.</li>
            <li> Brush gets smoshed after only 3 washed but great product for the money!</li>
            <li> I gave mine away and bought some manual brushes that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> The price is appropriate.  </li>
            <li> The extra sponge is perfect as this item is used the most.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is just OK.  </li>
            <li> I would return it, but its more of a hassle and bother if anything.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to change and love the two speeds.</li>
            <li> If you use an exfoliant of any kind, even the gentle kind, it will feel like sandpaper against your skin.</li>
            <li> and it was also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel great after using and soft.</li>
            <li> A good time to use a gentle lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> , I loved how gentle it was</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put the head you want on, take it off, switch, etc.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using the Revlon Skin Renewal cleansing system my face feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and I must say my skin is so smooth after just one use.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic.</li>
            <li> easy to clean</li>
            <li> there has four choose to use, i like use the sponge use with clean milk, it easy to remove your foundationã€‚&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> so far so good....</li>
            <li> The Revlon skin cleansing system has more attachments than any of the higher priced units on the market.  </li>
            <li> a little bit more power would be great.</li>
            <li> The foam sponge feels like it polished my face,  but didn&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li> leaves her skin feeling clean but not stripped of all oils.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing tools for facial cleansing ever!</li>
            <li> The unit is just the right size; which makes it easy to take with me when I am away from home.</li>
            <li> This is a good quick daily clean and cleans up well too.</li>
            <li> I would DEFinitely recommend this product for those on a budget yet lookin for a good skin care system.</li>
            <li> that didnt work, for some reason when the thing works and the brush spins properly it does your skin good , cleans the pores works well.</li>
            <li> The suction head was iffy, but perhaps if it were a stronger machine (but for $15 or so, that&#x27;s not bad -</li>
            <li> Stopped working fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Looses battery charge quickly.  </li>
            <li> Every other day I like to have a good scrub and clean out my pores.  </li>
            <li> This product is perfect for facial cleansing and care without making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> With the versatile heads available you can gently massage your face and you feel like you&#x27;ve had a spa treatment.</li>
            <li> It worked great for a few months then is just quit.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and encourages you to be a \\&quot;lady\\&quot; (to wit: gentle) while using it.</li>
            <li> and I have had many complements on how young I look.  </li>
            <li> I would say to anyone that it is worth a try to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I guess I got my moneys worth but this product no longer works.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it, it does the job,</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you worth</li>
            <li> its worth the price.</li>
            <li> You should defiantly try it and it was well worth the price~</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going right in the trash.</li>
            <li> The marketing department for this company got it right.  </li>
            <li> Overall I saw a great improvement on my skin especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The scrubs were great, especially for those wearing a lot of makeup or those low on time for cleaning the face.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend it to all women.</li>
            <li> After researching many similar products I chose Revlon&#x27;s Skin Renewal Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> Provides a gentle application that is suitable for daily home use.</li>
            <li> I tried the blemish extractor on one of my blemishes, and I didn&#x27;t feel anything at first, as soon as I pulled away</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks, it worked well</li>
            <li> something*).</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in this product!  </li>
            <li> exactly what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> Its loud and the attachments don&#x27;t  seem to be to secure.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a \\&quot;reasonably priced, effective facial cleanser.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The device is not very powerful, but is more than adequate for the price.</li>
            <li> Love my order am very please and will order from you in the future if you have something that I can use.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I was really into the scrubber with the bristles.</li>
            <li> When this one finally gives out I will definitely invest in the real deal, but its a good starter.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I just opened the package and took out the brush heads and the main part to the hand-held device.</li>
            <li> It comes with 5 different attachments that you easily snap on and off.</li>
            <li> One bit of advice tho...if you use it in the shower make sure to take out the battereies after you&#x27;re done with it and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to rinse it out (off the device) and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It is much softer to  the  touch</li>
            <li> My face is so much smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like this gadget.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t really have much &#x27;umph&#x27; to it..</li>
            <li> and it was the one part that I really wanted to work.</li>
            <li> , I dont really see the purpose of them..</li>
            <li> It looks cute but not very practical.</li>
            <li> The pore sucker is kind of fun too.</li>
            <li> the brush and massager feels good on my skin but the suction tool sucks..</li>
            <li> I was very interested in the idea of the facial brush, and didn&#x27;t want to try it for the first time with one that was $150.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this item and the price is really accessible.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and refreshed and the spinning massage head after you are done cleaning your face is the ultimate finish to your cleaning routine.  </li>
            <li> My skin is usually pretty clear, but this definitely helped me with maintaining and keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once a day or for very long.</li>
            <li> Only half of the attachments are really usable, and I feel like mine kind of lost a lot of its power after the first week.</li>
            <li> This give my face a nice tone feeling and diminishes the small lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not exactly sure how effective it is for what that piece is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The brush was soft for the skin and the attachment with little balls massaged the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Im sure this products would cost less if they didnt exist.</li>
            <li> My last system had rechargeable batteries on a charger and when they finally stopped being able to take a charge, I had to toss the unit.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend A++++++</li>
            <li> I have another cleaning system similiar that I like a little better.  </li>
            <li> I started using this system with my cleansing liquid when I received it, I am happy with the system, it is doing the job as the company described on the box, it is clearing my black heads and exposing the hairs underneath those areas, which in turn are allowing me to tweeze them out and be in less pain.</li>
            <li> The idea behind the product is a good one, however.</li>
            <li> This product you use to clean your face plus exfoliating brush that you literally see the dry skin flake off!</li>
            <li> After the first use of the system, the battery seems to be really sensitive and will cut out at times, especially if I don&#x27;t have my finger on the &#x27;on&#x27; button, which makes it a little bit of a pain to use, but it&#x27;s nothing more than an inconvenience,</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft and assists with preventing breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliator brush had soft bristles  that did go deep in my skin and made the biggest difference, I felt so much brighter and felt so much smoother as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards my skin feels so smooth and less oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I pretty much only use that attachment and the soft foam pad now</li>
            <li> Its a special treat to get anything deep down and really tone up the skin.  </li>
            <li> I sometime treat myself and use some exfoliating scrub and gently use the brushes on low.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for professional results than this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so loud and came with a holder.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> My skin is now vey soft and the chafing problem I had is now gone.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t sent it back as it will cost me just as much in postage</li>
            <li> The extra heads don&#x27;t do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rotate fast enough.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that can be purchased for young teens as well as adults.  </li>
            <li> The brush is short and gentle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about the other attachments, though I have used the massaging attachment a few times to apply moisturiser and seems OK.</li>
            <li> I only got to use it a few times and it broke a waste it twenty dollars better off buying something worth spending money on</li>
            <li> Yes, I get a little red, but I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li> An older model of the same product had a case but this device is bigger than the old one.</li>
            <li> This little brush doesn&#x27;t have enough power to really clean.</li>
            <li> I use the massager on some old zit scars as I was told the only thing that will make them disappear is time and massage.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a seal around the battery door and it does get wet in there.</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft and the power is too low.  </li>
            <li> though it veyr expensive, but when bought it as a gift, afffordabl and she loving it.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, after all the pain, my skin was quite smooth, but it&#x27;s still not worth it.</li>
            <li> I havent really used the other peices yet</li>
            <li> I like this product very much except it exfoliating brush, because it&#x27;s not so firm.</li>
            <li> - it sucks the blackheads right out!  </li>
            <li> The system comes with a few different heads, but only the brush is remotely useful.</li>
            <li> the thought that something could just suck up the oil, Especially for those problem areas ( Nose and chin), seemed great :( .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use the suction attachment, as I don&#x27;t generally break out due to my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is it need more power, if you press to firm it would slow down too much.</li>
            <li> I should have sent it right back, but waited until I felt it was too late.</li>
            <li> I had an older version and needed a new brush - since I was unable to find a replacement brush I bought a new unit.</li>
            <li> I add this fact because when I use the exfoliating brush my skin glows brighter than usual, showing me the Revlon brush is really working.</li>
            <li> I loved it I wished it had an electric plug and not batteries :(</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using the rolling massage attachment, if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I even stored it in a dry cabinet outside my bath.</li>
            <li> , if you have even one tiny stray hair loose... YANK!</li>
            <li> This did not even last a month, it can&#x27;t get wet at all.</li>
            <li> I would consider using it as a plain brush without the batteries, but it is too soft.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it for very long so as not to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; the skin.  </li>
            <li> I use the sponge for my face wash, follow with the exfoliating brush, rinse, apply moisterizer, let dry, then use the messager</li>
            <li> yes I use this once a month on my face to expoliate to rid dead skin, I use with warm water and rinse my face in cold water to close the pores.....</li>
            <li> it runs slow even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Revlon RVSP3505B1 Skin Renewal Cleansing System because I was having some problems with black head and ingrown hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> Long story short, waste of money and it isnt waterproof and therefore the batteries run out after a week every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just awful, when you put it to your face, it almost feels like it&#x27;s not there because of the super smooth pad, when you try to apply just alittle pressure, the thing stops turning, let off the pressure, and it doesnt touch your face at all.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t too bad, and I LOVE the idea.</li>
            <li> This is really not what it says it is.  </li>
            <li> IT GOT WET.</li>
            <li> This device,  which is used to wash and exfoliate your face using a cleanser and water, stopped working because it got WET.</li>
            <li> I never deliberately wet the powered part of the device.</li>
            <li> Yes, the head slows down a bit if you add pressure, But on high you shouldn&#x27;t have to press very hard.</li>
            <li> and then I can use the other pads to lotion up my face and massage it in.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to take with you where ever you go and</li>
            <li> Other than that I do use all of the other heads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what those other ladies were doing with it; however, I used it and had no problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li> the brissles are too soft and don&#x27;t clean my face properly, plus it makes a terrible noise&lt;br</li>
            <li> This device at least lets me get a deep scrub in</li>
            <li> I like the product for $20, but just know its not going to be like the $150&lt; one, and probably not great for overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Spins slowly, I usually have to help it get started and the minute it gets wet it stops.</li>
            <li> it just worked for 10 minutes and when you try to apply just a little pressure, the thing stops turning.</li>
            <li> To weak ,product simply not up to par.</li>
            <li> and the return is cumbersome, so I guess its 20 bucks down the drain!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> waste of money, DON&#x27;T BUY IT</li>
            <li> Works well ..... not so harsh as some.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought the batteries needed changing but it failed to work.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out because im not sure about investing 150.00 on the clarisonic.....</li>
            <li> But when you use it manually it just brings my fake up in a massive rash of spots, must be something to do with the rotation/pressure,</li>
            <li> , I feel like the other two are unnecessary.</li>
            <li> The motor is weak and you cannot apply pressure without it slowing down.</li>
            <li> the brush hurts a little, a bit rough, but the other attachments arent that bad.  </li>
            <li> You can hardly touch your skin and it stops.  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews that complained about it pulling their hair out.</li>
            <li> It would hurt me at least.</li>
            <li> well at least i can use it without batteries, just as a manual face brush.</li>
            <li> I also have bad acne scars on my cheelks and since I added my cleansing system to my daily routine my skin has progressively improved.</li>
            <li> Weak, the suction does nothing.</li>
            <li> And to make things so so much worse</li>
            <li> waste your money on this crap...</li>
            <li> When I read the review for this product, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t used in bathroom</li>
            <li> I am so mad and disappointed with this system.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people are giving it bad remarks.........</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed if you buy this.</li>
            <li> I gave it to all the females in my family as presents and was sadly disappointed because with one month they all stopped working.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product- after purchasing four of them!</li>
            <li> Broke after two weeks, my daughter was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> hello guys ..this is worst product ...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this item..its revlon worst product ever..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Since I have been using the Revlon Skin Renewal cleansing system my face feels fantastic.  It is much softer to  the  touch and I have had many complements on how young I look.  I most definitely recommend it to all women.</li>
            <li> Every other day I like to have a good scrub and clean out my pores.  This device at least lets me get a deep scrub in and then I can use the other pads to lotion up my face and massage it in.  This give my face a nice tone feeling and diminishes the small lines around my eyes.  On weekends or holidays I sometime treat myself and use some exfoliating scrub and gently use the brushes on low.  Don&#x27;t use it for very long so as not to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; the skin.  Its a special treat to get anything deep down and really tone up the skin.  A good time to use a gentle lotion afterwards. With the versatile heads available you can gently massage your face and you feel like you&#x27;ve had a spa treatment.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not buy the expensive versions of this. This one works great and did not break the bank. The pore sucker is kind of fun too. I use the massager on some old zit scars as I was told the only thing that will make them disappear is time and massage.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is so easy to use.  It comes with 5 different attachments that you easily snap on and off. My skin feels so clean and refreshed and the spinning massage head after you are done cleaning your face is the ultimate finish to your cleaning routine.  I would definitely recommend this item and the price is really accessible. It is small enough to take with you where ever you go and it is overall a GREAT ITEM!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because for some reason the pads to my Nutragena wave are nowhere to be found. BIG mistake. It&#x27;s just awful, when you put it to your face, it almost feels like it&#x27;s not there because of the super smooth pad, when you try to apply just alittle pressure, the thing stops turning, let off the pressure, and it doesnt touch your face at all. If you use an exfoliant of any kind, even the gentle kind, it will feel like sandpaper against your skin. The bristle brush absolutly kills, my face was all red after. And to make things so so much worse, if you have even one tiny stray hair loose... YANK! it will pull it out, imagine what it feels like to have several yanked out at once! On the other hand, after all the pain, my skin was quite smooth, but it&#x27;s still not worth it. I can&#x27;t stand this thing and it&#x27;s going right in the trash. I will wait patiently for my wave pads to re-appear.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in the idea of the facial brush, and didn&#x27;t want to try it for the first time with one that was $150. The system comes with a few different heads, but only the brush is remotely useful. There is one that has beads to massage, but it kind of hurts. The brush isn&#x27;t too bad, and I LOVE the idea. My face is so much smoother and cleaner. Its great for people who wear make up a lot because you dont have to scrub with a washcloth for 5 min. I just use the brush to go over my face one time and I&#x27;m done. I also like how I can use it in the shower.     The brush is soft, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once a day or for very long. I like the product for $20, but just know its not going to be like the $150&lt; one, and probably not great for overly sensitive skin. When this one finally gives out I will definitely invest in the real deal, but its a good starter.</li>
            <li> My skin is very better now!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The attachments are easy to change and love the two speeds. I use it in the shower and have not had any problems. Buy this for someone you love!</li>
            <li> This product has helped my skin a lot. I had bought this product the day after I got a heat rash. This product got rid of almost all over it in three days and made my skin feel great. I didn&#x27;t really use the suction attachment, as I don&#x27;t generally break out due to my very dry skin. I would definitely recommend using the rolling massage attachment, if you have dry skin. It makes your skin feel great after using and soft.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product instead of spending much more for the \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; and I am glad I did.  I like this but I don&#x27;t think I really noticed any great improvement in my skin.  I would say to anyone that it is worth a try to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few weeks and I already see the benefits in my skin.</li>
            <li> Broke after two weeks, my daughter was very disappointed. Went ahead and bought her the Clarisonic this year for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is really not what it says it is.  Very cheap built doesn&#x27;t do anything  Do not buy this</li>
            <li> The noise is very big</li>
            <li> This did not even last a month, it can&#x27;t get wet at all. waste of money, DON&#x27;T BUY IT YOU WILL REGRET!!!</li>
            <li> After researching many similar products I chose Revlon&#x27;s Skin Renewal Cleansing System. This product is amazing. My skin has never looked better! The system is very easy to use and it is so versatile. The system comes with 5 interchangeable heads that are very easy to interchange. The variety of heads allows me to use a variety of cleansing products of my own choosing.I am able to customize my beauty routine to my skin&#x27;s ever changing needs. The unit is just the right size; which makes it easy to take with me when I am away from home. This is a great product that I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! and FAST SHIPPING!! WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Love it, works just as well as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people are giving it bad remarks.........This is the best product in this price range.......Go for it.....</li>
            <li> it just worked for 10 minutes and when you try to apply just a little pressure, the thing stops turning.</li>
            <li> Works well ..... not so harsh as some.</li>
            <li> This product died on me one week after I got it. I regret buying this and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much except it exfoliating brush, because it&#x27;s not so firm. Otherwise the product is good. We can do facial at home at no cost.</li>
            <li> A good product at a good price. The only pitfall is there&#x27;s no case to carry everything in. An older model of the same product had a case but this device is bigger than the old one.</li>
            <li> t the begining I though it veyr expensive, but when bought it as a gift, afffordabl and she loving it.</li>
            <li> Only half of the attachments are really usable, and I feel like mine kind of lost a lot of its power after the first week. But I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt and saying that it&#x27;s proably because I&#x27;m using the batteries that came with it. I still like it though, even just using the sponge and brush heads.</li>
            <li> To weak ,product simply not up to par.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 out if 5 starts because the exfoliating brush is great, for me anyway. I use Retin-A daily which is a prescription anti-wrinkle cream that increases cell turnover to reveal fresher, rejuvenated looking skin. I add this fact because when I use the exfoliating brush my skin glows brighter than usual, showing me the Revlon brush is really working. I can&#x27;t say much about the other attachments, though I have used the massaging attachment a few times to apply moisturiser and seems OK. The motor is weak and you cannot apply pressure without it slowing down.</li>
            <li> Just stopped working after 1 application! and the return is cumbersome, so I guess its 20 bucks down the drain!</li>
            <li> Good option for cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> I had an older version and needed a new brush - since I was unable to find a replacement brush I bought a new unit. When it arrived, there was no brush. I do not even use the thing since I only wanted the brush attachment. Bummer</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use in the shower. It worked great for a few months then is just quit. Come to find out it is not water proof.</li>
            <li> I guess I got my moneys worth but this product no longer works. Bbbooo</li>
            <li> I bought one for a friends Birthday and then one for myself and I must say my skin is so smooth after just one use. It is amazing and a GREAT PRICE!!!! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last 2 weeks. I only got to use it a few times and it broke a waste it twenty dollars better off buying something worth spending money on</li>
            <li> The device is not very powerful, but is more than adequate for the price. If you are looking for professional results than this may not be for you. Provides a gentle application that is suitable for daily home use.</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric facial brush but didn&#x27;t want to pay $150 for one at a beauty store. I found this on amazon at without any thought I bought. I&#x27;ve had it now for almost three weeks and my skin is glowing! You wont be disappointed if you buy this. One bit of advice tho...if you use it in the shower make sure to take out the battereies after you&#x27;re done with it and let it air dry. There really isn&#x27;t a seal around the battery door and it does get wet in there.</li>
            <li> The sponge applicator did do what it said and move the cleanser all over my face, I loved how gentle it was and it was also very easy to clean. The exfoliator brush had soft bristles  that did go deep in my skin and made the biggest difference, I felt so much brighter and felt so much smoother as well. I tried the blemish extractor on one of my blemishes, and I didn&#x27;t feel anything at first, as soon as I pulled away I noticed it had a suction thing and I saw blood. It did extract the blemish and did NOT even leave a scar! :D (No pain either). I did not use the ball rolling applicator to apply my moisturizer, instead I used my fingers to apply the moisturizer after my toner and then used the ball roller head to get the moisturizer deep into my skin and get my blood circulation running and my skin did feel much more softer after. Overall I saw a great improvement on my skin especially for the price! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so loud and came with a holder. Pretty great product :P</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks, it worked well and I saw a difference in skin condition. However it stopped working after that. Planning on getting a replacement since the product was wonderful when it worked. The brush was soft for the skin and the attachment with little balls massaged the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I just opened the package and took out the brush heads and the main part to the hand-held device. It&#x27;s easy to put the head you want on, take it off, switch, etc. I used a granulated product (my face mask/exfoliator/cleanser product I adore), but you could probably use sugar and lemon/lime juice, too...and the result? I&#x27;ve never had the smoothest skin in my life. I have combination skin, blemishes, and pimples like everyone else, and wow. I used the bristle head on \\&quot;high\\&quot; and my face, after 6 minutes, is quite tingly. The suction head was iffy, but perhaps if it were a stronger machine (but for $15 or so, that&#x27;s not bad - I felt *something*). The scrubs were great, especially for those wearing a lot of makeup or those low on time for cleaning the face. Just make sure to rinse it out (off the device) and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> This system is wonderful. I use it on my face and body. My skin is now vey soft and the chafing problem I had is now gone. Using it with organic skin products is a plus and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> yes I use this once a month on my face to expoliate to rid dead skin, I use with warm water and rinse my face in cold water to close the pores.....Korean do that 424 regime.google it...I expoliate for 44 seconds.</li>
            <li> Good for the money...I have another cleaning system similiar that I like a little better.  This is a good quick daily clean and cleans up well too.</li>
            <li> I love it and I use it every day. I have recommended it to all the women in my family</li>
            <li> hello guys ..this is worst product ...don&#x27;t buy this item..its revlon worst product ever..so please dnt buy because its not working good effective its look like a plastic toy</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product- after purchasing four of them! I gave it to all the females in my family as presents and was sadly disappointed because with one month they all stopped working. Initially I thought the batteries needed changing but it failed to work.</li>
            <li> Stopped working fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS SYSTEM. It was fantastic. Gave great results at an amazing price. Then, it stopped working. The reason it stopped working, you ask? IT GOT WET. This device,  which is used to wash and exfoliate your face using a cleanser and water, stopped working because it got WET. Before you ask,  no,  I did not submerge it in water. I didn&#x27;t use it in the shower or tub. I simply moistened the sponge/brush,  scrubbed my face,  removed the attachment to rinse it off,  and dryed the head and unit. I never deliberately wet the powered part of the device. I even stored it in a dry cabinet outside my bath. I am so mad and disappointed with this system. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Revlon RVSP3505B1 Skin Renewal Cleansing System because I was having some problems with black head and ingrown hairs on my face. I started using this system with my cleansing liquid when I received it, I am happy with the system, it is doing the job as the company described on the box, it is clearing my black heads and exposing the hairs underneath those areas, which in turn are allowing me to tweeze them out and be in less pain. The only thing I would say is it need more power, if you press to firm it would slow down too much. For the price it&#x27;s worth it, it does the job, a little bit more power would be great.</li>
            <li> I loved it I wished it had an electric plug and not batteries :(</li>
            <li> Love my order am very please and will order from you in the future if you have something that I can use. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I wanted to try one of these face cleansing systems but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on it. I really like this gadget. I read some reviews that complained about it pulling their hair out. I use hair clips to hold my hair back from my forehead and the sides. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It seems to be doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> Spins slowly, I usually have to help it get started and the minute it gets wet it stops.</li>
            <li> The Revlon skin cleansing system has more attachments than any of the higher priced units on the market.  i especially love the pore vacuming tip - it sucks the blackheads right out!  The massage tip will allow you to put the moisturizer into the skin deeper than just applying it and of course the brush and polishing tips do a wonderful job!  My last system had rechargeable batteries on a charger and when they finally stopped being able to take a charge, I had to toss the unit.  This system will take regular AA batteries and should not have an issue with the charging station.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in this product!  You can hardly touch your skin and it stops.  I should have sent it right back, but waited until I felt it was too late.</li>
            <li> it is ok.&lt;br /&gt;After i use it , i prefer to use my hand instead.&lt;br /&gt;But i love the massage head of this! Although i don&#x27;t like use it wash my face, i can use it to do massage !&lt;br /&gt;you worth to have it !</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft and assists with preventing breakouts.  It even convinced my granddtr. to use one also.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom after my grand daughter got one. I love the looks of it. My mom said it works great and you can actually feel suction with the one piece, but I&#x27;m not exactly sure how effective it is for what that piece is supposed to do. But the brushes and pads were nice. Mom likes it.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t really have much &#x27;umph&#x27; to it.. it runs slow even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> The only piece that didn&#x27;t work for me was the suction head. I have oily skin so the thought that something could just suck up the oil, Especially for those problem areas ( Nose and chin), seemed great :( . Other than that I do use all of the other heads. They work just as I would imagine the $100-$200 cleanser brushes would AND you get more head options. Yes, the head slows down a bit if you add pressure, But on high you shouldn&#x27;t have to press very hard. It would hurt me at least. I use the sponge for my face wash, follow with the exfoliating brush, rinse, apply moisterizer, let dry, then use the messager head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards my skin feels so smooth and less oily at the end of the day. Yes, I get a little red, but I&#x27;m light skinned so I&#x27;m used to that. I also have bad acne scars on my cheelks and since I added my cleansing system to my daily routine my skin has progressively improved. I would DEFinitely recommend this product for those on a budget yet lookin for a good skin care system. Plus the replacement heads set is only like $5! Can&#x27;t beat that. Or if you want to spend $200 on another product to feel better, well that&#x27;s on you :)</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I was really into the scrubber with the bristles. I pretty much only use that attachment and the soft foam pad now, I feel like the other two are unnecessary. After the first use of the system, the battery seems to be really sensitive and will cut out at times, especially if I don&#x27;t have my finger on the &#x27;on&#x27; button, which makes it a little bit of a pain to use, but it&#x27;s nothing more than an inconvenience, if anything. My skin is usually pretty clear, but this definitely helped me with maintaining and keeping my pores clean. I think most will notice a difference in a week of use. I would recommend it since it&#x27;s affordable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Weak, the suction does nothing. The foam sponge feels like it polished my face,  but didn&#x27;t clean it. I am unimpressed.</li>
            <li> It was not what I wanted. the brissles are too soft and don&#x27;t clean my face properly, plus it makes a terrible noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sue Cox&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t sent it back as it will cost me just as much in postage</li>
            <li> the brush and massager feels good on my skin but the suction tool sucks..it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all and it was the one part that I really wanted to work.</li>
            <li> Great value, works well. I never knew I needed this until I tried one.</li>
            <li> Was impressed w/ the sunction in fact I have 2 scars where it pulled out my skin lol! Brush gets smoshed after only 3 washed but great product for the money! It does make alot ofnoise though while using.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this product, but this one does not work well.  The brush is too soft and the power is too low.  If you apply the slightest pressure the attachment sticks and the motor screams.  I have been replacing the batteries about every three or four days and I have been using it only once per day.  I would consider using it as a plain brush without the batteries, but it is too soft.  It is too inexpensive to return.</li>
            <li> Reaally nice work. I ordered for my wife and she just loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out because im not sure about investing 150.00 on the clarisonic..... the brush hurts a little, a bit rough, but the other attachments arent that bad.  easy to clean, just run it under sink.  so far so good....</li>
            <li> lost power and runs slower than molasses now</li>
            <li> I like this product, its worth the price. It does it job of cleansing. My only dislike is that there are not enough bristles so it seems like the bristles that exist sway side to side instead of being compacted while spinning. I havent really used the other peices yet, I dont really see the purpose of them.. Im sure this products would cost less if they didnt exist. It is battery operated and batteries are included so thats a plus for me.</li>
            <li> there has four choose to use, i like use the sponge use with clean milk, it easy to remove your foundationã€‚&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t used in bathroom</li>
            <li> This little brush doesn&#x27;t have enough power to really clean. It looks cute but not very practical. The extra heads don&#x27;t do much of anything.  I gave mine away and bought some manual brushes that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 weeks and then the battery died. replaced the batteries then realised it doesnt make any difference as the whoel thing isnt water proof so the water gets in and corrodes the batteries. Long story short, waste of money and it isnt waterproof and therefore the batteries run out after a week every time. you end up spending a fortune on batteriess ahhh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i thought hey well at least i can use it without batteries, just as a manual face brush. no. that didnt work, for some reason when the thing works and the brush spins properly it does your skin good , cleans the pores works well. But when you use it manually it just brings my fake up in a massive rash of spots, must be something to do with the rotation/pressure, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, or in this case, less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for the clarisonic , im saving up for it :P!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rotate fast enough.  Looses battery charge quickly.  I won&#x27;t purchase this product again!  The idea behind the product is a good one, however.</li>
            <li> exactly what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> I would never recommed this item to anyone. I would suggest spending your money on another product that is reliable.</li>
            <li> This product you use to clean your face plus exfoliating brush that you literally see the dry skin flake off! It&#x27;s amazing. Also massage for face and after, you&#x27;re face glows. Highly recommend A++++++</li>
            <li> Good price. Bought for hygiene purposes. Same as with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> purchased for teen granddaughter who loves it. leaves her skin feeling clean but not stripped of all oils. would purchase for self.</li>
            <li> When I read the review for this product, I was skeptical.  However, upon using it, I must say:  It is simply marvelous.  I don&#x27;t know what those other ladies were doing with it; however, I used it and had no problems with it at all.  It is a wonderful product and the results are amazing.  The price is appropriate.  The marketing department for this company got it right.  This is a product that can be purchased for young teens as well as adults.  The design is ergonomically friendly, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of pressure to use it, it cleanses and shines the face to a perfect glow. It is light weight and encourages you to be a \\&quot;lady\\&quot; (to wit: gentle) while using it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a \\&quot;reasonably priced, effective facial cleanser.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for facial cleansing and care without making a huge mess. It makes washing and exfoliating easy and handy. The brush is short and gentle. The extra sponge is perfect as this item is used the most. Yay, I found something that works. I bought an extra set of accessories for future use. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is just OK.  Its loud and the attachments don&#x27;t  seem to be to secure. One of them doesn&#x27;t even work actually.  I would return it, but its more of a hassle and bother if anything.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing tools for facial cleansing ever! You should defiantly try it and it was well worth the price~</li>
            <li> Great price n the batteries comes with it!</li>
