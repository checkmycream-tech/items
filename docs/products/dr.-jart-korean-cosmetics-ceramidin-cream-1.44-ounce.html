            <li>We just don&#x27;t produce as much.</li>

            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those of you suffering from chronic dryness : the answer is not thick creams, the answer is how to repair your compromised skin</li>
            <li>After a few days my scars have started to fade and the redness on my face from using acne products has literally gone away for the most part.</li>
            <li>Extreme Dryness or Oily skin, this with fit your needs for both.&lt;br /&gt;Dr.</li>
            <li>This product warranted the creation of new words to describe it.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m actually allergic to this product, which is ironic since this is made for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I received sample and immediately noticed this cream is non-greasy, smells wonderfully natural and aromatherapeutic, made my skin feel</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>

            <li>My face feels so soft after only a week of use.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin that is dry</li>
            <li>With regular use, you&#x27;ll see your skin retain moisture on its own, needing less and less &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; from heavy occlusive creams.</li>
            <li>Our dermis acts as the respiratory barrier, modulating out anything bad, while keeping in the good stuff like moisture and ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not sure what is really supposed to do.</li>
            <li> cream is pretty thick for a cream</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wait that long for a product.</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry or combination, this product is a must.  </li>
            <li> I would tell anyone with dry skin to give it a try.</li>
            <li> You can try using all the Hyaluronic Acid you want -- but it won&#x27;t help --it&#x27;ll just evaporate and escape from the loose barrier.</li>
            <li> Since moving here 3 years ago I have developed severe skin allergies and can use very few products that don&#x27;t cause itching and rashes.</li>
            <li> You only need a little dime size to cover the face literally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received this the security tape and overseal was broken leaving complete open access to the Ceramidin Cream.</li>
            <li> And when you do end up using hyaluronic acid and other hydrators, the moisture will stay withIN your skin instead of evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re deciding which to get, consider this: The two products are to be used in synergy with each other.</li>
            <li> After half an hour after I applied the cream, my face starts to itch and swell.</li>
            <li> It has broken me out several times but it&#x27;s like two or three baby pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trick Tip: To eke out every last bit of cream from this metal tube, i use a &amp;#34;wringer&amp;#34;, my secret weapon:</li>
            <li> B003XKEK50 Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> Trick Tip: To eke out every last bit of cream from this metal tube, i use a &amp;#34;wringer&amp;#34;, my secret weapon:</li>
            <li> B003XKEK50 Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> Since then this has been my to go winter face cream, no more uneven, flaky, patchy skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as I do love this cream.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> I am in my very late 40&#x27;s and somewhat losing elasticity, but this product will carry me into my 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I like how it is a very thick pasty cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good...and I am extremely skeptical by nature.</li>
            <li> Fully addicted !</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, mine arrived already pierced</li>
            <li> Also unfortunate, is that Amazons policy will not allow for an unopened replacement tube to be sent.  </li>
            <li> I was scared to use it, mad and just threw it away</li>
            <li> I am living in an area with terrible pollution and the highest pollen and mold levels in the US.</li>

            <li> Best moisturizer ever!  I have ultra sensitive skin that is dry and this does the job.  I like how it is a very thick pasty cream and it absorbs quickly into the skin.  Not greasy at all.  Very calming and a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I received sample and immediately noticed this cream is non-greasy, smells wonderfully natural and aromatherapeutic, made my skin feel more dense, more collagenic. Yes, I made those two words up you persnickety fellow-skeptics. This product warranted the creation of new words to describe it. Honestly...did you watch the movie Cat Lady? It reminds me of BeauLine...lol. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll crack up here... I noticed that when I look at my skin through a magnifying mirror, my skin looks hydrated now and plump. I am in my very late 40&#x27;s and somewhat losing elasticity, but this product will carry me into my 50&#x27;s quite nicely I do believe. Highly recommend it. It is great as a primer and as a morning and evening moisturizer. It&#x27;s that good...and I am extremely skeptical by nature.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel great and hydrated.  I use it on my face.  I have sensitive skin and this works great!  It even came with a key to squeeze all of the product from the tube.</li>
            <li> If you gave combination skin, I don&#x27;t really recommend this product. It has broken me out several times but it&#x27;s like two or three baby pimples. I&#x27;m still going to use it because I have eczema on my face. I don&#x27;t recommend using ceramidin line alone  if you have eczema. You&#x27;ll need a face cream or gel that works for you. What&#x27;s really helped my eczema is taking into consideration of both korean and japanese mentality of building layers to maintain moisture. This product has helped heal the eczema around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love Korean skin products! I have combination skin and after trying 20+ night creams at sephora, I finally got to try dr jart and wow!! Since then this has been my to go winter face cream, no more uneven, flaky, patchy skin. Good to use under primer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Now my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Fully addicted ! Works like a charm</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. You don&#x27;t have to swim in it, or apply it with a palette knife, and it really does help rebalance your skin and make it look healthier without leaving you oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot, it may just be what you&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
            <li> I love this; it is wonderful to have on under make up. My skin has never looked so good! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry or combination, this product is a must.  I love it! Results are almost immediate,  it didn&#x27;t break my sensitive skin out,  and it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky.  I&#x27;ve given two of my tubes away to friends and both love it as well.</li>
            <li> I was super excitesa bout this product because I&#x27;m big on hydration. However, I&#x27;m actually allergic to this product, which is ironic since this is made for people with sensitive skin. After the first night I used it, my cheeks were very rough and bumpy. At first I was in denial because of all the good reviews I&#x27;ve read about this product, I told myself it was because I was really tired from a weekend trip. I actually did a hydration mask (My beauty diary: hyaluronic acid. And I love this product, been using it for years) the second day, than applied the ceramidin cream. After half an hour after I applied the cream, my face starts to itch and swell. No doubt I&#x27;m allergic to this product &#x3D;&amp;#60; I gave this cream to my mom, she said it&#x27;s been great on her skin. Made her skin very nice and smooth. That&#x27;s why I gave it a 3 stars. It&#x27;s a good product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning, and it wears well under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid -- we all know it draws water to skin, but what makes it STAY there? our skin barrier. Our dermis acts as the respiratory barrier, modulating out anything bad, while keeping in the good stuff like moisture and ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramides are lipids that naturally occur in our skin and provide long-term moisture, glowy skin. We are born with a ton of ceramides. See babies with their highly elastic, dewdrop lustrous skin? that&#x27;s ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But guess what? Over time and with age, our ceramide load shrivels up. We just don&#x27;t produce as much. And our skin barrier becomes thinner and thinner, esp. if you overexfoliate or do acid peels. You can try using all the Hyaluronic Acid you want -- but it won&#x27;t help --it&#x27;ll just evaporate and escape from the loose barrier. You need ceramide lipids to hold that water in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to replenish our body&#x27;s store of ceramides, we need to ADD ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jart&#x27;s has a time-release microcapsule ceramide, which penetrates skin more effectively than regular ceramides, and the whole time-release thing -- says it all. With regular use, you&#x27;ll see your skin retain moisture on its own, needing less and less &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; from heavy occlusive creams. Ceramidin strengthens the skin barrier, &amp;#34;re-training&amp;#34; it to modulate hydration more effectively like a microfine mesh strainer vs. a loose woven net. And when you do end up using hyaluronic acid and other hydrators, the moisture will stay withIN your skin instead of evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you suffering from chronic dryness : the answer is not thick creams, the answer is how to repair your compromised skin barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jart&#x27;s Ceramidin system consists of a Cream and Liquid.  If you&#x27;re deciding which to get, consider this: The two products are to be used in synergy with each other. Both are loaded with Ceramides. The serum-like milky liquid acts as a &amp;#34;magnet&amp;#34; to draw in the cream&#x27;s additional Ceramide power, when layered together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you need to just get one, consider your skin type. if you&#x27;re drier, make it the Cream. It&#x27;s more nourishing and the &amp;#34;Star&amp;#34; of the system. if you&#x27;re acne-prone and oilier, get the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this duo, it will save my chronically parched skin in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trick Tip: To eke out every last bit of cream from this metal tube, i use a &amp;#34;wringer&amp;#34;, my secret weapon: [[ASIN:B003XKEK50 Heavy Duty All Metal Tube Wringer By Gill Manufacturing]].our skin type. if you&#x27;re drier, make it the Cream.

            <li> Quick Profile:&lt;br /&gt;18-25yo&lt;br /&gt;Male&lt;br /&gt;Combination, mainly oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through puberty my skin had deep puncture acne scars which I thought would never go away. After doing some research I found that ceramidin helped repair my skin foundation (not just the outer skin) along with hyaluronic acid serums to add moisture to my sub-dermal skin. After a few days my scars have started to fade and the redness on my face from using acne products has literally gone away for the most part. You only need a little dime size to cover the face literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is pretty thick for a cream but it&#x27;s great at protecting my skin from the cold winds in Minnesota :D Also, the cream doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out which is awesome considering how much moisture this cream is packing, and it&#x27;s non greasy so I&#x27;m not glossy when I go out. The scent is more on the herbal side which being a guy is better than if it smelled like perfume which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note my results are contributed in part from using hyaluronic acid serum ([[ASIN:B00DPE9EQO Best Vitamin C Serum For Your Face Contains Vitamin C + E + Hyaluronic Acid Serum - Potent 20% Vitamin CE Hyaluronic Acid Serum Will Leave Your Skin Radiant &amp; More Youthful Looking By Neutralizing Free Radicals - Highest Quality C Serum Available]]) first then applying the ceramidin cream.</li>
            <li> When I received this the security tape and overseal was broken leaving complete open access to the Ceramidin Cream. I was scared to use it, mad and just threw it away</li>
            <li> I have tried several moisturizes from Dr. Murad, Revisions etc... this is by far the best. I love this product I have really dry skin and this is the only stuff that works.  I have noticed a difference in my skin it looks healthier and the crows feet are not as deep.  I also recommend the BB cream in the gold bottle.  Beets everything out there.</li>
            <li> high moisture w/o the grease</li>
            <li> Love this product I have dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream! Keeps my face moisturized! Delivered quickly! Great service!</li>
            <li> I have always had problems finding products that don&#x27;t make my skin incredibly oily by mid-afternoon. If I use too much of this, I can still have that problem, but if I use a very small amount, I get soft skin without all the oil. This tube will last me forever!</li>
            <li> Extreme Dryness or Oily skin, this with fit your needs for both.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jart+ customer for life because of this product alone.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried this product, I couldn&#x27;t help but to buy it!! my skin feels more dewy and hydrated. Dr.Jart+ never disappoints!! ^_^</li>
            <li> I just started using this, the jury is still out</li>
            <li> Love this product..keeps skin moist and no breakouts.I live in the desert where it is very dry,and this product works wonders for the face.I would tell anyone with dry skin to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry winter skin, and love the smell!</li>
            <li> The cream was very good, however I only gave it 3 stars because it took over a month to get it.  I don&#x27;t like to wait that long for a product.</li>
            <li> Just lovely. I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> The top of this moisturizer from Dr. Jart+ has a seal that is meant to pierced/opened with the pointed end of the cap.  Unfortunately, mine arrived already pierced /opened.  Also unfortunate, is that Amazons policy will not allow for an unopened replacement tube to be sent.  Very disappointed, as I do love this cream.</li>
            <li> I am living in an area with terrible pollution and the highest pollen and mold levels in the US. Since moving here 3 years ago I have developed severe skin allergies and can use very few products that don&#x27;t cause itching and rashes. This product is wonderful. My face feels so soft after only a week of use.The moisturizer is not oily and feels light. It smells great too. Now 3 years later I am still totally satisfied and will not try another product. One reviewer stated it was too drying for her skin. This product is in NO way in drying. Instead it is moisturizing not oily and lasts over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is really supposed to do. Says it&#x27;s a moisturizer get rid of fine lines and wrinkles, doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that would indicate that it will do that.</li>
