    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best Leave in Conditioner</li>
            <li>Excellent for providing shine to over processed hair.  </li>
            <li>It also smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>the best you can buy and it Works !!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant also.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the oil is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great product for lightweight shine and thermal protection.</li>
            <li>If you have fly aways and need SHINE this is the one that will do</li>
            <li>So being able to use this between washes is perfect to protect my hair from the rigors of brushing it, when it often breaks easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is gorgeous, healthy, shiny and beautifully flowing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Chroma Riche Leave In Fluide for years and think it&#x27;s the best thing available of its kind.</li>
            <li>lightweight and gives my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>This is by far the very best hair product I have ever tried in my 50 years of life!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>love this product,  my hair feels soft,silky and healthier after applying 2 pumps.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Look healthy and shiny  this bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair brush able and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too-</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>It is really good conditioner overall</li>
            <li>I was worried about spending so much on this and even more worried when it came.  </li>
            <li>Normally I can use a lot more of this type of stuff on my hair-</li>
            <li>The salon I go to uses almost all Kerastase products, and that&#x27;s how I first learned of the Chroma Riche leave-in product.  </li>
            <li>but this is very concentrated.</li>
            <li>Very shiny glossy hair.</li>
            <li>and before i straight iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight compared to some shine products.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair shine and also not get tangled as much.</li>
            <li>I apply this to the ends of my dry hair at night and comb through, and in the morning it&#x27;s completely absorbed with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>Using this for years and it makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>I use volumizing products after wash and don&#x27;t like to wash my hair frequently.</li>
            <li>It almost becomes like a wax, but pliable, soft.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide much in the way of restoration to hair shaft, but will allow you to style the hair in a piece-y fashion, and helps as a blow drying aide, or after blow dry to increase shine.</li>
            <li>and number two your hair will look a bit greasy if you use even a little too much.</li>

            <li> No heavy oil residue like some other leave in oils.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair which, when colored, soon becomes dry and crunchy-frizzled at the ends.</li>
            <li> It helps with dry and damaged hair but you really need to use a small amount otherwise your hair will look greasy.</li>

            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair, and when I use the Chroma Riche and let my hair air-dry it literally feels like silk!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that I spent the money.</li>
            <li> no more frizz!</li>

            <li> love this product,  my hair feels soft,silky and healthier after applying 2 pumps. my hair is colored and highlighted and this product restores the look and feel i once had prior to processing my hair.</li>
            <li> Using this for years and it makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> My favorite brand. They can do nothing wrong. This is my second purchase. I will not go without it. Makes my hair. Look healthy and shiny  this bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It worked as promised.My hair is shiny,no more frizz! The best Leave in Conditioner so far!I definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Excellent for providing shine to over processed hair.  Works well for any color, has no added color- will not oxidize or cause blonde to go brassy.  Doesn&#x27;t provide much in the way of restoration to hair shaft, but will allow you to style the hair in a piece-y fashion, and helps as a blow drying aide, or after blow dry to increase shine.</li>

            <li> Love this product. It makes my hair brush able and shiny.</li>
            <li> A little of this leave-in conditioner goes a long way. I love the scent too- and it even goes a long way on my thicker hair. Normally I can use a lot more of this type of stuff on my hair- but this is very concentrated. I love how it works- but the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because number one it is pricey- and number two your hair will look a bit greasy if you use even a little too much. It is really good conditioner overall though- and I would definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Very shiny glossy hair. No heavy oil residue like some other leave in oils.</li>
            <li> used this for a while, just like the product , not the prize</li>
            <li> I do not like the scent!!! Appears to weigh down my hair which is already &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! lightweight and gives my hair a nice shine. i use it after i shower and before i straight iron. it&#x27;s changed the health of my hair. i recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> Quem pediu afirma que o produto é muito bom e de ótima qualidade. Além do que funciona perfeitamente. É um bom presente.</li>
            <li> It is not drastic but does give my hair a bit of shine. I like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel heavy. It&#x27;s very lightweight compared to some shine products.</li>
            <li> It helps with dry and damaged hair but you really need to use a small amount otherwise your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product for lightweight shine and thermal protection. It also smells wonderful! Delivered on time</li>
            <li> I was worried about spending so much on this and even more worried when it came.  It squirts into your hand like oil and I was so afraid it was going to make my hair greasy.  It did not.  It almost becomes like a wax, but pliable, soft.  My hair is gorgeous, healthy, shiny and beautifully flowing.  This is by far the very best hair product I have ever tried in my 50 years of life!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Kerastase fan. But this stuff is worthless. I&#x27;m sad that I spent the money. I was so excited. Perhaps I got a knock-off? The quality is not at all what I have come to expect from a Kerastase product.</li>
            <li> If you have fly aways and need SHINE this is the one that will do it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care what it costs when I put it on my hair I know the product&lt;br /&gt;is the best you can buy and it Works !!!!</li>
            <li> The salon I go to uses almost all Kerastase products, and that&#x27;s how I first learned of the Chroma Riche leave-in product.  I can not get enough of it!!!  I have very long, thick hair, and when I use the Chroma Riche and let my hair air-dry it literally feels like silk!  The scent is very pleasant also.  I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products from the Bead Head and Aveda lines, but this trumps them all!  No oily feeling in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for couple of years now. I have long thick hair and it keeps my hair shine and also not get tangled as much. The smell of the oil is very pleasant.</li>
