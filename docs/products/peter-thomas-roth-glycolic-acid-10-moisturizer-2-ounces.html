            <li> This product does work! It moisturizes yet controls my acne.  It tingles when you apply and shortly goes away.  It has helped diminish fine line, minimize pores and lessens cystic breakouts.  I love using it day or night and get great results.  Even have my mom and friends hooked on it too!</li>
            <li> I love using this product at night. And it clears any blemishes very quickly. My skin is prone to hormonal breakouts and this seems to keep it under control for me.</li>
            <li> After discovering this product a few years ago, I am hooked! I love this PTR moisturizer because it leaves my face feeling nourished and looking fresh and fab - I think the GA10% is the secret. Non-irritating, no weird smells, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no smell to it, i can see results almost immediately.. I have oil T-zone skin and it works great for me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good stuff; my wife loves it, says it really works well</li>
            <li> This is expensive and just ok - I didn&#x27;t see any great improvement or feel any tingle.  Maybe my face is just leather!</li>
            <li> did great things for adult acne; face is way clearer now than before; love this product!!  doesn&#x27;t overdry for me but i always add a moisturizing sunblock over it about 15 min after</li>
            <li> This stuff is just great. I could tell a difference immediately. The only downside is the product stings a wee bit upon application, but this is the product working.</li>
            <li> After years of changing moisurizers and anti-aging products I found this fantastic complex. It does everything it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin&#x27;s fine lines have dimished significantly. My skin feels smoother and looks radient. The best perk for me is improvement of my adult cystic acne on oily areas. It is almost gone when I use this moisturizer regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Glycolic Acid face wash as well.These products are affordable and will give you better results than creams and serums that are three times the price.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face. I use it in the morning under makeup. My skin tends to be oily and this works great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and unfortunately I do not notice a difference at all. I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and I was hoping this would help my dull looking skin. I also have some little milia on my forehead, which I&#x27;ve read can be erased by using glycolic acid. Maybe this product just isn&#x27;t strong enough? Really disappointed as I had read some good reviews about this.</li>
            <li> After reading the product description, I was excited to try it. However, it has been a disappointment. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost one year now and have not seen any effect. It&#x27;s a total lie.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, as described.</li>
            <li> gotta love his products, this one actually cleared my skin, it tingles a bit but it is certainly worth it!</li>
            <li> Great delivery time. Great product. Would definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> good, i think.  i like the slight &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 something and have tried a lot of highly rated creams and this is one of my favs for daily wear.  I think my pores look smaller and skin smoother!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good product, but I honestly have not used it long enough to be able to give five stars.  It does have a high percentage of glycolic acid, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> makes my skin look fresh and makes the lines seem to fade a bit.  all the nasty dullness of winter fades away too.  gives a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;  i would avoid the eye area like it says but I&#x27;ve gotten fairly close to the lips and nose without problems and i have really dry  acne-prone sensitive skin- the trifecta of mayhem but this has given me no problems</li>
