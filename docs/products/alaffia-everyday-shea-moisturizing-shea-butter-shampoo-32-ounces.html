    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Fair Trade!!!</li>
            <li>Also, we use the lavender shampoo and conditioner now - our noses have changed, and now we like the lavender the best!  </li>
            <li>and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Alone it seems to work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>(PS this stuff smells subtly awesome).</li>
            <li>it turns out GREAT.</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>One thing that happens now is my hair won&#x27;t slip out of my hairdos, which is great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how this makes my hair feel, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel great either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d happily give this five stars, except that I have not yet found a way to get the pump on top to pop up!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for you and good for the environment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go to shampoo, baby shampoo, dog wash, and makes a good body wash too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>- I have a fair complexion and my scalp is a tad oily, I wash my hair 5 to 6 days a week.  </li>
            <li>like I thought it would be really good.</li>
            <li>but I just want to give the company a good review.</li>
            <li>This would probably be a good choice for someone with a lot of teenagers in the house.</li>
            <li>I find it very refreshing , but it may not be to your taste.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month now, and my hair feels very healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair has been a lot more &#x27;fly away&#x27; since I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells really nice and feels good while lathering.</li>
            <li>and I love lovE it!!</li>
            <li>the best - sort of like Wrigley&#x27;s gum ;)  </li>
            <li>Hey, I&#x27;ll scrub a bit more to NOT have to use a ton of chemicals!</li>
            <li>So it is nice to support these products.</li>
            <li>My kids and I smelled this and liked this scent</li>
            <li>It lathers quite nice too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read that you can wash your hair indefinitely with baking soda and vinegar, but I like the aroma of nice shampoo also.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells great, works well as a body wash, no bad additives&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers nicely and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>Alaffia&#x27;s line of products helps communities,working to reduce poverty among many things.</li>
            <li>I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now we love it.  </li>
            <li>When I need more body, I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure most guys can relate).</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>The process and good intentions of this company is just an added bonus to a great product at a low price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is ok.... not as moisturizing as one would expect considering the formula.</li>
            <li>I also love Alaffia, the parent company, for what they stand for, so I was glad to support them.</li>
            <li>I love them both.  </li>
            <li>and overall I think it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure part of it is bc</li>
            <li>experienced the \\&quot;residue\\&quot; feeling, so now when I wash, I make sure to take the time to really scrub and get every inch of my scalp, and that seemed to work.</li>
            <li>but it was OK.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does lather well, but you have to use more shampoo when you oil your hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself started off good- enough lather and great scent.</li>
            <li>, that doesn&#x27;t cost $20 or more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use the conditioner, and am able to use a spray-on conditioner (another brand) for 2 days (for frizz and making the ends look smoother) without my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li>(I was able to return my lotion just because I didn&#x27;t like it).</li>
            <li>When I received this product I was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I have great results and HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Fair for Life - Social and Fair Trade by IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, smells good, no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to find a product in my budget without many unknown ingredient names in the shampoo.</li>
            <li>and this shampoo has been really great for keeping my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find something without so many ingredients.</li>
            <li>Easy to dispense as well.</li>
            <li>Very soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li>For about the first 2 weeks I really liked this product but after that it seemed to leave a lot of build up, now I am stuck with a huge bottle of product I don&#x27;t care to use.</li>
            <li>I found the conditioner fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge pain to have to remove the lid and glop some shampoo on my hand every time I want to use it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the quality of my hair after using this</li>
            <li>This is the best &#x27;green&#x27;/&#x27;low-poo&#x27; shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Going chemical free has been quite an experience.  </li>
            <li>So if you are trying to go chemical free, give this stuff a try.  </li>
            <li>Works on all hair types also, as my bf uses it (we have totally different hair textures) and has great results.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo because the ingredients and company&#x27;s mission has everything I liked and wanted.</li>
            <li>We kept using this shampoo, since it was the only one we could find that was affordable (when on sale), smelled good, and was ok for our  allergies and sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at all the good reviews here.</li>
            <li>But make sure you use it for a month before giving up on it ;)</li>
            <li>I bought this at the store, but after a couple uses found I had significant buildup.</li>
            <li>, I was really excited about it</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Shampoo, we picked it up at a WholeFoods and my only grip is I didn&#x27;t pick up MORE!</li>
            <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t clean our hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Summary, it didn&#x27;t lather well and did not leave the hair looking or feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>They love the way the shampoo smells; I love the pump that means no mess.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and it is worth it!</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice and it leaves my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to love this product and the associated conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this shampoo, but my hair is greasy &amp; oily after I use it.</li>
            <li>Glad we found it here Thanks for getting it to us promptly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather, which I don&#x27;t mind, but it seemed to disappear once you put it in your hair, so I&#x27;d super rinse to make sure it was all out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, but it&#x27;s been an interesting experience using a natural shampoo instead of the more traditional kind that I prefer.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>(I have a full head of fine straight hair, colored with henna and indigo).  </li>
            <li>, HOT!  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large and will last you a good while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have a shampoo that performs well for multiple purposes, smells good, has a decent price, and isn&#x27;t a bottle full of harsh lab-created chemicals.</li>
            <li>Everyday Shea shampoo works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>It is drying, since it is salty, but it gives my hair some fun texture.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also nice, especially if you&#x27;re a fan of vanilla.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has minimal irritants in the formula, and is fair trade.</li>
            <li>I add it to my wet hair, at the roots, &amp; work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair feel soft and much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving it overall.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many natural shampoos to avoid chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>--I followed up with cool water rinse), and my hair, now that it is dry feels really nice.</li>
            <li>On the go, I even use this as a bodywash, and it leaves me very clean and soft without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really particular about the ingredients in my hair products (and my food for that matter) and enjoy the fact that these ingredients are not harmful to the environment nor to my body.</li>
            <li>I really like it and highly reccomend to those who are willing to wait on the hair-combing ease :-)</li>
            <li>ended up buying another brand of all natural shampoo and conditioner and it took 2 washes to get all of the buildup out of my hair and when I got out of the shower and combed it, there were still a couple spots that had a tiny bit left on my scalp, even after I scrubbed it as best as I could.</li>
            <li>We enjoy this shampoo but can&#x27;t get it where we live.</li>
            <li>I got this shampoo at my local co-op while looking for a good, natural, no-sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin  often breaks out into rashes and rosacea when I use strong shampoos</li>
            <li>I also feel that as a sulfate free and natural product that it keeps my hair color fresh longer than the products advertised to protect color.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend following a program where you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day to get the full benefits of this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very concentrated shower soap (two quick pumps are more than enough for a shower, when used with a shower \\&quot;scrunchy\\&quot;) which lathers copiously.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that an exceptional amount of hair came out when I rinsed, far more than usual.</li>
            <li>B0062BE1NI Sexy Beach Hair - Texturizing Sea Salt Spray with French Lavender, Sea Kelp &amp; Seaweed]].  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using their shampoo/conditioner for almost a year now, it really helped my oily hair!</li>
            <li>I also find myself using more shampoo than I thought I would, per washing (2 squirts, or more).&lt;br /&gt;I was going to use an alternate shampoo like a bar shampoo, to give my hair a break, but remembered that I&#x27;ve used baking soda and a vinegar rinse before.</li>
            <li>All seemed good with the conditioner even though the girl at the market warned it might leave a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>Loved it after a few uses</li>
            <li>The shampoo makes my hair feel very thick, which is good, since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tends to get pretty oily, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or scalp.</li>
            <li>As a fan of both mint and vanilla, I love the scent, especially since it is soft and natural and not overpowering like I find most synthetic fragrances to be.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo, its all natural, smells great, and lathered like conventional shampoos that contain all the junk I wanted to avoid putting in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is different because it does lather up well and gets my hair very clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a lot to wash out, but if you curl or flat iron and use a lot of product (which I do on occasion), you might need a slightly more robust shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be aware that the strong peppermint scent is reminiscent of candy.</li>
            <li>Like the baby and me, the dog has sensitive dry skin, and this shampoo works well to get him clean without the itching or flaking like many dog shampoos or soaps</li>
            <li>I switched to sulfate free products for 3 reasons, the environment (I live near the coast</li>
            <li>For what its worth, it made a decent soap for shaving, since I can&#x27;t bear to just throw it out after spending a decent amount of money on both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>With oilier type hair, I think this would work out fine for fairly regular use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem is, there is WAY too much shea butter in this.</li>
            <li>I bought our bottle at Whole Foods for about $10.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning mine to the Whole Foods where I bought it.</li>
            <li>I got this product from whole foods</li>
            <li>It was also very affordable at $10.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reviews, which confirmed my suspicion, saying that it takes a couple days-weeks for your hair to adjust.</li>
            <li>I came accross this shampoo in whole foods store and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars instead of fewer because while the feel is not good, I can tell that it is actually pretty good for my hair.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel twice as thick as it is and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the plus side, the ingredient list is acceptable and it&#x27;s a lot more economical than some of the other natural shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and keeps it pretty straight.</li>
            <li>I do like a nice tingle from time to time, but I have found that not having a tingle is beneficial in that I can wash my baby&#x27;s hair or even my dog without \\&quot;the tinglies\\&quot; bothering eyes or other sensitive places.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other shampoo/conditioners, and they always make my hair feel lovely -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one thing for a product to be green, fair trade, healthy, etc., but if that product doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s a complete waste.</li>
            <li>I thought a moisturizing shampoo would be good for my hair since I always blow dry and straighten it, but this takes moisture to a whole other level.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and long, these products gives it a nice bounce (but, not a frizzy-fro) and really helps to maintain normal oil balances, making my hair very soft and definitely not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Before I started using this amazing stuff I had to wash my hair everyday!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>white vinegar in cool water</li>
            <li>and I particularly like the smell of this flavor</li>
            <li>Once my hair is &#x27;clean&#x27; and &#x27;dry&#x27;, I can pull a section of hair up and it&#x27;ll almost stay sticking straight up, like in that scene in &#x27;</li>
            <li>After rinsing out this shampoo you will notice that your hair feels very different, clean but not slick per se.  </li>
            <li>and we have a high water table)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle enough for all these showers but strong enough to wash away the scalp oiliness.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, medium thickness, not too fine or coarse, but very straight.</li>
            <li>It works well to get my hair fresh and clean without being harsh or stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>I honestly think I&#x27;m going to have to cleanse a few times with a &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo, or maybe something more hard core like dish liquid, to get this out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never really been able to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all frizzed and crazy, but this shampoo is really great.</li>
            <li>My old shampoo was just as natural and chemical free, but actually cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty moisturizing, however, it does leave a semi-stripped feeling to the hair but not as much as the \\&quot;regular</li>
            <li>This product completely dried out and damaged my hair causing notable breakage and hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to get my hair to part right, and suddenly after using this shampoo, I&#x27;ll brush my hair and it won&#x27;t immediately fall limply into that bald spot, again because it feels a bit thicker or rougher, and is holding its shape</li>
            <li>Bought it because I wanted few ingredients and liked the socially concious aspect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be shopping for a new shampoo and using the rest of this product as a body wash.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the pump handle because I&#x27;m pretty lazy and would rather not fiddle around with caps</li>
            <li>I bought this locally, wish there had been a smaller size available.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not that great if you have dandruff, but then again I&#x27;ve tried T-gel, Head and Shoulders, and Selsun Blue and none of them ever got rid of my dandruff, so your results may vary.</li>
            <li>It was 32 fl oz which is more than the usual shampoo that I use</li>
            <li>I used the vanilla mint conditioner first since I was still using up the last of another shampoo.</li>
            <li>However, sometimes I wonder about build-up, and I think that now that I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for several weeks, my hair seems to get oily sooner than when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>I have hair down to my bra-strap but 3 pumps is more than enough to wash my scalp.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this product but let down.</li>
            <li>Does not lather well enough to clean my long hair without using a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>I have relatively thick chin-length, straight-ish fine hair that is much drier than it used to be.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair and therefore it takes a lot less to clean and condition.  </li>
            <li>If I used too much of this shampoo at once, my hair would feel like it was starting to turn into dread locks while I was washing it</li>
            <li>And I must admit, I was not wild about this shampoo when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li>- my hair is soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Everyday Shea products.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to throw it out, so I tried one last</li>
            <li>I used to have to lotion up my whole body but since switching to using this as a body wash the only time I need to put lotion on is after I shave my legs.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that usually feels super silky, and this made it feel rough.</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural moisture.  </li>
            <li>their shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s products like this that give the natural food and health industry a granola munch, sweaty hippie reputation.</li>
            <li>But, i noticed considerable hair fall with all the shampoos.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair fall reduced considerably and my hair looked stronger than never before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a gentle shampoo with a short ingredient list</li>
            <li>baking soda in warm water, poured onto wet hair, let sit for a few minutes, followed by 2 Tbsp.</li>
            <li>+ it&#x27;s matching conditioner for a few days and at first, I loved the smell (so did my family!), but it seemed like my hair was so dry and stringy in the shower that I could hardly comb out my hair!</li>
            <li>It takes a bit to adjust to, like any other natural thing in the world, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the adjustment.</li>
            <li>I find the pump very convenient; much less bothersome than dealing with flip top plastic caps, which are messy and tend to break anyway.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in a natural product that does seem to work, I LOVE Acure products, to which I&#x27;m going back after this failed experiment.</li>
            <li>At first it was a bit runny, but I think that was due to the temperature</li>
            <li>I have been sulfate free for 6 years and have tried at least 10 shampoos</li>
            <li>Seems to be a common problem with sulfate free products.</li>
            <li>It felt dry coming out of the shower, but dried fine.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am not a heavy product user, I have a simple water based gel that I apply with my hands</li>
            <li>Sadly, I&#x27;m back on the lookout for a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>I often don&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner afterward because the natural oils in my hair seem to be just enough to make my hair stay moisturized.</li>
            <li>I reccomend this product to anyone who has dry, normal, and even oily hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the conditioner at a local store - in my continuing search for a natural shampoo and conditioner that actually work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been mostly natural for years, and it&#x27;s not the least expensive way to live, so I was super excited to find a big bottle of a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>That said, my hair is not dull or lack any shine due the absence of silicones and proteins, the natural products in this shampoo replace them sufficiently.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fair Trade!!!</li>
            <li> Also, we use the lavender shampoo and conditioner now - our noses have changed, and now we like the lavender the best!  </li>
            <li> and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Alone it seems to work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> (PS this stuff smells subtly awesome).</li>
            <li> it turns out GREAT.</li>
            <li> It smells great</li>
            <li> One thing that happens now is my hair won&#x27;t slip out of my hairdos, which is great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how this makes my hair feel, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel great either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d happily give this five stars, except that I have not yet found a way to get the pump on top to pop up!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for you and good for the environment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to shampoo, baby shampoo, dog wash, and makes a good body wash too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> - I have a fair complexion and my scalp is a tad oily, I wash my hair 5 to 6 days a week.  </li>
            <li> like I thought it would be really good.</li>
            <li> but I just want to give the company a good review.</li>
            <li> This would probably be a good choice for someone with a lot of teenagers in the house.</li>
            <li> I find it very refreshing , but it may not be to your taste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now, and my hair feels very healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair has been a lot more &#x27;fly away&#x27; since I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells really nice and feels good while lathering.</li>
            <li> and I love lovE it!!</li>
            <li> the best - sort of like Wrigley&#x27;s gum ;)  </li>
            <li> Hey, I&#x27;ll scrub a bit more to NOT have to use a ton of chemicals!</li>
            <li> So it is nice to support these products.</li>
            <li> My kids and I smelled this and liked this scent</li>
            <li> It lathers quite nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read that you can wash your hair indefinitely with baking soda and vinegar, but I like the aroma of nice shampoo also.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells great, works well as a body wash, no bad additives&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers nicely and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> Alaffia&#x27;s line of products helps communities,working to reduce poverty among many things.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now we love it.  </li>
            <li> When I need more body, I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure most guys can relate).</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> The process and good intentions of this company is just an added bonus to a great product at a low price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is ok.... not as moisturizing as one would expect considering the formula.</li>
            <li> I also love Alaffia, the parent company, for what they stand for, so I was glad to support them.</li>
            <li> I love them both.  </li>
            <li> and overall I think it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure part of it is bc</li>
            <li> experienced the \\&quot;residue\\&quot; feeling, so now when I wash, I make sure to take the time to really scrub and get every inch of my scalp, and that seemed to work.</li>
            <li> but it was OK.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does lather well, but you have to use more shampoo when you oil your hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself started off good- enough lather and great scent.</li>
            <li> , that doesn&#x27;t cost $20 or more.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner, and am able to use a spray-on conditioner (another brand) for 2 days (for frizz and making the ends look smoother) without my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> (I was able to return my lotion just because I didn&#x27;t like it).</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I have great results and HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Fair for Life - Social and Fair Trade by IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, smells good, no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to find a product in my budget without many unknown ingredient names in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and this shampoo has been really great for keeping my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find something without so many ingredients.</li>
            <li> Easy to dispense as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li> For about the first 2 weeks I really liked this product but after that it seemed to leave a lot of build up, now I am stuck with a huge bottle of product I don&#x27;t care to use.</li>
            <li> I found the conditioner fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge pain to have to remove the lid and glop some shampoo on my hand every time I want to use it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the quality of my hair after using this</li>
            <li> This is the best &#x27;green&#x27;/&#x27;low-poo&#x27; shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Going chemical free has been quite an experience.  </li>
            <li> So if you are trying to go chemical free, give this stuff a try.  </li>
            <li> Works on all hair types also, as my bf uses it (we have totally different hair textures) and has great results.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo because the ingredients and company&#x27;s mission has everything I liked and wanted.</li>
            <li> We kept using this shampoo, since it was the only one we could find that was affordable (when on sale), smelled good, and was ok for our  allergies and sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at all the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> But make sure you use it for a month before giving up on it ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this at the store, but after a couple uses found I had significant buildup.</li>
            <li> , I was really excited about it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shampoo, we picked it up at a WholeFoods and my only grip is I didn&#x27;t pick up MORE!</li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t clean our hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Summary, it didn&#x27;t lather well and did not leave the hair looking or feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> They love the way the shampoo smells; I love the pump that means no mess.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and it is worth it!</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice and it leaves my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this product and the associated conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this shampoo, but my hair is greasy &amp; oily after I use it.</li>
            <li> Glad we found it here Thanks for getting it to us promptly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lather, which I don&#x27;t mind, but it seemed to disappear once you put it in your hair, so I&#x27;d super rinse to make sure it was all out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, but it&#x27;s been an interesting experience using a natural shampoo instead of the more traditional kind that I prefer.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> (I have a full head of fine straight hair, colored with henna and indigo).  </li>
            <li> , HOT!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is large and will last you a good while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have a shampoo that performs well for multiple purposes, smells good, has a decent price, and isn&#x27;t a bottle full of harsh lab-created chemicals.</li>
            <li> Everyday Shea shampoo works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is drying, since it is salty, but it gives my hair some fun texture.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also nice, especially if you&#x27;re a fan of vanilla.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has minimal irritants in the formula, and is fair trade.</li>
            <li> I add it to my wet hair, at the roots, &amp; work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair feel soft and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving it overall.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural shampoos to avoid chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> --I followed up with cool water rinse), and my hair, now that it is dry feels really nice.</li>
            <li> On the go, I even use this as a bodywash, and it leaves me very clean and soft without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really particular about the ingredients in my hair products (and my food for that matter) and enjoy the fact that these ingredients are not harmful to the environment nor to my body.</li>
            <li> I really like it and highly reccomend to those who are willing to wait on the hair-combing ease :-)</li>
            <li> ended up buying another brand of all natural shampoo and conditioner and it took 2 washes to get all of the buildup out of my hair and when I got out of the shower and combed it, there were still a couple spots that had a tiny bit left on my scalp, even after I scrubbed it as best as I could.</li>
            <li> We enjoy this shampoo but can&#x27;t get it where we live.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo at my local co-op while looking for a good, natural, no-sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin  often breaks out into rashes and rosacea when I use strong shampoos</li>
            <li> I also feel that as a sulfate free and natural product that it keeps my hair color fresh longer than the products advertised to protect color.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend following a program where you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day to get the full benefits of this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very concentrated shower soap (two quick pumps are more than enough for a shower, when used with a shower \\&quot;scrunchy\\&quot;) which lathers copiously.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that an exceptional amount of hair came out when I rinsed, far more than usual.</li>
            <li> B0062BE1NI Sexy Beach Hair - Texturizing Sea Salt Spray with French Lavender, Sea Kelp &amp; Seaweed]].  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their shampoo/conditioner for almost a year now, it really helped my oily hair!</li>
            <li> I also find myself using more shampoo than I thought I would, per washing (2 squirts, or more).&lt;br /&gt;I was going to use an alternate shampoo like a bar shampoo, to give my hair a break, but remembered that I&#x27;ve used baking soda and a vinegar rinse before.</li>
            <li> All seemed good with the conditioner even though the girl at the market warned it might leave a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Loved it after a few uses</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel very thick, which is good, since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tends to get pretty oily, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> As a fan of both mint and vanilla, I love the scent, especially since it is soft and natural and not overpowering like I find most synthetic fragrances to be.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, its all natural, smells great, and lathered like conventional shampoos that contain all the junk I wanted to avoid putting in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is different because it does lather up well and gets my hair very clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a lot to wash out, but if you curl or flat iron and use a lot of product (which I do on occasion), you might need a slightly more robust shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be aware that the strong peppermint scent is reminiscent of candy.</li>
            <li> Like the baby and me, the dog has sensitive dry skin, and this shampoo works well to get him clean without the itching or flaking like many dog shampoos or soaps</li>
            <li> I switched to sulfate free products for 3 reasons, the environment (I live near the coast</li>
            <li> For what its worth, it made a decent soap for shaving, since I can&#x27;t bear to just throw it out after spending a decent amount of money on both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> With oilier type hair, I think this would work out fine for fairly regular use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is, there is WAY too much shea butter in this.</li>
            <li> I bought our bottle at Whole Foods for about $10.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning mine to the Whole Foods where I bought it.</li>
            <li> I got this product from whole foods</li>
            <li> It was also very affordable at $10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews, which confirmed my suspicion, saying that it takes a couple days-weeks for your hair to adjust.</li>
            <li> I came accross this shampoo in whole foods store and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars instead of fewer because while the feel is not good, I can tell that it is actually pretty good for my hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel twice as thick as it is and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the plus side, the ingredient list is acceptable and it&#x27;s a lot more economical than some of the other natural shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and keeps it pretty straight.</li>
            <li> I do like a nice tingle from time to time, but I have found that not having a tingle is beneficial in that I can wash my baby&#x27;s hair or even my dog without \\&quot;the tinglies\\&quot; bothering eyes or other sensitive places.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoo/conditioners, and they always make my hair feel lovely -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one thing for a product to be green, fair trade, healthy, etc., but if that product doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s a complete waste.</li>
            <li> I thought a moisturizing shampoo would be good for my hair since I always blow dry and straighten it, but this takes moisture to a whole other level.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and long, these products gives it a nice bounce (but, not a frizzy-fro) and really helps to maintain normal oil balances, making my hair very soft and definitely not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this amazing stuff I had to wash my hair everyday!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> white vinegar in cool water</li>
            <li> and I particularly like the smell of this flavor</li>
            <li> Once my hair is &#x27;clean&#x27; and &#x27;dry&#x27;, I can pull a section of hair up and it&#x27;ll almost stay sticking straight up, like in that scene in &#x27;</li>
            <li> After rinsing out this shampoo you will notice that your hair feels very different, clean but not slick per se.  </li>
            <li> and we have a high water table)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle enough for all these showers but strong enough to wash away the scalp oiliness.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, medium thickness, not too fine or coarse, but very straight.</li>
            <li> It works well to get my hair fresh and clean without being harsh or stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly think I&#x27;m going to have to cleanse a few times with a &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo, or maybe something more hard core like dish liquid, to get this out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never really been able to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all frizzed and crazy, but this shampoo is really great.</li>
            <li> My old shampoo was just as natural and chemical free, but actually cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li> It is pretty moisturizing, however, it does leave a semi-stripped feeling to the hair but not as much as the \\&quot;regular</li>
            <li> This product completely dried out and damaged my hair causing notable breakage and hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my hair to part right, and suddenly after using this shampoo, I&#x27;ll brush my hair and it won&#x27;t immediately fall limply into that bald spot, again because it feels a bit thicker or rougher, and is holding its shape</li>
            <li> Bought it because I wanted few ingredients and liked the socially concious aspect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be shopping for a new shampoo and using the rest of this product as a body wash.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the pump handle because I&#x27;m pretty lazy and would rather not fiddle around with caps</li>
            <li> I bought this locally, wish there had been a smaller size available.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not that great if you have dandruff, but then again I&#x27;ve tried T-gel, Head and Shoulders, and Selsun Blue and none of them ever got rid of my dandruff, so your results may vary.</li>
            <li> It was 32 fl oz which is more than the usual shampoo that I use</li>
            <li> I used the vanilla mint conditioner first since I was still using up the last of another shampoo.</li>
            <li> However, sometimes I wonder about build-up, and I think that now that I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for several weeks, my hair seems to get oily sooner than when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my bra-strap but 3 pumps is more than enough to wash my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product but let down.</li>
            <li> Does not lather well enough to clean my long hair without using a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick chin-length, straight-ish fine hair that is much drier than it used to be.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair and therefore it takes a lot less to clean and condition.  </li>
            <li> If I used too much of this shampoo at once, my hair would feel like it was starting to turn into dread locks while I was washing it</li>
            <li> And I must admit, I was not wild about this shampoo when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li> - my hair is soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Everyday Shea products.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to throw it out, so I tried one last</li>
            <li> I used to have to lotion up my whole body but since switching to using this as a body wash the only time I need to put lotion on is after I shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that usually feels super silky, and this made it feel rough.</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural moisture.  </li>
            <li> their shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s products like this that give the natural food and health industry a granola munch, sweaty hippie reputation.</li>
            <li> But, i noticed considerable hair fall with all the shampoos.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair fall reduced considerably and my hair looked stronger than never before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a gentle shampoo with a short ingredient list</li>
            <li> baking soda in warm water, poured onto wet hair, let sit for a few minutes, followed by 2 Tbsp.</li>
            <li> + it&#x27;s matching conditioner for a few days and at first, I loved the smell (so did my family!), but it seemed like my hair was so dry and stringy in the shower that I could hardly comb out my hair!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to adjust to, like any other natural thing in the world, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the adjustment.</li>
            <li> I find the pump very convenient; much less bothersome than dealing with flip top plastic caps, which are messy and tend to break anyway.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in a natural product that does seem to work, I LOVE Acure products, to which I&#x27;m going back after this failed experiment.</li>
            <li> At first it was a bit runny, but I think that was due to the temperature</li>
            <li> I have been sulfate free for 6 years and have tried at least 10 shampoos</li>
            <li> Seems to be a common problem with sulfate free products.</li>
            <li> It felt dry coming out of the shower, but dried fine.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am not a heavy product user, I have a simple water based gel that I apply with my hands</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m back on the lookout for a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I often don&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner afterward because the natural oils in my hair seem to be just enough to make my hair stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this product to anyone who has dry, normal, and even oily hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner at a local store - in my continuing search for a natural shampoo and conditioner that actually work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mostly natural for years, and it&#x27;s not the least expensive way to live, so I was super excited to find a big bottle of a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> That said, my hair is not dull or lack any shine due the absence of silicones and proteins, the natural products in this shampoo replace them sufficiently.  </li>
            <li> IMO, it cleans just as well as other &#x27;natural&#x27; type shampoos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> My wife introduced me to this product, which she had purchased at Whole Foods in the past.</li>
            <li> added about a tablespoon of BAKING SODA to about 4-5 pumps, which is enough to wash my long hair.</li>
            <li> Actually, we took her for a haircut after using it and the hairdresser thought she hadn&#x27;t washed her hair in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Seemed like it made my hair so dry, and it was thinner feeling, not thick and slick like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Other than the possibly defective pump bottle, though, this is definitely a product I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I added a little more to see if I could get it suds at least a little</li>
            <li> I appreciate the business they do, being fair trade and don&#x27;t use GMO ingredients or horrible chemicals found in just about every main stream shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry, and I&#x27;ve had past experiences with dandruff (using normal, chemically shampoo&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> After wrapping it with a towel and letting it absorb the moisture, I either air dry or blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner too, and let it air dry then comb through it, which seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, maybe not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given how dry the winters are in Canada, this is not one I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Everyday Shea Moisturizing Shampoo and just recently added the matching conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I think is the defining and sometime misunderstood characteristic of this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of</li>
            <li> It would be really hard to pick up this large bottle every time you wanted some, so it&#x27;s pretty much a useless product in this format.</li>
            <li> Regular shampoo cleans with detergents/sulfates (bad for you and the environment) and then smooth your hair with man made silicones and proteins.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feelig greasy, heavy, sticky, even after styling.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Everyday Shea Vanilla Mint shampoo a couple of months ago and have been using it on a regular basis since that time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate-free, \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; shampoos before, but always found them sticky and impossible to lather enough to actually clean my hair.  </li>
            <li> Wet hair tangles easily because no matter how much you rinse, it leaves nasty residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo was very soap-like and not at all moisturizing for</li>
            <li> It seems like everyone here is sharply divided on the Everyday Shea shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m on here to buy any and all other products from Everyday Shea.</li>
            <li> Other daughter still had a small amount of other shampoo she scraped up and used the vanilla mint conditioner and was boasting about the softness of her hair.</li>
            <li> I put on the conditioner hoping it would soften my hair, and this is when I ended up with a greasy tangled mess.</li>
            <li> This product was the same price for approximately twice as much as the expensive (but not outlandishly priced) shampoos.</li>
            <li> After several washes, the strands of my hair felt tight and tough almost is if my hair was forming into clumps.</li>
            <li> My hair is so greasy, I can hardly tell when I&#x27;m done drying, because it still looks wet.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped to cut down my chemical load with this product, but it doesnt clean properly and my hair was terrible.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Everyday Shea where this is concerned.  </li>
            <li> I was about to toss them when I read these reviews and decided we&#x27;ll try the shampoo as a body wash to try not to waste it.  </li>
            <li> but my everyday Shea off Amazon</li>
            <li> (I wash every other day), very stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> This product just plain does not rinse out of your hair after use.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I would repurchase if I had a place close by that sold it, but too anxious to wait for a shipment.  </li>
            <li> like it usually does 24 hours after a shower.</li>
            <li> Left my hair greasy and was unable to get a brush through it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that my hair was so tangled and felt a bit rough afterwards, especially after rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t lather at all and is hard to work through the hair unless you use a lot and still won&#x27;t get a god lather.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, at least the rest of what I have, since I like the (lack of)</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having an oil slick on my head!  </li>
            <li> , I tried Everyday Shea&#x27;s unscented lotion a few years ago, and returned it; the smell was extremely unpleasant, almost nauseating, and I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the lotion on my skin.</li>
            <li> and then when I would get out, not only would I have the mess on my scalp, but my hair was incredibly stiff and impossible to comb through, and looked nasty when it dried.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try to tough it out and use up the bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair just kept looking worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Rest assured that the Everyday Shea conditioner is just as bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the shampoo immediately turned my hair to straw.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is going in the garbage sadly.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Also, I have a weird spot where my hair parts at the scalp and looks like a bald spot-</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the vanilla mint smell is weird.</li>
            <li> It rinses to sort of greasy-feeling hair that is nearly impossible to get my fingers through, which is not a good thing for me.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was bad too.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad</li>
            <li> The conditioner is just as bad as the shampoo in this regard.  </li>
            <li> Looks bad.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and using this solo, my hair didn&#x27;t look too bad.  </li>
            <li> We smelled the Lavender and hated it.  </li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> It leaves terrible build up on the scalp, too.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, its all natural, smells great, and lathered like conventional shampoos that contain all the junk I wanted to avoid putting in my hair. The problem is, there is WAY too much shea butter in this. I had a coating of shea on my scalp and if I tried to comb my hair when I got out of the shower, I was ending up with white junk on my comb and I could scrape it off with my nails. If I used too much of this shampoo at once, my hair would feel like it was starting to turn into dread locks while I was washing it and then when I would get out, not only would I have the mess on my scalp, but my hair was incredibly stiff and impossible to comb through, and looked nasty when it dried. It made my hair feel twice as thick as it is and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying another brand of all natural shampoo and conditioner and it took 2 washes to get all of the buildup out of my hair and when I got out of the shower and combed it, there were still a couple spots that had a tiny bit left on my scalp, even after I scrubbed it as best as I could. For what its worth, it made a decent soap for shaving, since I can&#x27;t bear to just throw it out after spending a decent amount of money on both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I found this at my local co-op and couldn&#x27;t be happier! This is the best &#x27;green&#x27;/&#x27;low-poo&#x27; shampoo I have ever used. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoo/conditioners, and they always make my hair feel lovely - but this is the softest and lightest my hair has felt in years! I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Everyday Shea shampoo works great on my hair. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. It can vary from person to person and what your routine is. It lathers nicely, smells good, no harsh chemicals. It&#x27;s good for you and good for the environment. It is a product from Alaffia Sustainable Skin Care. Alaffia&#x27;s line of products helps communities,working to reduce poverty among many things. (research the company) So it is nice to support these products. The bottle is large and will last you a good while. Easy to dispense as well. I know there are mixed reviews out there, but you don&#x27;t know until you try it for yourself. I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Liquid Shea Butter Soap (Aqueous Shea Leaf (Butyrospermum parkii) Extract, Saponified Shea (Butyrospermum parkii) Butter* (and) Virgin Coconut (Cocos nucifera) Oil), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl Polyglucose, Lavender Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Fair for Life - Social and Fair Trade by IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support Fair Trade!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate-free, \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; shampoos before, but always found them sticky and impossible to lather enough to actually clean my hair.  This product is different because it does lather up well and gets my hair very clean without drying it out.  As a fan of both mint and vanilla, I love the scent, especially since it is soft and natural and not overpowering like I find most synthetic fragrances to be. I&#x27;d happily give this five stars, except that I have not yet found a way to get the pump on top to pop up!  It&#x27;s a huge pain to have to remove the lid and glop some shampoo on my hand every time I want to use it.  Other than the possibly defective pump bottle, though, this is definitely a product I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Safer than the chemical laden commercial stuff and I particularly like the smell of this flavor and it lasts for the money</li>
            <li> Going chemical free has been quite an experience.  And I must admit, I was not wild about this shampoo when I first tried it.  Seemed like it made my hair so dry, and it was thinner feeling, not thick and slick like regular shampoo.  But, that&#x27;s what chemicals do, and I needed no chemicals.  My kids and I smelled this and liked this scent the best - sort of like Wrigley&#x27;s gum ;)  We smelled the Lavender and hated it.  But..... here we are two years later.  We kept using this shampoo, since it was the only one we could find that was affordable (when on sale), smelled good, and was ok for our  allergies and sensitivities.  And now we love it.  It turned out that it took about a month to adjust.  Now I wash twice with the shampoo and follow with conditioner - my hair is soft and shiny (I have a full head of fine straight hair, colored with henna and indigo).  When I need more body, I use [[ASIN:B0062BE1NI Sexy Beach Hair - Texturizing Sea Salt Spray with French Lavender, Sea Kelp &amp; Seaweed]].  It is drying, since it is salty, but it gives my hair some fun texture.  I just use extra conditioner if I need it later.  Also, we use the lavender shampoo and conditioner now - our noses have changed, and now we like the lavender the best!  So if you are trying to go chemical free, give this stuff a try.  But make sure you use it for a month before giving up on it ;)</li>
            <li> My wife introduced me to this product, which she had purchased at Whole Foods in the past. It&#x27;s a very concentrated shower soap (two quick pumps are more than enough for a shower, when used with a shower \\&quot;scrunchy\\&quot;) which lathers copiously. Be aware that the strong peppermint scent is reminiscent of candy. I find it very refreshing , but it may not be to your taste. It does not linger noticeably on the body, though, so there&#x27;s no worry about affecting those around you, post-shower. I find the pump very convenient; much less bothersome than dealing with flip top plastic caps, which are messy and tend to break anyway. The pump is efficient and does not drip after use.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo at my local co-op while looking for a good, natural, no-sulfate shampoo. It smells like Wrigley Spearmint gum, what a bonus! It works well to get my hair fresh and clean without being harsh or stripping my hair. It doesn&#x27;t tingle like some minty shampoos. I do like a nice tingle from time to time, but I have found that not having a tingle is beneficial in that I can wash my baby&#x27;s hair or even my dog without \\&quot;the tinglies\\&quot; bothering eyes or other sensitive places.    Everyone in my household uses this- including the dog. Like the baby and me, the dog has sensitive dry skin, and this shampoo works well to get him clean without the itching or flaking like many dog shampoos or soaps cause him to get.    On the go, I even use this as a bodywash, and it leaves me very clean and soft without drying out my skin. Must be the shea butter!    I&#x27;m so happy to have a shampoo that performs well for multiple purposes, smells good, has a decent price, and isn&#x27;t a bottle full of harsh lab-created chemicals. It&#x27;s my go to shampoo, baby shampoo, dog wash, and makes a good body wash too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with pretty thick hair and I&#x27;ve never really been able to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all frizzed and crazy, but this shampoo is really great. It leaves my hair very soft and keeps it pretty straight. I also enjoy the pump handle because I&#x27;m pretty lazy and would rather not fiddle around with caps (I&#x27;m sure most guys can relate). The smell is also nice, especially if you&#x27;re a fan of vanilla.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not that great if you have dandruff, but then again I&#x27;ve tried T-gel, Head and Shoulders, and Selsun Blue and none of them ever got rid of my dandruff, so your results may vary.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now, and my hair feels very healthy. This shampoo has minimal irritants in the formula, and is fair trade. The scent comes from essential oils and extracts.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla scent. Very soft and pleasant. The shampoo lathers nicely and rinses easily. It&#x27;s a good value. I really enjoy the Everyday Shea products. I will buy this again. I like the natural ingredients. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought our bottle at Whole Foods for about $10. I was hoping for a moisturizing shampoo so we could reduce our use of conditioner. Unfortunately, this shampoo was very soap-like and not at all moisturizing for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells great, works well as a body wash, no bad additives&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Dries your hair out. My hair and my kids hair all feel stripped after using this. It is NOT moisturizing.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was very excited to try it.  It was 32 fl oz which is more than the usual shampoo that I use and it the cost was comparable shipping including.  At first it was a bit runny, but I think that was due to the temperature, HOT!  It is pretty moisturizing, however, it does leave a semi-stripped feeling to the hair but not as much as the \\&quot;regular shampoo.\\&quot;  I would repurchase if I had a place close by that sold it, but too anxious to wait for a shipment.  But I would recommend trying it.  The smell is mild and it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how people can give this stuff a low review.  The process and good intentions of this company is just an added bonus to a great product at a low price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is ok.... not as moisturizing as one would expect considering the formula. I was disappointed that my hair was so tangled and felt a bit rough afterwards, especially after rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever. Leaves my hair sticky and oily looking. My old shampoo was just as natural and chemical free, but actually cleaned my hair. I tried this because they were running a sale. Never again. Yuck, returning!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the store, but after a couple uses found I had significant buildup. I looked online for resources, and found others had similar issues. I thought I&#x27;d post this review here.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to waste the whole bottle or throw it away. I have long hair, medium thickness, not too fine or coarse, but very straight. I really didn&#x27;t want to throw it out, so I tried one last trick.&lt;br /&gt;I added about a tablespoon of BAKING SODA to about 4-5 pumps, which is enough to wash my long hair. I add it to my wet hair, at the roots, &amp; work up a good lather. I don&#x27;t scrub it or try to work it into all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I figure the suds during the rinse will get to the ends of my hair. It washes all out without leaving a residue. It does feel dry-like, but I don&#x27;t finger comb it or anything, I add the matching conditioner from mid-length to the ends of my hair. After wrapping it with a towel and letting it absorb the moisture, I either air dry or blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;But it turns out GREAT. No build up! Initially 1 star but now working its way up to about a 4.</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed and bleached (highlights combined with a dye for my roots) every 3-4 months and this shampoo has been really great for keeping my hair soft and manageable. I only wash my hair maybe twice a week and I only use shampoo on the roots. I have hair down to my bra-strap but 3 pumps is more than enough to wash my scalp. It lathers quite nice too. It&#x27;s not foamy like a regular shampoo so if you&#x27;re used to that this will take some getting used to. I strongly recommend following a program where you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day to get the full benefits of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a body wash! The scent is really nice and it leaves my skin soft and silky. I used to have to lotion up my whole body but since switching to using this as a body wash the only time I need to put lotion on is after I shave my legs. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo I keep in the kids bathroom.  They love the way the shampoo smells; I love the pump that means no mess.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this product and the associated conditioner. I&#x27;ve been mostly natural for years, and it&#x27;s not the least expensive way to live, so I was super excited to find a big bottle of a natural shampoo. I also love Alaffia, the parent company, for what they stand for, so I was glad to support them. Unfortunately, the shampoo immediately turned my hair to straw. I have fine, curly hair that usually feels super silky, and this made it feel rough. I also noticed that an exceptional amount of hair came out when I rinsed, far more than usual. I hoped that the conditioner would help, but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll be returning mine to the Whole Foods where I bought it. If you&#x27;re interested in a natural product that does seem to work, I LOVE Acure products, to which I&#x27;m going back after this failed experiment.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local organic health food style grocery store.  I have been sulfate free for 6 years and have tried at least 10 shampoos but now I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Everyday Shea Moisturizing Shampoo and just recently added the matching conditioner.  I love them both.  I switched to sulfate free products for 3 reasons, the environment (I live near the coast and we have a high water table), I have sensitive skin and I color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I think is the defining and sometime misunderstood characteristic of this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture.  It is very gentle.  After rinsing out this shampoo you will notice that your hair feels very different, clean but not slick per se.  Regular shampoo cleans with detergents/sulfates (bad for you and the environment) and then smooth your hair with man made silicones and proteins.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair and therefore it takes a lot less to clean and condition.  That said, my hair is not dull or lack any shine due the absence of silicones and proteins, the natural products in this shampoo replace them sufficiently.  Also, I am not a heavy product user, I have a simple water based gel that I apply with my hands so I don&#x27;t have a lot to wash out, but if you curl or flat iron and use a lot of product (which I do on occasion), you might need a slightly more robust shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AKA  - I have a fair complexion and my scalp is a tad oily, I wash my hair 5 to 6 days a week.  This shampoo is gentle enough for all these showers but strong enough to wash away the scalp oiliness.  My sensitive skin  often breaks out into rashes and rosacea when I use strong shampoos, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Everyday Shea where this is concerned.  I also feel that as a sulfate free and natural product that it keeps my hair color fresh longer than the products advertised to protect color.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner at a local store - in my continuing search for a natural shampoo and conditioner that actually work.  These were not it.  Both my daughter and I used them a couple times.  The shampoo didn&#x27;t clean our hair at all.  Mine felt greasier than when I started. It had that feel like I had used a lot of gel or hairspray.  My daughter&#x27;s hair looked greasy.  Actually, we took her for a haircut after using it and the hairdresser thought she hadn&#x27;t washed her hair in a long time.  Summary, it didn&#x27;t lather well and did not leave the hair looking or feeling clean.  The conditioner was bad too.  I was about to toss them when I read these reviews and decided we&#x27;ll try the shampoo as a body wash to try not to waste it.  The conditioner is going in the garbage sadly.</li>
            <li> I bought this locally, wish there had been a smaller size available. For about the first 2 weeks I really liked this product but after that it seemed to leave a lot of build up, now I am stuck with a huge bottle of product I don&#x27;t care to use. My hair became course and stringy (I wash every other day), very stiff feeling. I had to go back to an SLS shampoo to get it out of my hair. I will continue to use it as a body wash until it is gone but won&#x27;t be buying it again. It is too bad, I was really excited about it and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioner as well, since we use the body wash which I like I thought it would be really good. I was wrong. I had hoped to cut down my chemical load with this product, but it doesnt clean properly and my hair was terrible. My search continues</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner at my local health market. I was excited to find something without so many ingredients. I used the vanilla mint conditioner first since I was still using up the last of another shampoo. All seemed good with the conditioner even though the girl at the market warned it might leave a heavy feeling. I found the conditioner fine and so did my daughters. It wasn&#x27;t until I used the shampoo that I had problems. I was actually surprised at all the good reviews here. AS SOON as I put the shampoo on my hair it felt like it turned to straw. I added a little more to see if I could get it suds at least a little (yes I know all about suds.) I put on the conditioner hoping it would soften my hair, and this is when I ended up with a greasy tangled mess. It didn&#x27;t even look or feel like I had washed my hair. So I tried it again. Same result. My daughter tried same result. Other daughter still had a small amount of other shampoo she scraped up and used the vanilla mint conditioner and was boasting about the softness of her hair. Tells me it&#x27;s the shampoo. I guess I&#x27;ll buy what I was buying before and try mixing. I think I&#x27;ll write to the company too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this shampoo, but my hair is greasy &amp; oily after I use it. I&#x27;ve tried it for 3 weeks now with no improvement. Sadly, I&#x27;m back on the lookout for a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got this product from whole foods and I love lovE it!! I&#x27;ve been using their shampoo/conditioner for almost a year now, it really helped my oily hair! Before I started using this amazing stuff I had to wash my hair everyday! Now I can go for two/three days between shampooing! It also made my hair feel soft and much more manageable. If you have greasy/oily/frizzy hair I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In my never ending search for vanilla smelling products, I tried this, bought from Amazon. It does not smell like vanilla, it smells like mint. If you like mint, and want to smell like mint, this is the product for you. Also, the pump dispenser did not pop up, ever. Three people have tried to make it pop up - no effect. The pump on two of the three products did not pop up. It would be really hard to pick up this large bottle every time you wanted some, so it&#x27;s pretty much a useless product in this format.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t lather at all and is hard to work through the hair unless you use a lot and still won&#x27;t get a god lather.</li>
            <li> This product completely dried out and damaged my hair causing notable breakage and hair loss.  The conditioner is just as bad as the shampoo in this regard.  I did not purchase through Amamzon but wanted to share my experience.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the business they do, being fair trade and don&#x27;t use GMO ingredients or horrible chemicals found in just about every main stream shampoo. I have very fine hair that tends to get pretty oily, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or scalp. I have found that using the Everyday Shea Moisturizing Conditioner afterward, makes my hair feel very greasy. Alone it seems to work wonderfully. I often don&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner afterward because the natural oils in my hair seem to be just enough to make my hair stay moisturized. It smells great and overall I think it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews &amp; I didn&#x27;t but my everyday Shea off Amazon but I just want to give the company a good review. My hair loves their products. I use the shampoo and lotion. Not a fan of the coconut version but their Shea butter is my fave. My hair is almost to my tailbone and I&#x27;m sure part of it is bc their shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> It seems like everyone here is sharply divided on the Everyday Shea shampoo and conditioner. I have medium thick hair that&#x27;s a bit oily (I wash it every day) and have always used some form of Pantene since it left my hair so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced the \\&quot;residue\\&quot; feeling, so now when I wash, I make sure to take the time to really scrub and get every inch of my scalp, and that seemed to work. Hey, I&#x27;ll scrub a bit more to NOT have to use a ton of chemicals! (PS this stuff smells subtly awesome). I use the conditioner too, and let it air dry then comb through it, which seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel a bit thicker/rougher, which I actually dig! One thing that happens now is my hair won&#x27;t slip out of my hairdos, which is great. Also, I have a weird spot where my hair parts at the scalp and looks like a bald spot- I have never been able to get my hair to part right, and suddenly after using this shampoo, I&#x27;ll brush my hair and it won&#x27;t immediately fall limply into that bald spot, again because it feels a bit thicker or rougher, and is holding its shape now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to think of it, now that I&#x27;m using this, my hair doesn&#x27;t look oily/limp like it usually does 24 hours after a shower. So if you have a bit oily hair, try it out. If your hair is dry, maybe not.</li>
            <li> Bought it because I wanted few ingredients and liked the socially concious aspect. It was also very affordable at $10. However, I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again. Does not lather well enough to clean my long hair without using a lot of the product. Seems to be a common problem with sulfate free products. I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the quality of my hair after using this but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t describe it as moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product just plain does not rinse out of your hair after use. Wet hair tangles easily because no matter how much you rinse, it leaves nasty residue. It left my hair feelig greasy, heavy, sticky, even after styling. It leaves terrible build up on the scalp, too. I thought I&#x27;d try to tough it out and use up the bottle. After 1/3 of the bottle was gone, I gave up. My hair just kept looking worse and worse. Not to mention that the vanilla mint smell is weird. Rest assured that the Everyday Shea conditioner is just as bad. It&#x27;s one thing for a product to be green, fair trade, healthy, etc., but if that product doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s a complete waste. As a side note, the pump on the bottle didn&#x27;t even work, either. It&#x27;s products like this that give the natural food and health industry a granola munch, sweaty hippie reputation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo + it&#x27;s matching conditioner for a few days and at first, I loved the smell (so did my family!), but it seemed like my hair was so dry and stringy in the shower that I could hardly comb out my hair! I&#x27;ve read several reviews, which confirmed my suspicion, saying that it takes a couple days-weeks for your hair to adjust. I&#x27;m really loving it overall. My hair is very curly and long, these products gives it a nice bounce (but, not a frizzy-fro) and really helps to maintain normal oil balances, making my hair very soft and definitely not frizzy. My hair tends to be dry, and I&#x27;ve had past experiences with dandruff (using normal, chemically shampoo&#x27;s). It takes a bit to adjust to, like any other natural thing in the world, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the adjustment. I reccomend this product to anyone who has dry, normal, and even oily hair. I really like it and highly reccomend to those who are willing to wait on the hair-combing ease :-)</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Everyday Shea Vanilla Mint shampoo a couple of months ago and have been using it on a regular basis since that time. IMO, it cleans just as well as other &#x27;natural&#x27; type shampoos but it is rather drying. My hair has been a lot more &#x27;fly away&#x27; since I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the ingredient list is acceptable and it&#x27;s a lot more economical than some of the other natural shampoos on the market. This would probably be a good choice for someone with a lot of teenagers in the house. With oilier type hair, I think this would work out fine for fairly regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how dry the winters are in Canada, this is not one I&#x27;d buy again but it was OK.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shampoo, we picked it up at a WholeFoods and my only grip is I didn&#x27;t pick up MORE! Now I&#x27;m on here to buy any and all other products from Everyday Shea. I&#x27;ve been really particular about the ingredients in my hair products (and my food for that matter) and enjoy the fact that these ingredients are not harmful to the environment nor to my body. I have great results and HIGHLY recommend. Works on all hair types also, as my bf uses it (we have totally different hair textures) and has great results.</li>
            <li> We enjoy this shampoo but can&#x27;t get it where we live. Glad we found it here Thanks for getting it to us promptly.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural shampoos to avoid chemical ingredients. But, i noticed considerable hair fall with all the shampoos. Before this, I used burt bees shampoo too, but the hair fall did not stop. I came accross this shampoo in whole foods store and gave it a try. I noticed my hair fall reduced considerably and my hair looked stronger than never before. This shampoo does lather well, but you have to use more shampoo when you oil your hair. I am very happy to find a product in my budget without many unknown ingredient names in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Loved it after a few uses however I thought I didn&#x27;t rinse it out of my hair the last time. So back under the spray I go.....after 10 minutes it still felt like I had shampoo in my hair. Hair feels greasy. Looks bad. I was so excited for this product but let down. It doesn&#x27;t rinse out...I can&#x27;t even use up the rest of the bottle because my hair feels and looks gross after using it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo because the ingredients and company&#x27;s mission has everything I liked and wanted. The shampoo itself started off good- enough lather and great scent. After several washes, the strands of my hair felt tight and tough almost is if my hair was forming into clumps. I manage to soften my hair with lots of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be shopping for a new shampoo and using the rest of this product as a body wash. Too bad because I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I thought a moisturizing shampoo would be good for my hair since I always blow dry and straighten it, but this takes moisture to a whole other level.  It&#x27;s like having an oil slick on my head!  I honestly think I&#x27;m going to have to cleanse a few times with a &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo, or maybe something more hard core like dish liquid, to get this out of my hair.  My hair is so greasy, I can hardly tell when I&#x27;m done drying, because it still looks wet.  Once my hair is &#x27;clean&#x27; and &#x27;dry&#x27;, I can pull a section of hair up and it&#x27;ll almost stay sticking straight up, like in that scene in &#x27;there&#x27;s something about Mary&#x27;.  I think I&#x27;m just going to use it as a body wash instead.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and using this solo, my hair didn&#x27;t look too bad.  It felt dry coming out of the shower, but dried fine.  It doesn&#x27;t really lather, which I don&#x27;t mind, but it seemed to disappear once you put it in your hair, so I&#x27;d super rinse to make sure it was all out.  It&#x27;s ok, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick chin-length, straight-ish fine hair that is much drier than it used to be. I&#x27;m always looking for a gentle shampoo with a short ingredient list, that doesn&#x27;t cost $20 or more. This product was the same price for approximately twice as much as the expensive (but not outlandishly priced) shampoos. I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I try to wash my hair once every 2-3 days. The shampoo makes my hair feel very thick, which is good, since my hair is fine. I use the conditioner, and am able to use a spray-on conditioner (another brand) for 2 days (for frizz and making the ends look smoother) without my hair looking greasy. However, sometimes I wonder about build-up, and I think that now that I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for several weeks, my hair seems to get oily sooner than when I first started using it. I also find myself using more shampoo than I thought I would, per washing (2 squirts, or more).&lt;br /&gt;I was going to use an alternate shampoo like a bar shampoo, to give my hair a break, but remembered that I&#x27;ve used baking soda and a vinegar rinse before. I did that tonight (1 Tbsp. baking soda in warm water, poured onto wet hair, let sit for a few minutes, followed by 2 Tbsp. white vinegar in cool water--I followed up with cool water rinse), and my hair, now that it is dry feels really nice. I don&#x27;t think I have to find an alternate shampoo. I&#x27;ve also read that you can wash your hair indefinitely with baking soda and vinegar, but I like the aroma of nice shampoo also.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I tried Everyday Shea&#x27;s unscented lotion a few years ago, and returned it; the smell was extremely unpleasant, almost nauseating, and I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the lotion on my skin. I do like the smell of the shampoo, though. I will continue to use it, at least the rest of what I have, since I like the (lack of) ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;For those who didn&#x27;t like the conditioner and can&#x27;t return it (I was able to return my lotion just because I didn&#x27;t like it). If you can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve used conditioners I didn&#x27;t like on my hair for shaving my legs. I like the idea of using the shampoo as a body wash and will try that.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells really nice and feels good while lathering. It rinses to sort of greasy-feeling hair that is nearly impossible to get my fingers through, which is not a good thing for me. I don&#x27;t like how this makes my hair feel, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel great either. I give it 3 stars instead of fewer because while the feel is not good, I can tell that it is actually pretty good for my hair. It provides a lot of moisture that is probably helping against breakage quite a bit. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, but it&#x27;s been an interesting experience using a natural shampoo instead of the more traditional kind that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Left my hair greasy and was unable to get a brush through it. My hair was one giant clump and felt covered in wax, not oils.</li>
