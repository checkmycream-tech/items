            <li>huge 4 oz bottle was a great promotional deal and there&#x27;s so many uses for this essential oil.</li>
            <li>It has been pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>Just an average oil at best.</li>

            <li>What a wonderful way to control this little guys without brining any harm.  </li>

            <li>I never received a complimentary dropper  for more precise application.</li>
            <li>I have a huge home and spiders</li>

            <li>When they say &amp;#34;huge 4 oz&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s because many essential oils come in a tiny .33 oz bottle, so in comparison, yes this is huge and a great value!  </li>

            <li>Super fast shipping and the product is amazing.  </li>

            <li>No feeling of irritation and the smell is not bad.</li>

            <li>The smell CAN be strong if you add too much!</li>

            <li>This peppermint oil has a fresh, clean, minty aroma.  </li>

            <li>, we used the soap last night and we love it,  will keep coming for more.</li>
            <li>I received quickly</li>
            <li>They were quick to apologize about the damaged dropper, and immediately sent a replacement.</li>
            <li>I quickly had to wash it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but unsure what all they are.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the quick service.&lt;br /&gt;Kathy Crow</li>
            <li>Package was delivered quickly.</li>

            <li>Nice quality, will be using on spiders, we usually get more in the fall after the farmers harvest, but they&#x27;ve been around this year, just not in the house!</li>
            <li>Big improvement and very refreshing shower.</li>
            <li>It works great to repel spider, which was the main objective to get this</li>
            <li>super strong, don&#x27;t need to use much</li>
            <li>I have used it in a humidifier, as a massage rub mixed with equal parts carrier oil of your choice, add some drops to your favorite foot cream for a wonderful massage, in a water bottle, add a few drops and spray around room for a refreshing scent!</li>
            <li>This is a new favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to discover this brand and realized shortly thereafter, it smells better, and more pure than the &amp;#34;big two&amp;#34; AND - it is therapeutic grade,</li>
            <li>the scent of peppermint being so strong, it will even keep bugs (cold/flu) and real bugs at bay.</li>
            <li>They are not as strong as some of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products, seem to be diluted, but work very well.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li>Peppermint Essential Oil has so many benefits!</li>

            <li>the smell is strong, it dissipates enough for me to be okay with</li>
            <li>The oil arrived nicely packed in a tight fitting box (so there is no shaking around inside) along with a dropper made of glass.</li>
            <li>This is a huge problem for me because I’m absolutely terrified of them.</li>
            <li>- I did find that tea tree oil works great on athletes foot but for the itcy feet from just being too dried out I heard to try this peppermint oil</li>
            <li>After a night with this running in my diffuser he actually woke up feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>but I’m happy to use it year round.</li>
            <li>The oil sends this amazing, calming sensation around the back of neck, helping to elevate my headache and tension.</li>

            <li>Working well so far and keeps the house smelling refreshing too.</li>
            <li>If you believe in and use organic and natural products than you should try this out for sure.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised to see so many benefits and trust me</li>
            <li>While many find the oil to sooth the skin, adverse reaction is a possibility if you are sensitive to the plant.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Since I started making my own homemade mix, for my Lampe Berger, I been trying out different oils and scent.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle of effervescent peppermint.</li>
            <li>so it is safe to use it around my one year old.</li>
            <li>I have a diffuser in our bathroom and it keeps our bathroom smelling fresh and eliminates odor.</li>
            <li>I love that the oil is natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Glass dropper is useful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to make and fun to give to others.</li>
            <li>: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>It is like a fresh breeze</li>
            <li>one thing many people don&#x27;t know is that if you have rodent problems there are natural ways to make them run for the hills.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, they rarely work well - if at all.</li>
            <li>What a fresh feeling in my cottage.</li>
            <li>I will use this in conjunction with the Fresh Cab packages.</li>
            <li>favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that I have no inkling of how far reaching their benefits can be, but I am having fun learning ways to use them here at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far from what I can tell the oil is OK.</li>
            <li>Peppermint tea is a useful curative measure for inflammation of the digestive tract.  </li>
            <li>Helps with my migraines more than any pill has so far.  </li>
            <li>Just started getting into essential oils and am loving this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the deep freeze is over I plan to make my own remedies for the spring and summer bug</li>
            <li>These oils are so excellent and of such a nice quality that when ordering other essential oils I specifically bought this brand.</li>
            <li>In other words but with confidence  this is a good quality oil .</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right, bats.</li>
            <li>The dropped helps with getting the right amount I need.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have any on hand right now.</li>
            <li>and I am able to enjoy long car rides with out the drowsiness.</li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is bigger than expected and has a great glass dropper to make application easy.</li>
            <li>This oil is really strong &amp; natural!</li>
            <li>The peppermint smells great and is a natural answer to headaches and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love Peppermint oil in general...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Benefits/Evidence of Peppermint Oil in Essential form:&lt;br /&gt;Beyond it&#x27;s soothing scent and being able to clear our nasal passages, Peppermint oil can provide you with many benefits.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any data yet on how long it may be effective, but (damn)</li>
            <li>Being that it is 100% pure, it does not dissipate as quickly which saves me tons of money.</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil is very energizing and great aromatherapy in the mornings, before working out or whenever you need a little pick me up.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the Fractionated Coconut out from Majestic Pure as well and used in combination the very first day I got them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful to Majestic Pure for offering such great products that allow me to enjoy the benefits of the essential oils and not have to use pills or</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Peppermint Oil - Wowza!</li>
            <li>Less pain is good.</li>
            <li>Much more economical to buy compared to local stores.</li>
            <li>Definitley not as strong as the young living brand.</li>
            <li>It’s Therapeutic Grade with no fillers or additives and it comes in a 4 oz glass bottle with a clear glass dropper for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For EXTERNAL use only, great for using to protect garden plants, also get rid of rodents or keep them at bay.</li>
            <li>I take a warm bath in the evening with one single drop and it clears my sinuses and relaxes me.  </li>
            <li>Because it has so very many other uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pure.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil and jojoba oil for my migraines and for soothing my little ones congestion and coughs.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many fantastic uses for peppermint oil that it is an amazing thing to have on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>So I will definitely continue to use this mixture for spider control, and for an extra bonus, it has a very nice aroma to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from Majestic pure at promotional price and it&#x27;s really worth the money.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil is a perfect balance of not to strong and not to weak.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and pleasantly pleased by the high quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I got this to try for headaches, but had another issue come up first.</li>
            <li>recommend this to those who are looking to take their first steps in to holistic treatments and cures.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many reasons to use the Peppermint Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like this peppermint oil!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought peppermint oil</li>
            <li>I am so enjoying essential oils!</li>
            <li>Had an issue with the dropper supplied with the order so decided to send an email to Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals and received an immediate response from Brian who corrected the issue right away.  </li>
            <li>It smells so much better than the commercial stuff.</li>
            <li>Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li>So much bang for the buck!</li>
            <li>I found mostly the essential oil was safer if used as a way to relieve nasal congestion but keeping in mind that for some, it can cause headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Being that the oil could be used on the skin and such, it just did not seem like the most sanitary way to include this.</li>
            <li>Maybe just adding it to the bottle and including the smaller (non-dropper) top would have been wiser.</li>

            <li>Maybe just adding it to the bottle and including the smaller (non-dropper) top would have been wiser.</li>
            <li>First ordered peppermint oil to eliminate ants in my mothers bedroom .  </li>
            <li>When you get a essential oils there is many ways to use them.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and as a longtime migraine suffer, FULLY recommend buying this essential oil!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I will likely pass on buying more Majestic Products as it seems the potency is just not there.</li>
            <li>I also used it for big bites I love my peppermint oil</li>
            <li>course, Peppermint Essential Oil is used for more than this.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it works well on tick bites as well as keeping bugs off when outside by the pool.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, some call it Hot flashes ...</li>
            <li>Best part is, little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I happen to love peppermint, I regularly drink peppermint tea.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Works well on big spiders, but they are much more resilient.</li>
            <li>The information you sent about the uses of the oil was very helpful!</li>
            <li>We use peppermint for many different things, soaps, vapor rubs, fevers, diffusing, and headaches!</li>
            <li>My favorite would definitely have to be my homemade peppermint, lemon vapor rub!</li>
            <li>This is a first rate operation and oil.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I used it a couple times when I felt nauseous and it really helped!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>Will repeat the order for sure some time in the future</li>
            <li>Love this product would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase.</li>
            <li>I imagine this bottle will last a long time, it works great in the rainbow too.</li>
            <li>I love learning about their different uses and benefits.</li>

            <li>This is exactly how the seller describes it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite way to use this essential oil.</li>
            <li>This stuff (in addition to adding probiotics) has really helped alot!</li>
            <li>The scent from the oil was not over powering but added a light natural smell to the air.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I never knew what oils were used for, and was always wondering why my mother had so many different kinds sitting around.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We had mice in the pantry and bought peppermint oil and used a cotton ball to draw a line across the shelves first and then once the mice were gone we used it to draw a line across the door.</li>
            <li>It’s safe to use topically or in aroma therapy</li>
            <li>If you are looking at this for using in foods such as baked goods I would try a different one just to be safe unless they update their label or description to reflect that it is indeed safe.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite essential oils to keep around the house.</li>
            <li>So many different uses for it</li>
            <li>So glad I tried out essential oils.  </li>
            <li>The aromatherapy of it was very soothing too!</li>
            <li>It cools him down and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to add this peppermint oil to my essential oils collection!</li>

            <li>- it is one amazing product and with the huge 4 fluid ounce bottle of Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve heard so many positive uses for them and heard folks rave about how beneficial they are that I felt I simply had to try them out.</li>
            <li>i have been using essential oils for many years, this was my first purchase from majestic pure.  </li>
            <li>I love peppermint whether it is in a hard candy or just the oil and scent of it, I love peppermint.</li>
            <li>Essential oils, especially good oils, can be hard to find.</li>
            <li>This is especially useful in bathrooms and kitchens to disinfect and purify.ted) to relieve skin rashes; relieve migraine headaches; aroma can invigorate and awaken and be a great stress reliever; reduces morning sickness; helps eliminate nausea symptoms; and helps control bad breath.  </li>
            <li>I love that this one simple oil can help with so much</li>
            <li>I know all essential oil is different and finding a brand that is good</li>
            <li>I always buy Now products and this is the first time I tried Majestic pure.</li>
            <li>There is no need to use a lot of the oil because it is exactly what it says it is pure.</li>
            <li>and it really does not cost very much.</li>
            <li>Lots of positive feedback from guests that enter my home.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, all the tiny pieces of glass stayed in the tiny packaging so it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I just needed to use a few drops with the other oil, to achieve that perfect balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a great peppermint smell and blends well with other essential oils.</li>
            <li>I put 3 droppers full, WAY more than recommended, into my essential oil diffuser and can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>First I use it to dab on my temples when my headaches get to be too much to stand.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Using in the bath tub, few drops just add wonders in the soak tub, very refreshing</li>
            <li>not only does it smell completely heavenly, it has so many useful functions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li>I have been using peppermint oil in other applications for a long time, but this is a new and hopefully successful answer to my problem/phobia!</li>
            <li>Very good quality and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I love peppermint oil most for use in homemade vapor rub, to clear out the respiratory tract and for a little energy boost by smelling it, either straight from the bottle or in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>(I moved the bird to the other room, as this is VERY STRONG SMELLING)</li>
            <li>I have been happy with other oils before (Whole Foods brand, Essentially KateS, etc)</li>
            <li>It has a metallic smell to it and isnt strong as regular peppermint is.</li>
            <li>It you&#x27;re looking for a strong peppermint oil, look no further... buy this oil!  </li>
            <li>LIKE IT PLENTY STRONG AND LASTING ...</li>
            <li>I can certainly testify to</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure gave me a promo code to purchase this</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be pure peppermint oil</li>
            <li>I ordered this brand and there is nothing pure about it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how this MAJESTIC PURE  is going to work..?</li>
            <li>So when presented with the opportunity to review the Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Oil, I was quite delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I make certain to spray every corner of my bathroom because for some reason they find their way in there when I am supposed to be relaxing</li>
            <li>Pure bliss in a bottle.</li>
            <li>i look forward to ordering majestic pure products again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The large bottle of therapeutic grade</li>
            <li>Therapeutic oils are certified as pure oils and do not contain any chemicals or fillers that cheaper oils may contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was smell this oil, and though it does smell nice, it is definitely not as strong of a smell as another peppermint oil that I have.</li>
            <li>I use it as a lovely scent for various things and also as a natural aversive for unwanted critters in the garden!</li>
            <li>and I find it very high quality product.</li>
            <li>This oil is of a very high quality.  </li>
            <li>First applied full strength which was too strong and is pretty oily and was a bit slick on my slate floors.</li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Majestic Pure.  </li>

            <li>This oil, once diluted in a carrier oil, I found that this oil performed better than expected.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really rate the product.</li>
            <li>the argan oil has a very overpowering nutty scent...</li>
            <li>spiders really take offense to this</li>

            <li>then this product is really for you.</li>

            <li>I have ready reviews about this oil treating migraines</li>
            <li>The peppermint is not what I expected the smell is OK</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to test and review this product, and so very thankful for it.</li>

            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>I really like the Oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the taste and smell of mint</li>
            <li>suffering from motion sickness I really wanted to review this product.</li>
            <li>Just an overall comfortable buying experience.</li>
            <li>But somehow I do not like it so much because of the scent of the oil.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that the seller gave me additional information on ways to use the oil.</li>
            <li>Works very well as an insecticide.</li>
            <li>, it really does take the edge off my migraines.</li>
            <li>When you turn on the sweeper your whole house will smell like whatever oil you put on the bag instead of the yucky stuff</li>
            <li>In all honesty, it didnt do much for my ankle, I didnt even feel the coolness of it, but my sprained hand was relieved</li>
            <li>Thank you--great product fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I avoid traditional medicine and opt for more natural ways of healing.  </li>
            <li>Love this product so far i&#x27;ve used it in my body butters and when taking a bath looking forward to my next order.</li>
            <li>I do use other majestic pure products and this one as expected is o great quality.</li>
            <li>The oil is strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Because if you find that you do not like it for one thing there are many other ways to use it that way your not buying something and never using it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as potent as other brands.</li>
            <li>and I love using it because it masks all other smells</li>
            <li>So many uses and the bonus is its an ingestible oil, so I can use for teas, smoothies and other cooking.  </li>
            <li>The 4 oz size is priced great and will last me for a LONG time - even though I do use Peppermint EO regularly to make cleaning and beauty products.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so this bottle is great for anyone who loves to use Peppermint Oil often.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it must work for all other unwanted critters too.</li>
            <li>He says this seems to work better than any other over the counter stuff</li>
            <li>I have used peppermint oil from other competitors that has been much more fragrant.  </li>
            <li>I am sure there are other uses</li>
            <li>There are many other ways to use this oil including keeping mice away</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Majestic Pure peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>it may work to clean outdoors but inside it just smells like some commercial cleaner.</li>
            <li>and so while I was dressing and getting myself ready for work, I filled the bath wash basin with very hot water and added a few drops of the peppermint oil into it.</li>
            <li>When I had some stomach upset the other day it helped immensely to take a nice hot bath with a bunch of himalayan sea salt and a dropper of this.</li>
            <li>High quality and comes with a dropper so you can put as much as you want with whatever you are using it for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking or that much needed relief like I needed.</li>
            <li>The oil is high quality and has reasonable price.</li>
            <li>After visiting an orthopedic doctor that &amp;#34;isnt into narcotics&amp;#34; even after knowing I cannot take anything for inflammation, I was sitting here in major pain the other night and decided to try making my own rub to relieve some of the swelling and pain.  </li>
            <li>This is some super strong, long lasting oil.</li>
            <li>Having a positive feeling we have our problem fixed!</li>
            <li>Also my 98 year old mother seems more alert the next day when I put a drop or two on the floor near her bed at night.</li>
            <li>Its is a really good product, use a few drops in the bath to feel rejuvenated, burn a few drops in the oil warmer to have the room smelling fabulous.</li>
            <li>Use it in the shower and your entire body is cool when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle I smelled what seemed like a strong alcohol smell which I thought was odd, but haven&#x27;t noticed it again when opening the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I put this down by all of the doors and windows about once a week and it keeps pests and bugs away for the most part.</li>
            <li>so you might want to tone it down more than I did.  </li>
            <li>I received Majestic Pure Therapeutic Grade Peppermint Oil a few days ago and I must say that I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Several other comments here have some very good information about the specifics for peppermint , suffice to say the quality of this product makes its uses widely varied.</li>
            <li>Hard to find this oil locally at a reasonable price and was thrilled with the pricing and shipping speed for this seller.</li>
            <li>I order this and was not to pleased it had a moldy smell to it odd smelling stuff</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to add a half drop to my water to help with my stomach hunger pains.</li>
            <li>This oil smells more like chemicals and less like peppermint.  </li>
            <li>I dislike the Lemon Oil in this brand, I mainly buy it for scent.. and cleaning properties to put in my laundry.  </li>
            <li>got this particular brand peppermint oil as a sample to to try</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting how the same essential oil can vary in smell from product line to product line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also paid much more for much smaller bottles that had no dropper included in local stores, and those oils were not therapeutic grade.</li>
            <li>But this oil helps to relieve them quickly and allows me to lay off some pills - which anyone that takes pills daily understand that is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smalls far more peppery than minty, and this is a turn off to me.  </li>
            <li>When I need more I will definitely come back to this dealer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in an apartment building, we suffer with mice and this is the main reason I use peppermint oil and peppermint oil</li>
            <li>Particularly with the bloaty, gurgly stomach he was getting.</li>
            <li>My main use is in my diffuser which puts the scent into the air and makes the room I’m in smell minty.</li>
            <li>I mainly got to rid spiders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be trying more &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; later.  </li>
            <li>Smells sweet and more faint than other peppmint oils I own.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product based on its quality.</li>
            <li>You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
            <li>Fine product as I expected.  </li>
            <li>I was given this peppermint oil to review and quality test and used it along with other essential oils and a carrier oil to make my own refills.</li>
            <li>With Majestic they have a 100% pure and natural formula that is non-toxic.</li>
            <li>Peppermint Oil - Premium Quality 4 Oz 100% Pure &amp; Natural Peppermint</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super new to essential oils</li>
            <li>Having been recently bitten, I was willing to try anything!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re Not even Old!!</li>
            <li>what one can do with it, I researched it a little and came up with my favorite uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have a country house and of course little field mice seams to enjoy the house while we are away!</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>I also put couple drops inside the hollow roll of toilet paper (like suggestion of one review customer) and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Epson salt and add to hot water in a basin large enough for a footbath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Epson salt and add to hot water in a basin large enough for a footbath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased the Majestic Pure brand of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as other brands.</li>
            <li>This is has a strong aroma and compares to other brands I have</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if there really was a difference between super expensive oils and super cheap oils.</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure to experiment a little to see how sensitive you are to peppermint as I have found out if I add too much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was quite pleased with Majestic Pure&#x27;s peppermint oil, however, I do wish they would&#x27;ve included a little paper on safety and proper usage and handling for people that aren&#x27;t familiar with essential oils and don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>Try adding a few drops of Peppermint into a spray bottle with water and spritz back of neck while working outside for a great cooling</li>
            <li>I placed a drop in a pump of lotion and used it as a moisturizer before taking my final exam and it seemed to calm my test</li>
            <li>But this oil helps to relieve the congestion that normally follows the sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then a few more sprays and they die.  </li>
            <li>Love this,  I put a few drops on the A/C filter snd</li>
            <li>I put a few drops in a spray bottle water and I spray my bathroom, kitchen counter top.</li>
            <li>but I will make sure to leave the house for a few hours after the application of the oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably fine for other uses though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong or smell the same as the peppermint essential oils I had been using.</li>
            <li>Not a terrible oil but just not strong.</li>
            <li>This bottle of oil was no different and the bottle was packaged in a dark, glass bottle which helps maintain the purity of the oil and keep the oil fresh and toxin free.</li>
            <li>Maybe ankle was a little too far gone for it to help, but I love how the soreness in my hand had relief.  </li>
            <li>I live in northern Michigan on 20 acres surrounded by woods, so I have lots spiders in my house every spring when they all wake up.</li>
            <li>Well live and learn.</li>
            <li>I was into lavander scent for the longest time, and it&#x27;s time to switch for a new one.</li>
            <li>I am an oil junkie and am always trying out new oils.</li>
            <li>I did not think that I would have in my new home.</li>
            <li>I am new to using oils</li>
            <li>I knew I needed to try it out in my new diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass dropper</li>
            <li>I tested this on my forehead and cheekbones, and wouldn&#x27;t you know my pores are less visible, my stress headaches and migraines are easily gone</li>
            <li>I love putting a drop of peppermint oil on my hand and smelling it throughout the day to stay awake during long work hours and on long trips.</li>
            <li>I still have a few drops of the Young Living brand, so I was able to sniff test compare.</li>
            <li>In just a few minutes my nose cleared and the entire apartment was nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it in aromatherapy, I gave the peppermint oil a try on my flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still works but doesn&#x27;t last as long, scent wise, as some other brands.</li>
            <li>Out of nowhere I developed tennis elbow and was in constant pain, I lost all strength in my right hand.  </li>
            <li>I need the oils that I but to be strong and long lasting in their scent.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint we use to clear congestion with an humidifier !</li>
            <li>But did you know the other symptoms and aliments that peppermint is able to ease such as headaches, anxiety, asthma, spasms of both the stomach and bowel, not to forget relieve a fever and help with arthritis pain,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is said to be used for many other ailments, such as: arthritis pain, fever, intestinal cramping and symptoms of asthma/respiratory illness.</li>
            <li>I have history of migraines, and I will try next time to see if it was a fluke , or for real!  </li>
            <li>I can only attest to the headache fixing aspect of this product, I have yet to try many of the other uses but</li>
            <li>Going to buy my old brand and be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried out was Peppermint Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>Only time will truly tell if this really works!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely potent, I only use 3-4 drops for my entire back and dilute with either jojobo or coconut oil.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This works because these pests hate the scent of peppermint and knowing this makes me a happy girl because I cringe at the sight of mice and roaches but most especially spiders.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I use 1 part hydrogen peroxide + 2 parts HOT water + 10+ drops any essential oil you like.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to learn the other many benefits of Peppermint Oil in the future.</li>
            <li>but usually there will be something on the label or in the description mentioning if it is safe for consumption or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I was exposed to Peppermint Essential Oil was at a convention.</li>
            <li>Other oils are  recommended for aromatherapy, such as citrus oils (smells more</li>
            <li>I bought this product to help with mice at one of my rentals, well the first application of mopping the floors with the peppermint a mouse ran out and just sat in the middle of the floor!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to use this for other uses too.</li>
            <li>The smell in general is very calming but yet wakes up all my senses and keeps me alert.</li>
            <li>I have recently been experimenting with different essential oils and was glad when I was given the opportunity to test this one for quality.  </li>
            <li>It was a little strong</li>
            <li>If you place a small amount on a cotton swap and slightly sniff it it is a great natural headache reliever.</li>
            <li>It is a little powerful at first</li>
            <li>I plan  use this all the time, because I live near a wooded area .  </li>
            <li>Just a few drops of this on a cotton ball with the easy to use dropper, inhale ..  </li>
            <li>I was totally amazed because usually when I try one of these kind of do-it-yourself solutions</li>
            <li>I made a strong solution of peppermint oil, water and a few drops of dish soap.</li>
            <li>I blow dried my hair since the cooling sensation on my scalp was quite strong.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the Majestic Pure brand essential oils, but it will not be my last.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this product based on all of the positive reviews</li>
            <li>The essential oil by Majestic Pure also goes far!</li>
            <li>I live in a rural area and every summer the bats come around for a couple of months, and they will find ways to get into your attic, in between the siding on your house, whatever, and they can be a real nuisance.</li>
            <li>They even emailed me a PDF of uses, tips, and medical benefits which was very informative and gave me some new ideas on what I can do with it (like add it to coconut oil for a minty mouthwash).</li>
            <li>One by one they came out from their hiding spots to the middle of my house (open floor plan) where I proceeded to killed them with my fly swatter and then vacuumed them up with the long hose.</li>
            <li>Most of my other EOs only have one or the other, rarely both.</li>
            <li>I am an aromatherapist and am therefore very particular about my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several Majestic Pure oils.  </li>
            <li>I received one bottle of Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil to review!  </li>

            <li>that Majestic Pure came with a glass dropper in addition to a regular lid.</li>
            <li>That is what you will get with Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>are some ways to use Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To compare the quantity that you receive when you purchase Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;To compare the quantity that you receive when you purchase Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can tell that it&#x27;s pure and therapeutic grade the minute you open the cap.</li>
            <li>Large bottle, comes with a pipet and a regular lid.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the large size bottle.  </li>
            <li>Such a large bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also mixed it with pure water in a spray bottle as insect repel spray.</li>
            <li>This peppermint oil by Majestic Pure is the only Peppermint oil I will ever use!</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil is made of 100% pure and natural Essential Oil</li>
            <li>okay, not sure if it&#x27;s as strong as my last brand since it&#x27;s been too long since I last had some.  </li>
            <li>My only concern prior to ordering this oil is that it would not live up to quality the big name brands like Young Living or Mountain Rose Herbs (I&#x27;ve used both).</li>
            <li>My husband has neuropathy, which is diabetic nerve damage and he experiences mild to extreme pain in his feet.  </li>
            <li>I used my other brand, and it worked quickly.</li>
            <li>There was a huge spider dead between my door and screen where I had sprayed.  </li>
            <li>It feels like I can breathe clear when the water boils out.</li>
            <li>For some odd reason, it says do not ingest--but peppermint oil in general is totally fine to do so.</li>
            <li>You can also mix with carrier oil and massage chest or drop into a humidifier to help clear sinus and lung congestion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps clear up my sinuses.</li>
            <li>And came with document explaining benefits of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I do like the idea of going natural oils rather than putting a bunch of chemicals in your body to heal you.</li>
            <li>opening the package I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>but WOW.</li>
            <li>Lasted much longer than similar peppermint oils</li>
            <li>so essentially I was going to pay twice as much</li>
            <li>I am old and I power surge........</li>
            <li>It has been about two weeks, now, and so far, no mice.</li>
            <li>she said my house smelled like old people.</li>
            <li>I have applied this peppermint oil directly on my neck and chest</li>
            <li>It works perfectly to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>Away - Buy with Complete Confidence</li>
            <li>says wow, my hands are so soft.</li>
            <li>I really like the option of using the regular cap or having the dropper.</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, I opened the bottle, took a deep breath, and immediately realized I spent three times more than I should have with the big names.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely clueless when it comes to using essential oils</li>
            <li>still don&#x27;t know much about essential oils, but I do see there are uses for them.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for the age old statementbrings so loudly with this product.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am now learning how to use it to in a natural pesticide.</li>
            <li>Every item should be professionally sold like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got the freshest-smelling room on the block!&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely be using this seller again when I run low!</li>
            <li>but I had blisters that ended up scarring my face because it was applied directly to my skin without a carrier oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know others that rub these oils directly on their skin without the reaction that I had.</li>
            <li>I recomend that if you use it for your headache to be caution with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is 100 % natural and</li>
            <li>This stuff is junk compared to young living and doterra.</li>
            <li>The product has a soft fragrance yet seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The peppermint oil can be used to naturally deter rodents like mice from entering your home.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I have several friends and relatives now using it.</li>
            <li>As a frequent migraine sufferer, I am always looking for homeopathic ways to relieve them rather than relying on medication.  </li>
            <li>have read that peppermint oil is a natural deterrent for spiders and ants.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops in spray bottle with water, shake to make sure it&#x27;s mixed and spray around baseboards, entryways, closets.</li>
            <li>you are new to essential oils, then I would highly recommend this product to get you started.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought it for rodents, however, after a while the little pest was still running around.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s in a huge bottle, compared to the other sizes I&#x27;ve received from companies selling essential oils.</li>
            <li>Peppermint oil contains significant amounts of calcium, vitamin B, manganese, magnesium, folate, iron, copper, potassium, Omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin A and</li>
            <li>I purchased another oil with the peppermint and while both smell nice, they are not nearly as strong as other essentials oils used in my diffuser.</li>
            <li>His sinuses were clear and he said he woke up feeling ready for the long day ahead of him.</li>
            <li>They first sent an informative e-mail with a .pdf file about the several uses and benefits of peppermint oil, and later a follow up e-mail to check in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big bottle for a small price, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as potent as some of the competition.</li>
            <li>This is a potent oil and only a small amount is all you need whether for diffusing, adding to your Epsom salt for bath, or as an air freshener ( about 20 drops plus vodka [use a lg.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pretty big bottle so it will last me a while.</li>
            <li>would recommend this oil due to the purity and high quality of Majestic Pure products.</li>
            <li>but I am hoping they maintain their high quality in the future, as well.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and has countless uses.</li>
            <li>But this is a nice heavy glass bottle, with a glass dropper (very carefully packaged and wrapped) and smells like 100% to me!  </li>
            <li>Essential Oil is a non-toxic product, but this does not mean you want to keep it in the reach of children.</li>
            <li>It is strong so you only need a few drops.  </li>
            <li>And be aware of an after smell of a wet mildew smell.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of icy hot</li>
            <li>This is a therapeutic grade essential oil that can be used in many ways for the betterment of your everyday health such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I take a drop straight in my mouth a few times everyday for better breath.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use so much or it will irritate you skin!</li>
            <li>This peppermint oil is very powerful, all you need to apply is very little at a time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gross, unfortunately I mixed a large batch without testing.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure essential oil is a total scam.</li>
            <li>I have several essential oils from MAJESTIC PURE.</li>
            <li>Apparently you can rub a drop of oil under the nose for improved concentration and alertness and apply some to the back of the neck and shoulders to keep energy levels high.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat new to essential oils and their uses.</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to essential oils</li>
            <li>I am new to using essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils and peppermint</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much otherwise your hair will dry out, just a couple of drops should be sufficient.  </li>
            <li>NOW Peppermint essential oil will fill the whole room with only 3 drops.  </li>
            <li>My family had stuffy nose &#x27;syndrome&#x27; and since we don&#x27;t have a diffuser, I put a pan on the stove, added a few drops of peppermint and lemon essential oils and let the steam run free in my home.</li>
            <li>It has a very loud pepper minty smell that can be smelled as soon as you open the door.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as strong or long lasting as other peppermint oils I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I received no other compensation for my review.</li>
            <li>I have only recently become interested in using essential oils for health benefits</li>
            <li>so no other animals will be harmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is so strong, it is not a good idea to put it anywhere near one&#x27;s eyes, just as a caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I mean VERY mild.  </li>
            <li>use peppermint oil as aroma therapy because it helps keep the mind active and aware and also reduces headaches.</li>
            <li>Usually find are for external use only so I was really excited to find such a large bottle of therapeutic grade peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>I like how the bottle is large as I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle that goes a long way for an essential oil.  </li>
            <li>only ingredient in Peppermint Essential Oil is simply 100% Pure Peppermint Oil from the peppermint plant.</li>
            <li>I mix my own e-juice for vaping and my previous brand of mint essential oils started selling theirs in half the quantity for the same price</li>
            <li>This one has a backnote that I can only describe as &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s different than the two high end oils I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this peppermint oil is a high quality essential oil</li>
            <li>Discomfort - Helps Relief From Stress, Migraines, Headaches &amp; Anxiety - Refreshing and Relaxing - Promote Healthy Skin, Prevents Clogging of Pores and Outbreak of Acne - Natural Insect Repellent</li>
            <li>This oil is 4 ounces of 100% natural essential oil.</li>
            <li>used it mixed with coconut oil as a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Soon, 4oz of peppermint oil will feel like barely enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an all natural essential oil</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how big the bottle was!  </li>
            <li>Four ounces of this essential oil should last a long time as a few drops is all you need for many purposes.</li>
            <li>I actually put this directly on my air filters and the scent goes through my house every time it turns on.</li>
            <li>The smell is faint and kind of chemical smelling.</li>
            <li>The oil itself is not a blob of grease but more of a thin oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more oil and less mint on the ratio.</li>
            <li>The original package arrived with a broken dropper,  but I received an email from a rep at Majestic Pure asking about my overall experience.</li>
            <li>For under 20 dollars, you get 4 fluid ounces of a high quality product that is very comparable to the other big brand names that are out on the market.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, the mice have not continued to chew on my van wiring and AC vacuum hoses.  </li>
            <li>I selected Majestic Pure due to its being therapeutic grade.  </li>
            <li>A few  drops on my pillow and it calms  me and put me right to sleep.</li>
            <li>the brands I mentioned actually last just as long because a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li>Essential Oil is highly effective for its cooling and soothing vapor to help many respiratory problems including nasal congestion, common cold, sore throat, and coughs.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast, I would use this company for other oils again.</li>
            <li>Essential Oil can be used (diluted) to relieve skin rashes; relieve migraine headaches; aroma can invigorate and awaken and be a great stress reliever; reduces morning sickness; helps eliminate nausea symptoms; and helps control bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When properly diluted with a carrier oil such as fractionated coconut, jojoba or almond oil, it can be applied directly to the skin.</li>
            <li>This came in a 4 oz size for free* to try and review, which is a larger sized bottle for essential oils and will last me for a few months of various types of uses.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out or become irritated, so perhaps this will be an option when the next major headache hits.&lt;br /&gt;I put some into my bath on a couple of occasions along with some rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>This peppermint oil does have a strong aroma, but it is not nearly as strong as the other brand that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Very useful in awakening my tired son for early morning baseball or tennis.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this brand in general but this product as well.</li>
            <li>Before long, my migraine had nearly diminished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used argan oil, jojoba oil, and tea tree oil so far but have just ordered a bunch of different kinds because you can mix the different essential oils together to combine and maximize their benefits.</li>
            <li>A few days later, one of the grand kids had a headache, so we applied it per the directions, and her head stopped hurting after just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put a few drops of this peppermint oil into a carrier oil (I used coconut this time) and rubbed it on my temples when I first felt a headache start.  </li>
            <li>I was a little leary at first because it is a big 4oz bottle</li>
            <li>so not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li>For a test, I usually place on drop on my tongue (be careful not to put too much because it will burn like horseradish!!!), close my mouth and breath.</li>
            <li>Closed the bathroom door and - wow!</li>
            <li>After laying in a dark, quite, cool room for about half an hour, the headache never fully bloomed.  </li>
            <li>These qualities make it a good oil in the treatment of anxiety, indigestion,  bad breath, flu, headaches and migraines, skin irritations, rheumatism, toothache, and fatigue.  </li>
            <li>I have had both good and bad experiences with them over the last year.</li>

            <li> huge 4 oz bottle was a great promotional deal and there&#x27;s so many uses for this essential oil.</li>
            <li> It has been pretty effective.  </li>
            <li> Just an average oil at best.</li>
            <li> and it leaves a cool and refreshing tingle on my hair and body.</li>

            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as like a candy cane scent, its very true to a mint leaf, vs that sweet peppermint smell.  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on sore, tight muscles and sinus headaches.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not of the pure peppermint oil that I am used to nor is it as effective as the NOW brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a large bottle and it was nicely packed.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful way to control this little guys without brining any harm.  </li>

            <li> I made a huge &amp;#34;Q-tip&amp;#34; out of a broom handle and a wadded up washcloth, then used an elastic to attach the cloth to the handle.</li>
            <li> I never received a complimentary dropper  for more precise application.</li>
            <li> I have a huge home and spiders</li>
            <li> However, I was rather happy when I need the bottle and took a whiff that was too big.</li>

            <li> The oil arrived nicely packed in a tight fitting box (so there is no shaking around inside) along with a dropper made of glass.</li>
            <li> This is a huge problem for me because I’m absolutely terrified of them.</li>
            <li> - I did find that tea tree oil works great on athletes foot but for the itcy feet from just being too dried out I heard to try this peppermint oil</li>
            <li> After a night with this running in my diffuser he actually woke up feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> but I’m happy to use it year round.</li>

            <li> Since I started making my own homemade mix, for my Lampe Berger, I been trying out different oils and scent.</li>

            <li> I will use this in conjunction with the Fresh Cab packages.</li>
            <li> favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that I have no inkling of how far reaching their benefits can be, but I am having fun learning ways to use them here at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far from what I can tell the oil is OK.</li>
            <li> Peppermint tea is a useful curative measure for inflammation of the digestive tract.  </li>
            <li> Helps with my migraines more than any pill has so far.  </li>
            <li> Just started getting into essential oils and am loving this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the deep freeze is over I plan to make my own remedies for the spring and summer bug</li>
            <li> These oils are so excellent and of such a nice quality that when ordering other essential oils I specifically bought this brand.</li>
            <li> In other words but with confidence  this is a good quality oil .</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right, bats.</li>
            <li> The dropped helps with getting the right amount I need.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have any on hand right now.</li>
            <li> and I am able to enjoy long car rides with out the drowsiness.</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is bigger than expected and has a great glass dropper to make application easy.</li>
            <li> This oil is really strong &amp; natural!</li>
            <li> The peppermint smells great and is a natural answer to headaches and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love Peppermint oil in general...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Benefits/Evidence of Peppermint Oil in Essential form:&lt;br /&gt;Beyond it&#x27;s soothing scent and being able to clear our nasal passages, Peppermint oil can provide you with many benefits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any data yet on how long it may be effective, but (damn)</li>
            <li> Being that it is 100% pure, it does not dissipate as quickly which saves me tons of money.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil is very energizing and great aromatherapy in the mornings, before working out or whenever you need a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Fractionated Coconut out from Majestic Pure as well and used in combination the very first day I got them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful to Majestic Pure for offering such great products that allow me to enjoy the benefits of the essential oils and not have to use pills or</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Peppermint Oil - Wowza!</li>
            <li> Less pain is good.</li>
            <li> Much more economical to buy compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> Definitley not as strong as the young living brand.</li>
            <li> It’s Therapeutic Grade with no fillers or additives and it comes in a 4 oz glass bottle with a clear glass dropper for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For EXTERNAL use only, great for using to protect garden plants, also get rid of rodents or keep them at bay.</li>
            <li> I take a warm bath in the evening with one single drop and it clears my sinuses and relaxes me.  </li>
            <li> Because it has so very many other uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pure.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil and jojoba oil for my migraines and for soothing my little ones congestion and coughs.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many fantastic uses for peppermint oil that it is an amazing thing to have on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> So I will definitely continue to use this mixture for spider control, and for an extra bonus, it has a very nice aroma to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Majestic pure at promotional price and it&#x27;s really worth the money.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil is a perfect balance of not to strong and not to weak.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and pleasantly pleased by the high quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I got this to try for headaches, but had another issue come up first.</li>
            <li> recommend this to those who are looking to take their first steps in to holistic treatments and cures.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many reasons to use the Peppermint Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li> I really like this peppermint oil!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought peppermint oil</li>
            <li> I am so enjoying essential oils!</li>
            <li> Had an issue with the dropper supplied with the order so decided to send an email to Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals and received an immediate response from Brian who corrected the issue right away.  </li>
            <li> It smells so much better than the commercial stuff.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li> So much bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> I found mostly the essential oil was safer if used as a way to relieve nasal congestion but keeping in mind that for some, it can cause headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Being that the oil could be used on the skin and such, it just did not seem like the most sanitary way to include this.</li>
            <li> Maybe just adding it to the bottle and including the smaller (non-dropper) top would have been wiser.</li>
            <li> Being that the oil could be used on the skin and such, it just did not seem like the most sanitary way to include this.</li>
            <li> Maybe just adding it to the bottle and including the smaller (non-dropper) top would have been wiser.</li>

            <li> I will likely pass on buying more Majestic Products as it seems the potency is just not there.</li>
            <li> I also used it for big bites I love my peppermint oil</li>
            <li> course, Peppermint Essential Oil is used for more than this.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it works well on tick bites as well as keeping bugs off when outside by the pool.</li>

            <li> Best part is, little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I happen to love peppermint, I regularly drink peppermint tea.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works well on big spiders, but they are much more resilient.</li>
            <li> The information you sent about the uses of the oil was very helpful!</li>
            <li> We use peppermint for many different things, soaps, vapor rubs, fevers, diffusing, and headaches!</li>
            <li> My favorite would definitely have to be my homemade peppermint, lemon vapor rub!</li>
            <li> This is a first rate operation and oil.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I used it a couple times when I felt nauseous and it really helped!</li>

            <li> Will repeat the order for sure some time in the future</li>
            <li> Love this product would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase.</li>
            <li> I imagine this bottle will last a long time, it works great in the rainbow too.</li>
            <li> I love learning about their different uses and benefits.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this peppermint essential oil.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly how the seller describes it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to use this essential oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff (in addition to adding probiotics) has really helped alot!</li>
            <li> The scent from the oil was not over powering but added a light natural smell to the air.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I never knew what oils were used for, and was always wondering why my mother had so many different kinds sitting around.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We had mice in the pantry and bought peppermint oil and used a cotton ball to draw a line across the shelves first and then once the mice were gone we used it to draw a line across the door.</li>
            <li> It’s safe to use topically or in aroma therapy</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this for using in foods such as baked goods I would try a different one just to be safe unless they update their label or description to reflect that it is indeed safe.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite essential oils to keep around the house.</li>
            <li> So many different uses for it</li>
            <li> So glad I tried out essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The aromatherapy of it was very soothing too!</li>
            <li> It cools him down and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to add this peppermint oil to my essential oils collection!</li>

            <li> - it is one amazing product and with the huge 4 fluid ounce bottle of Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve heard so many positive uses for them and heard folks rave about how beneficial they are that I felt I simply had to try them out.</li>
            <li> i have been using essential oils for many years, this was my first purchase from majestic pure.  </li>
            <li> I love peppermint whether it is in a hard candy or just the oil and scent of it, I love peppermint.</li>
            <li> Essential oils, especially good oils, can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is especially useful in bathrooms and kitchens to disinfect and purify.ted) to relieve skin rashes; relieve migraine headaches; aroma can invigorate and awaken and be a great stress reliever; reduces morning sickness; helps eliminate nausea symptoms; and helps control bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I love that this one simple oil can help with so much</li>
            <li> I know all essential oil is different and finding a brand that is good</li>
            <li> I always buy Now products and this is the first time I tried Majestic pure.</li>
            <li> There is no need to use a lot of the oil because it is exactly what it says it is pure.</li>
            <li> and it really does not cost very much.</li>
            <li> Lots of positive feedback from guests that enter my home.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, all the tiny pieces of glass stayed in the tiny packaging so it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I just needed to use a few drops with the other oil, to achieve that perfect balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a great peppermint smell and blends well with other essential oils.</li>
            <li> I put 3 droppers full, WAY more than recommended, into my essential oil diffuser and can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li> First I use it to dab on my temples when my headaches get to be too much to stand.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Using in the bath tub, few drops just add wonders in the soak tub, very refreshing</li>
            <li> not only does it smell completely heavenly, it has so many useful functions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been using peppermint oil in other applications for a long time, but this is a new and hopefully successful answer to my problem/phobia!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I love peppermint oil most for use in homemade vapor rub, to clear out the respiratory tract and for a little energy boost by smelling it, either straight from the bottle or in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> (I moved the bird to the other room, as this is VERY STRONG SMELLING)</li>
            <li> I have been happy with other oils before (Whole Foods brand, Essentially KateS, etc)</li>
            <li> It has a metallic smell to it and isnt strong as regular peppermint is.</li>
            <li> It you&#x27;re looking for a strong peppermint oil, look no further... buy this oil!  </li>
            <li> LIKE IT PLENTY STRONG AND LASTING ...</li>
            <li> I can certainly testify to</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure gave me a promo code to purchase this</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be pure peppermint oil</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand and there is nothing pure about it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how this MAJESTIC PURE  is going to work..?</li>
            <li> So when presented with the opportunity to review the Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Oil, I was quite delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I make certain to spray every corner of my bathroom because for some reason they find their way in there when I am supposed to be relaxing</li>
            <li> Pure bliss in a bottle.</li>
            <li> i look forward to ordering majestic pure products again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The large bottle of therapeutic grade</li>
            <li> Therapeutic oils are certified as pure oils and do not contain any chemicals or fillers that cheaper oils may contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was smell this oil, and though it does smell nice, it is definitely not as strong of a smell as another peppermint oil that I have.</li>
            <li> I use it as a lovely scent for various things and also as a natural aversive for unwanted critters in the garden!</li>
            <li> and I find it very high quality product.</li>
            <li> This oil is of a very high quality.  </li>

            <li> I purchased it because I use so much of it.  </li>

            <li> This doesnt really smell of peppermint.</li>

            <li> The peppermint is not what I expected the smell is OK</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test and review this product, and so very thankful for it.</li>

            <li> suffering from motion sickness I really wanted to review this product.</li>
            <li> Just an overall comfortable buying experience.</li>
            <li> But somehow I do not like it so much because of the scent of the oil.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that the seller gave me additional information on ways to use the oil.</li>
            <li> Works very well as an insecticide.</li>
            <li> , it really does take the edge off my migraines.</li>
            <li> When you turn on the sweeper your whole house will smell like whatever oil you put on the bag instead of the yucky stuff</li>
            <li> In all honesty, it didnt do much for my ankle, I didnt even feel the coolness of it, but my sprained hand was relieved</li>
            <li> Thank you--great product fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I avoid traditional medicine and opt for more natural ways of healing.  </li>
            <li> Love this product so far i&#x27;ve used it in my body butters and when taking a bath looking forward to my next order.</li>
            <li> I do use other majestic pure products and this one as expected is o great quality.</li>
            <li> The oil is strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Because if you find that you do not like it for one thing there are many other ways to use it that way your not buying something and never using it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as potent as other brands.</li>
            <li> and I love using it because it masks all other smells</li>
            <li> So many uses and the bonus is its an ingestible oil, so I can use for teas, smoothies and other cooking.  </li>
            <li> The 4 oz size is priced great and will last me for a LONG time - even though I do use Peppermint EO regularly to make cleaning and beauty products.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so this bottle is great for anyone who loves to use Peppermint Oil often.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it must work for all other unwanted critters too.</li>
            <li> He says this seems to work better than any other over the counter stuff</li>
            <li> I have used peppermint oil from other competitors that has been much more fragrant.  </li>
            <li> I am sure there are other uses</li>
            <li> There are many other ways to use this oil including keeping mice away</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Majestic Pure peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> it may work to clean outdoors but inside it just smells like some commercial cleaner.</li>
            <li> and so while I was dressing and getting myself ready for work, I filled the bath wash basin with very hot water and added a few drops of the peppermint oil into it.</li>
            <li> When I had some stomach upset the other day it helped immensely to take a nice hot bath with a bunch of himalayan sea salt and a dropper of this.</li>
            <li> High quality and comes with a dropper so you can put as much as you want with whatever you are using it for.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking or that much needed relief like I needed.</li>
            <li> The oil is high quality and has reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After visiting an orthopedic doctor that &amp;#34;isnt into narcotics&amp;#34; even after knowing I cannot take anything for inflammation, I was sitting here in major pain the other night and decided to try making my own rub to relieve some of the swelling and pain.  </li>
            <li> This is some super strong, long lasting oil.</li>
            <li> Having a positive feeling we have our problem fixed!</li>
            <li> Also my 98 year old mother seems more alert the next day when I put a drop or two on the floor near her bed at night.</li>
            <li> Its is a really good product, use a few drops in the bath to feel rejuvenated, burn a few drops in the oil warmer to have the room smelling fabulous.</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower and your entire body is cool when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle I smelled what seemed like a strong alcohol smell which I thought was odd, but haven&#x27;t noticed it again when opening the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I put this down by all of the doors and windows about once a week and it keeps pests and bugs away for the most part.</li>
            <li> so you might want to tone it down more than I did.  </li>
            <li> I received Majestic Pure Therapeutic Grade Peppermint Oil a few days ago and I must say that I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Several other comments here have some very good information about the specifics for peppermint , suffice to say the quality of this product makes its uses widely varied.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this oil locally at a reasonable price and was thrilled with the pricing and shipping speed for this seller.</li>
            <li> I order this and was not to pleased it had a moldy smell to it odd smelling stuff</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to add a half drop to my water to help with my stomach hunger pains.</li>
            <li> This oil smells more like chemicals and less like peppermint.  </li>
            <li> I dislike the Lemon Oil in this brand, I mainly buy it for scent.. and cleaning properties to put in my laundry.  </li>
            <li> got this particular brand peppermint oil as a sample to to try</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting how the same essential oil can vary in smell from product line to product line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also paid much more for much smaller bottles that had no dropper included in local stores, and those oils were not therapeutic grade.</li>
            <li> But this oil helps to relieve them quickly and allows me to lay off some pills - which anyone that takes pills daily understand that is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smalls far more peppery than minty, and this is a turn off to me.  </li>
            <li> When I need more I will definitely come back to this dealer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in an apartment building, we suffer with mice and this is the main reason I use peppermint oil and peppermint oil</li>
            <li> Particularly with the bloaty, gurgly stomach he was getting.</li>
            <li> My main use is in my diffuser which puts the scent into the air and makes the room I’m in smell minty.</li>
            <li> I mainly got to rid spiders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be trying more &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; later.  </li>
            <li> Smells sweet and more faint than other peppmint oils I own.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product based on its quality.</li>
            <li> You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
            <li> Fine product as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was given this peppermint oil to review and quality test and used it along with other essential oils and a carrier oil to make my own refills.</li>
            <li> With Majestic they have a 100% pure and natural formula that is non-toxic.</li>
            <li> Peppermint Oil - Premium Quality 4 Oz 100% Pure &amp; Natural Peppermint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super new to essential oils</li>
            <li> Having been recently bitten, I was willing to try anything!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re Not even Old!!</li>
            <li> what one can do with it, I researched it a little and came up with my favorite uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have a country house and of course little field mice seams to enjoy the house while we are away!</li>
            <li> wow!!</li>
            <li> I also put couple drops inside the hollow roll of toilet paper (like suggestion of one review customer) and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Epson salt and add to hot water in a basin large enough for a footbath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Epson salt and add to hot water in a basin large enough for a footbath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased the Majestic Pure brand of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as other brands.</li>
            <li> This is has a strong aroma and compares to other brands I have</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if there really was a difference between super expensive oils and super cheap oils.</li>
            <li> You do have to make sure to experiment a little to see how sensitive you are to peppermint as I have found out if I add too much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was quite pleased with Majestic Pure&#x27;s peppermint oil, however, I do wish they would&#x27;ve included a little paper on safety and proper usage and handling for people that aren&#x27;t familiar with essential oils and don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Try adding a few drops of Peppermint into a spray bottle with water and spritz back of neck while working outside for a great cooling</li>
            <li> I placed a drop in a pump of lotion and used it as a moisturizer before taking my final exam and it seemed to calm my test</li>
            <li> But this oil helps to relieve the congestion that normally follows the sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then a few more sprays and they die.  </li>
            <li> Love this,  I put a few drops on the A/C filter snd</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in a spray bottle water and I spray my bathroom, kitchen counter top.</li>
            <li> but I will make sure to leave the house for a few hours after the application of the oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably fine for other uses though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong or smell the same as the peppermint essential oils I had been using.</li>
            <li> Not a terrible oil but just not strong.</li>
            <li> This bottle of oil was no different and the bottle was packaged in a dark, glass bottle which helps maintain the purity of the oil and keep the oil fresh and toxin free.</li>
            <li> Maybe ankle was a little too far gone for it to help, but I love how the soreness in my hand had relief.  </li>
            <li> I live in northern Michigan on 20 acres surrounded by woods, so I have lots spiders in my house every spring when they all wake up.</li>
            <li> Well live and learn.</li>
            <li> I was into lavander scent for the longest time, and it&#x27;s time to switch for a new one.</li>
            <li> I am an oil junkie and am always trying out new oils.</li>
            <li> I did not think that I would have in my new home.</li>
            <li> I am new to using oils</li>
            <li> I knew I needed to try it out in my new diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass dropper</li>
            <li> I tested this on my forehead and cheekbones, and wouldn&#x27;t you know my pores are less visible, my stress headaches and migraines are easily gone</li>
            <li> I love putting a drop of peppermint oil on my hand and smelling it throughout the day to stay awake during long work hours and on long trips.</li>
            <li> I still have a few drops of the Young Living brand, so I was able to sniff test compare.</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes my nose cleared and the entire apartment was nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it in aromatherapy, I gave the peppermint oil a try on my flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still works but doesn&#x27;t last as long, scent wise, as some other brands.</li>
            <li> Out of nowhere I developed tennis elbow and was in constant pain, I lost all strength in my right hand.  </li>
            <li> I need the oils that I but to be strong and long lasting in their scent.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint we use to clear congestion with an humidifier !</li>
            <li> But did you know the other symptoms and aliments that peppermint is able to ease such as headaches, anxiety, asthma, spasms of both the stomach and bowel, not to forget relieve a fever and help with arthritis pain,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is said to be used for many other ailments, such as: arthritis pain, fever, intestinal cramping and symptoms of asthma/respiratory illness.</li>
            <li> I have history of migraines, and I will try next time to see if it was a fluke , or for real!  </li>
            <li> I can only attest to the headache fixing aspect of this product, I have yet to try many of the other uses but</li>
            <li> Going to buy my old brand and be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried out was Peppermint Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> Only time will truly tell if this really works!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely potent, I only use 3-4 drops for my entire back and dilute with either jojobo or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This works because these pests hate the scent of peppermint and knowing this makes me a happy girl because I cringe at the sight of mice and roaches but most especially spiders.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I use 1 part hydrogen peroxide + 2 parts HOT water + 10+ drops any essential oil you like.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to learn the other many benefits of Peppermint Oil in the future.</li>
            <li> but usually there will be something on the label or in the description mentioning if it is safe for consumption or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I was exposed to Peppermint Essential Oil was at a convention.</li>
            <li> Other oils are  recommended for aromatherapy, such as citrus oils (smells more</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with mice at one of my rentals, well the first application of mopping the floors with the peppermint a mouse ran out and just sat in the middle of the floor!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to use this for other uses too.</li>
            <li> The smell in general is very calming but yet wakes up all my senses and keeps me alert.</li>
            <li> I have recently been experimenting with different essential oils and was glad when I was given the opportunity to test this one for quality.  </li>
            <li> It was a little strong</li>
            <li> If you place a small amount on a cotton swap and slightly sniff it it is a great natural headache reliever.</li>
            <li> It is a little powerful at first</li>
            <li> I plan  use this all the time, because I live near a wooded area .  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops of this on a cotton ball with the easy to use dropper, inhale ..  </li>
            <li> I was totally amazed because usually when I try one of these kind of do-it-yourself solutions</li>
            <li> I made a strong solution of peppermint oil, water and a few drops of dish soap.</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair since the cooling sensation on my scalp was quite strong.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Majestic Pure brand essential oils, but it will not be my last.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this product based on all of the positive reviews</li>
            <li> The essential oil by Majestic Pure also goes far!</li>
            <li> I live in a rural area and every summer the bats come around for a couple of months, and they will find ways to get into your attic, in between the siding on your house, whatever, and they can be a real nuisance.</li>
            <li> They even emailed me a PDF of uses, tips, and medical benefits which was very informative and gave me some new ideas on what I can do with it (like add it to coconut oil for a minty mouthwash).</li>
            <li> One by one they came out from their hiding spots to the middle of my house (open floor plan) where I proceeded to killed them with my fly swatter and then vacuumed them up with the long hose.</li>
            <li> Most of my other EOs only have one or the other, rarely both.</li>
            <li> I am an aromatherapist and am therefore very particular about my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several Majestic Pure oils.  </li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil to review!  </li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil to review.</li>
            <li> that Majestic Pure came with a glass dropper in addition to a regular lid.</li>
            <li> That is what you will get with Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li> are some ways to use Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compare the quantity that you receive when you purchase Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compare the quantity that you receive when you purchase Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can tell that it&#x27;s pure and therapeutic grade the minute you open the cap.</li>
            <li> Large bottle, comes with a pipet and a regular lid.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the large size bottle.  </li>
            <li> Such a large bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also mixed it with pure water in a spray bottle as insect repel spray.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil by Majestic Pure is the only Peppermint oil I will ever use!</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil is made of 100% pure and natural Essential Oil</li>
            <li> okay, not sure if it&#x27;s as strong as my last brand since it&#x27;s been too long since I last had some.  </li>
            <li> My only concern prior to ordering this oil is that it would not live up to quality the big name brands like Young Living or Mountain Rose Herbs (I&#x27;ve used both).</li>
            <li> My husband has neuropathy, which is diabetic nerve damage and he experiences mild to extreme pain in his feet.  </li>
            <li> I used my other brand, and it worked quickly.</li>
            <li> There was a huge spider dead between my door and screen where I had sprayed.  </li>
            <li> It feels like I can breathe clear when the water boils out.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, it says do not ingest--but peppermint oil in general is totally fine to do so.</li>
            <li> You can also mix with carrier oil and massage chest or drop into a humidifier to help clear sinus and lung congestion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps clear up my sinuses.</li>
            <li> And came with document explaining benefits of natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I do like the idea of going natural oils rather than putting a bunch of chemicals in your body to heal you.</li>
            <li> opening the package I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> but WOW.</li>
            <li> Lasted much longer than similar peppermint oils</li>
            <li> so essentially I was going to pay twice as much</li>
            <li> I am old and I power surge........</li>
            <li> It has been about two weeks, now, and so far, no mice.</li>
            <li> she said my house smelled like old people.</li>
            <li> I have applied this peppermint oil directly on my neck and chest</li>
            <li> It works perfectly to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> Away - Buy with Complete Confidence</li>
            <li> says wow, my hands are so soft.</li>
            <li> I really like the option of using the regular cap or having the dropper.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, I opened the bottle, took a deep breath, and immediately realized I spent three times more than I should have with the big names.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely clueless when it comes to using essential oils</li>
            <li> still don&#x27;t know much about essential oils, but I do see there are uses for them.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for the age old statementbrings so loudly with this product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am now learning how to use it to in a natural pesticide.</li>
            <li> Every item should be professionally sold like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the freshest-smelling room on the block!&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely be using this seller again when I run low!</li>
            <li> but I had blisters that ended up scarring my face because it was applied directly to my skin without a carrier oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know others that rub these oils directly on their skin without the reaction that I had.</li>
            <li> I recomend that if you use it for your headache to be caution with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is 100 % natural and</li>
            <li> This stuff is junk compared to young living and doterra.</li>
            <li> The product has a soft fragrance yet seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The peppermint oil can be used to naturally deter rodents like mice from entering your home.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I have several friends and relatives now using it.</li>
            <li> As a frequent migraine sufferer, I am always looking for homeopathic ways to relieve them rather than relying on medication.  </li>
            <li> have read that peppermint oil is a natural deterrent for spiders and ants.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops in spray bottle with water, shake to make sure it&#x27;s mixed and spray around baseboards, entryways, closets.</li>
            <li> you are new to essential oils, then I would highly recommend this product to get you started.  </li>
            <li> Originally bought it for rodents, however, after a while the little pest was still running around.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s in a huge bottle, compared to the other sizes I&#x27;ve received from companies selling essential oils.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil contains significant amounts of calcium, vitamin B, manganese, magnesium, folate, iron, copper, potassium, Omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin A and</li>
            <li> I purchased another oil with the peppermint and while both smell nice, they are not nearly as strong as other essentials oils used in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> His sinuses were clear and he said he woke up feeling ready for the long day ahead of him.</li>
            <li> They first sent an informative e-mail with a .pdf file about the several uses and benefits of peppermint oil, and later a follow up e-mail to check in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle for a small price, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as potent as some of the competition.</li>
            <li> This is a potent oil and only a small amount is all you need whether for diffusing, adding to your Epsom salt for bath, or as an air freshener ( about 20 drops plus vodka [use a lg.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pretty big bottle so it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> would recommend this oil due to the purity and high quality of Majestic Pure products.</li>
            <li> but I am hoping they maintain their high quality in the future, as well.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and has countless uses.</li>
            <li> But this is a nice heavy glass bottle, with a glass dropper (very carefully packaged and wrapped) and smells like 100% to me!  </li>
            <li> Essential Oil is a non-toxic product, but this does not mean you want to keep it in the reach of children.</li>
            <li> It is strong so you only need a few drops.  </li>
            <li> And be aware of an after smell of a wet mildew smell.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of icy hot</li>
            <li> This is a therapeutic grade essential oil that can be used in many ways for the betterment of your everyday health such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I take a drop straight in my mouth a few times everyday for better breath.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use so much or it will irritate you skin!</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil is very powerful, all you need to apply is very little at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gross, unfortunately I mixed a large batch without testing.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure essential oil is a total scam.</li>
            <li> I have several essential oils from MAJESTIC PURE.</li>
            <li> Apparently you can rub a drop of oil under the nose for improved concentration and alertness and apply some to the back of the neck and shoulders to keep energy levels high.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to essential oils and their uses.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to essential oils</li>
            <li> I am new to using essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and peppermint</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much otherwise your hair will dry out, just a couple of drops should be sufficient.  </li>
            <li> NOW Peppermint essential oil will fill the whole room with only 3 drops.  </li>
            <li> My family had stuffy nose &#x27;syndrome&#x27; and since we don&#x27;t have a diffuser, I put a pan on the stove, added a few drops of peppermint and lemon essential oils and let the steam run free in my home.</li>
            <li> It has a very loud pepper minty smell that can be smelled as soon as you open the door.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as strong or long lasting as other peppermint oils I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I received no other compensation for my review.</li>
            <li> I have only recently become interested in using essential oils for health benefits</li>
            <li> so no other animals will be harmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is so strong, it is not a good idea to put it anywhere near one&#x27;s eyes, just as a caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I mean VERY mild.  </li>
            <li> use peppermint oil as aroma therapy because it helps keep the mind active and aware and also reduces headaches.</li>
            <li> Usually find are for external use only so I was really excited to find such a large bottle of therapeutic grade peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> I like how the bottle is large as I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle that goes a long way for an essential oil.  </li>
            <li> only ingredient in Peppermint Essential Oil is simply 100% Pure Peppermint Oil from the peppermint plant.</li>
            <li> I mix my own e-juice for vaping and my previous brand of mint essential oils started selling theirs in half the quantity for the same price</li>
            <li> This one has a backnote that I can only describe as &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s different than the two high end oils I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this peppermint oil is a high quality essential oil</li>
            <li> Discomfort - Helps Relief From Stress, Migraines, Headaches &amp; Anxiety - Refreshing and Relaxing - Promote Healthy Skin, Prevents Clogging of Pores and Outbreak of Acne - Natural Insect Repellent</li>
            <li> This oil is 4 ounces of 100% natural essential oil.</li>
            <li> used it mixed with coconut oil as a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Soon, 4oz of peppermint oil will feel like barely enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an all natural essential oil</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how big the bottle was!  </li>
            <li> Four ounces of this essential oil should last a long time as a few drops is all you need for many purposes.</li>
            <li> I actually put this directly on my air filters and the scent goes through my house every time it turns on.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint and kind of chemical smelling.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is not a blob of grease but more of a thin oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more oil and less mint on the ratio.</li>
            <li> The original package arrived with a broken dropper,  but I received an email from a rep at Majestic Pure asking about my overall experience.</li>
            <li> For under 20 dollars, you get 4 fluid ounces of a high quality product that is very comparable to the other big brand names that are out on the market.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the mice have not continued to chew on my van wiring and AC vacuum hoses.  </li>
            <li> I selected Majestic Pure due to its being therapeutic grade.  </li>
            <li> A few  drops on my pillow and it calms  me and put me right to sleep.</li>
            <li> the brands I mentioned actually last just as long because a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> Essential Oil is highly effective for its cooling and soothing vapor to help many respiratory problems including nasal congestion, common cold, sore throat, and coughs.</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast, I would use this company for other oils again.</li>
            <li> Essential Oil can be used (diluted) to relieve skin rashes; relieve migraine headaches; aroma can invigorate and awaken and be a great stress reliever; reduces morning sickness; helps eliminate nausea symptoms; and helps control bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When properly diluted with a carrier oil such as fractionated coconut, jojoba or almond oil, it can be applied directly to the skin.</li>
            <li> This came in a 4 oz size for free* to try and review, which is a larger sized bottle for essential oils and will last me for a few months of various types of uses.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out or become irritated, so perhaps this will be an option when the next major headache hits.&lt;br /&gt;I put some into my bath on a couple of occasions along with some rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil does have a strong aroma, but it is not nearly as strong as the other brand that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very useful in awakening my tired son for early morning baseball or tennis.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this brand in general but this product as well.</li>
            <li> Before long, my migraine had nearly diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used argan oil, jojoba oil, and tea tree oil so far but have just ordered a bunch of different kinds because you can mix the different essential oils together to combine and maximize their benefits.</li>
            <li> A few days later, one of the grand kids had a headache, so we applied it per the directions, and her head stopped hurting after just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this peppermint oil into a carrier oil (I used coconut this time) and rubbed it on my temples when I first felt a headache start.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leary at first because it is a big 4oz bottle</li>
            <li> so not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> For a test, I usually place on drop on my tongue (be careful not to put too much because it will burn like horseradish!!!), close my mouth and breath.</li>
            <li> Closed the bathroom door and - wow!</li>
            <li> After laying in a dark, quite, cool room for about half an hour, the headache never fully bloomed.  </li>
            <li> These qualities make it a good oil in the treatment of anxiety, indigestion,  bad breath, flu, headaches and migraines, skin irritations, rheumatism, toothache, and fatigue.  </li>
            <li> I have had both good and bad experiences with them over the last year.</li>
            <li> force is strong with this one!&lt;br /&gt;Since putting a few drops at the back of my pantry shelves and the backs/bottoms of my kitchen cupboards, I&#x27;ve seen no more critter or critter-turds, and even tho</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with water and a few drops of plain dish soap in a sprayer to keep my plain basement smelling nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice to use something this environmentally friendly as opposed to nasty chemicals which don&#x27;t even work as well.</li>
            <li> also i added it to my little oil lamp and used it whole night long.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when arriving home after having been out of town for 5 days to find the delivery sitting on my front steps, in direct sun after there had been considerable storming in the past two days.</li>
            <li> put a few drops into a small Corning Ware pot filled with water.</li>
            <li> Though, I have not had it long enough to try it in multiple settings</li>
            <li> He finds that a rub behind the ears or temples is a quick relief to the normal dark room with prescription medication.  </li>
            <li> I put a little on a paper towel and tie it to the fan and very few pests...will buy again since it still has many other benefits I have yet to try.</li>
            <li> Pretty soon I started feeling this subtle tingling on my temples and I was instantly brought back to when my grandmother would put Menthol on my aching head, for headaches.</li>
            <li> It did make out kitchen smell very strong of peppermint for several days afterwards, but it wasn&#x27;t an unpleasant chemical smell like traditional bug sprays would be.</li>
            <li> Upon further research, I found out this is great to use in aromatherapy to alleviate discomfort that accompanies the common cold and coughs.</li>
            <li> This bottle goes a long way, but I  bought a second bottle  as a spare .</li>
            <li> I expect this to go a long ways since you only use a drop or two each time.  </li>
            <li> works well to repel spiders, but does not last as long as i hoped</li>
            <li> I am a user of other (more expensive) essential oils.</li>
            <li> Added a few drops to my shampoo with some Tea Tree Oil and my hair is already like new.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had such a versatile product in my hands in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I typically use it in my humidifier to help clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> The package was dry but it was obvious had been soaked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean getting warm, I mean my face and neck were on fire!</li>
            <li> I use to repel insect and for back and neck tension before going to bed, I feel so refreshed in the morning every single time I use this oil.</li>
            <li> We also learned this summer that spiders hate it, and we had quite a spider problem on the side of our house, we put several drops in water and sprayed where they normally congregate and didn&#x27;t have any more issues.</li>
            <li> a little drop goes a long way and it will clear your nostrils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using quite a few of Majestic Pure&#x27;s products for a few months now and not just their essential oils and each I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> This is also a great spider repellent.</li>
            <li> : put a few drops in a humidifier to help clear lung and sinus congestion&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in the shower to help clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> However, not for long.</li>
            <li> There were lots of ideas how to use them such as to wake up, headache relief, mental clarity, GI upset, and the list went on.</li>
            <li> I also use it when I mop my floors with vinegar and water and again just a few drops and it completely masks the vinegar smell.  </li>
            <li> Put a couple of drops on some cotton balls and place them wherever you see evidence of mice, and those mice will not hang around for long.</li>
            <li> Jar came larger than expected.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not even smell remotely close to peppermint</li>
            <li> I bought this because the unusually long rainy season here drove ants to the inside of the house.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it in an insect repellent spray (which is quite effective)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can even help household and garden problems such as repelling mice, spiders, ants, fleas, lice, roaches, and other rodents.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing other essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> So, instead of sending it back, I will use it for other purposes.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to checking out other essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> I will be trying other oils from the company in the future.</li>
            <li> bottle which will last quite some time as you only use a few drops at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dab a few drops on your neck ,back and inner areas of your arms...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Peppermint is a common herb from the mint family that is ranked high for its health benefits and a distinctive flavor and aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not seen a single one where I sprayed.</li>
            <li> it is one of the first things I feel a person learns when they get tired of feeling like everything is going to come up and out.</li>
            <li> but this is a big step down and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this 4 oz bottle will provide you with enough oil to find a use in every room of your home.</li>
            <li> I read that this can help with cold sores and IT&#x27;S TRUE!</li>
            <li> The bottle contains several uses for the oil and a small description of peppermint, which helps a lot when you have an entire cabinet of oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mixed some peppermint oil with Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Aloe Vera Oil</li>
            <li> I use peppermint oil for my face (clears up acne pretty well and really wakes you up) and as a natural bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Other than the minor damage, I&#x27;m assuming from shipping,  </li>
            <li> Lately, I feel like essential oils have been popping up all over my social media feeds.</li>
            <li> so I rubbed just a little bit on my temples and the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> I use this peppermint oil to get rid of little pests, such as ants.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil overloads their little scenes and they will not cross a threshold with peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed this with a carrier oil put some on a tissue by my pillow and dabbed a little on my temples.</li>
            <li> Recieved limited time promotional discount but will have no problem paying without it for other varieties ( lavender , lemon oil)  </li>
            <li> I use Peppermint oil mostly for my bad headaches and anxiety..</li>
            <li> It also helped greatly with my terrible winter time sinus infection.  </li>
            <li> I use it a diffuser and it lifts my mental fog and it lessens my fatigue.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> As I am learning about essential oils I have used this for a few things</li>
            <li> use peppermint oil for a few different applications.</li>
            <li> USE IT FOR MY HAIR, LEAVE IT ON THE WET HAIR FOR 30 mins</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with peppermint oil anytime using it around your face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor and spend a few dollars extra on another brand.</li>
            <li> I will turn it on low for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> As expected seller Amzn came thru as always.</li>
            <li> (Dilute with water as this is concentrated and you only need a few drops)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It probably doesn&#x27;t need to be said, but please be careful to avoid getting it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops at a time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another way I like to use essential oils is to put a few drop on my sweeper bag at the place where it attaches to the machine.  </li>
            <li> The company even offers a 100% guarantee - if you are not happy with the product, they will refund your entire purchase price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that peppermint oil is also good as an insect repellent.</li>
            <li> I read on WikiHow that if you mixed a little peppermint with water and sprayed it once a month that it would keep ants and other pests away.  </li>
            <li> If you have rooms that are stale smelling or even in your car it freshens it right up.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for things like beard oil, toothpaste additive , air refresher and several other things.</li>
            <li> A few drops in a foot bath is great&lt;br /&gt;for hot tired achy feet.</li>
            <li> Once again a little dab will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I needed to use a little for a pick-me-up and minor headache.</li>
            <li> A little can go a long way, depending on what you&#x27;re using it for.</li>
            <li> Not to mention a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like this oil for the aroma but will stick to my other brand of oils for managing ailments.</li>
            <li> small and only</li>
            <li> small and only</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it in any other way yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s list of uses are endless.  </li>
            <li> not spearmint or other</li>
            <li> my daughters room that has a small ant problem is the next step for usage of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it on other things around the house.</li>
            <li> I use this for my migraines, and all my other aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this Peppermint oil would chase a mouse away,  but I was willing to try it.  </li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops of  Peppermint oil on  cotton balls and place them in small open canning jars.</li>
            <li> BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY</li>
            <li> I use it along with some other ingredients as an insecticide.  </li>
            <li> Works on ants and other insects too.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m extremely curious to see if it works!</li>
            <li> not like the other argan oils I&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li> I put the peppermint oil on cotton squares and tuck them into windowsills and bookcases and other furniture items throughout my apartment to keep the &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; spiders out of my living spaces.  </li>
            <li> had a bit of a stuffy nose the other morning</li>
            <li> I guess due to the heat 😣</li>
            <li> I have purchased other ones in the past that have had this on the label, and personally use an extract unless I’m out in which case I’ve used another brand a couple of times because it’s</li>
            <li> JUST FOUND IT THE OTHER DAYLOVE IT</li>
            <li> /&gt;100% money back guarantee if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Will be a repeat customer for this an other oils.  </li>
            <li> This product appears to be watered down, when compared to other brands used in the past such as NOW.  </li>
            <li> I use Peppermint oil in a number of applications; Most notably as a key ingredient in a home made bug repellent.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops of the peppermint oil (instead of dried peppermint leaves), water and a choice of sweetener such as honey or sugar.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased peppermint oil from other suppliers</li>
            <li> I will be using NOW Foods oils exclusively from now on, the scent of pepper instead of mint is not worth the two dollar savings in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil that I have to use the least amount of drops to make my lip balms.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that when I tried it myself, it gave me wicked heartburn.</li>
            <li> Soak a cotton ball with the oil and place it behind your fridge, in your cabinets, or any where you might have seen mice or mice droppings and it will steer them clear.</li>
            <li> I usually plant mint to harvest and put around our garage doors and pumphouse door to deter them, but now all I need is a few drops of this essential oil and it will also do the trick, and I will not have bunches of mint leaves scattered all over!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am slowly moving toward the essential oil trend.  </li>
            <li> Then I rub the rest of the oil behind my neck near the baseline of my hair.</li>
            <li> I would suggest drinking plenty of water with it and not laying down for a while afterward.</li>
            <li> I use it in a diffuser in an upstairs room and the scent slides its way down the stars.  </li>
            <li> so I often get chest congestion, light coughing or wheezing depending on the air quality, allergies and if I am sick with anything else.</li>
            <li> Today, I woke up with a slight headache</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell.</li>
            <li> Less than 4 drops are needed.</li>
            <li> My son and I both have a cold and since he&#x27;s only a year old</li>
            <li> I purchased this peppermint oil because it cost less than the NOW brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had hoped this peppermint oil could be used in tea, but sadly the label indicated this was not for ingestion - only external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE</li>
            <li> Now, I have to start putting this on the lover half of my face where it is still breaking out.</li>
            <li> you have sucked up previously.  </li>
            <li> Although I still noticed dandruff on my hair after this process, I also noticed that my scalp started to heal and the dandruff was significantly less after one time use.</li>
            <li> a little bit of sugar makes the medicine go down.  </li>
            <li> Peppermint tea can be made hot or cold and yet still keeps the benefits of peppermint</li>
            <li> Herbal tea - few drops in Black tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I took a little bit on my finger and rubbed it thoroughly in.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> and I use just a little bit in my water</li>
            <li> A little on my chest</li>
            <li> I massage a little on my tempora</li>
            <li> a person that has been scared of spiders since a little girl.</li>
            <li> Just little drops through out the space</li>
            <li> Even for roaches, I mix it up with few drops of cypress oil and water and spray it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like that since the dog and cat sometimes eat dead bugs.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with an unscented lotion and use it for headaches.</li>
            <li> Put a few drops on a cotton ball and the scent fills the rooms while keeping away the spring ants.</li>
            <li> Apply on back of neck, behind ears, on temples, forehead and under nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply on back of neck, behind ears, on temples, forehead and under nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even add a few drops to my shampoo bottle to help remove any dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I found a few mouse droppings in my spice drawer</li>
            <li> that is if you don&#x27;t mind the peppermint fragrance that lasts a few hours......</li>
            <li> place a few drops on your writs to help with motion sickness</li>
            <li> : make a peppermint essential oil steam to help with a head cold (pour a few drops in a bowl with steaming water, drape a towel over your head and put your face 10-12 inches above the bowl and breathe deeply)&lt;br</li>
            <li> i added few drops to the water spray and used it to keep the cockroaches away.</li>
            <li> It takes care of the headache for a few hours</li>
            <li> We use peppermint oil in many applications including abatement of motion sickness, indigestion, and even insect repellent.  </li>
            <li> I soak a few cotton balls in this and place them in the problem area.</li>
            <li> The Peppermint when dispersed smells sour and not refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I found this a bit heavy handed (or</li>
            <li> perhaps I was a bit heavy handed).</li>
            <li> /&gt;You could also put a few drops into a spray bottle to keep spiders, mice, roaches, fleas and ants away.</li>
            <li> I also use this to freshen the smell of my house by adding a few drops to my wax warmer and when I am feeling congested</li>
            <li> If you are composting, put a few cotton balls around it and they will stay away.</li>
            <li> He has a history of gastrointestinal problems/sensitivities that are currently being made worse by his ongoing antibiotic treatment for another condition.</li>
            <li> I did add a few drops of the peppermint oil to the pot.  </li>
            <li> I also made home made lip balm and added a few drops of this</li>
            <li> Not happy that it says &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not for internal use&amp;#34</li>
            <li> If it is not fit for consumption, you should not label it therapeutic grade.</li>
            <li> Use with eucalyptus to keep flying insects and fruit flies out of the house year round.</li>
            <li> I am going to do another round this week.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops into a spray bottle with water and spray my bed sheets a couple times before bed.</li>
            <li> I just added a few drops to my inexpensive Walmart Tea Tree body shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops in the palm of my hand</li>
            <li> I let it stay for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I put a few cotton balls behind my bed to keep insects like spiders and such away.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this to help rid  The house of ants, spiders, and other common bugs.</li>
            <li> This is all natural product that is also useful to cure Nausea, Vomiting, Morning sickness, Diarrhea, gas, colds, coughs, Cramps of the upper gastrointestinal tract and bile ducts, inflammation of the mouth and throat, sinus and respiratory infections, liver and gallbladder problems, headache, muscle pain, nerve pain, toothache, joint conditions, itchiness, allergic rash, mosquito repellent, and is a natural repellent for pests.</li>
            <li> I put this on my head when I feel a migraine about to rear it&#x27;s ugly head, and this icy cold magic in a bottle can take a 9 to a 5 on a pain scale.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used different oils and aromatherapy mixes for a long time, but this is by far the worst smelling peppermint oil that I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing.</li>
            <li> Very weak strength of essential oil.</li>
            <li> I have a small cat and a dog in my apartment.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Diluted about 50% with water (just used filtered tap water to dilute) and still worked just as well to save money and not let the floor get too slick.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to my mop bucket, haven&#x27;t seen a spider in 2 weeks inside my house!</li>
            <li> no more spills.</li>
            <li> I have purchased oils from this company in the past and will continue.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is with this</li>
            <li> Usually I just deal with headaches or pain.  </li>
            <li> I have been getting migraines a lot the past year, and over the counter pain reliefs products just don&#x27;t work anymore and find myself just laying in bed dealing with the pain.</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to get a water bottle and mix it, so</li>
            <li> Within about a day there were no more ants and they have not returned.  </li>
            <li> cotton balls soaked in this equals no more ants.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> And those are just a few of the uses!</li>
            <li> is one I use everyday!  </li>
            <li> The Peppermint Oil is indeed pure but the smell made me and my daughter sick</li>
            <li> and then I washed and rinsed as usually.</li>
            <li> Originally I wanted the oil for bug repellent.</li>
            <li> The others had a very off-putting undertone to the peppermint that, not only didn&#x27;t work, but made everything smell terrible!</li>
            <li> I personally love plug-in oil warmers but hate the cost of those expensive refills.</li>
            <li> I use a couple of drop of this in a plain hair conditioner to massage the scalp or use it in my hair pack which help headaches too!</li>
            <li> lightens and you hardly notice it after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the service man said spiders are hard to kill since their bodies don&#x27;t touch the floor/chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if I didn&#x27;t get bit because of the oil, or a mix from my bonfire and the weather getting cooler at night.</li>
            <li> I also share my home with three Chinese Crested dogs, and didn’t want to use dangerous pesticides.</li>
            <li> The apartment complex spays for bugs,</li>
            <li> They also included common uses for peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> After last year&#x27;s cold that never went away, even after two rounds of antibiotics, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and try out some.</li>
            <li> and I must say,  I haven&#x27;t seen any lately.  </li>
            <li> This essential oil has been known to help with anxiety, respiratory problems (nasal congestion, sinusitis, common cold and cough), stomach and bowel spasms, fever and arthritis pain as well as improve energy levels.</li>
            <li> I just put about 3 drops on a wood cutting board we keep on our counter and another 3 drops on the window sill above the sink.  </li>
            <li> Bought for spider control (I hate spiders) and appears to work very well.</li>
            <li> The glass dropper was broken and some of the oil was missing.</li>
            <li> After investigating any signs of forced entry, I had to conclude it was the latter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I slowly simmered this until the water all simmered out.</li>
            <li> and I always explain that you need to start slow and learn about oils before you jump in and get yourself in a pickle</li>
            <li> I have had an opportunity to use the oil when I was experiencing very bad headaches for several days recently.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works yet but time will tell!</li>
            <li> No more ants!</li>
            <li> Use in very small doses.</li>
            <li> I placed a few dabs on cotton balls and placed them in the garage and needless to say I haven&#x27;t seen any visitors.  </li>
            <li> and this is not a good smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of what you need it for, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this essential oil.</li>
            <li> I would not buy it again because it&#x27;s too weak of a solution.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t used it because the glass dropper that came with it was broken in small pieces when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My husband has had horrible allergies and constantly wakes up feeling congested and ends up missing work because of it.</li>
            <li> I tired using this for a headache</li>
            <li> I saturate cotton balls and put it behind my cabinets and stove to repel mice.  </li>
            <li> Place drops behind each ear and around navel 2-3 times hourly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Place drops behind each ear and around navel 2-3 times hourly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seal was broken.</li>
            <li> Tried it tonight by rubbing on the side of my head and behind my ears and it gave me soothing/cooling feeling.</li>
            <li> bugs!&lt;br /&gt;I also put them on my window seal, behind my plants to keep those freaking flying bugs away.</li>
            <li> it does not have the cooling effect ones should find when using this on tired muscles.</li>
            <li> I had the worse headache of my life.</li>
            <li> Dropper arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of Argan oil in the palm of my hand and added a few drops of the peppermint oil 50/50 and then using my finger applied it on my skin all along my hairline including the base of my neck.</li>
            <li> The dropper was broken on arrival and unable to be used.</li>
            <li> The dropper would help not spilling it when using it, unfortunately the glass dropper came broken in three pieces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sprayed along my base boards, and any other crack and crevice</li>
            <li> Mixes well with other oils and base for aromatherapy uses as well as around the house for scenting.</li>
            <li> I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the dropper was made of glass and was not packed will, so it broke.  </li>
            <li> mice are weird.</li>
            <li> One price expensive here</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> were just too expensive to afford my use....</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with peppermint?</li>
            <li> THIS is how you go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Weak flavor than I thought, but the quality seems to be not too bad.</li>
            <li> and I am desperate.</li>
            <li> I also use this in cold process soap.  </li>
            <li> I thought I could injest the oil for my coughs &amp; cold</li>
            <li> it helps me with my cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update with my results this fall, when cold season begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this during a promotional period.</li>
            <li> WHICH WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT</li>
            <li> chasing the creepy crawly critters away!</li>
            <li> The smell is very faint.  </li>
            <li> As I do suffer them badly.</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> Yeah for us, bad for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I either received a bad batch, or the oil has an ammonia/alcohol smell that leaves you queasy.</li>
            <li> Before my sinus gets so bad that I would wake up I</li>
            <li> Hope I can use all before it goes bad.</li>
            <li> I have been sick</li>
            <li> When i am sick and my nose or chest or stomach bother me I smell it.</li>
            <li> have also been using this with sea salt and argan oil to make a therapeutic bath salt for easing aches and pains when injured or sick.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get the peppermint oil to help with headaches and migraines which have unfortunately making our household miserable for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Try this oil, you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Yes, I HATE</li>
            <li> it smelled so bad!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s antibacterial, insect repellent and therapeutic effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I put it in a spray bottle with water for my kids to use as a spider repellent in their room.</li>
            <li> I bought it as insect repellent for my trip to Costa Rica.</li>
            <li> I was very shocked at the size of the bottle, I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention when I ordered it</li>
            <li> those nasty spiders like to hide.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling &amp;#34;peppermint&amp;#34; oil.</li>
            <li> because I hate bugs!!</li>
            <li> Spiders hate peppermint!  </li>
            <li> Also...spider repellent!</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING</li>
            <li> Absolutely HORRIBLE!</li>

            <li> I have tried several Majestic Pure oils.  This peppermint, while not my favorite, does not disappoint.  It has many uses, so I am glad that it comes in this size (4 ounces.)  The convenient dropper makes it easy to control the amounts you use, and you will need to because it is stong and concentrated. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Strong peppermint smell and taste. I used it in a homemade toothpaste recipe. It worked great for my needs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! The smell very potent. I was a little leary at first because it is a big 4oz bottle and it really does not cost very much. However, I was rather happy when I need the bottle and took a whiff that was too big. And it works! I use it a diffuser and it lifts my mental fog and it lessens my fatigue. I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for keeping the mice away from our RV! Smells good too!</li>
            <li> So many wonderful uses, love it with my bath products.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It does wonders!  My wrist was hurting quite a bit and I didn&#x27;t know if I had carpul tunnel or sprained it somehow during work.  I combined Fractionated Coconut oil with Peppermint Oil and put it on my wrist in the morning before work and when I got home.  Sometimes before I went to bed.  After 2 days, my wrist feels 100% better!</li>
            <li> This oil is the best Peppermint oil I bought so far. Than you for a good product MAJESTIC PURE.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Refreshing scent and relaxing effect that I look forward to each day.  Lots of positive feedback from guests that enter my home.  Will continue to resupply from this company.</li>
            <li> I add this peppermint oil to my carpet shampoo.  It works great to eliminate dog dander and doggie odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> I bought this Peppermint Oil for its effectiveness in repelling spiders. I live in northern Michigan on 20 acres surrounded by woods, so I have lots spiders in my house every spring when they all wake up. This is a huge problem for me because I’m absolutely terrified of them. I also share my home with three Chinese Crested dogs, and didn’t want to use dangerous pesticides. After reading some reviews here, I thought I would give this peppermint oil a try. I filled a spray bottle up with water and added about 4 full droppers to it. I sprayed along my base boards, and any other crack and crevice those nasty spiders like to hide. Within minutes, they started to come out of the woodworks! One by one they came out from their hiding spots to the middle of my house (open floor plan) where I proceeded to killed them with my fly swatter and then vacuumed them up with the long hose. I am happy to report that after that night my house has been spider free! So I will definitely continue to use this mixture for spider control, and for an extra bonus, it has a very nice aroma to it.&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to say that the customer service is outstanding! They first sent an informative e-mail with a .pdf file about the several uses and benefits of peppermint oil, and later a follow up e-mail to check in. They wanted to make sure everything is still going well with my Peppermint Oil, and asked for my “unbiased honest feedback”. Said “it helps ensure we keep doing things right and encourages us to keep sharing helpful tips!”&lt;br /&gt;Another happy customer!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an insect since spraying around my house. Perfect</li>
            <li> I put this on cotton balls to deter mice from coming in the garage.  Works great and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Item was exactly what I was expecting. Nice to find peppermint oil in q larger size bottle.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Perfect and quick shipping! Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Use in lotions and aromatherapy</li>
            <li> Helped keep away pesky spiders.</li>
            <li> I got this to try for headaches, but had another issue come up first. I had ants coming into my kitchen and looked online for a solution. Peppermint  oil was one of the ideas. I put it on a cotton ball and rubbed it where I thought they were getting inside the house (I moved the bird to the other room, as this is VERY STRONG SMELLING) The ants were gone for several days (until my boys left peanut butter and jelly sandwich crumbs on the table again). So I repeated the process again and have been ant free for a while now...again. It did make out kitchen smell very strong of peppermint for several days afterwards, but it wasn&#x27;t an unpleasant chemical smell like traditional bug sprays would be.</li>
            <li> I like this one okay, not sure if it&#x27;s as strong as my last brand since it&#x27;s been too long since I last had some.  I dislike the Lemon Oil in this brand, I mainly buy it for scent.. and cleaning properties to put in my laundry.  Too many allergies to buy scented soap...</li>
            <li> Love it!  I bought it for spiders in the house.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil is great stuff!  I use it as a lovely scent for various things and also as a natural aversive for unwanted critters in the garden! Not sure how well it works yet but time will tell!</li>
            <li> I love peppermint whether it is in a hard candy or just the oil and scent of it, I love peppermint. With Majestic they have a 100% pure and natural formula that is non-toxic. Has no additives is unfiltered and undiluted with no fillers. So I know I am getting some of the best oils and safe oils to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people know peppermint is great for... upset stomachs it is one of the first things I feel a person learns when they get tired of feeling like everything is going to come up and out. But did you know the other symptoms and aliments that peppermint is able to ease such as headaches, anxiety, asthma, spasms of both the stomach and bowel, not to forget relieve a fever and help with arthritis pain,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can even help household and garden problems such as repelling mice, spiders, ants, fleas, lice, roaches, and other rodents. Because of the smell of peppermint and it repels all of those with out harming your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to mention that you need to use this as directed or told. So remember to dilute with water when needed or with another oil such as coconut oil especially when using it as a topical application. Water would be to mix in a spray bottle and apply to areas of the house or garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man I love that this one simple oil can help with so much and I do not have to worry about my pets or kids getting in to an area that I have sprayed it or use it in. Plus, it is just a calming scent in the house. It is a little powerful at first but once the air gets moving and time goes by the smell lightens and you hardly notice it after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to those who are looking to take their first steps in to holistic treatments and cures. Because if you find that you do not like it for one thing there are many other ways to use it that way your not buying something and never using it. Because it has so very many other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil to review!  Peppermint Oil is extremely useful for discomfort and pain.  My husband has neuropathy, which is diabetic nerve damage and he experiences mild to extreme pain in his feet.  I discovered that Peppermint Oil helps to alleviates his pain, so I rub the oil on his feet every night.  It sure does smell good, it reminds you of a peppermint patty.  This is a great oil and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Use Peppermint Essential Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Helps to relieve headaches&lt;br /&gt;  Eases respiratory problems, like asthma and bronchitis&lt;br /&gt;  Reduces pain, like joint and arthritis pain&lt;br /&gt;  Aromatherapy&lt;br /&gt;  Treats stomach and bowel spasms, but it must be applied topically.&lt;br /&gt;  Repels mice, spiders, ants, fleas, lice, roaches and rodents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many reasons to use the Peppermint Essential Oil.  My favorite is using it to relieve pain.  It also has a refreshing aroma, that will freshen your home, while making you feel more relaxed.  Every home can benefit having a bottle of Peppermint Oil!</li>
            <li> Arrived packed well. I bought it to add into a spray canister to prevent bugs from coming into the house. Working well so far and keeps the house smelling refreshing too. Minty!</li>
            <li> II will use this summer for ants</li>
            <li> It works great to repel spider, which was the main objective to get this product.&lt;br /&gt;10 drops in a liter of water , 2 or 3 drops of dish detergent. Gone</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and the service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this peppermint oil!  This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought peppermint oil but I like this smell better then a peppermint oil a friend had.  The company also emailed a PDF of all the uses for it which I found helpful,</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses that it always impresses me.  I use it all the items to repel insects.  Even for roaches, I mix it up with few drops of cypress oil and water and spray it. It has been pretty effective.  Peppermint is strong and smells excellent, I spread it around the house and and enjoy soothing environment.  I can certainly testify to it&#x27;s antibacterial, insect repellent and therapeutic effectiveness.  Works well for clearing nasal passage and headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this particular brand peppermint oil as a sample to to try and I find it very high quality product.</li>
            <li> If you believe in and use organic and natural products than you should try this out for sure. I got this product as a sample to try and before trying I looked it up on WebMD to validate the claims and found that peppermint oil help relieve irritable bowel syndrome, indigestion, and heartburn. This is all natural product that is also useful to cure Nausea, Vomiting, Morning sickness, Diarrhea, gas, colds, coughs, Cramps of the upper gastrointestinal tract and bile ducts, inflammation of the mouth and throat, sinus and respiratory infections, liver and gallbladder problems, headache, muscle pain, nerve pain, toothache, joint conditions, itchiness, allergic rash, mosquito repellent, and is a natural repellent for pests. I was actually surprised to see so many benefits and trust me I have not listed all of them. Anyway, I used it for a persistent cough and I think it helped. It definitely helped me with stress headaches and indigestion. I think this is definitely a must have for your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I thought it was to be used with a meal. The lable says &amp;#34;&#x27;FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Great to keep bees away</li>
            <li> Essential oils, especially good oils, can be hard to find. In the are the only ones I cap. Usually find are for external use only so I was really excited to find such a large bottle of therapeutic grade peppermint oil. Recieved limited time promotional discount but will have no problem paying without it for other varieties ( lavender , lemon oil)  Since entire books have been written about the uses / benifits of essential oils I won&#x27;t try to list them all here.  Several other comments here have some very good information about the specifics for peppermint , suffice to say the quality of this product makes its uses widely varied.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have a small cat and a dog in my apartment. The apartment complex spays for bugs, but I don&#x27;t like that since the dog and cat sometimes eat dead bugs. I put this down by all of the doors and windows about once a week and it keeps pests and bugs away for the most part. Also, I use this when I get a migraine. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent,the product as described and the packaging very good and informative.</li>
            <li> Works great. I do crime scene investigation and use this in my masks when I go to calls with decomposed bodies. Also helps with nausea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for starting off with oils, but you get what you pay for. I like this oil for the aroma but will stick to my other brand of oils for managing ailments. I tired using this for a headache and it did not help. I used my other brand, and it worked quickly. I received this item in order to test and review.</li>
            <li> Love this peppermint oil. I use it every night and day time when I feel I need it. Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> I love this Peppermint Oil.  Very good quality and a little goes a long way.  I bought this along with the Fractionated Coconut out from Majestic Pure as well and used in combination the very first day I got them.  I use about 2 capfulls of the coconut oil and 3-4 drops of the peppermint oil (it comes with the dropper).  Very good for taking away sore muscles after 12 hour days on my feet.  It also helped greatly with my terrible winter time sinus infection.  The services on this as well was excellent.  I received the products way before the estimated time and everything was as requested.  I WILL order more items from Majestic Pure.  Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of peppermint oil, this is a great value.  I purchased it because I use so much of it.  I selected Majestic Pure due to its being therapeutic grade.  I use it for muscle aches and it has been very helpful.  It&#x27;s interesting how the same essential oil can vary in smell from product line to product line.  This one has a backnote that I can only describe as &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s different than the two high end oils I had been using.  If I were  using only Peppermint Oil for the aromatherapy benefit, I would prefer something else.  But this one suits my needs well and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Definitely did NOT work.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Peppermint Oil - Wowza! I am so enjoying essential oils! Why did I not discover the cosmetic and health benefits before now? Well live and learn. I got this on a promo to try out and review.  I have struggled with itchy feet and tried so many products - I did find that tea tree oil works great on athletes foot but for the itcy feet from just being too dried out I heard to try this peppermint oil and I did.  I washed my feet throughly with a mild soap then applied this peppermint oil diluted with jojoba oil.  my feet felt really good - not itchy and cool. Yay!</li>
            <li> I have knee pain. So, I took a little bit on my finger and rubbed it thoroughly in. It relieved the pain instantly. Whoooo, I am so glad I ordered this! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and exceptional customer service.  Had an issue with the dropper supplied with the order so decided to send an email to Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals and received an immediate response from Brian who corrected the issue right away.  I initially bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and I can verify that they are warranted.  Will definitely recommend this vendor and product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love Peppermint oil in general...but I especially love Majestic peppermint oil! This oil is 4 ounces of 100% natural essential oil. I love that it is not diluted and MADE IN THE USA!!!!  It also comes with an easy to use dropper.&lt;br /&gt;  I use Peppermint oil mostly for my bad headaches and anxiety.. but it is said to be used for many other ailments, such as: arthritis pain, fever, intestinal cramping and symptoms of asthma/respiratory illness. I can definitely recommend this oil and will be a repeat customer! received discount for honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Great product! Received it quickly &amp; best price out there. Used it to keep mice &amp; ants off my property. I have yet to see any &amp; it&#x27;s been over a month since I bought it. Can&#x27;t wait to see what else it can do.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil is very powerful, all you need to apply is very little at a time. Just one tiny drop will smell up your entire home.  Please use caution when using this product. If you used too much it will give you a headache.  And be aware of an after smell of a wet mildew smell. I had to in up mopping up what I had applied,  with lemon pine sole, to get rid of the after smell.</li>
            <li> This oil is about as high a quality of oil as I have used!  I am very happy with it and the customer service is excellent.  We will be ordering this again and again and again!</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil has a lot of uses. I use it in homemade cleaning products and air fresheners. It smells so much better than the commercial stuff. It is also good for personal care products. I mix a few drops with an unscented lotion and use it for headaches. I&#x27;ve heard that peppermint oil is also good as an insect repellent. The label on the bottle has a list of uses for the product. For under $20, you get a 4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to headaches!!! Omgoodness this stuff works!! And, it&#x27;s in a huge bottle, compared to the other sizes I&#x27;ve received from companies selling essential oils. I put this on my head when I feel a migraine about to rear it&#x27;s ugly head, and this icy cold magic in a bottle can take a 9 to a 5 on a pain scale. Oh, oh, and my son who can get nauseous very, VERY easily, is bewitched by this magic potion! I just take a q-tip and dab some peppermint oil onto his belly, and his stomach is calmed by breathing in the cool, calming vapors. Excellent product, at a low price, that gives you more than most that come in Barbie sized bottles!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work so well, but shipping/arrival were prompt.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil to review. I have been using Essential oils for several years now and have done a lot of reading on them. I love peppermint oil most for use in homemade vapor rub, to clear out the respiratory tract and for a little energy boost by smelling it, either straight from the bottle or in a diffuser. We also learned this summer that spiders hate it, and we had quite a spider problem on the side of our house, we put several drops in water and sprayed where they normally congregate and didn&#x27;t have any more issues. We did regularly reapply to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most liked that Majestic Pure came with a glass dropper in addition to a regular lid. Most of my other EOs only have one or the other, rarely both. I love that this has both options. It&#x27;s also a 4 oz. bottle which will last quite some time as you only use a few drops at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was quite pleased with Majestic Pure&#x27;s peppermint oil, however, I do wish they would&#x27;ve included a little paper on safety and proper usage and handling for people that aren&#x27;t familiar with essential oils and don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth. The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil. You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle for a small price, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as potent as some of the competition. The smell is faint and kind of chemical smelling. Not sure yet if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> When they say &amp;#34;huge 4 oz&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s because many essential oils come in a tiny .33 oz bottle, so in comparison, yes this is huge and a great value!  This is a 100% therapeutic grade oil, so what&#x27;s not to love?  I personally like to use peppermint in a mist/spray form (by mixing water, vegetable glycerin and the oil) in a spray bottle.  The peppermint oil is very energizing and great aromatherapy in the mornings, before working out or whenever you need a little pick me up. I was happy to receive a discount on this product!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this brand, and I&#x27;ve got to say, it is absolutely the best therapeutic oil I&#x27;ve purchased from anywhere. Comes with a sealed rubber internal stopper top and a spare glass dropper top. This is some super strong, long lasting oil. Note: If you&#x27;re using this for oil pulling, it can have quite a bite. Use in very small doses. It blends so well in cosmetic preparations like scrubs and souffles. So much bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> Majestic Oils, is a company that carries an array of products and especially oils. They have &amp;#34;Carrier&amp;#34; oils, which get used in addition to essential oils. Think of a candle and the wax is the carrier, where the fragrance would be the essential oil. I was sent a bottle of their, Peppermint Oil to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits/Evidence of Peppermint Oil in Essential form:&lt;br /&gt;Beyond it&#x27;s soothing scent and being able to clear our nasal passages, Peppermint oil can provide you with many benefits. As I researched, I found many use the oil for stomach problems like nausea and vomiting, however I did see it could worsen heartburn. While many find the oil to sooth the skin, adverse reaction is a possibility if you are sensitive to the plant. You will need to do your research and I went by scientific findings versus just anecdotal evidence. I like balancing out what people report and measure it against what can be proven. I found mostly the essential oil was safer if used as a way to relieve nasal congestion but keeping in mind that for some, it can cause headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the aforementioned in mind and used the product in oil essential form to re-freshen the home, since we keep doors and windows shut close doing colder weather. Being that I suffer from allergies and always congested, I did find mixing the essential Peppermint oil with the Fractionated Coconut oil from Majestic Pure, was the perfect match! The oil filled the home with what I forgot was the true scent of peppermint. I got so use to faux smells that I forgot how calming a scent with cooler notes can be. It did freshen up the home, which I found pleasurable and that alone made me feel good. Think of what lavender can do and peppermint shares the same aromatherapy properties. I actually enjoyed it and threw anything away that claimed to be peppermint scented and was not. The essential oil by Majestic Pure also goes far! I just needed to use a few drops with the other oil, to achieve that perfect balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My small and only Con- The dropper is included and while it&#x27;s glass and I love it.....it&#x27;s just sort of thrown in with bubble wrap into a box where the bottle fits well but not with the dropper. The dropper comes apart easily, as that is how it arrived. Being that the oil could be used on the skin and such, it just did not seem like the most sanitary way to include this. Maybe just adding it to the bottle and including the smaller (non-dropper) top would have been wiser. I cleared the dropper with alcohol because it just seemed as the smart thing to do :)  This con would not keep me from buying though! I received the above product(s) free of charge from Majestic Pure.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

            <li> Absolutely love this EO!!  It has so many uses.  It is so good for you as well. I would definitely recommend this oil!  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Love my peppermint oil.  Added a few drops to my shampoo with some Tea Tree Oil and my hair is already like new.</li>
            <li> not only does it smell completely heavenly, it has so many useful functions.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time nicely packed against breakage with dropper. Quality is advertised. And came with document explaining benefits of natural oils.  I use this in an electric oil burner in the bathroom. Much more effective, affordable, and healthy than sprays and small air wicks with refills.</li>
            <li> I use the peppermint to make a natural insect repellent--this was a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> My second bottle smells fantastic</li>
            <li> I think this peppermint oil is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using it to spray my cellar as a spider and insect deterrent.  The smell lingers and leaves a pleasant fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils, it is always in the diffuser and I keep a soaked cotton ball in bathroom.</li>
            <li> First ordered peppermint oil to eliminate ants in my mothers bedroom .  It worked!  Then used it on my mothers chest to elevate congestion after the flu.  It worked! Now trying to use the oil to prevent centipedes coming into the house after a rain.  That&#x27;s why I purchased the larger size.  Also my 98 year old mother seems more alert the next day when I put a drop or two on the floor near her bed at night. So many uses!</li>
            <li> should work all summer</li>
            <li> Hello the smell is amazing !!!!!!  My house smell so good!!!!!!  Thank u so much......</li>
            <li> I like it. Helps to get rid of a headache. However, not for long. Haven&#x27;t tried it in any other way yet.</li>
            <li> Helped with a headache almost immediately when I rubbed it on my temples and forehead.  Still felt pressure, but no pain.  I have history of migraines, and I will try next time to see if it was a fluke , or for real!  I also sprayed a dilution around window sills out and inside the house, and I believe it has helped keep bugs away.</li>
            <li> Best peppermint oil I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s list of uses are endless.  I&#x27;ve also paid much more for much smaller bottles that had no dropper included in local stores, and those oils were not therapeutic grade. So glad I found this. The dropper included with this matches the depth of the bottle so it is very convenient to use. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Put a few drops on a cotton ball and the scent fills the rooms while keeping away the spring ants.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner, undamaged in a package properly designed for size, protection, and ease of opening.  Product is as advertised and does what is advertised.</li>
            <li> When you get a essential oils there is many ways to use them. Such as on the body, head, or could use it for aromatherapy in a candle. I used this around the house for spiders. I haven&#x27;t seen any yet so I would have to say yes this is working. I also used this in a candle that you could put essential oils in. It gives off a nice smell. I have been sick so it is extra peppermint smell in my lungs is helping me breathe better. I am really liking the peppermint oil. I will try soon on the head to help with headaches. As I do suffer them badly. I do like the idea of going natural oils rather than putting a bunch of chemicals in your body to heal you. It comes with a nice dropper. I got this in compensation for a review. This is not sponsored and all thoughts are mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep spiders away. I made a huge &amp;#34;Q-tip&amp;#34; out of a broom handle and a wadded up washcloth, then used an elastic to attach the cloth to the handle. I made a strong solution of peppermint oil, water and a few drops of dish soap. I sprayed the cloth with this solution and also put some straight oil on it. Then I swabbed around the suspected areas of the spiders&#x27; entry. I do the swabbing bit a lot...probably more than is necessary, but spiders freak me out and I am desperate. It seems to be working great, but time will tell. I will be forever vigilant! I hope this is the answer to my problem because it&#x27;s a non-toxic solution and makes the whole house smell great. I have been using peppermint oil in other applications for a long time, but this is a new and hopefully successful answer to my problem/phobia! I find this particular brand to be excellent and it was at a great price with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when arriving home after having been out of town for 5 days to find the delivery sitting on my front steps, in direct sun after there had been considerable storming in the past two days. The package was dry but it was obvious had been soaked. I sighed and resigned myself to what I might find, I had not planned this delivery well, wondering what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package I was pleasantly surprised. Packaging very well done. The bottle and dropper nicely wrapped. No broken bottle, No leakage around lid into packaging. So far so good....&lt;br /&gt;Then I opened the bottle. Oh- WOW. Great aroma, so pure and a true fragrance. Perfect in the body oil I make. Because I love the freshness and ALIVENESS (is that a word?) of peppermint TRUE peppermint- not spearmint or other; I will sometimes soak a cotton ball with it and place it in the return vent next to the filter of my central HVAC. Makes the house so welcoming and &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; when I arrive home.&lt;br /&gt;I will be  returning for further available oils......</li>
            <li> Love my peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Bought for spider control (I hate spiders) and appears to work very well. I&#x27;ve not seen a single one where I sprayed. First applied full strength which was too strong and is pretty oily and was a bit slick on my slate floors. Diluted about 50% with water (just used filtered tap water to dilute) and still worked just as well to save money and not let the floor get too slick. Smells great too. My cat even loves it. Nice to use something this environmentally friendly as opposed to nasty chemicals which don&#x27;t even work as well. When we used to use a pest control service the service man said spiders are hard to kill since their bodies don&#x27;t touch the floor/chemicals. Controlling with a nice smell is just perfect. Our kind of solution. This is my second order.</li>
            <li> AWESOME..BIG BOTTLE!!</li>
            <li> Generous sized bottle with a dropper which is very efficient.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Shipped fast.  I appreciate the dropper to dispense the product as it makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> My mother suffer a lot of bowels issues, a lot pain episodes.. but this oil applied in the skin of the abdomen has helped a lot... it is not the cure but it calms the cramps!</li>
            <li> Very strong  hurts stomach</li>
            <li> Good quality and large bottle. This will last for a while. I use this is my vaporizer, lotions, as well as for repelling insects. It has a great peppermint smell and blends well with other essential oils. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible. Not quite as good smelling as Lavender oil but its a close 2nd.  :)</li>
            <li> Great product. I will order this brand again.</li>
            <li> Oh My Goodness. I had no idea what I was getting into exactly when buying this product. I saw, &amp;#34;For migraines&amp;#34; and my fingers went into overdrive to order. I am glad I didn&#x27;t let the pest deterrent aspect deter me from buying. When I got this, I had no idea what to expect with this but WOW. I didn&#x27;t even read the directions, (like I should have) and just started dapping drops onto my face/eye area. At first, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I felt bummed. Pretty soon I started feeling this subtle tingling on my temples and I was instantly brought back to when my grandmother would put Menthol on my aching head, for headaches. But it has the smell of peppermint! It&#x27;s more potent than the Menthol rubs that I had. I can only attest to the headache fixing aspect of this product, I have yet to try many of the other uses but my daughters room that has a small ant problem is the next step for usage of this stuff. I love that it is also safe enough for cooking!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and as a longtime migraine suffer, FULLY recommend buying this essential oil!</li>
            <li> I like this peppermint oil. It appears to reduce inflammation in my sore muscles. Less pain is good.</li>
            <li> This is very nice peppermint oil! It smells nice and strong and will be perfect for all my home made recipes that call for peppermint oil. The size is great because I use a lot of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Love the peppermint oil! Nice sized bottle! Has a lot of uses and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> love this scent. Have used for outdoor skin protection, and inside as a spider repellant.  Packaged well.</li>
            <li> I love the purity of the oil, the quantity &amp; the price! Well worth - EVERY cent!</li>
            <li> quick service great product</li>
            <li> Yes . 4oz is very huge for peppermint oil . I was so happy it came with a dropper. I love this oil very potent</li>
            <li> Gives a nice aroma to the house.  I saturate cotton balls and put it behind my cabinets and stove to repel mice.  It works.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great for scalp massage. Whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Has helped in some area/s, so i&#x27;m fine w/it</li>
            <li> Its is a really good product, use a few drops in the bath to feel rejuvenated, burn a few drops in the oil warmer to have the room smelling fabulous. Great natural oil.</li>

Apply on back of neck, behind ears, on temples, forehead and under nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Try inhaling Peppermint before or during a workout to help boost mood and reduce fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* For heartburn, add 1 drop of Peppermint to a teaspoon of honey and dissolve in a cup of warm water; sip slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on with the many uses of Peppermint Oil - it is one amazing product and with the huge 4 fluid ounce bottle of Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil you will always have it on hand for whatever ailment comes your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no charge in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare the quantity that you receive when you purchase Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil I have put it next to a 30ml bottle and a 12ml bottle.  As you can see, it is a great value! (picture 2)</li>
            <li> My family has been battling an upper respiratory flu. I put water on the stove to boil, and add drops of peppermint oil in it. It feels like I can breathe clear when the water boils out. It also makes my house smell so good. Much better than any candle, or air freshener. It&#x27;s relaxing to. Sometimes we add peppermint oil to bath water. It&#x27;s pretty potent. You do need to mix it with coconut oil if you are using it on your skin. The dropper works well that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I&#x27;m a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and product was as described!</li>
            <li> I was glad to receive the peppermint oil as I know there are many uses for it.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Peppermint Essential Oil is a perfect balance of not to strong and not to weak. We love using&lt;br /&gt;essential oils and there is so much you can do with them and there are so many health benefits. I think&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint is so versatile. If you look up its uses you will find 100&#x27;s of recipes. I like to put a couple drops&lt;br /&gt;on my shower floor, it fills my shower with a refreshing &amp; awaken scent. A few drops in a foot bath is great&lt;br /&gt;for hot tired achy feet. We use it in our cleaning solutions. Peppermint &amp; lemon essential oil in a diffuser are&lt;br /&gt;great to rid of cooking odors. Along with eucalyptus oil good it is good for sinus issues and sore muscles.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product at a promotional price for review. All of my reviews are honest and based off of mine &amp;&lt;br /&gt;my family&#x27;s experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Great value and good quality for topical only.</li>
            <li> this is great. It meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to essential oils and their uses. So when I was offered this Peppermint Oil from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, i definitely ordered a bottle. It arrived and I&#x27;ve used it for some nasal inhalers that I recently got. I also used it on my temples for my headaches. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on other things around the house. If you are looking for a great Peppermint Oil, I definitely recommend this one from Majestic Pure for your home.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the oil to keep spiders out of our sunroom. It seemed to do the job nicely. A few days later, one of the grand kids had a headache, so we applied it per the directions, and her head stopped hurting after just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> V ERY POWERFUL USE SPARINGLY ADD TO FAVORITE BODY CREAMS AS A DIY PRODUCT MANY MORE USES ON INTERNET</li>
            <li> Nice product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this product :&lt;br /&gt;Smells refreshing and is soothing&amp;#34; bottle is a decent size for the price!</li>
            <li> This doesnt really smell of peppermint. It has a metallic smell to it and isnt strong as regular peppermint is.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Good quallity.  Put a couple of drops in my steamer when I cleaned my tile floor!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice peppermint oil, in a generous size bottle. I ordered mine through a special deal to try it and leave my honest opinion.I do use other majestic pure products and this one as expected is o great quality. I sue it for my migraines and in my diffuser as well. It does come with a dropper which I appreciate it so I can easily measure and not messes.In other words but with confidence  this is a good quality oil .</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than I expected. Has a very nice aroma to it. Placed on cotton balls to put in drop ceiling to help control spiders and voles. I like that it comes with a dropper so I didn&#x27;t have to get one myself.</li>
            <li> Love this, sprinkled some inside the house. Will update later I it works as a deterrent against mice.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Unfortunately, the dropper was made of glass and was not packed will, so it broke.  However, the oil still works.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Works and smells great. Love the dropper.</li>
            <li> I love this scent in my homemade beauty products.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> I have an essential oil diffuser and it helps me a lot to relax. Most of the time I use it when I go to sleep, it helps me give a more relaxed and good sleep everynight. I was into lavander scent for the longest time, and it&#x27;s time to switch for a new one. Majestic Pure gave me a promo code to purchase this so I can test it and review it. Man, did I loved the scent. I never thought peppermint will be this relaxing. I would shy away with peppermint tea as it is not something that I like, but surprisingly, the essential oil was really amazing. I use it now every night. I love it and I definitely recommend it. A little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> I order this and was not to pleased it had a moldy smell to it odd smelling stuff</li>
            <li> Perfect .... Love it so much</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and soothes whatever ache or pain I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Just an average oil at best. Smells sweet and more faint than other peppmint oils I own. I purchased another oil with the peppermint and while both smell nice, they are not nearly as strong as other essentials oils used in my diffuser. I will likely pass on buying more Majestic Products as it seems the potency is just not there. I can put 5 drops in my diffuser and it not hold a candle to others oils with only 3 drops. Not a terrible oil but just not strong. I find it a much more pleasing smell than more pure forms so I think it would be a great one to use on the body. I plan on using it in my palms for aromatherapy to use it up.</li>
            <li> Did NOT keep mice away as some had advised that it would</li>
            <li> Helps repel some insects. Not so much the ants.</li>
            <li> I use this for my migraines, and all my other aches and pains. I also used it for big bites I love my peppermint oil</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews in reference to peppermint oil getting rid of pests, I decided to take a chance with it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with purchase.  I placed a few dabs on cotton balls and placed them in the garage and needless to say I haven&#x27;t seen any visitors.  Also, I mixed some with water and spray it around the house as well. The smell is refreshing and a get sinus opener!!!  This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love peppermint oil and the dropper is really nice to have!</li>
            <li> I am very excited to add this peppermint oil to my essential oils collection! I have previously purchased peppermint oil from other suppliers I never received a complimentary dropper  for more precise application. They also included common uses for peppermint oil. I plan to use this to help rid  The house of ants, spiders, and other common bugs. I also use this in cold process soap.  This is a very large bottle with a great price. I would definitely suggest this product and will be repurchasing it again</li>
            <li> Really good high quality product. Lasted much longer than similar peppermint oils I had been using and was much more room filling and potent. I will be sticking to this brand from now on. Very happy with this product. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I mix my own e-juice for vaping and my previous brand of mint essential oils started selling theirs in half the quantity for the same price so essentially I was going to pay twice as much so I thought I would try out a different brand. Bad decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even diluted by 50x this has a flavor that is similar to licking an envelope. It&#x27;s gross, unfortunately I mixed a large batch without testing. Going to buy my old brand and be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> It works very well for what I purchased it for I will make more purchases of this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I cannot get enough of it. I compared this to the doTERRA peppermint oil Both are great. This one is amazing at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint oil! What can&#x27;t you do with it? I use it in coconut oil as a moisturizer. I like the peppermint oil because it is refreshing and wakes you up when you apply it first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it in baking. I made chocolate peppermint bark. You only need a tiny bit in your baking. Make sure to follow whatever recipe you have exactly. The essential oil is a bit stronger than peppermint extract.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed a tiny drop with baking soda to brush my teeth. I used it straight, just a few drops, to massage on my scalp. It had a wonderful tingly feeling and left me feeling refreshed and my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I used it mixed with coconut oil as a natural deodorant. I like the smell of peppermint and it kept me refreshed all day.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in my aromatherapy humidifier and let the scent of peppermint go throughout my home. It provided a nice pick-me-up scent throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I also used a very tiny drop on my morning tea and coffee. A nice refreshing flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Majestic Pure peppermint oil. It is of very high quality, the scent is strong and lingers beautifully all day long. And, you get much more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this peppermint essential oil at a deeply discounted rate. In exchange I agreed to give my 100% honest opinion/review. I received no other compensation for my review.</li>
            <li> Lately, I feel like essential oils have been popping up all over my social media feeds. After last year&#x27;s cold that never went away, even after two rounds of antibiotics, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and try out some. The first one I tried out was Peppermint Essential Oil. Of course I got it and had no idea what to do with it so I went to Pinterest. There were lots of ideas how to use them such as to wake up, headache relief, mental clarity, GI upset, and the list went on. Today, I woke up with a slight headache so I rubbed just a little bit on my temples and the back of my neck. It reminded me of icy hot and I loved the cooling feeling. It wasn&#x27;t immediate but quickly after applying, I could feel my headache fading away. This one is definitely a keeper that I&#x27;ll keep on hand!</li>
            <li> When I received this Peppermint Essential Oil in the mail, oh I could smell it even before opening the box. This is amazing and I use just a little bit in my water and sometimes I add a bit to my coffee or smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Peppermint Essential Oil is used for more than this. This is a therapeutic grade essential oil that can be used in many ways for the betterment of your everyday health such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Digestive Health&lt;br /&gt;  Calming Stomach issues&lt;br /&gt;  Reducing headache or migraine pain&lt;br /&gt;  Excellent for calming nerves like anxiety or stress&lt;br /&gt;  Allowing for better skincare as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the scent of peppermint being so strong, it will even keep bugs (cold/flu) and real bugs at bay. Another way in which I use Peppermint Essential Oil is by adding 2 to 3 dropper to a water sprayer, shaking it up, and spraying it around by front, side and backdoor to keep the outdoor bugs out of my home. Bugs just do not like the scent and taste of Peppermint Essential Oil. Yeah for us, bad for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint Essential Oil is a non-toxic product, but this does not mean you want to keep it in the reach of children. This oil is so strong, it is not a good idea to put it anywhere near one&#x27;s eyes, just as a caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this Peppermint Essential Oil is packaged in the U.S.A. and is a great product for vegetarians and vegans alike.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oil because I wanted I love the smell of the oil and it leaves a cool and refreshing tingle on my hair and body. This oil is very authentic and can be use for so many things, but I just use it for my hair. I will definitely purchase again soon!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it works well on tick bites as well as keeping bugs off when outside by the pool. I put a little on a paper towel and tie it to the fan and very few pests...will buy again since it still has many other benefits I have yet to try.</li>
            <li> Great product good price point and fast shipping.  All around wonderful experience.</li>
            <li> Amazing delivery time. Love the product. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. As I am learning about essential oils I have used this for a few things and I absolutely love the quality of this products.</li>
            <li> not as song as the brand &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You get lots of peppermint oil here and it smells great.  I&#x27;m using it in with stored linens and it lasts well and deters bugs.  This bottle is a lifetime supply for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I actually apply this on my skin soothe achy muscles, apply on my forehead for headaches.  I even add a few drops to my shampoo bottle to help remove any dandruff.  Honestly you have to try it to believe it as I&#x27;m a skeptic also.  Glad I received at a lower price and love this product.  This has so many uses.  Honestly just google it and you will see and give it a try!</li>
            <li> better price than whole foods. got it to discourage mice from hanging out in my kitchen. wonderful smell wakes me up in the morning and lingers from overnight when i spray it before bed. how can mice not like this scent? mice are weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> High quality. Fast delivery. perfect</li>
            <li> The best aroma of peppermint oil that I have so far. delivered on time adequately packaged. Thanks</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good price and great quality.</li>
            <li> I use this peppermint oil along with some organic rose water to spray into my hair. It is so refreshing! I love it. It was delivered well packaged and on time. I would definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Excellent price.  Super Lux product.  Highest Quality Essential Oil.  Seller even emailed me a fabulous and practical &amp;#34;use and benefit guide&amp;#34; with tons of tips!  What&#x27;s not to love?  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Strongest Peppermint oil I&#x27;ve found! Should last forever!</li>
            <li> I thought I could injest the oil for my coughs &amp; cold but it said do not take internall . So I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and seems to be the real deal. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this Peppermint oil would chase a mouse away,  but I was willing to try it.  I found a few mouse droppings in my spice drawer so I knew I had a mouse in my house, but I did not want to use poison or traps . Several people here said this works .  I put a couple of drops of  Peppermint oil on  cotton balls and place them in small open canning jars. I placed a jar in each kitchen  drawer and cabinet and under the sink.  That was more than 2 months ago and I have not seen one mouse dropping since . This bottle goes a long way, but I  bought a second bottle  as a spare . I plan  use this all the time, because I live near a wooded area .  It is food grade,  safe for humans and pets and it smells nice</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell. It kinda smells like cardboard instead of peppermint. It says it&#x27;s not diluted but it&#x27;s not as potent as other brands. If it&#x27;s for household use then it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Great product and smell</li>
            <li> You cant beat the price! High quality and comes with a dropper so you can put as much as you want with whatever you are using it for. I will definitely make future purchases.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Use this to ward off slide scent is so refeshing</li>
            <li> Most people know that peppermint tea or candy is good for an upset stomach, but aside from candy canes and breath mints, most knowledge stops there. It&#x27;s good for so many other things, and this bottle is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell that it&#x27;s pure and therapeutic grade the minute you open the cap. The scent is unmistakable. My husband was 15-20 feet away when I opened it and within seconds he turned and asked me why he smelled peppermint. That&#x27;s pretty strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use peppermint oil for a few different applications. Of course, it smells delicious in an infuser, but if you are into making your own products at home, this is one of your best friends! Everything from muscle rubs to kitchen cleaners to scented candles can benefit from a bit of peppermint oil. You can always look up things to make or use with peppermint oil on your favorite search engine. Soon, 4oz of peppermint oil will feel like barely enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, FAIR AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  I recently read that using this oil can deter spiders when soaked on a cotton ball and placed around a room. I gave it a try and I must say,  I haven&#x27;t seen any lately.  Having been recently bitten, I was willing to try anything!  Only time will truly tell if this really works!  But overall,  this product has a great smell and I even use it in a diffuser for additional fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I take a drop straight in my mouth a few times everyday for better breath.</li>
            <li> I use the peppermint oil to stimulate hair growth.  This peppermint oil has to mixed with an oil, conditioner or shampoo. Less than 4 drops are needed. It can also be used for pest control. I have purchased peppermint oil before from another company and I did not receive the droppler, so I appreciate this company providing it.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to my mop bucket, haven&#x27;t seen a spider in 2 weeks inside my house! And it made my house smell like Christmas time.</li>
            <li> Definitely woth the buy!</li>
            <li> I am old and I power surge........well, some call it Hot flashes ...and, this s the greatest product ever/that is if you don&#x27;t mind the peppermint fragrance that lasts a few hours......dab a few drops on your neck ,back and inner areas of your arms...PRESTO!!!!!!!----30 degrees cooler...great for anyone working out in the hot sun also!!  Love~ Love this product ---I wish I could give it a 10 on the  the 1 to 5 scale!!!</li>
            <li> very good product from customer service minded people.</li>
            <li> More uses for it - I had bats in the house and until the bat proffesional could get over to seal up where they were getting in.  He advised me to get some oil of Peppermint put it on cottenball and set around room they were coming in .  They do not like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. very strong peppermint.</li>
            <li> Very potent oil. Meet the needs of the spray I was making, will definitely use this brand again.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, speedy delivery, product is great! I also purchased the lavender as well and they go great together for that spa smell. Best part is, little goes a long way! I use it with a wax burner opposed to a oil diffuser. Just add water and the oils and it smells great! Initially I put way too much because I thought I needed to, but 10 drops of each was perfect for my 1 bedroom apartment! I highly recommend the two together.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this peppermint oil. It&#x27;s perfect. I mix it with cinnamon oil  in my candle warmer and it&#x27;s an amazing combo. It reminds me of Christmas scents and is surprisingly calming.  The cable guy came over to fix my Internet one day and asked me what that smell was.  He said it was calming him after being in a fender bender earlier that day.</li>
            <li> The moles in my yard must have heard I was buying this.  They left even before I could try it on them.</li>
            <li> Great price and very strong smell</li>
            <li> I like the oil but thought it would have a stronger peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> Smell is lovely , use it around the house as ant deterrent etc. High quality.</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold. I happen to love peppermint, I regularly drink peppermint tea. I&#x27;ve always found it soothing and since I have stomach issues, it&#x27;s a blessing. This oil is so much more. I know some people don&#x27;t believe self remedies, but this oil helps with headaches to sinus congestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids and I have a allergies and living in a rural piece of west TX surrounding by fields there are times when I believe we&#x27;re all going to die from sneezing. But this oil helps to relieve the congestion that normally follows the sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from insomnia, so headaches are a part of the norm for me. I take Tylenol and Advil regularly. But this oil helps to relieve them quickly and allows me to lay off some pills - which anyone that takes pills daily understand that is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of what you need it for, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this essential oil. It&#x27;s everything they say it is and so much more. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> One price expensive here and I want to get some points on the reduction and I want to ask what benefit Save at the bottom of each product ????</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil worked great.  I use it along with some other ingredients as an insecticide.  No more ants!</li>
            <li> great product for a much lower price</li>
            <li> I was surprised and pleasantly pleased by the high quality of this product. It is definitely a great choice!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Dr Groves</li>
            <li> The seal was broken. The glass dropper was broken and some of the oil was missing.</li>
            <li> UPDATE.... USE IT FOR MY HAIR, LEAVE IT ON THE WET HAIR FOR 30 mins AND IT MAKES MY HAIR SMOOTH AND SILKY AND WEIGHTLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell. Tried it tonight by rubbing on the side of my head and behind my ears and it gave me soothing/cooling feeling. For now it&#x27;s seems like a good product but will have to test it some more to really be sure it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Effective 100% natural deterrent for mice.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works and your aches and pains and it will not let fleas ticks mosquitoes anything going on love the stuff</li>
            <li> This really worked to banish mice from our cupboard.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle of peppermint oil! Great quality, great price and received quickly! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I put just a dab on the back of my neck and I can feel my shoulders release their tension!!! A little on my chest and I get to most relaxing night sleep ever! I wish I had known about this miracle before!!!</li>
            <li> We have used this oil to deter mice from our kitchen. It has been about two weeks, now, and so far, no mice. We dropped oil on balled-up tissues and placed the tissues here and there in the cupboards that the mice like. It smells great, and is so much better than using traps!</li>
            <li> These oils are so excellent and of such a nice quality that when ordering other essential oils I specifically bought this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use to repel insect and for back and neck tension before going to bed, I feel so refreshed in the morning every single time I use this oil. It&#x27;s extremely potent, I only use 3-4 drops for my entire back and dilute with either jojobo or coconut oil. Wash your hands after use. Just an FYI. :)</li>
            <li> I always buy Now products and this is the first time I tried Majestic pure. Since I started making my own homemade mix, for my Lampe Berger, I been trying out different oils and scent. I love that it came with dropper, no more spills. I also make my own homemade room sprays, mixing with Polysorbate 20 emulsifier (1:1 mix, 1 tsp:1 tsp on a 4 oz sprayer, then fill the rest with filtered water).</li>
            <li> LOVE!  Much more economical to buy compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> Great price for this large bottle. I was very happy that it came with a dropper. I&#x27;ve bought some that didn&#x27;t have one and I&#x27;ve had to improvise. The oil is strong and lasts a long time. I haven&#x27;t purchased any of their products before, but I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Love this peppermint oil. It&#x27;s also great for repelling ants.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle of effervescent peppermint. Will order more.</li>
            <li> This is great Peppermint oil.  I put about 20 drops in a spray bottle with 10 squirts of liquid dish soap and water.  Wasps drop immediately to the ground.  Then a few more sprays and they die.  Works well on big spiders, but they are much more resilient. Works on ants and other insects too.  A wonderful alternative to buying those harmful insecticides.  I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great product and even better customer service!</li>
            <li> Came promptly smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I used this in an oil warmer and it made my whole house stink. Every time my daughter would come to visit she said my house smelled like old people. We&#x27;re Not even Old!! .....I highly recommend Pure Body Naturals peppermint oil , smells much better!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a good price.  It was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Oh what a pleasant aroma! I love peppermint period so I was very excited to purchase this when the company was promoting their product in return for truthful feedback. This is an all natural essential oil so it is safe to use it around my one year old. I only use three drops in my oil diffuser and I&#x27;m in heaven. I have a diffuser in our bathroom and it keeps our bathroom smelling fresh and eliminates odor. My son and I both have a cold and since he&#x27;s only a year old, I didn&#x27;t apply this on him; but of course I am using my second oil diffuser in his room to help him breathe. I have applied this peppermint oil directly on my neck and chest and I love the tingling feeling and it helps me with my cold. Overall, this peppermint oil is a high quality essential oil and I am one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly to my sensitive skin. No feeling of irritation and the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> Love this , it works on everything I need it for</li>
            <li> My clients are having relief with ailments that are stated for usage. Very happy! Smells great!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, good price for quality oil, thanks!</li>
            <li> Had to throw this away it smelled so bad! I thought maybe I just didn&#x27;t like peppermint until I got a smaller bottle from another company. Be warned!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Arrived fast. I have already recommended it to others. Will definitely buy again. Works wonderfully on sore, tight muscles and sinus headaches.</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell. Can&#x27;t be pure peppermint oil</li>
            <li> I got it helping me wake up in the morning. It really does work in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Very useful in awakening my tired son for early morning baseball or tennis. It cools him down and is very refreshing. The information you sent about the uses of the oil was very helpful!</li>
            <li> I love this peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling &amp;#34;peppermint&amp;#34; oil. Smelled like medicine. I wanted to make like spray, but didn&#x27;t want to use my good oils. I ordered this brand and there is nothing pure about it.</li>
            <li> I had taken the advice from another reviewer to put this on my clothes instead of my skin to repel Mosquitos. It&#x27;s hard to tell if I didn&#x27;t get bit because of the oil, or a mix from my bonfire and the weather getting cooler at night. I&#x27;m going to keep my eye out for a diffuser, I read that peppermint decreases your appetite so I&#x27;m extremely curious to see if it works!</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil has a fresh, clean, minty aroma.  I was surprised at how big the bottle was!  Not knowing a lot about peppermint oil and what one can do with it, I researched it a little and came up with my favorite uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: inhaling mint oil can help curb appetite&lt;br /&gt;2: place a few drops on your writs to help with motion sickness&lt;br /&gt;3: put a few drops in a humidifier to help clear lung and sinus congestion&lt;br /&gt;4: make a peppermint essential oil steam to help with a head cold (pour a few drops in a bowl with steaming water, drape a towel over your head and put your face 10-12 inches above the bowl and breathe deeply)&lt;br /&gt;5: mix it with a carrier oil such as coconut oil and rub it on your temples when you have a headache&lt;br /&gt;6: add 2 or 3 drops to your regular shampoo to stimulate your scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rec&#x27;d by manufacturer for review consideration.</li>
            <li> EO are probably the most used products in my home! We use peppermint for many different things, soaps, vapor rubs, fevers, diffusing, and headaches! My favorite would definitely have to be my homemade peppermint, lemon vapor rub! I&#x27;m very thankful  to h!!ve received this during a special promotion to test out</li>
            <li> it works for migrane relief.</li>
            <li> It you&#x27;re looking for a strong peppermint oil, look no further... buy this oil!  It is awesome.  I love it, but bugs don&#x27;t.  It is great for so many things.  In fact, the seller even provides a pdf on its many uses, etc.  This is a first rate operation and oil.  I&#x27;m going to be replacing all my oils with any like oils they have as I&#x27;m sure they are all of equal excellent quality.  Glad I tried it... I&#x27;m hooked!  Not to mention, it&#x27;s reasonably priced for a deceit quantity.  Again, if you&#x27;re looking for a quality peppermint oil, this is it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!!! Large bottle, comes with a pipet and a regular lid. Really good deal for the discounted price I got it for :)</li>
            <li> I mixed this with distilled water and sprayed it everywhere and my spider problem is gone also it smells good.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been mixing it in with castor oil. It makes my scalp feel so nice and tingly.</li>
            <li> Perfect as described  and on time!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff very potent</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...I use this for belly aches and indigestion - a little bit of sugar makes the medicine go down.  I also use it in my various potions around the house if I want a fresh smell :) Nice price and good value</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very strong smell. i added few drops to the water spray and used it to keep the cockroaches away. also i added it to my little oil lamp and used it whole night long. i had very good night sleep.</li>
            <li> If you have stuffy nose at times (congestion), then it may be worthwhile to try this oil. It is very potent and effective in clearing stuffiness almost instantly when applied (I do so on its own but you may want to dilute it in a carrier oil of your choice) and lasts quite a while - enough for me to sleep by then. Four ounces of this essential oil should last a long time as a few drops is all you need for many purposes. The oil arrived nicely packed in a tight fitting box (so there is no shaking around inside) along with a dropper made of glass. I never heard of this brand before but I am hoping they maintain their high quality in the future, as well.</li>
            <li> Nice strong smell. Fast shipping! Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, refreshing and a mood enhancer.  It is strong so you only need a few drops.  I have made an all purpose cleaner and I love using it because it masks all other smells and you only smell the light scent of peppermint.  I also use it when I mop my floors with vinegar and water and again just a few drops and it completely masks the vinegar smell.  I absolutely love it.  The bottle is a very nice size and the dropper comes with it so makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great peppermint oil. I used it a couple times when I felt nauseous and it really helped! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So far, the peppermint oil seems to be quite effective at repelling spiders. I put some on the thresholds of my cabin and it seems to work. I don&#x27;t have any data yet on how long it may be effective, but (damn) my outdoor space smells nice!</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, on my air freshener......  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! So many uses and the bonus is its an ingestible oil, so I can use for teas, smoothies and other cooking.  Great price point. Will definitely recommend and buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. And there are so many uses for it. The latest use of peppermint oil for me was to get rid of bats. Yes, that&#x27;s right, bats. I live in a rural area and every summer the bats come around for a couple of months, and they will find ways to get into your attic, in between the siding on your house, whatever, and they can be a real nuisance. Someone recommended peppermint oil to get rid of mice without having to worry about kids or pets (since it&#x27;s nontoxic) or setting traps. Put a couple of drops on some cotton balls and place them wherever you see evidence of mice, and those mice will not hang around for long. They can&#x27;t stand peppermint oil. Well, I thought, why not bats as well. So I placed some peppermint soaked cotton balls where I saw the bats going in and out. And it works like a charm. They are gone, gone, gone. And it&#x27;s funny, I never heard anything like this from an exterminator, or from someone you would pay to rid your place of bats. This is an excellent quality peppermint oil, at a good price, and I recommend it for it&#x27;s many different uses.</li>
            <li> This brand of oil&#x27;s are good.  I really like them.  They are not as strong as some of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products, seem to be diluted, but work very well.  For the cost, I will purchase these oils again</li>
            <li> Great for making homemade products! I used it to make chap stick and I love the way it smells and feels on my lips. I will also be using it to make deodorant soon. For the size and price it was a great find!</li>
            <li> Fine product as I expected.  Will repeat the order for sure some time in the future</li>
            <li> Exceptional packaging, speedy delivery, additional helpful info enclosed.  I especially appreciate the large size bottle.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> An excellent product! My handcrafted peppermint and Jasmine flower soap came out smelling wonderful and it is as invigorating as much as it is relaxing. The peppermint eucalyptus soap is soothing and sensational! Thank you so much for such a quality product. We will be doing business again.</li>
            <li> I am an oil junkie and am always trying out new oils. Majestic Pure is one of my favorite oil providers because they use natural and organic ingredients for their oils and they have great costumer service. This bottle of oil was no different and the bottle was packaged in a dark, glass bottle which helps maintain the purity of the oil and keep the oil fresh and toxin free. The bottle contains several uses for the oil and a small description of peppermint, which helps a lot when you have an entire cabinet of oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use peppermint oil as aroma therapy because it helps keep the mind active and aware and also reduces headaches. I love putting a drop of peppermint oil on my hand and smelling it throughout the day to stay awake during long work hours and on long trips. Peppermint is beneficial for the mind, body and skin. I also use the oil in a homemade moisturizing blend to help treat my husbands feet eczema, which helps a lot and removes feelings of itchiness and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this oil due to the purity and high quality of Majestic Pure products. The peppermint smells great and is a natural answer to headaches and dry skin. I love that the oil is natural and organic. The oil is quickly absorbed into my skin and smells like fresh delicious peppermint. I will be buying another bottle of this oil as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> Just as described, nice product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil in an attempt to rid my basement of mice. We found where we thought they were entering and loaded that area with cotton balls soaked in the oil, then blocked the area off with wire mesh. Not one mouse has been seen or detected since that day!!!! This was a fantastic remedy.</li>
            <li> I use Peppermint oil in a number of applications; Most notably as a key ingredient in a home made bug repellent.  I need the oils that I but to be strong and long lasting in their scent.  And while this product does both of these. It smalls far more peppery than minty, and this is a turn off to me.  I will not be buying this brand again. I will be using NOW Foods oils exclusively from now on, the scent of pepper instead of mint is not worth the two dollar savings in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Awesome peppermint oil</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to add a half drop to my water to help with my stomach hunger pains. Works okay for it, even though it says it for ingestion. I have to wonder specifically why not if it&#x27;s 100% peppermint oil...</li>
            <li> Will buy it again. Jar came larger than expected. Dropper was easy to use. I put it in a spray bottle with water for my kids to use as a spider repellent in their room. They love the mint smell and the freedom of no spiders. Great product.</li>
            <li> The dropper was broken on arrival and unable to be used.</li>
            <li> Using it to keep bees away from hummingbird feeder.</li>
            <li> If you are a big time user of essential oils, this is for you!  I go through Lavender and Peppermint quickly, and the &amp;#34;big two&amp;#34; were just too expensive to afford my use....I was so excited to discover this brand and realized shortly thereafter, it smells better, and more pure than the &amp;#34;big two&amp;#34; AND - it is therapeutic grade, is a HUGE bottle in comparison, and has a great dropper.  highly recommend!  (Posting the same review for both my Lavender and Peppermint Purchases as I feel the same about both).</li>
            <li> I use a lot of peppermint oil and this big bottle is a great price. Love peppermint oil and I trust this brand.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil is really good stuff . I use it everyday for things like beard oil, toothpaste additive , air refresher and several other things. Recommended .</li>
            <li> I like the amount of oil. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t used it because the glass dropper that came with it was broken in small pieces when it arrived. I tried to use it by pouring but it spilled everywhere. I need to get a dropper before I try to use again.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I wish</li>
            <li> This stuff if awesome!!!!! Smells great and repels ants. The dropper is great for getting the oil exact where you want it.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the mice have not continued to chew on my van wiring and AC vacuum hoses.  My van smells nice so I guess it is doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Verdict is still out on the helping to keep the spiders, bugs away. May come back later &amp; update.</li>
            <li> Super fragrant and a nice tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> This was delivered promptly!  I love it and use it to keep bugs, etc from my front door and windows!  It has worked very well, and I recommended it to one of my sons, who lives in the South. When I need more I will definitely come back to this dealer!</li>
            <li> Ahhhh... the scent of peppermint! I bought this stuff because many reviews said it was great for bug control! I diluted with some water and went to town. The aroma filled my apartment and I have yet to see any critters. I will definitely keep buying this stuff 1. because I hate bugs!! 2. because the smell is great and so is the price!</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil is high grade oil.  I use it for the respiratory benefits  and I make candles as well.  My breathing has definitely improved with this product.</li>
            <li> WOW! For the price I paid I thought it would kind of be a knock off of real peppermint, but I am thankful I took the chance! I usually get peppermint oil WAAAAYYY smaller, for a MUCH higher price. I typically use it in my humidifier to help clear my sinuses. This stuff is legit. One drop on the tongue will tell you that. For a test, I usually place on drop on my tongue (be careful not to put too much because it will burn like horseradish!!!), close my mouth and breath. If it is true peppermint, you will feel it go through your sinus cavities, nose, etc. For some odd reason, it says do not ingest--but peppermint oil in general is totally fine to do so. I have done it every night with this bottle and I am just fine. I have used it by placing drops on my tongue, I use it in my humidifier, and for those who like starbucks peppermint flavoring, but not all the sugar---I use liquid stevia (either non-flavored or peppermint) and then place 2 to 3 drops of this peppermint oil and it tastes just like the peppermint syrup without the sugar spike :)</li>
            <li> Third time trying to submit a review, Amazon keeps kicking it back.  Good.  Product.  Is that okay?</li>
            <li> Great product - Performed perfectly in my CP soap.</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with water and a few drops of plain dish soap in a sprayer to keep my plain basement smelling nice.  I think it is also helping to discourage spiders and earwigs.  I also hear that mice do not like the smell of peppermint.</li>
            <li> Best peppermint oil Ive ever used. I tried three at once in different body parts, all the same orice, this one blow them away. So happy I found it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have a country house and of course little field mice seams to enjoy the house while we are away!… But since  I started putting peppermint around, they seam to move out for good ! I did tried NOW peppermint…. so I don&#x27;t know how this MAJESTIC PURE  is going to work..? Hope as good as the first.</li>
            <li> I was very shocked at the size of the bottle, I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention when I ordered it but it&#x27;s much larger than I thought it would be. I was pleased about that!!! I&#x27;d bought peppermint oil before from GNC and I must admit, the smell was more potent from the one I got from GNC. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Bought it for headache relief.  Can&#x27;t believe it honestly works!  Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the product is good, i used it and give the best result. i love this, i  buy it gain.</li>
            <li> Out of nowhere I developed tennis elbow and was in constant pain, I lost all strength in my right hand.  Prior to purchasing this bottle I had never tried Peppermint oil, my chiropractor recommended I rub this into my muscle each night before going to bed.  I followed his orders and within a week I was pain free.  I am very impressed with the way the Peppermint Oil has helped me.</li>
            <li> Was very potent and just what we needed. We recently moved into a facility that is surrounded by woods and we noticed some rat poop in the storage area. We did some research and found that peppermint oil is a deterrent for mice and rats. We got this stuff and put it on cotton balls and distributed it everywhere. No sign of mice or rats since. It has a very loud pepper minty smell that can be smelled as soon as you open the door. I love it for the smell and for it its ability to get the job done. Plan on ordering it every month to keep the mice and rats away!</li>
            <li> Just started getting into essential oils. This was my first purchase. Arrived promptly with no damage or leaks. Prompted to buy this because my yoga teacher put some on the back of my neck before class and I felt that it enhanced my yoga session. Glass dropper is useful.  I use it to transfer it into a smaller bottle and a smaller roller bottle. Loving it!</li>
            <li> I like the eye dropper, makes it much easier to dispense.  The smell isn&#x27;t as strong or long lasting as other peppermint oils I&#x27;ve used and so isn&#x27;t as effective at rodent control. It&#x27;s probably fine for other uses though.</li>
            <li> best bang for the buck, I fill in a 1$ spray bottle and spray everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful to have discovered this oil!!  I use it in a mist machine, mix with water to spray around all outside doorways to keep spiders and insects out.  Mix with water to mop floors cleans great as it freshens the house.  There are many uses for Peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased the Majestic Pure brand of essential oils.  When I first opened the bottle I smelled what seemed like a strong alcohol smell which I thought was odd, but haven&#x27;t noticed it again when opening the bottle.  I have had an opportunity to use the oil when I was experiencing very bad headaches for several days recently.  I put a few drops of Argan oil in the palm of my hand and added a few drops of the peppermint oil 50/50 and then using my finger applied it on my skin all along my hairline including the base of my neck. Within about 5 minutes my headache was gone and the subsequent times I have done it it has relieved the headache as well.  It takes care of the headache for a few hours and then I just have to reapply if needed. It was a little strong so you might want to tone it down more than I did.  You have to be careful with peppermint oil anytime using it around your face.  It is very strong, but effective for sure.  I rather do this than popping a pill.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and a good quality is absolutely required in my home - this one is great - smells fresh, tastes good and does just what it should</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so please with this peppermint oil. Fragrant but not over powering, pure oil with beautiful dropper. I would not hesitate to buy from this business again!</li>
            <li> Love this,  I put a few drops on the A/C filter snd freshen the whole house, spray some (diluted) to repel spiders and ants and a drop or two on the dogs&#x27; collars helps repel fleas (not enough alone for Florida fleas, still need topical treatment)</li>
            <li> Excellent oil and very pure!  We use peppermint oil in many applications including abatement of motion sickness, indigestion, and even insect repellent.  This oil, once diluted in a carrier oil, I found that this oil performed better than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with water or alcohol to use as a spray to deter mice in my laundry room in the basement. It has a nice strong smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, thanks.</li>
            <li> Used a homemade recipe to kill spiders with this oil and it worked!  There was a huge spider dead between my door and screen where I had sprayed.  So glad I found this way to stop them coming into my home.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping keep the spiders away</li>
            <li> We us oils for healing. The peppermint we use to clear congestion with an humidifier ! It relieved the symptoms and that is all i could ask for this product to do in the uses that I use them for. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Will Definitely  buy again</li>
            <li> Great product. Works for a lot of household problems. Works great for fleas, or to even just make the house smell great</li>
            <li> This product appears to be watered down, when compared to other brands used in the past such as NOW.  I would not buy it again because it&#x27;s too weak of a solution.</li>
            <li> Even if it does not run off the spiders it is great stuff. If you have rooms that are stale smelling or even in your car it freshens it right up. I will use this now in lieu of air freshener and in conjunction with my unwanted critter war.</li>
            <li> big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really rate the product. I had ordered the peppermint oil and received argan oil&lt;br /&gt;instead. the argan oil has a very overpowering nutty scent... not like the other argan oils I&#x27;ve come&lt;br /&gt;across</li>
            <li> Very good product; hot, good aroma,and easy to use. I would want to it again after I have finished it. I wish price lower those because I use a lots.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Definitley not as strong as the young living brand.</li>
            <li> It is keeping the spiders away!</li>
            <li> This is good oil (it smells great) at a good price, and it didn&#x27;t leak in shipping.</li>
            <li> I have tried TONS of Peppermint essential oils from Amazon and, let me just say, not all peppermint oils work or smell the same! I use peppermint oil for my face (clears up acne pretty well and really wakes you up) and as a natural bug repellent. I only had one before this one that smelled the way you would expect peppermint to smell and worked the way it should but it was a teeny-tiny bottle for the same price as this one! The others had a very off-putting undertone to the peppermint that, not only didn&#x27;t work, but made everything smell terrible! But this one is FANTASTIC! Smells just like peppermint SHOULD, BIG bottle - the dropper/lid attachment is a nice touch too! They even emailed me a PDF of uses, tips, and medical benefits which was very informative and gave me some new ideas on what I can do with it (like add it to coconut oil for a minty mouthwash). I will definitely buy this as my go-to peppermint oil from now on!!</li>
            <li> I use this to keep the mice away.  It works better than anything I have ever used.  I also use it in my Cherokee because I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, very happy</li>
            <li> Love using this for cleaning.</li>
            <li> This oil smells more like chemicals and less like peppermint.  I wonder what process they use to distill the peppermint.  it may work to clean outdoors but inside it just smells like some commercial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used different oils and aromatherapy mixes for a long time, but this is by far the worst smelling peppermint oil that I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. I have been happy with other oils before (Whole Foods brand, Essentially KateS, etc) but I like to try new brands, and this was fortunately cheaper than most. How can you go wrong with peppermint? The oil has been made almost forever, and the smell is in every brand of gum, mint, and chocolate that they place on your pillow at mid-end hotels. THIS is how you go wrong. I either received a bad batch, or the oil has an ammonia/alcohol smell that leaves you queasy. I have two diffusers and one candle burner and after about an hour of using this oil I was nauseous. Either a cat broke into my house and sprayed the ceiling to floor with asparagus-powered fear pee, or this oil was just garbage. After investigating any signs of forced entry, I had to conclude it was the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and spend a few dollars extra on another brand.</li>
            <li> wow!! spiders really take offense to this and I love the effects</li>
            <li> I purchased this peppermint oil because it cost less than the NOW brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in an apartment building, we suffer with mice and this is the main reason I use peppermint oil and peppermint oil products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not of the pure peppermint oil that I am used to nor is it as effective as the NOW brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry folks, cannot provide a better review, but, I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong or smell the same as the peppermint essential oils I had been using.</li>
            <li> good product strong smell great on the skin works very well for headaches and muscle very uplifting</li>
            <li> Keeps the mice away and smell better than using urinal cake.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I have been using it when I feel like a migraine is coming on.  I rub it into my neck muscles and around my temples.  Also, when I am having discomfort from IBS I rub it on the abdomen area.  It is a great, safe, natural product.  I like how the bottle is large as I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Came promptly smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Well packaged, fast delivery. Good price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil.  This is a large bottle that goes a long way for an essential oil.  I use it to scent the room and as an insecticide.  I mix with water in a spray bottle and spray around the areas where bugs might enter.  No bugs :-)</li>
            <li> We use it to keep pests away while leaving a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Product for review: I love this company and product. I have purchased oils from this company in the past and will continue.</li>
            <li> This oil is very nice and the price is great for the size. Also nice that it comes with a dropper.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Great Price!&lt;br /&gt;A lot for a little.&lt;br /&gt;Go for it!</li>

I imagine this bottle will last a long time, it works great in the rainbow too. enjoy you fresh smell like i am</li>
            <li> I suffer from headaches and i smell the peppermint oil to help relieve it. It really does work. When i am sick and my nose or chest or stomach bother me I smell it. I really works. I love this product. I recommend it and would purchase. I was given this product at a reduced price to review and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of peppermint...use it for itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I use this peppermint oil to get rid of little pests, such as ants. I soak a few cotton balls in this and place them in the problem area. Upon further research, I found out this is great to use in aromatherapy to alleviate discomfort that accompanies the common cold and coughs. I&#x27;ll update with my results this fall, when cold season begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this during a promotional period. These are my unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> This oil is really strong &amp; natural! This is the only oil that I have to use the least amount of drops to make my lip balms. Be careful not to use so much or it will irritate you skin! I will only continue to buy peppermint oil from this brand! Also the sellers emailed me 2 times to make sure I had received it &amp; to make sure I liked it. Best costumer service EVER!</li>
            <li> The Peppermint when dispersed smells sour and not refreshing.  :(  I diffuse peppermint daily and this is not a good smell.</li>
            <li> Of course my dropper was broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of essential oils. I am however still a newbie with them. I love learning about their different uses and benefits. This peppermint oil does have a strong aroma, but it is not nearly as strong as the other brand that I have tried. I love peppermint oil to help with headaches. If you place a small amount on a cotton swap and slightly sniff it it is a great natural headache reliever. I have not purchased a diffuser yet, but I think it would work the same way and have similar benefits. It also gives your scalp an amazing feeling if you apply a drop or two to your shampoo. It also seems to help with my anxiety. I placed a drop in a pump of lotion and used it as a moisturizer before taking my final exam and it seemed to calm my test anxiety!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of peppermint. I put a few drops in a spray bottle water and I spray my bathroom, kitchen counter top. I love this smell, it relax me</li>
            <li> I like the peppermint as it has staying power..... I use it to make a sugar scrub for work and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Item arrived  on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> Spiders hate peppermint!  I recently learned this fact.  I put the peppermint oil on cotton squares and tuck them into windowsills and bookcases and other furniture items throughout my apartment to keep the &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; spiders out of my living spaces.  It works very well and I recommend it to anyone with trees that are close to their living quarters.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and service.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li> Bottle is a good size. The Peppermint Oil is awesome. I used it in my homemade sugar scrubs and it has become my favorite. The smell is perfect but the effect you get when you use it in a sugar scrub is an experience to love! Use it in the shower and your entire body is cool when you get out of the shower. I feel awake and ready to roll after using this product. Love it. I now give these sugar scrubs and bath salts as gifts. It&#x27;s fun to make and fun to give to others. And, the man in my life have decided that he loves them also because they are great for degreasing your hands after work! And I&#x27;ve had a guy or two says wow, my hands are so soft. :) love it!</li>
            <li> Not as strong as other brands.</li>
            <li> Love the peppermint! Using it with our Inno Gear diffuser, it helps with congestion and clearer nasal passages!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this peppermint essential oil.  I put some on cotton balls and placed them in my closet and around my house.  When I come home it smells soooo good!  I&#x27;ve also heard peppermint oil helps keep spiders &amp; critters away.</li>
            <li> My daughter was having a mouse problem.  She isn&#x27;t anymore.  Makes the house smell great and discourages the critters.  Cheaper than buying a cat</li>
            <li> I am using the peppermint oil as a control for mice in my garden and ants on my patio.  Two teaspoons to a cup of water with a dab of dish detergent  makes a very effective spray.  What a wonderful way to control this little guys without brining any harm.  This oil is of a very high quality.  I am an aromatherapist and am therefore very particular about my essential oils.  I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Strong, even though not as strong as YL -but then it doesn&#x27;t claim to be. So, 5 stars for everything it does claim! The size is just awesome, perfect when you diffuse it everyday, and for multiple other uses as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!! Clears up sinus immediately I put drops in my vents..It is also a great air freshner.</li>
            <li> We have purchased several different oils and have found them all to be beneficial.</li>
            <li> I really like the option of using the regular cap or having the dropper. I use it by my doors for spider and mouse prevention. It has a very nice potent scent. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> The must have oils in my cabinet: Peppermint, Lavender, Frankincense, and Lemon. All have their unique purposes. The Peppermint is #1, and it must be of exceptional quality. My only concern prior to ordering this oil is that it would not live up to quality the big name brands like Young Living or Mountain Rose Herbs (I&#x27;ve used both). When the package arrived, I opened the bottle, took a deep breath, and immediately realized I spent three times more than I should have with the big names. I still have a few drops of the Young Living brand, so I was able to sniff test compare. Zero difference. This product is EASILY the best quality at the right price. Add a sixth star for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;If you are organic product lover then this product is really for you. I received a sample of this product and after trying it, I am planning to order the bottle as pricing is very reasonable and comes with wonderful peppermint smell. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely clueless when it comes to using essential oils but I&#x27;ve heard so many positive uses for them and heard folks rave about how beneficial they are that I felt I simply had to try them out. So when presented with the opportunity to review the Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Oil, I was quite delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a diffuser so I couldn&#x27;t utilize that dispensing method. But I did try several things.....&lt;br /&gt;I dabbed a bit onto my temples (suppose to help with headaches). I found this a bit heavy handed (or perhaps I was a bit heavy handed). It didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out or become irritated, so perhaps this will be an option when the next major headache hits.&lt;br /&gt;I put some into my bath on a couple of occasions along with some rosehip oil. Nice aroma and hopefully helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops into a small Corning Ware pot filled with water. I slowly simmered this until the water all simmered out. Very nice to breathe this in but don&#x27;t want to be right next to it in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of a stuffy nose the other morning and so while I was dressing and getting myself ready for work, I filled the bath wash basin with very hot water and added a few drops of the peppermint oil into it. Closed the bathroom door and - wow! What a nice head-opener. I think this is a winner when you have a stuffy nose or head cold.&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t know much about essential oils, but I do see there are uses for them. I had hoped this peppermint oil could be used in tea, but sadly the label indicated this was not for ingestion - only external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are solely my own. I was not compensated for this review.</li>
            <li> Great for insect control---also leaves nice fragrance in home</li>
            <li> great product, even better price! Quality and value all in one. Will buy more oils from this company.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Peppermint. This is the best purchase that I have ever made and at a reasonable cost also.  The uses for this product are unlimited.</li>
            <li> I have been collecting oils for my diffuser. I want a nice smelling house with some great benefits. This is a nice scent not to strong and helps with our runny nose allergies! I bought this at a promotional price and am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this great product :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product.  It is very mild.  And I mean VERY mild.  I put 3 droppers full, WAY more than recommended, into my essential oil diffuser and can barely smell it.  NOW Peppermint essential oil will fill the whole room with only 3 drops.  Not sure what the problem is with this but it doesn&#x27;t even smell that much like peppermint.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge and comes with a glass dropper! I wanted this because I have been dealing with a lot of stress at home and work, saw this helps with stress, headaches, migraines, outbreaks of my wonderful adult acne and so much more. Those are the specific reasons I NEEDED this. Well, I have to say, since I received this, it truly has helped. I tested this on my forehead and cheekbones, and wouldn&#x27;t you know my pores are less visible, my stress headaches and migraines are easily gone and I feel better over all. Now, I have to start putting this on the lover half of my face where it is still breaking out. This is exactly how the seller describes it. This is beyond my expectations, but I thought I would give it a try. I highly recommend this to anyone looking or that much needed relief like I needed.</li>
            <li> I received a free product sample for review. The Majestic Pure essential oil has a wonderful peppermint fragrance. I have already used it (successfully!) as aromatherapy to get rid of my headaches. Simply breathing in the peppermint aroma has worked wonders for me. The 4 oz size is priced great and will last me for a LONG time - even though I do use Peppermint EO regularly to make cleaning and beauty products. A little bit goes a long way, so this bottle is great for anyone who loves to use Peppermint Oil often. This is my first time using the Majestic Pure brand essential oils, but it will not be my last. I am very pleased with the quality of their peppermint essential oil.</li>
            <li> Love the oil.  I drink lots of water and put 2 drops in a 20 oz glass of ice water and it gives it a great taste for a change.  My cats don&#x27;t like the smell so anywhere I don&#x27;t want them I put a drop so I&#x27;m sure it must work for all other unwanted critters too.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals Peppermint Essential Oil is made of 100% pure and natural Essential Oil and I received it free for tessting purposes. It’s Therapeutic Grade with no fillers or additives and it comes in a 4 oz glass bottle with a clear glass dropper for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Peppermint Essential Oil has so many benefits! This essential oil has been known to help with anxiety, respiratory problems (nasal congestion, sinusitis, common cold and cough), stomach and bowel spasms, fever and arthritis pain as well as improve energy levels. It also reduces headache, nausea and vomitting and effectively lessens sensitivity to noise and light! When properly diluted with a carrier oil such as fractionated coconut, jojoba or almond oil, it can be applied directly to the skin. You can combine the peppermint oil with lotion or another oil to make a great smelling moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This essential oil also has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, antispasmodic and carminative properties. Apparently you can rub a drop of oil under the nose for improved concentration and alertness and apply some to the back of the neck and shoulders to keep energy levels high. You can also mix with carrier oil and massage chest or drop into a humidifier to help clear sinus and lung congestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also put a few drops into a spray bottle to keep spiders, mice, roaches, fleas and ants away. This is my favorite way to use this essential oil. This works because these pests hate the scent of peppermint and knowing this makes me a happy girl because I cringe at the sight of mice and roaches but most especially spiders. I make certain to spray every corner of my bathroom because for some reason they find their way in there when I am supposed to be relaxing and instead they end up scaring me. Since the use of this oil though, I have managed to scare the spiders away! This oil WORKS! I also use this to freshen the smell of my house by adding a few drops to my wax warmer and when I am feeling congested I apply some on a cotton ball and smell it until I can breathe comfortably again. It is amazing all of the wonderul things this Peppermint Oil is capable of! Really a great product!w drops to my wax warmer and when I am feeling congested I apply some on a cotton ball and smell it until I can breathe comfortably again. It is amazing all of the wonderul things this Peppermint Oil is capable of! Really a great product!</li>
            <li> For EXTERNAL use only, great for using to protect garden plants, also get rid of rodents or keep them at bay. If you are composting, put a few cotton balls around it and they will stay away. I put a few cotton balls behind my bed to keep insects like spiders and such away. Yes, I HATE bugs!&lt;br /&gt;I also put them on my window seal, behind my plants to keep those freaking flying bugs away. I buy a different brand of peppermint for ingesting. I only buy two oils to ingest that I trust.</li>
            <li> I  bought a bottle of this for my boyfriend to try a couple months ago. He has a history of gastrointestinal problems/sensitivities that are currently being made worse by his ongoing antibiotic treatment for another condition. This stuff (in addition to adding probiotics) has really helped alot! Particularly with the bloaty, gurgly stomach he was getting. He says this seems to work better than any other over the counter stuff hes tried (incl. pepto). I&#x27;m just so happy to have found something that can take the edge off his symptoms and make him more comfortable. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that when I tried it myself, it gave me wicked heartburn. I would suggest drinking plenty of water with it and not laying down for a while afterward. The peppermint burps were pleasent though! :)</li>
            <li> Great product just didn&#x27;t come with a dropper</li>
            <li> super strong, don&#x27;t need to use much</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for the age old statementbrings so loudly with this product. Not only does it not even smell remotely close to peppermint it does not have the cooling effect ones should find when using this on tired muscles.</li>
            <li> If you are using this as a plant spray, just a dab will do you. I put something like a tablespoon in a quart and burned a bunch of plants. Now I use a couple drops, it smells up the plants, and the insects and mice are leaving them alone.</li>
            <li> I am slowly moving toward the essential oil trend.  I loved this bottle came with it&#x27;s own dropper.  Because of sinus issues I tend to keep a pot of water on the stove (like my granny did).  I will turn it on once it starts to boil I will turn it on low for a few hours.  This is my attempt to add moisture back in the air.  I did add a few drops of the peppermint oil to the pot.  The scent from the oil was not over powering but added a light natural smell to the air.  In exchange for the product I agreed to provide my honest and unbiased opinion.  The bottle is 4 ounces.  I expect this to go a long ways since you only use a drop or two each time.  I have ready reviews about this oil treating migraines so I wanted to see how it would affect a sinus headache. I added a drop to fingers and rubbed in on my forehead and temples.  I was pleasantly surprised. I avoid traditional medicine and opt for more natural ways of healing.  Usually I just deal with headaches or pain.  I am glad to know that I have this as an option.  The oil itself is not a blob of grease but more of a thin oil.  Once again a little dab will go a long way.  5 star rating since it came with a dropper, size of the bottle, and the fact that it&#x27;s a multipurpose item.  I am now learning how to use it to in a natural pesticide.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great</li>
            <li> Never without peppermint! Bs wish in my mouth after brushing, great for hair scent, in the tub, in the laundry. Use it in my homemade cleaners and mop water. Good good value . Not to mention no migraine sufferer should ge without!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  The oil is very strong-smelling and very potent.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> As expected seller Amzn came thru as always.</li>
            <li> As described, came in time and i love the smell. Thanx</li>
            <li> smells GREAT and feels great to add to MANY things, laundry, tea, mouse traps.. lol</li>
            <li> The peppermint is not what I expected the smell is OK it&#x27;s definitely not the greatest quality also when I received it the glass part that you insert inside broke I guess due to the heat 😣</li>
            <li> This tastes wonderful. Works great in my lip balms I make.</li>
            <li> I never knew what oils were used for, and was always wondering why my mother had so many different kinds sitting around. I never thought to ask her. I have been getting migraines a lot the past year, and over the counter pain reliefs products just don&#x27;t work anymore and find myself just laying in bed dealing with the pain. That&#x27;s until someone told me about peppermint oil. They told me how to use it and where to apply it when I got migraines. I&#x27;ve tried a couple peppermint oils, and none of them even compare to this one! This oil is so beneficial to me now. Any time I have a migraine I just simply dab some of this oil on my temples and let it do its work. Before long, my migraine had nearly diminished. The smell is inviting, but not overly strong. The dropped helps with getting the right amount I need. I was given the opportunity to test and review this product, and so very thankful for it. I am no longer worried about finding relief when it comes to my migraines. This peppermint oil is beyond the best one that works!&lt;br /&gt;I also use this oil in my diffuser because I love the smell of peppermint. Make sure to not over do it on how much you add. The smell CAN be strong if you add too much!</li>
            <li> Wow! Love this peppermint oil. I opened my bottle in the car while my boyfriend was driving. I needed to use a little for a pick-me-up and minor headache. He was like, &amp;#34;Wow! What&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34; I told him I had used my peppermint oil to ward off a headache and liven up. He said, &amp;#34;Well, it works.&amp;#34;  This is a potent oil and only a small amount is all you need whether for diffusing, adding to your Epsom salt for bath, or as an air freshener ( about 20 drops plus vodka [use a lg. spray bottle to fill] and it is a wonderful air freshener. Can also add to carpet cleaners with recipe (test first for colorfastness!) I use 1 part hydrogen peroxide + 2 parts HOT water + 10+ drops any essential oil you like. Also...spider repellent! Just a few drops in spray bottle with water, shake to make sure it&#x27;s mixed and spray around baseboards, entryways, closets.</li>
            <li> I mixed some peppermint oil with Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Aloe Vera Oil and I use it on my scalp. It gives my scalp a cooling sensation and it stops it from itching.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had such a versatile product in my hands in a very long time. I have done so much with this since I received it that I don&#x27;t know where to begin. First I use it to dab on my temples when my headaches get to be too much to stand. I put a few drops in the shower to help clear my sinuses. It really helps with nausea. I have made a foot rub out of coconut oil, sea salt, and this. I also made home made lip balm and added a few drops of this and it was a huge hit! I plan on using it to combat mice, ants, and mosquitoes as well once the summer months hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Weak flavor than I thought, but the quality seems to be not too bad.</li>
            <li> I love this peppermint oil so so much. I used it for sleeplessness (in pillow at night) and relaxation. I also put couple drops inside the hollow roll of toilet paper (like suggestion of one review customer) and it smells amazing. I purchased this product from Majestic pure at promotional price and it&#x27;s really worth the money. The bottle with glass dropper are convenient for storage and usage. I really like the quality of this oil. will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very unimpressed with this product.  The smell is very faint.  I have used peppermint oil from other competitors that has been much more fragrant.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again; invest in spending a bit more to get better quality.</li>
            <li> Very powerful 100 percent oil</li>
            <li> A few  drops on my pillow and it calms  me and put me right to sleep. A plus that it&#x27;s in a glass bottle. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product overall. We use it as a natural way to ward off pests and also found it to be great for sinuses if you have a stuffy nose. (Just put a drop under your nose and breathe easy!)</li>
            <li> I spray this on my fan and on my pillows..it is so refreshing. This is my second time ordering it. It is like a fresh breeze</li>
            <li> I think its a great product.  You can definitely smell the oil and tell that it is 100% peppermint oil.  I use it with the coconut oil that I put on my hair.  Don&#x27;t use too much otherwise your hair will dry out, just a couple of drops should be sufficient.  I also put it into my shampoo.</li>
            <li> This smells lovely. I can&#x27;t wait to try it in a multitude of products.</li>
            <li> Some of the best peppermint oil we have used. Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to essential oils but I continue to be impressed with all of the Majestic Pure essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get the peppermint oil to help with headaches and migraines which have unfortunately making our household miserable for awhile.  And this definitely worked for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this peppermint oil has no additives - I don&#x27;t  want to pay for a bunch of added junk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful to Majestic Pure for offering such great products that allow me to enjoy the benefits of the essential oils and not have to use pills or chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product as part of promotion, the opinions expressed in the review are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Such a large bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one thing many people don&#x27;t know is that if you have rodent problems there are natural ways to make them run for the hills. Peppermint oil overloads their little scenes and they will not cross a threshold with peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had mice in the pantry and bought peppermint oil and used a cotton ball to draw a line across the shelves first and then once the mice were gone we used it to draw a line across the door. NO MORE MICE!!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The reason i&#x27;ve taken away one star is that I&#x27;ve purchased another brand and realized this brand isn&#x27;t nearly as potent as others. It&#x27;s still works but doesn&#x27;t last as long, scent wise, as some other brands. It&#x27;s a little more oil and less mint on the ratio. The line of peppermint wears off every two days where others take over a week for the smell to dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product but my reviews are honest</li>
            <li> There are many uses for this product which is why I will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super new to essential oils and I&#x27;m in love! It comes with a dropper top, perfect to control how much you&#x27;re using. I&#x27;ve been doing some research on EOs and finding that they have so many uses! The smell of this one is amazing, strong and smells like a candy cane! It&#x27;s a huge bottle so it will last for quite some time. This product has turned me onto EOs and I will definitely be purchasing more! Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the unusually long rainy season here drove ants to the inside of the house.  I read on WikiHow that if you mixed a little peppermint with water and sprayed it once a month that it would keep ants and other pests away.  Well.  I was too lazy to get a water bottle and mix it, so I just put about 3 drops on a wood cutting board we keep on our counter and another 3 drops on the window sill above the sink.  Within about a day there were no more ants and they have not returned.  I was totally amazed because usually when I try one of these kind of do-it-yourself solutions, they rarely work well - if at all.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil really works for me , everytime I feel a migraine coming on I massage a little on my tempora and it do the treat</li>
            <li> I received Majestic Pure Therapeutic Grade Peppermint Oil a few days ago and I must say that I love this product.  It works wonders!  I have used it to spray for spiders and in lotion during a pedicure.  There is no need to use a lot of the oil because it is exactly what it says it is pure. I read that there are several ways to use peppermint oil and I can not wait to put the Majestic Pure Therapeutic Grade Peppermint Oil to use in some of these many ways.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Fast service</li>
            <li> Great product....use it to repel mice in my sports car while in storage....</li>
            <li> I was waiting to use the peppermint oil to review it, well,  I just did body wash soap and the fragrance was so delightful, we used the soap last night and we love it,  will keep coming for more. it is a large bottle and it was nicely packed. Great service,</li>
            <li> I love this oil. And I love the price!  I was paying 9 bucks for 1/2 ounce at the local health food store. I should have been on amazon all along. The oil is clear and has a nice and strong peppermint smell. It comes with a glass dropper included. I use this oil in soaps, lip balms, muscle balms, and in bath bombs. It works great. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again. I&#x27;m really impressed by this company. Good, quality products at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  and great price as well.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, quality excellent for my diffuser, separately sealed dropper included for protection!  Every item should be professionally sold like this. Kudos to the manufacturer and to Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> chasing the creepy crawly critters away!</li>
            <li> product meets my expectations</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for headaches and stomach aches. I will be purchasing other essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> Very weak strength of essential oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the freshest-smelling room on the block!&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely be using this seller again when I run low!</li>
            <li> This is great in my water, tea and diffuser. What a fresh feeling in my cottage. It helps with my sinus congestion. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I really like the Oil.  I received quickly and I paid an excellent price for it. Thanks you</li>
            <li> Pure bliss in a bottle. I just recently got into using a diffuser and oils. A friend mentioned peppermint oil to me and I was so excited to try it. My husband has had horrible allergies and constantly wakes up feeling congested and ends up missing work because of it. Even after getting a surgery on his sinuses they still get bothersome. After a night with this running in my diffuser he actually woke up feeling amazing. His sinuses were clear and he said he woke up feeling ready for the long day ahead of him. I loved the way this smelled. It was such a calming scent. It helped my anxiety and stress disappear. This is my favorite oil and I am so happy with it. I can&#x27;t wait to learn the other many benefits of Peppermint Oil in the future. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> The size was surprising for such a potent oil, great price, and they followed up to see if I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> No mice have showed up since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I will use this in conjunction with the Fresh Cab packages. They work great, so thus will be used in addition to or to revitalize the packets.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Quick shipping! Thank You!</li>
            <li> This oil is great!!! I use it in a diffuser and also in a spray bottle to keep spiders at bay!</li>
            <li> I use the oil for spiders,  works great!  Also doubles as air freshener for my home. Great price for the large bottle! !</li>
            <li> Great for what I needed it for</li>
            <li> I am only giving this 4 stars because it says not for internal use. My family has used peppermint oil to soothe stomach aches for years. But, I didn&#x27;t want to use this one in that way, since it said not to. So, instead of sending it back, I will use it for other purposes. It is still very nice peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal, very large size, good communication, fast shipping, hope to do business with again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Everything about my experience was great</li>
            <li> Good Quality - will buy again</li>
            <li> Love the spell and the way it make me fill. It also put me in a relationship inr mode. I have and will buy it again. Yes! I will recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Strong powerful and fresh. Try this oil, you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Not keeping mice away...</li>
            <li> Good for oral uses. Originally bought it for rodents, however, after a while the little pest was still running around.</li>
            <li> This is a new favorite of mine. It&#x27;s strong, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot at one time. A little can go a long way, depending on what you&#x27;re using it for.</li>
            <li> cotton balls soaked in this equals no more ants.  yeahhhhh</li>
            <li> Amazing product for relieving headaches. I also enjoy using it for opening up my lungs. My primary use of this product is for brushing my teeth. I use it in combination with almond oil, ingredients inspired from Oramd. The original package arrived with a broken dropper,  but I received an email from a rep at Majestic Pure asking about my overall experience. They were quick to apologize about the damaged dropper, and immediately sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good oil, I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> Came fast and I really love the peppermint scent.  Use it every day on my shoulders and neck mixed with almond oil.</li>
            <li> First time buyer and I fell in love !</li>
            <li> Not happy that it says &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not for internal use&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s what &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; means!  It is a quality level fit for consumption.  If it is not fit for consumption, you should not label it therapeutic grade.</li>
            <li> This came in a 4 oz size for free* to try and review, which is a larger sized bottle for essential oils and will last me for a few months of various types of uses. My main use is in my diffuser which puts the scent into the air and makes the room I’m in smell minty. I really like the taste and smell of mint so to some this may only be a holiday scent for some people but I’m happy to use it year round. I also have allergies and chronic bronchitis so I often get chest congestion, light coughing or wheezing depending on the air quality, allergies and if I am sick with anything else. I like to use peppermint oils in the diffuser to help with this as needed when I am having issues. This is has a strong aroma and compares to other brands I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using this with sea salt and argan oil to make a therapeutic bath salt for easing aches and pains when injured or sick. It’s safe to use topically or in aroma therapy but I am unsure of it being okay for consumption. It does say it is 100% non-toxic but usually there will be something on the label or in the description mentioning if it is safe for consumption or not. If you are looking at this for using in foods such as baked goods I would try a different one just to be safe unless they update their label or description to reflect that it is indeed safe. I have purchased other ones in the past that have had this on the label, and personally use an extract unless I’m out in which case I’ve used another brand a couple of times because it’s label specified that it was safe for consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this item for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> For those of you who want to cut right to the chase, this particular product is the best therapeutic grade oil I have used. I have bought a lot of different grade  oils and have a fair idea of the value of a good product when I see/use one. I use this primarily for&lt;br /&gt;1. Using in the bath tub, few drops just add wonders in the soak tub, very refreshing&lt;br /&gt;2. Sauna / Steam room - few drops in the steam room for a very relaxing time. (Dilute with water as this is concentrated and you only need a few drops)&lt;br /&gt;3. Herbal tea - few drops in Black tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be thinking about all the use cases i have put here, but that is what is amazing about this product, you can literally use it in so many ways ways.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it for quality and value.</li>
            <li> I am new to using essential oils. I have had both good and bad experiences with them over the last year. That said, I have been learning ways to use them safely and Peppermint is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that I have no inkling of how far reaching their benefits can be, but I am having fun learning ways to use them here at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I was exposed to Peppermint Essential Oil was at a convention. I had the worse headache of my life. One of the ladies with me whipped out this bottle and started rubbing it over my forehead, temples and along the back of my neck. Wow, it smelled wonderful and was so relaxing as I sat there breathing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then... it started burning. I don&#x27;t mean getting warm, I mean my face and neck were on fire! Well, my headache was gone but I had blisters that ended up scarring my face because it was applied directly to my skin without a carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? I did a ton of research on carrier oils and use them anything I am applying essential oils on myself or my children. Disclaimer here... I know others that rub these oils directly on their skin without the reaction that I had. I think every one is different and I always explain that you need to start slow and learn about oils before you jump in and get yourself in a pickle like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, back to using Peppermint Essential Oils. First I love the smell. It makes me smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been adding it to our laundry soap recipe, cleaning products and of course aroma therapy devices. Another great use for it has been on sore muscles and those dreaded headaches. Just a drop in a couple of tablespoons of carrier oil is enough to work amazingly when massaged on sore spots or along the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably doesn&#x27;t need to be said, but please be careful to avoid getting it in your eyes. Also, used without a carrier oil may irritate your skin. The use during pregnancy is still up to debate so make sure you do your own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided to me through a discount coupon or gift card.d to me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
            <li> Although I love peppermint I recomend that if you use it for your headache to be caution with sensitive skin. I put it in and it burned on my face. I quickly had to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;However I decided to use it in a recipe and it was fantastic! The cookies turned out fabulous and everyone loved them.&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome that you can use the peppermint essential oil for so many different things if you can&#x27;t use it for one!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> suffering from motion sickness I really wanted to review this product. Its AMAZING!  Everything I had read about Peppermint oil and aromatherapy is true. Just a few drops of this on a cotton ball with the easy to use dropper, inhale ..  and I am able to enjoy long car rides with out the drowsiness. This comes in a brown jar to avoid product deterioration, and easy to use dropper, and a strong wonderful scent. 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> Great oil. Great price and really fast shipping. Only problem was my dropper was shattered when I got it. Luckily, all the tiny pieces of glass stayed in the tiny packaging so it was easy to clean up. Other than the minor damage, I&#x27;m assuming from shipping,  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product with an incredible soothing scent. I use it in a diffuser in an upstairs room and the scent slides its way down the stars.  Looking forward to checking out other essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> I had left a review, Amazon can&#x27;t seem to find it. So I&#x27;ll do it again happily because I want everyone to know that even though I tried this @discount for a review I love it!  It&#x27;s great for people who are into essential oils, but also great for so many physical issues. It helps headaches, sinus issues and a lot more. The bottle it comes in is bigger than expected and has a great glass dropper to make application easy. I will keep using this company to replace all my essential oils. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil is working beautiful.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. It&#x27;s refreshing. Originally I wanted the oil for bug repellent. I am not sure it&#x27;s working yet but I&#x27;ve used this for the headache. It does relieve the tension.</li>
            <li> works well to repel spiders, but does not last as long as i hoped</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my baths, it is a HUGE bottle and it smells amazing. So refreshing and so relaxing! When I had some stomach upset the other day it helped immensely to take a nice hot bath with a bunch of himalayan sea salt and a dropper of this. It was refreshing and amazing.</li>
            <li> Product came as described. Absolutely potent stuff! EXCELLENT customer service. I feel they went above and beyond to show they appreciate my business. I was provided documentation about this product and its uses without having to ask. Just an overall comfortable buying experience.</li>
            <li> Helps with my sinus at night. I get to have uninterrupted sleep now. Before my sinus gets so bad that I would wake up I the middle of the night with my nose non stop running and to just to blow my nose.</li>
            <li> So far from what I can tell the oil is OK. It is a big bottle. The dropper would help not spilling it when using it, unfortunately the glass dropper came broken in three pieces.&lt;br /&gt;It has now been a bit and love the oil.</li>
            <li> Although did not satisfied with amazon delivery, the product is very good. like the smell, repels insects!</li>
            <li> High quality and versatile oil. Very satisfied with this product. Hard to find this oil locally at a reasonable price and was thrilled with the pricing and shipping speed for this seller. Mixes well with other oils and base for aromatherapy uses as well as around the house for scenting. Use with eucalyptus to keep flying insects and fruit flies out of the house year round.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like peppermint. Kind of stinky.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, will be using on spiders, we usually get more in the fall after the farmers harvest, but they&#x27;ve been around this year, just not in the house!</li>
            <li> I like it, you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly impressed.  I heard you could drop peppermint oil in the corners of your rooms to keep house spiders away.  I like and use essential oils but just wanted something affordable for the spider.  But this is a nice heavy glass bottle, with a glass dropper (very carefully packaged and wrapped) and smells like 100% to me!  Hopefully it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. The peppermint scent is strong but suprisingly pleasant. It adds a nice and fresh aroma to indoor and outdoor areas. Though, I have not had it long enough to try it in multiple settings so I did not give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely.  I am very impressed.  Great scent, and a lot of oil for a very reasonable price.  Patti</li>
            <li> Made a homemade spider spray. Good product, excellent price.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure essential oil is a total scam. DISGUSTING</li>
            <li> Dropper arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and people</li>
            <li> I mainly got to rid spiders. OMG awesome. I was seeing all the time. When I do now it is already DEADDDDDD. Yeahh  I am so Happy a person that has been scared of spiders since a little girl. I did not think that I would have in my new home. I have trees all around my yard etc.Also my home smells delightful. I am going to do another round this week. So I am still on one bottle. I will be ordering more sooonnnnnn</li>
            <li> I like this scent.  Bought several different essential oils for my diffuser that I recently purchased.  Although I&#x27;ve only used this once, because I am rotating the different scents, I like the scent of it in my diffuser.  I am also looking into using this as a deterrent for the bugs/insects that come out during the summer.</li>
            <li> Amazing how well this works putting a drop on each temple for headaches (caution, do not get in eyes)&lt;br /&gt;  Very good seller</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. And helps greatly with sinus headache pain. Not to mention a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> JUST FOUND IT THE OTHER DAYLOVE IT</li>
            <li> WHEW!  This stuff is potent!  D-con wasn&#x27;t doing the job, and altho I&#x27;ve found mothballs to be an effective deterrent for mice, I didn&#x27;t want the smell of mothballs all over the house, and I didn&#x27;t want my doggie to accidentally ingest any D-Con or napthol.&lt;br /&gt;The force is strong with this one!&lt;br /&gt;Since putting a few drops at the back of my pantry shelves and the backs/bottoms of my kitchen cupboards, I&#x27;ve seen no more critter or critter-turds, and even tho the smell is strong, it dissipates enough for me to be okay with it.&lt;br /&gt;The glass dropper that comes with it, makes it easy to use, too.</li>
            <li> I received this item in order to test and review. I am a user of other (more expensive) essential oils. I wanted to see if there really was a difference between super expensive oils and super cheap oils. There is. The first thing I did was smell this oil, and though it does smell nice, it is definitely not as strong of a smell as another peppermint oil that I have. Which tells me that it must be diluted in some way. I will use the oil more for fragrance in my diffuser since the peppermint smell isn&#x27;t super over powering.</li>
            <li> Strong scent, this peppermint oil has been a god send! I use this for my migraines, and it works! So many wonderful uses for peppermint oil, I put it in my aroma therapy diffuser, and my entire room smells like peppermint. It isn&#x27;t as strong as like a candy cane scent, its very true to a mint leaf, vs that sweet peppermint smell.  I love this! sample received for review</li>
            <li> I have even wanting to try more natural products and have read great things about these oils. I suffer from headaches quite often. I mixed this with a carrier oil put some on a tissue by my pillow and dabbed a little on my temples. After taking alot if headache tablets I&#x27;m happy to say this actually helped relieve the pain. I also know peppermint oil is great for when you Get congestion so will be using it next time it&#x27;s needed.  So many uses to try out looking forward to it</li>
            <li> Strong scent! Premium indeed!</li>
            <li> Great peper mint oil. Works for nosal congestion.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use peppermint balm but find this big bottle on Amazon and there is a discount on it, so I decide to give it a try. It works. I have seasonal allergies and my nose gets congested so often. This oil works to relieve the symptoms. But somehow I do not like it so much because of the scent of the oil. I know that some people use peppermint as home fragrance but I do not like to use it that way. Other oils are  recommended for aromatherapy, such as citrus oils (smells more delightful).&lt;br /&gt;To consume such a big bottle, it might take forever if I only use it to relieve modal congest. I also mixed it with pure water in a spray bottle as insect repel spray. Works when playing outside. Hope I can use all before it goes bad.</li>
            <li> Works great for the spiders!</li>
            <li> I have only recently become interested in using essential oils for health benefits but so far I am loving it. Peppermint oil is great for so many things from easing headaches and migraines to stimulating hair growth and dandruff treatment to nausea or constipation and even for keeping away rodents and spiders. And those are just a few of the uses! It&#x27;s advised to use some kind of carrier oil if you plan to use it on your skin or it can cause irritation and/or burns. I&#x27;ve used argan oil, jojoba oil, and tea tree oil so far but have just ordered a bunch of different kinds because you can mix the different essential oils together to combine and maximize their benefits. Fractionated coconut oil is also recommended as a good carrier oil but I don&#x27;t have any on hand right now. I love the way Majestic Pure&#x27;s peppermint oil smells and the fact that it&#x27;s 100% peppermint oil with nothing else added to dilute or disrupt the product. The fact that this is therapeutic grade is also an important plus. This bottle is huge! You only need a few drops at a time and I expect this bottle to last months, or even longer depending on my usage. I&#x27;ve been using quite a few of Majestic Pure&#x27;s products for a few months now and not just their essential oils and each I&#x27;ve tried has been of extremely high quality.  I definitely recommend this brand in general but this product as well. I received this oil as a promotional item for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is based solely on my own experience after having used it.</li>
            <li> i have been using essential oils for many years, this was my first purchase from majestic pure.  i received my order promptly and the peppermint oil is of a very nice quality, the price competitive.  adding the glass dropper is a wonderful touch, as is the literature pdf - informative and helpful. i look forward to ordering majestic pure products again.</li>
            <li> Love this size of peppermint oil!  I&#x27;m new to essential oils and peppermint is one I use everyday!  Great product, with so many health benefits!  Give it try!</li>
            <li> The Peppermint Oil is indeed pure but the smell made me and my daughter sick and this is the only reason it does not get five stars. I did not know how strong it was.  It did get rid of the mice, which is a good thing. I will definitely order this product again but I will make sure to leave the house for a few hours after the application of the oil.</li>
            <li> I knew off the bat I was going to love this bottle of peppermint oil. This is one of my favorite essential oils to keep around the house. When I have a sinus congestion, I put a couple drops of the oil into my palms, rub my hand together and breath in the peppermint oil scent. It helps clear up my sinuses. Then I rub the rest of the oil behind my neck near the baseline of my hair. The oil sends this amazing, calming sensation around the back of neck, helping to elevate my headache and tension. I have also used it as fragrance spray. I add a few drops into a spray bottle with water and spray my bed sheets a couple times before bed. This is also a great spider repellent. Spray it around the doorway, window seals, or any where you may have spiders. They will run from it. They cannot stand the smell of peppermint oil. This goes the same for mice. Soak a cotton ball with the oil and place it behind your fridge, in your cabinets, or any where you might have seen mice or mice droppings and it will steer them clear. They too, cannot stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty big bottle so it will last me a while. I love that it came with a dropper so you that you can measure just the right amount that you need. Since it is oil, it&#x27;s best to keep it in a cool place and away from the sunlight or heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased to have received this at a promotional price. I highly recommend keeping this around the house at all times. So many different uses for it and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Smells and works great.</li>
            <li> Extremely Potent!  With that said I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this oil.  I take a warm bath in the evening with one single drop and it clears my sinuses and relaxes me.  I use it on my son when he is studying for a test the night before and before school.  I don&#x27;t get migraines but my husband does.  He finds that a rub behind the ears or temples is a quick relief to the normal dark room with prescription medication.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I received this at a promotional discount to try and I love it. It smells so great! I am new to using oils so not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil is amazing I actually put this directly on my air filters and the scent goes through my house every time it turns on. You do have to make sure to experiment a little to see how sensitive you are to peppermint as I have found out if I add too much I start to get a headache no one else in my house was effected though but by experimenting I have been able to find the perfect combination and it&#x27;s been wonderful.  I was able to get this product at a promotional price to give my opinions and I am 100% satisfied with it I know all essential oil is different and finding a brand that is good is very important and I can honestly say Majestic Pure is top notch!</li>
            <li> This is a nice peppermint it to scent things with, like putting in the car to keep it fresh smelling.  I tried it in a mouthwash, but this was not the flavor for that use.  Nice size bottle, nice price, helpful for things around the house.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil by Majestic Pure is the only Peppermint oil I will ever use! It is 100 % natural and pure.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil and jojoba oil for my migraines and for soothing my little ones congestion and coughs.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many fantastic uses for peppermint oil that it is an amazing thing to have on hand at all times.

I have used it in a humidifier, as a massage rub mixed with equal parts carrier oil of your choice, add some drops to your favorite foot cream for a wonderful massage, in a water bottle, add a few drops and spray around room for a refreshing scent! Its amazing the things you can do and the ailments you can use this Peppermint Oil on.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that the seller gave me additional information on ways to use the oil.</li>

            <li> I was given an opportunity to write a review for Peppermint Essential Oil purchased at a deep discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle of therapeutic grade Peppermint Essential Oil contains 4 fluid ounces. Therapeutic oils are certified as pure oils and do not contain any chemicals or fillers that cheaper oils may contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ingredient in Peppermint Essential Oil is simply 100% Pure Peppermint Oil from the peppermint plant. It provides a wonderful cooling sensation and naturally alleviates discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint is a common herb from the mint family that is ranked high for its health benefits and a distinctive flavor and aroma.

It is beneficial for headaches and nausea.  It helps indigestion and inflammation of the digestive tract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using the Peppermint Essential Oil to make delicious Peppermint Tea.  I use a few drops of the peppermint oil (instead of dried peppermint leaves), water and a choice of sweetener such as honey or sugar. Peppermint tea can be made hot or cold and yet still keeps the benefits of peppermint intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint tea is known as a “stomach healer for various stomach problems and for good digestive health. Peppermint tea helps in healing stomach cramps, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, and gallstone problems. Peppermint herbal tea promotes digestion and reduces heartburns.

            <li> Works very well as an insecticide. Gets rid of ants in the house. Have used it to eliminate carpenter bees; dose cotton with oil and stuff in many of their holes. Gone in days. AND, all without toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use the peppermint oil to help keep mice away.  Works great so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is junk compared to young living and doterra. I assume it as so many good reviews because most people haven&#x27;t had the best quality but this is a big step down and the brands I mentioned actually last just as long because a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lavender oil for years and this smells nothing like it should.  Absolutely HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Love it.  So glad I tried out essential oils.  Helps with my migraines more than any pill has so far.  I will be trying other oils from the company in the future.</li>
            <li> Product as described, great price, would buy from this vendor again</li>
            <li> Great for so many things, including waking me up in the morning....sharpens focus and alertness.  Good for getting rid of headaches too, and so many things.  This is a good quality product and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Also REALLY APPRECIATE the glass container with the dropper option, very handy!</li>
            <li> I use this for many things. Somebody mentioned that it did not work for headache. I suggest mixing it with some la endear oil. I use a couple of drop of this in a plain hair conditioner to massage the scalp or use it in my hair pack which help headaches too!</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil is absolutely amazing. It is high quality and has countless uses. It is stimulating to the senses and has a lasting effect. I personally love plug-in oil warmers but hate the cost of those expensive refills. I was given this peppermint oil to review and quality test and used it along with other essential oils and a carrier oil to make my own refills. The results were phenomenal! They were even better than the original. Being that it is 100% pure, it does not dissipate as quickly which saves me tons of money. I also added a couple of drops to my shampoo and conditioner for that nice invigorating feeling on my scalp. A little goes a long way so this 4 oz bottle will provide you with enough oil to find a use in every room of your home.</li>
            <li> I use the peppermint oil in my aromatherapy and in coconut oil for moisturizer</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with mice at one of my rentals, well the first application of mopping the floors with the peppermint a mouse ran out and just sat in the middle of the floor!  Having a positive feeling we have our problem fixed!</li>
            <li> good...I like this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product so far i&#x27;ve used it in my body butters and when taking a bath looking forward to my next order.</li>
            <li> Use for sinus pressure .Love  the smell.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Works great &amp; has excellent smell.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> Great value and very fast shipping. Pleased with purchase. I just added a few drops to my inexpensive Walmart Tea Tree body shampoo. Big improvement and very refreshing shower.</li>
            <li> The product has a soft fragrance yet seems to do the trick. I have a huge home and spiders love to visit. Sometimes there are mice in the fall. (none now) and am hoping this will help. I use it in the humidifier in my bedroom. I am sure there are other uses but unsure what all they are.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the quick service.&lt;br /&gt;Kathy Crow</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! I read that this can help with cold sores and IT&#x27;S TRUE! I def noticed a difference, and I didn&#x27;t even mind needing to reapply couple times a day because it smells so great (I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of peppermint). Next, I plan on making toothpaste with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using as aromatherapy and it really helps with a cough with a wonderful scent that fills the room.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does exactly it says and it smells wonderful. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil. It&#x27;s pleasant without being overpowering. So far I&#x27;ve only used it in an insect repellent spray (which is quite effective) but I plan to use it for personal use as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. I thought it came with a dropper since that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s shown in the picture but it doesn&#x27;t. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I bought it as insect repellent for my trip to Costa Rica. It has proven to be effective in the tropical rain forest when we hiked.</li>
            <li> LIKE IT PLENTY STRONG AND LASTING ...VERY DIFFERENT FROM THEIR YLANG YLANG...WHICH WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT</li>
            <li> I am loving the Peppermint oil by Majestic Pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This huge 4 oz bottle was a great promotional deal and there&#x27;s so many uses for this essential oil. I knew I needed to try it out in my new diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass dropper is a nice added touch of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint oil can be used to naturally deter rodents like mice from entering your home. I usually plant mint to harvest and put around our garage doors and pumphouse door to deter them, but now all I need is a few drops of this essential oil and it will also do the trick, and I will not have bunches of mint leaves scattered all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell, so relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to use this for other uses too. Just started getting into essential oils and am loving this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% money back guarantee if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially coupled with their list of uses and benefits of using the peppermint oil.  Shipping was fast and I have several friends and relatives now using it.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and the product is amazing.  Will be a repeat customer for this an other oils.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my sister in law recommended it for headaches. Just a few drops in the palm of my hand and I cup my face and breathe in, it really does take the edge off my migraines.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I use it for home, car and at work. Just little drops through out the space not only makes it smell amazing but helps get rid of spiders. They don&#x27;t like the smell of peppermint oil (and I don&#x27;t like spiders), it is too strong for them so they leave. The smell in general is very calming but yet wakes up all my senses and keeps me alert. Best smell ever.</li>
            <li> While the site above lists all sorts of uses for this oil, the bottle says external use only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use my complimentary bottle to make my own bug spray by mixing it with some water and spraying around my home so no other animals will be harmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the glass dropper that comes with this, makes it so much easier to measure, oh and reuseable!</li>
            <li> I have recently been experimenting with different essential oils and was glad when I was given the opportunity to test this one for quality.  As a frequent migraine sufferer, I am always looking for homeopathic ways to relieve them rather than relying on medication.  I put a few drops of this peppermint oil into a carrier oil (I used coconut this time) and rubbed it on my temples when I first felt a headache start.  After laying in a dark, quite, cool room for about half an hour, the headache never fully bloomed.  When one does, it can last for 8-10 hours so I will definitely be keeping this mixture in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way I like to use essential oils is to put a few drop on my sweeper bag at the place where it attaches to the machine.  When you turn on the sweeper your whole house will smell like whatever oil you put on the bag instead of the yucky stuff you have sucked up previously.  There are many other ways to use this oil including keeping mice away but I have only tried the two ways listed above.</li>
            <li> I have several essential oils from MAJESTIC PURE. The quality of their products is truly outstanding. There is a lot I need to learn about essential oils, and I am just starting. I love this peppermint oil for its fresh, clean fragrance. I have been using 5-6 drops mixed with water in a candle warmer. The fragrance is light and refreshing. I do not have an oil diffuser; I find using this in my candle warmer works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that peppermint oil is a natural deterrent for spiders and ants. When the deep freeze is over I plan to make my own remedies for the spring and summer bug season.&lt;br /&gt; I was given the opportunity to test and try this product --I was so glad I did. I highly recommend this product based on its quality.</li>
            <li> My family had stuffy nose &#x27;syndrome&#x27; and since we don&#x27;t have a diffuser, I put a pan on the stove, added a few drops of peppermint and lemon essential oils and let the steam run free in my home. In just a few minutes my nose cleared and the entire apartment was nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it in aromatherapy, I gave the peppermint oil a try on my flaky scalp. I diluted it with fractionated coconut oil and applied it on my hair, mostly on my roots and scalp. I let it stay for a few minutes and then I washed and rinsed as usually. I blow dried my hair since the cooling sensation on my scalp was quite strong. Although I still noticed dandruff on my hair after this process, I also noticed that my scalp started to heal and the dandruff was significantly less after one time use.</li>
            <li> The product works so well with the recipes I have - great!!!!</li>
            <li> This is motivation in a bottle, a couple of drops of this in a diffuser are amazing. I have also put a couple of drops in the Sensy wax burner. It is perfect in that as well. I also put a couple of drops in my water. Tasted perfect.</li>
            <li> Love my peppermint oil it is doing it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> I recently sprained my ankle and hand, in a fall.  After visiting an orthopedic doctor that &amp;#34;isnt into narcotics&amp;#34; even after knowing I cannot take anything for inflammation, I was sitting here in major pain the other night and decided to try making my own rub to relieve some of the swelling and pain.  I&#x27;d been icing all day to no avail.  I mixed some peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil with a carrier of coconut oil.  In all honesty, it didnt do much for my ankle, I didnt even feel the coolness of it, but my sprained hand was relieved and I could feel the coolness/heat.  Maybe ankle was a little too far gone for it to help, but I love how the soreness in my hand had relief.  I&#x27;ll definitely be trying more &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; later.  The aromatherapy of it was very soothing too!</li>
            <li> Package was delivered quickly. Product smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Receive product and it&#x27;s contents had leaked throughout the shipping box. Had to return</li>
            <li> Humongous! Love the dropper as well. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you--great product fast delivery.</li>
