            <li>I love the way it feels, the way it tastes, the way it looks on... but can&#x27;t stand the container</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable even though everyone I know thinks its a nipple</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s adorable.</li>

            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>I love mostly the cuteness of Korean products.</li>
            <li>Their packaging is always adorable and the product quality even better.</li>
            <li>Pretty much all of their lip balms and lotions smell wonderful hit</li>

            <li>It smells super nice</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quick, was accurate and smelled great</li>
            <li>Its really strong and smells like a processed peach.</li>
            <li>my gosh, you NEED to smell this!&amp;#34;), and it moistens your lips so nicely.</li>
            <li>it looks cute sitting on my table but the moisture wears off quick &amp; the taste is too perfumey for my liking.</li>
            <li>My friend brought this from Korea as a gift I loved it so much was lucky to find it here.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot actually, the smell is great</li>
            <li>This lip balm smells amazing and is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I also received a free face mask with the package.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and also it does smooth my lips.</li>
            <li>Also, it took more than one finger&#x27;s worth of balm to spread it all on my bottom lip.</li>
            <li>My main reason for buying it is how awesome it smells, like an actual peach.</li>
            <li>üçë perfect little peach!</li>
            <li>not only is it adorable but it smells sooo good and tastes even better, also it makes my lips super soft</li>
            <li>It does smell like sweet peaches but it doesn&#x27;t taste like it.</li>
            <li>REALLY PEACHY, CUTE CASE.</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss!It feels great lasts a long time on the lips,light sweet taste if you like peaches as much as i do ;) 5 star</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super hydrating or any sort of miracle product, but I like it nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a great little lip balm,</li>
            <li>totally worth it.</li>
            <li>leaves me lips so soft, and all my friends absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>A bit smaller than I expected, but very cute and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>So far works fine.</li>
            <li>It moisturized, and smells exactly like peaches.</li>
            <li>but the hand cream probably looks a lot more like a peach than this, the smaller version.</li>
            <li>This even came with extra gifts which was extremely lovely.</li>
            <li>comes off on your fingers when you rub it, but it&#x27;s tasty and cute and works well enough.</li>
            <li>These are enough for me:)</li>
            <li>This has a very high quality smell, and a very cute but suggestive looking container (pimple, boob, your pick other than a peach).</li>
            <li>Not only is it cute but it smells really g</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised about the size which is the size of a gum ball, but the smell is amazing, just like peaches!</li>
            <li>and it makes my lips super soft.</li>
            <li>It has the sweetest little peach scent (as in, the kind that you share with everyone because &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not as inhibited as I am (or as my friend says &amp;#34;dirty minded&amp;#34;), then I highly recommend this gloss.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The balm lasts for quite a while, and I found it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Super cute, and you can take it on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very small with not a lot of product though.</li>
            <li>I highly highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recieved the item BROKEN and though the item smells good, it tastes like nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Well it is easy to get dust in, and you do need to wash your hand before you poke a finger into it and spread the balm on your lips, which is kind of inconvenient.</li>
            <li>Goes on as a clear gloss, and it smells just like peaches!</li>
            <li>As far as lip balms go it&#x27;s not mind blowing.</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin i would beware</li>
            <li>And it makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m giving four stars is that I don&#x27;t really like how the lip balm is in the peach in a way that you have to use your finger to get it out</li>
            <li>and it makes my lips extremely soft without making them sticky</li>
            <li>Seriously sooo cute, I bought the lotion version of this also.</li>
            <li>The shine doesn&#x27;t last near as long as the smell, but then again I don&#x27;t know many lip balms that have a long lasting shine.</li>
            <li>so honestly you just can&#x27;t go wrong with this unless you don&#x27;t like peaches...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is probably a personal feeling - but... there is no other way of saying this...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on for long and it doesn&#x27;t leave my lips soft like others do.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on for long and it doesn&#x27;t leave my lips soft like others do.</li>
            <li> this seriously smells like fresh peaches</li>
            <li> The color goes on clear and has a slight gloss to it.</li>
            <li> The container is a little hard to scoop the balm out of, but it&#x27;s not impossible.</li>
            <li> If you have long nails, forget about using your finger, you might have to just use a lip brush.</li>
            <li> kind of hard to get on because the lip balm is so hard and very little</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my lips felt like they were drying out just a little while later, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt help me with my dry lips at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Although the price is not cheap.. it is smaller than how it looks on picture..</li>
            <li> other than that they work and smell like yummy peaches</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of moisturizing effect but not much.</li>
            <li> just average lip balm.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Even more so when you&#x27;re hold the lid separately from the base.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pretty artificial.</li>
            <li> It takes a few dabs around the lips to get it fully coated and it needs to be redone after a couple hours as your typical lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cutest little thing.</li>
            <li> Dried out my lips</li>
            <li> Even thought the balm a fairly small</li>
            <li> It taste like a perfume, it&#x27;s not very good at all.</li>
            <li> The product is hard to get out</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Just wish it didn&#x27;t take a month to ship from Korea. :(</li>

            <li> This is my favorite lip balm that I own, I keep it with me all the time.  It smells so good, exactly like peaches!  The packaging sort of resembles a peach, but it isn&#x27;t blaringly obvious.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with it--I think it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my friends Christmas gift and she loved it! I may buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> As far as lip balms go it&#x27;s not mind blowing. The consistency is a bit more sticky so it doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel moisturized although it does keep them from getting chapped. My main reason for buying it is how awesome it smells, like an actual peach. Pretty much all of their lip balms and lotions smell wonderful hit this was my favorite.</li>
            <li> Good product. Was as described. Daughter pleased with this.</li>
            <li> now this is my favorite lip balm!!</li>
            <li> My friend loves it! I gave it to her as a gift! :)</li>
            <li> Great product. It moisturized, and smells exactly like peaches. Super cute, and you can take it on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very small with not a lot of product though. But it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
            <li> Great fruity smell and super cute packaging.</li>
            <li> Cutest little thing. I was a little surprised about the size which is the size of a gum ball, but the smell is amazing, just like peaches! I really like it.</li>
            <li> This chapstick is not as great as it seems. The container looks like a nipple. The product is hard to get out and you have to use your finger. If you have long nails, forget about using your finger, you might have to just use a lip brush. It does smell like sweet peaches but it doesn&#x27;t taste like it. It taste like a perfume, it&#x27;s not very good at all. It has a little bit of moisturizing effect but not much. It doesn&#x27;t stay on for long and it doesn&#x27;t leave my lips soft like others do. The color goes on clear and has a slight gloss to it.</li>
            <li> Goes on as a clear gloss, and it smells just like peaches!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot actually, the smell is great and so is the flavor and stuff but it looks more like a nipple rather than a peach- I don&#x27;t know if its the shape, the coloring or just everything but the hand cream probably looks a lot more like a peach than this, the smaller version.</li>
            <li> I had to give this away.  It looked like I was carrying a nipple around.</li>
            <li> just average lip balm. The scent is pretty artificial.</li>
            <li> This lip balm smells amazing and is really moisturizing. I like it on its own or over lipsticks that are drying. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li> I recieved the item BROKEN and though the item smells good, it tastes like nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> bought this with the Tony Moly Peach anti aging handcream. Love Tony Moly, love the packaging, love the product. Lovely smell.</li>
            <li> This is the peachiest peach scented/flavored thing I&#x27;ve ever found aside from an actual peach. Plus it&#x27;s a great little lip balm, so honestly you just can&#x27;t go wrong with this unless you don&#x27;t like peaches... in which case, why are you even looking at this product?</li>
            <li> i got this in the mail and the look of it was a lil off lol. BUT the smell and the taste was just like a peach. the only problem was that after a day or two of using it i started breaking out in blisters and lil pimple like things on my lips. so i stopped using it and it went away. so if you have sensitive skin i would beware</li>
            <li> üçë perfect little peach! Tonymoly shut up and take my money! Adorable packaging, the products smells amazeballs like fresh peaches!!! Now I must order the cherry and blueberry for my daughterS! I.ove with TM will order more!</li>
            <li> I like the peach flavor!  And it makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than I expected, but very cute and smells amazing. The container is a little hard to scoop the balm out of, but it&#x27;s not impossible. The balm lasts for quite a while, and I found it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Seriously sooo cute, I bought the lotion version of this also. This even came with extra gifts which was extremely lovely. It smells really good also. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving four stars is that I don&#x27;t really like how the lip balm is in the peach in a way that you have to use your finger to get it out but besides that and if you don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> They are moisturizing. ... and they do look like nipples lol.... other than that they work and smell like yummy peaches</li>
            <li> Okay, I love the look of the jar, smells good &amp; it looks cute sitting on my table but the moisture wears off quick &amp; the taste is too perfumey for my liking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this stuff is actually moisturizing my lips, but it smells great and thats all I need! The shine doesn&#x27;t last near as long as the smell, but then again I don&#x27;t know many lip balms that have a long lasting shine.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm, love it. REALLY PEACHY, CUTE CASE. Just wish it didn&#x27;t take a month to ship from Korea. :(</li>
            <li> I love this balm it slides on very nicely into lips and it smells so good and strong. Even thought the balm a fairly small I love the appearance the smell and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> i got it form my friend and she cannot stop using it. Its really strong and smells like a processed peach.</li>
            <li> Nice light tint, its o.k.</li>
            <li> My friend brought this from Korea as a gift I loved it so much was lucky to find it here.</li>
            <li> I highly highly highly recommend this product. This is literally the cutest thing ever. Not only is it cute but it smells really g</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. Taste more like perfume.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels, the way it tastes, the way it looks on... but can&#x27;t stand the container it&#x27;s in... Doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is probably a personal feeling - but... there is no other way of saying this... it looks like a boob.  Even more so when you&#x27;re hold the lid separately from the base.  You may not think so, of course.  I always find myself trying to hide the lid when I put it on, not wanting to cause car accidents of cars passing by, if they were to see me putting this on while driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not as inhibited as I am (or as my friend says &amp;#34;dirty minded&amp;#34;), then I highly recommend this gloss.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING I WANTED AND MORE!!! I have been lusting after Tony Moly products forever, and so I caved and got the peach lip balm and its perfect. Its cute is smells/tastes great, it keeps my lips soft forever. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It smells super nice but it doesnt help me with my dry lips at all. It tastes like vegetable oil to me.</li>
            <li> Super cute! kind of hard to get on because the lip balm is so hard and very little comes off on your fingers when you rub it, but it&#x27;s tasty and cute and works well enough.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and it makes my lips super soft. The packaging is adorable even though everyone I know thinks its a nipple</li>
            <li> okay I bought this because tonymoly is amazing. this seriously smells like fresh peaches it&#x27;s adorable. ANNNDD it&#x27;s moisturizing and somehow makes your lips look fantastic?! guys, it&#x27;s like a dollar. totally worth it. I&#x27;m tellin&#x27; ya- buy two and give one as a gift. :D</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, and it arrived a couple weeks before it was supposed to! I also received a free face mask with the package. Thank you. 5/5 would order from here again</li>
            <li> Tony Moly has cute stuff. This lip balm is supposed to be peach scented but it smells like grapefruit, very strongly too.</li>
            <li> Does not look like a peach!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and also it does smooth my lips. So far works fine. Although the price is not cheap.. it is smaller than how it looks on picture..</li>
            <li> Adorable, yet suggestive package. Dried out my lips and it&#x27;s hard to get out. Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> This has a very high quality smell, and a very cute but suggestive looking container (pimple, boob, your pick other than a peach). It takes a few dabs around the lips to get it fully coated and it needs to be redone after a couple hours as your typical lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a sample of another TONYMOLY product.</li>
            <li> not only is it adorable but it smells sooo good and tastes even better, also it makes my lips super soft and i love it</li>
            <li> I love mostly the cuteness of Korean products. Tonymoly is always tops in that respect. Their packaging is always adorable and the product quality even better. I have tried a lot of peach scented/flavored skin and body care and this is the BEST Peach Scent. I will definitely be re-upping on this product once it is gone. I have all Tonymoly&#x27;s peach items and love them all!! As for staying power you have to reapply often but it doesn&#x27;t lose any points with me, that&#x27;s just how the majority of novelty flavored lip balms are.</li>
            <li> Well it is easy to get dust in, and you do need to wash your hand before you poke a finger into it and spread the balm on your lips, which is kind of inconvenient. But oh my god oh my god it smells so sweet and perfect and it looks so cuuute! These are enough for me:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected but it smells great and it makes my lips extremely soft without making them sticky üíû</li>
            <li> leaves me lips so soft, and all my friends absolutely love the smell. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quick, was accurate and smelled great</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss!It feels great lasts a long time on the lips,light sweet taste if you like peaches as much as i do ;) 5 star</li>
            <li> love how its a cute bottle, smells great and strong and moisurizes your lips</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today, and oh my GOD, someone needs to keep this away from me or I&#x27;ll use it all up in a week. It has the sweetest little peach scent (as in, the kind that you share with everyone because &amp;#34;oh my gosh, you NEED to smell this!&amp;#34;), and it moistens your lips so nicely. The only downside is that my lips felt like they were drying out just a little while later, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay for long. Also, it took more than one finger&#x27;s worth of balm to spread it all on my bottom lip. The peach scent is to die for, though, which is why I&#x27;m still giving this five stars.</li>
            <li> Product is very glossy and smells wonderful.  It isn&#x27;t super hydrating or any sort of miracle product, but I like it nonetheless.</li>
