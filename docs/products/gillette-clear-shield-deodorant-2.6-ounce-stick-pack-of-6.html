            <li>This is a very good Gillette product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great scent too.</li>
            <li>A great compromise of a sticky roll-on and clumpy stick.</li>
            <li>but I find it pleasant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Burberry London is easily the best out of all these.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good product</li>
            <li>No, I wont be changing over but it was a good</li>
            <li>Does it smell good??  </li>
            <li>-- they give you a fair sized stick of it.  </li>
            <li>A buddy let me smell his deodorant once and it smelled like a really good cologne.  </li>
            <li>but it also smells really good too.  </li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>A very good stick that is easy in application and seems effective in odor and moisture control.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Mitchum kind of guy</li>
            <li>My step daughter told me the very first day, You smell good!  </li>
            <li>It works well and does have a nice odor.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, you can&#x27;t get too picky over your Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, works well.</li>
            <li>Nice work</li>
            <li>but this does a nice job and does not pull hair.    </li>
            <li>Nicely done.</li>
            <li>, a very attractive young lady told me I smelled \\&quot;yummy\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>It smells good, but not overpowering like some cheap brands.</li>
            <li>But as for being \\&quot;shirt friendly\\&quot;, I&#x27;m not so sure.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the scent.  </li>
            <li>but they need to moisten the deodorant for better results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Anti-perspirant ability: 3 stars&lt;</li>
            <li>If you have an excess of perspiration in your arm pits, this is going to do a better job than most others.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I gave it one more</li>
            <li>Many (but not all)</li>
            <li>Although I am rating the item 4 stars like most</li>
            <li>Ok, first to be fair</li>
            <li>It works well, lasts all day, and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good</li>
            <li>But best of all, it works all day long.</li>
            <li>Many seem to complain about the strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the best part of this deodorant, and this may just be a coincidence, but the very first day I used it</li>
            <li>I find it not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong.</li>
            <li>It smelled kind of funny</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t lasting, nor impressive the first time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Ok, first off -- I&#x27;ll admit it -- I&#x27;ve tried most deodorants and anti-perspirants on the shelf at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>But it seems to work fine anyway.</li>
            <li>It rolls on like any other deodorant, and smells very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because it is smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave clumps or break apart.</li>
            <li>Lastly, there was zero residue in my shirt, which is a great advantage to this product.  </li>
            <li>Light smell.  </li>
            <li>The claims of be shirt friendly and going on cleanly are also accurate.</li>
            <li>Shirt friendly.  </li>
            <li>It actually worked for me, Which was amazing considering most Non-Clinical Strength Antiperspirants</li>
            <li>too good actually.  </li>
            <li>Rarely do I find myself disagreeing with the reviews significantly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and have purchase it again and again!!!</li>
            <li>It rolls on clear and does not run at all which is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the light, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an effective anti-antiperspirant and it&#x27;s shirt-friendly (though not totally invisible).</li>
            <li>Simply, I didn&#x27;t find the product all that effective --  </li>
            <li>nice thing about this product I definitely noticed</li>
            <li>I think they got it right.</li>
            <li>The smell is rather pleasant and not very strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, though the smell is obvious but better than the alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this item is no longer sold in wal-mart or anywhere else as far as I can fine.  </li>
            <li>It was funny, but not what I was looking for in an anti persperant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to stop the perspiration if I get hot, e.g. in a hot car.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant works exactly as you would expect it too.  </li>
            <li>little strong for me, but not a terrible smell</li>
            <li>I always like to read the other reviews before posting my own.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean scent and very few marks on my shirts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a thought of</li>
            <li>Most Clinical Strength Antiperspirants are a hassle to wash off of your underarms because it&#x27;s stuck like glue, which is why it lasts so long.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely reccomend this doedorant to people who plan on being active as it seemed to have a very strong drying presence.</li>
            <li>Gillette Clear Shield bills itself as \\&quot;shirt friendly\\&quot;, and so far my shirts appear to be free of stains, clumps, or smears.  </li>
            <li>That said, in my opinion their are 4 areas to judge when it comes to a really thorough review of an Anti-perspirant/Deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on smooth without clumping -- no white residue!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t protect as much as I&#x27;d like it to, leaves a film I don&#x27;t like, and can sometimes be too odorous.</li>
            <li>The deodorant sticks on very well...</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as some of the others on the market, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>I thought this deo stick is much drier than most of the other ones in the market.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth $5-6 a stick, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried Gillette Clear Shield it seemed normal.  </li>
            <li>Those are the main things I expect from an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>A decent deodorant.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it keeps you dry and smelling good!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant but not strong fragrance, it has a soft, powder-like texture but is not chalky and it seems to last.</li>
            <li>As far as wetness and odor protection go, this product works very well.</li>
            <li>I perspire normally, so</li>
            <li>I think I may have found a new Antiperspirant</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of dress shirts to work, so I&#x27;m very conscious of underarm stains.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I cannot say that it is better or worse than Right Guard and my buying decision between the two would be based solely on price per ounce.</li>
            <li>Essentially, it is just a product that does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>I also found the smell a little too strong at times.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this new Gillette product, as it seems to be the first deo that actually delivers.</li>
            <li>I like the anti- perspirants / deodorant combo, but in this case I found the anti- perspirants a little less effective than I needed, and the deodorant a little more than</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Clear Shield\\&quot; has a bit less of the same active ingredient that you&#x27;ll find in most other antiperspirants and a warning that if you use too much it won&#x27;t be \\&quot;clear\\&quot; any more.</li>
            <li>Gillette Clear Shield Deodorant, Arctic Ice does what says.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Clear Shield works for me.</li>
            <li>No problems with Gillette Clear Shield.</li>
            <li>I have another deodorant that is also supposed to be clear</li>
            <li>:B0028K3IZY Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice Antiperspirant/Deodorant]] Worked wonders.     </li>
            <li>B0028K3IZY Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice Antiperspirant/Deodorant]]</li>
            <li>The real benefit is that it doesn&#x27;t go on white and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re telling me that i Have to keep the protective plastic underneath the cover fixed all the time, you gotta be kidding.</li>
            <li>In this case, though, I really wasn&#x27;t a big fan.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that claim the product leaves a flaky white residue -- I imagine those reviewers are just using too much product.</li>
            <li>Wearing it throughout the day kept me dry and odor-free, doing exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li>It is fresh smelling and works as well as any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But this Clear Shield product has it in it but does not irritate my skin, so either I&#x27;ve changed or it was because of other ingredients in Right Guard.</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day, but not strong enough to last 8-hours in the office plus 2-hours in the gym.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need major protection.</li>
            <li>I would sweat right through it, where I wouldn&#x27;t with other similar products.  </li>
            <li>generally like the Gillette products.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Clear Shield&#x27;s \\&quot;low residue technology\\&quot; seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white but goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>Still, if gels aren&#x27;t your type of thing, I guess you could give this Gillette Clear Shield Deodorant a try, but this just isn&#x27;t for me personally.</li>
            <li>Although the stick is white in color, it glides on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I used Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice for YEARS and couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks since I last used it, and I still can&#x27;t wash it completely off.  </li>
            <li>After using this deodorant for a few weeks now, I can say it&#x27;s much better than the typical white stick.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve been using antiperspirant gel for so long, but I just didn&#x27;t dig this Clear Shield Deodorant from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I have been using and I order this particular type from online due to the fact that I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I avoided Gillette&#x27;s Right Guard products because when I sweated it irritated my skin.</li>

            <li> I like the anti- perspirants / deodorant combo, but in this case I found the anti- perspirants a little less effective than I needed, and the deodorant a little more than</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Clear Shield\\&quot; has a bit less of the same active ingredient that you&#x27;ll find in most other antiperspirants and a warning that if you use too much it won&#x27;t be \\&quot;clear\\&quot; any more.</li>
            <li> Gillette Clear Shield Deodorant, Arctic Ice does what says.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Clear Shield works for me.</li>
            <li> No problems with Gillette Clear Shield.</li>
            <li> I have another deodorant that is also supposed to be clear</li>

            <li> The real benefit is that it doesn&#x27;t go on white and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re telling me that i Have to keep the protective plastic underneath the cover fixed all the time, you gotta be kidding.</li>
            <li> In this case, though, I really wasn&#x27;t a big fan.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that claim the product leaves a flaky white residue -- I imagine those reviewers are just using too much product.</li>
            <li> Wearing it throughout the day kept me dry and odor-free, doing exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li> It is fresh smelling and works as well as any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But this Clear Shield product has it in it but does not irritate my skin, so either I&#x27;ve changed or it was because of other ingredients in Right Guard.</li>
            <li> It lasts most of the day, but not strong enough to last 8-hours in the office plus 2-hours in the gym.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need major protection.</li>
            <li> I would sweat right through it, where I wouldn&#x27;t with other similar products.  </li>
            <li> generally like the Gillette products.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Clear Shield&#x27;s \\&quot;low residue technology\\&quot; seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white but goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> Still, if gels aren&#x27;t your type of thing, I guess you could give this Gillette Clear Shield Deodorant a try, but this just isn&#x27;t for me personally.</li>
            <li> Although the stick is white in color, it glides on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I used Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice for YEARS and couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks since I last used it, and I still can&#x27;t wash it completely off.  </li>
            <li> After using this deodorant for a few weeks now, I can say it&#x27;s much better than the typical white stick.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve been using antiperspirant gel for so long, but I just didn&#x27;t dig this Clear Shield Deodorant from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I have been using and I order this particular type from online due to the fact that I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I avoided Gillette&#x27;s Right Guard products because when I sweated it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this product from Amazon&#x27;s Vine program and unlike the gel, which can be gooey and sticky, this is a hard \\&quot;stick\\&quot; type of deodorant like Right Guard stick.</li>
            <li> But this particular Gillete Clear Shield Deodorant is my least favourite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little sensitive to  odors and a lot of perfumes and deodorants are usually too over-bearing for me, but this one is just right.  </li>
            <li> I found it pretty hard to \\&quot;roll over\\</li>
            <li> Though it states \\&quot;Clear Shield\\&quot;, it still leaves a noticable enough marking on my black t-shirts,</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t really care for the scent, and would prefer an unscented version.</li>
            <li> also found that this product leaves a weird film, which doesn&#x27;t easily wash off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always cautious with stick deodorants as some white streak undoubtedly pops out somewhere no matter how carefully I put my shirt on.</li>
            <li> A minor issue but one I am reminded of each morning.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the fragrance overpowering, but as we well know, the sense of smell is extremely subjective, so reviews are likely to be all over the map on that point.</li>
            <li> A little about me:  big guy -- 6&#x27;1\\&quot;, normal-hairy, and definitely sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wear cologne or perfume, then it might not be an issue for you, but this product will definitely clash with other scents.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry and remains dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets dry within it&#x27;s packaging and that defeats the soul purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li> Usually the other reviews merely validate my own opinion.  </li>
            <li> other products like this don&#x27;t leave this sort of residue, or at least not as much as this one does.  </li>
            <li> I wear a lot of dark shirts, and I found that the dreaded white marks are minimal.</li>
            <li> Previously the only Gillette Deodorant I found was a gel 6 pack sold at [...].</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this.  </li>

            <li> I like wearing dark blue or black clothes, except in scorching summer weather.  </li>
            <li> In this case, I think the product would last a little longer than average.  </li>
            <li> Depending on what you wear, it could even overpower other scents.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to choosing it because I generally use Clinical Strength due to my excessive sweating    </li>
            <li> I regularly find in the shower that it&#x27;s still slick / hair matted from where I applied the product previously.  </li>
            <li> I do find the reasons for complaint or praise are different from myself and my fellow reviewers.    </li>
            <li> From Axe to Old Spice to Ban to Secret...</li>

            <li> Not much to say about this.  It works well, lasts all day, and smells pretty good.  But as for being \\&quot;shirt friendly\\&quot;, I&#x27;m not so sure.  I should qualify this statement by saying I wear black shirts, almost exclusively.  I did find white residue on my shirts after using this product.  If you wear lighter colored clothes, you might not notice.</li>
            <li> Gillette Clear Shield Deodorant, Arctic Ice does what says.  The deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the scent.  It smelled kind of funny and this is a big turn off for me.  I guess I;m not that big of a fan of the Arctic Ice scent.  If you are then you&#x27;ll want to grab one.  But if you don&#x27;t like the smell then you&#x27;re going to have a problem with it.  it&#x27;s good product and I recommend it because it makes a promise and it delivers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always cautious with stick deodorants as some white streak undoubtedly pops out somewhere no matter how carefully I put my shirt on. After using this deodorant for a few weeks now, I can say it&#x27;s much better than the typical white stick. I&#x27;ve noticed random white marks on my shirts, but very minor and sporadic. It&#x27;s got a great scent too. Not sure it&#x27;s worth $5-6 a stick, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Mitchum kind of guy but I gave this a shot. It&#x27;s not bad, though the smell is obvious but better than the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lift weights and practice martial arts so I work up some serious sweat. It&#x27;s always worked and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I haven&#x27;t noticed any obvious signs on my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll get it whenever the store is out of Mitchum.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave clumps or break apart. It is fresh smelling and works as well as any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. A great compromise of a sticky roll-on and clumpy stick. I will be switching to this item.</li>
            <li> Ok, first to be fair I have used Mitchum for years and will never change. But this product made me think that life will not end if I cant get Mitchum.  My step daughter told me the very first day, You smell good!  It was funny, but not what I was looking for in an anti persperant.  It works well and does have a nice odor. No, I wont be changing over but it was a good product.[[ASIN:B001EWEP04 Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Power Gel, Mountain Air, 3.4 oz (96 g) (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> When looking for a deodorant and anti-perspirant, I want DEPENDABLE!&lt;br /&gt;No way I want my deodorant to let me down! (Ewww). With Gillete, you don&#x27;t have to worry! (Whew, one of life&#x27;s problems solved, eh?) Seriously, it keeps you dry and smelling good! Not to mention you don&#x27;t end up with deodorant stains 3 seconds after you put on a shirt!  I highly recommend it and have purchase it again and again!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this deo stick is much drier than most of the other ones in the market. I found it pretty hard to \\&quot;roll over\\&quot; my under arms because of the dryness. The smell is pretty good but they need to moisten the deodorant for better results.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Clear Shield&#x27;s \\&quot;low residue technology\\&quot; seems to work well.  I wear a lot of dark shirts, and I found that the dreaded white marks are minimal. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t really care for the scent, and would prefer an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I received this roll on deodorant through Amazon&#x27;s Vine program, and decided to give it a try.  It rolls on like any other deodorant, and smells very pleasant.  Wearing it throughout the day kept me dry and odor-free, doing exactly what it should do.  It rolls on clear and does not run at all which is very comfortable.  Lastly, there was zero residue in my shirt, which is a great advantage to this product.  I would absolutely reccomend this doedorant to people who plan on being active as it seemed to have a very strong drying presence.</li>
            <li> Lets face it - the vast majority of deodorants suck -they either work for no more than an hour, or they go on poorly.    I was pleasantly surprised by this new Gillette product, as it seems to be the first deo that actually delivers. It smells good, but not overpowering like some cheap brands. It goes on feeling dry, without giving you the horrible feeling that some gel products do. But best of all, it works all day long. Essentially, it is just a product that does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Finally they have come up with a deodorant that won&#x27;t leave white marks on your shirts. Smells great and seems to do what it says!! That makes it a winner in my book!</li>
            <li> In the past, I avoided Gillette&#x27;s Right Guard products because when I sweated it irritated my skin. I thought it was the aluminum chlorohydrate, so I avoided all deodorants with that ingredient. But this Clear Shield product has it in it but does not irritate my skin, so either I&#x27;ve changed or it was because of other ingredients in Right Guard. At any rate, it works for me. I actually like this deodorant a lot. It has a pleasant but not strong fragrance, it has a soft, powder-like texture but is not chalky and it seems to last. I think they got it right. I&#x27;ll probably buy another stick after this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week now and I have been very pleased.  Let&#x27;s be honest, you can&#x27;t get too picky over your Deodorant.  It&#x27;s pretty much a thought of Does it smell good??  That said, in my opinion their are 4 areas to judge when it comes to a really thorough review of an Anti-perspirant/Deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Anti-perspirant ability: 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to stop the perspiration if I get hot, e.g. in a hot car.  No perspiration when doing daily work in the office.  If you have an excess of perspiration in your arm pits, this is going to do a better job than most others.  The real benefit is that it doesn&#x27;t go on white and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Odor protection: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;All I can smell is this stuff - no odor is getting through this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Scent: 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;A little strong for me, but not a terrible smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Application: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth without clumping -- no white residue!</li>
            <li> Previously the only Gillette Deodorant I found was a gel 6 pack sold at [...]. We got a sample of this product from Amazon&#x27;s Vine program and unlike the gel, which can be gooey and sticky, this is a hard \\&quot;stick\\&quot; type of deodorant like Right Guard stick. It goes on dry and remains dry. Frankly, I cannot say that it is better or worse than Right Guard and my buying decision between the two would be based solely on price per ounce.</li>
            <li> Tried this stuff out. Works fine. Gave me all day protection. No stains on t-shirts either. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert but I have five different brands of deodorants which gives me what I think is a bit of a say in these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So lets see. I use Axe, Burberry London, some random sticks I picked from Duane Reed and Body Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burberry London is easily the best out of all these. But this particular Gillete Clear Shield Deodorant is my least favourite. I would definitely not buy another one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets dry within it&#x27;s packaging and that defeats the soul purpose of the product. If you&#x27;re telling me that i Have to keep the protective plastic underneath the cover fixed all the time, you gotta be kidding. It wasn&#x27;t lasting, nor impressive the first time I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;ve used it about four times and I&#x27;ve hidden it somewhere in a compartment in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple. Gillette Clear Shield works for me. It&#x27;s an effective anti-antiperspirant and it&#x27;s shirt-friendly (though not totally invisible). I don&#x27;t find the fragrance overpowering, but as we well know, the sense of smell is extremely subjective, so reviews are likely to be all over the map on that point.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried Gillette Clear Shield it seemed normal.  However, after taking a shower it left a sticky feeling and would not wash off.  I gave it one more try the next morning, with the same results.  It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks since I last used it, and I still can&#x27;t wash it completely off.  Needless to say, it won&#x27;t be used again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good Gillette product. Smells nice, works well. I&#x27;ve got absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Ok, first off -- I&#x27;ll admit it -- I&#x27;ve tried most deodorants and anti-perspirants on the shelf at the pharmacy. From Axe to Old Spice to Ban to Secret... you name it, chances are I&#x27;ve tried it.  A little about me:  big guy -- 6&#x27;1\\&quot;, normal-hairy, and definitely sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally like the Gillette products.  In this case, though, I really wasn&#x27;t a big fan.  Simply, I didn&#x27;t find the product all that effective --  I would sweat right through it, where I wouldn&#x27;t with other similar products.  I also found the smell a little too strong at times.  I like the anti- perspirants / deodorant combo, but in this case I found the anti- perspirants a little less effective than I needed, and the deodorant a little more than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that this product leaves a weird film, which doesn&#x27;t easily wash off.  I regularly find in the shower that it&#x27;s still slick / hair matted from where I applied the product previously.  Not particularly cool.  Many (but not all) other products like this don&#x27;t leave this sort of residue, or at least not as much as this one does.  My 2-cents at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing about this product I definitely noticed -- they give you a fair sized stick of it.  I hate spending $3-4 on a stick of this stuff and running out shortly after.  In this case, I think the product would last a little longer than average.  Nice work Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this product again.  I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as some of the others on the market, at least for me.  It doesn&#x27;t protect as much as I&#x27;d like it to, leaves a film I don&#x27;t like, and can sometimes be too odorous.</li>
            <li> Gillette Clear Shield bills itself as \\&quot;shirt friendly\\&quot;, and so far my shirts appear to be free of stains, clumps, or smears.  I really like the light, fresh scent.  It keeps me dry.  Those are the main things I expect from an anti-perspirant.  I wear a lot of dress shirts to work, so I&#x27;m very conscious of underarm stains.  No problems with Gillette Clear Shield.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Clear Shield\\&quot; has a bit less of the same active ingredient that you&#x27;ll find in most other antiperspirants and a warning that if you use too much it won&#x27;t be \\&quot;clear\\&quot; any more. Apparently, it achieves clearness by cutting down on anti-perspirant-ness. But it seems to work fine anyway. The scent is a bit clinical but I haven&#x27;t noticed it to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I always like to read the other reviews before posting my own.  Usually the other reviews merely validate my own opinion.  Rarely do I find myself disagreeing with the reviews significantly.  Although I am rating the item 4 stars like most I do find the reasons for complaint or praise are different from myself and my fellow reviewers.    Pros:  1.  Light smell.  Many seem to complain about the strong smell.  I find it not too strong.  Maybe this is my nose not working but I find it pleasant.  2.  Shirt friendly.  I have seen a few reviewers complain about the shirt staining.  I recommend you change detergent.  I have never had a problem with staining of shirts or even residue during the day.  3.  Glides well for a non-gel stick.  I like the application of gels but this does a nice job and does not pull hair.    Cons:    1.  The mix is so water repellent that washing it off in the shower is a bit of a pain.  A minor issue but one I am reminded of each morning.    A very good stick that is easy in application and seems effective in odor and moisture control.  Nicely done.</li>
            <li> Im not sure why but this item is no longer sold in wal-mart or anywhere else as far as I can fine.  A buddy let me smell his deodorant once and it smelled like a really good cologne.  Ever since (a couple of years later) I have been using and I order this particular type from online due to the fact that I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  This works well as a deodorant but it also smells really good too.  Best deodorant ever!</li>
            <li> A decent deodorant. Nice clean scent and very few marks on my shirts. It lasts most of the day, but not strong enough to last 8-hours in the office plus 2-hours in the gym. I&#x27;m moving back to Degree.</li>
            <li> I like wearing dark blue or black clothes, except in scorching summer weather.  I&#x27;ve noticed in the past that my shirts would be just plain white under the arms.  After trying this product for a week, there was no white residue on my shirts.  It&#x27;s white but goes on clear.  I have another deodorant that is also supposed to be clear but it never has been, at least this product performs as advertised.  And it also works well as an antiperspirant and deodorant.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0028K3IZY Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice Antiperspirant/Deodorant]] Worked wonders.     I was a little hesitant to choosing it because I generally use Clinical Strength due to my excessive sweating    But Let&#x27;s face it  A. Clinical Strength is expensive   B. Most Clinical Strength Antiperspirants are a hassle to wash off of your underarms because it&#x27;s stuck like glue, which is why it lasts so long. I hate that.    SO I gave [[ASIN:B0028K3IZY Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice Antiperspirant/Deodorant]] a try. WOW. It actually worked for me, Which was amazing considering most Non-Clinical Strength Antiperspirants have me sweating within anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours of applying it, depending on weather and physical activity.    I think I may have found a new Antiperspirant</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve been using antiperspirant gel for so long, but I just didn&#x27;t dig this Clear Shield Deodorant from Gillette.  Though it states \\&quot;Clear Shield\\&quot;, it still leaves a noticable enough marking on my black t-shirts, something that the usual deodorant gel I use doesn&#x27;t.  Still, if gels aren&#x27;t your type of thing, I guess you could give this Gillette Clear Shield Deodorant a try, but this just isn&#x27;t for me personally.</li>
            <li> As far as wetness and odor protection go, this product works very well. I perspire normally, so I didn&#x27;t need major protection. The claims of be shirt friendly and going on cleanly are also accurate. I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that claim the product leaves a flaky white residue -- I imagine those reviewers are just using too much product. In my experience, if you use the suggested amount then you won&#x27;t have residue.    My biggest gripe with this product is the smell. It&#x27;s way too strong. If you don&#x27;t wear cologne or perfume, then it might not be an issue for you, but this product will definitely clash with other scents. Depending on what you wear, it could even overpower other scents. For me, this is a big issue.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works exactly as you would expect it too.  The smell is rather pleasant and not very strong. I&#x27;m a little sensitive to  odors and a lot of perfumes and deodorants are usually too over-bearing for me, but this one is just right.  Although the stick is white in color, it glides on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on your clothes. The deodorant sticks on very well...too good actually.  After after this on all day, when I shower at night, sometimes I can&#x27;t get it all off.    Finally, the best part of this deodorant, and this may just be a coincidence, but the very first day I used it, a very attractive young lady told me I smelled \\&quot;yummy\\&quot;!  This alone was my reason or giving it five stars! Needless to say, I have continued to use this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I used Gillette Clear Shield Arctic Ice for YEARS and couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore so I turned to Amazon.  When it arrived I opened it and immediately found it didn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like what I had been using previously.</li>
