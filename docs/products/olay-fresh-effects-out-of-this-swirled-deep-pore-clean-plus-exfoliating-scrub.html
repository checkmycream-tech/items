            <li>I also use the fresh effects moisturizer which feels like silk and doesnt leave my sking oily.</li>

            <li>I doubt very much that this can be considered deep pore cleansing.</li>

            <li>After using it for a month--which is about how long the bottle lasted, and I use it pretty liberally--I can say that I will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for three days, i was just too busy</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after using this product.</li>

Smells great, keeps your skin soft, clean, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I use the other scent. It smells wonderful and not too overwhelming for morning face washes! I&#x27;ve never smelled this one. I love this pump bottle I really hope they don&#x27;t switch it. I use this with a face sponge and my face has been really clear and smooth. I have really sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any dryness or redness. Perfect</li>
            <li> my skin has cleared thanks</li>
            <li> The container broke and could not be repaired.  Half the bottle went down the drain</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great!!</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this product make my face feel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Ive tried many, Ive spent a lot of money from Avon to Mary Kay to department store face products and this is my favorite. It cleans my face without drying it out. My face was broke out, and i had a lot of blackheads. Ever since i started using this my face is clear and i have NO acne what so ever. I stopped using it for three days, i was just too busy and my face broke out :( but after one day of using it again it immediately cleared up and i havent missed a day since. I also use the fresh effects moisturizer which feels like silk and doesnt leave my sking oily. Perfect amount of moisture. Now im buying the rest of the fresh effects products. Im in love!</li>
            <li> My favorite facial cleanser! I, too, have tried many different cleansers, including Mary Kay and AcneFree, and this one is by far the best. My face feels fresh and clean, not oily or dry, especially when used with Olay Fresh Effects Dew Over Gel, and it smells amazing! It really does offer a refreshing clean.</li>
            <li> i love this face wash its not too harsh on my skin and removes make up really good, which is hard to find</li>
            <li> No better or worse than most.  The exfoliating scrub is gentle, fragrance is fine.  The product is not remarkable.  If I can find it cheaper elsewhere, I will buy it again.  Meanwhile, my drugstore carries a ton of varieties of facial exfoliater.  I will continue searching.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle; I can hardly feel the exfoliating beads. I doubt very much that this can be considered deep pore cleansing.</li>

            <li> Love the way my skin feels. Too soon to tell yet. Just using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Love this product will buy more!!!</li>
            <li> I have not used it for very long, but what I have used of it appears to be working nicely</li>

            <li> This product is great!  I love the way it makes my  face feel.  The scent is mild and very refreshing.  I wish I could get a perfume like this.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job on my skin.  I have already ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of different face cleansers.  Both expensive and inexpensive.  This is tops  for my skin, which is a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash because it gently but most effectively removes my makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face! I even feel like my pores are not so obvious anymore!</li>
            <li> DEEP PORE CLEANER AND EXFOLIATOR.  GREAT LIGHT FRAGRANCE.  AAA+++</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after using this product.</li>
