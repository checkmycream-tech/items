            <li>but so what it smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; but it does not work.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for sweat control, this is not your product; but if a deodorant is all you need, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I even had the owner of a health food store follow me around asking what I was wearing because I smelled so nice lol!  </li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>

            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>Love all the scents from lavanilla !!</li>
            <li>Very nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice, feels very good on my skin... but doesn&#x27;t help me not to smell sweaty.  </li>
            <li>mom loves it and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this deodorant!</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells really great and works well to keep you smelling good all day.</li>
            <li>This is the most wonderfully scented product.</li>
            <li>The best non alluminum I have ever tried and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>I tried it and it&#x27;s almost been a month, and let me tell you I didn&#x27;t smell the best during it, but it has gotten a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love it, excellent.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have found - it smells great and works the best.</li>
            <li>smell strong like lavender; it just has a wonderful fragrance that everyone seems to like.</li>
            <li>I was used to using strong deodorants but Lavanilla has been wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Great product , I love it!</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I;m bummed it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I still gave it 3 stars because it will be good for people who demand a chemical-free deodorant</li>
            <li>I was worried but it&#x27;s really a good product.</li>
            <li>How good can it be to use it under your arms,</li>
            <li>$15 is a fair price to pay for deodorant but it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells that good to me.</li>
            <li>Even though the product smells good and spreads well, it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>This smells soooooo good.</li>
            <li>and I have recommended to my daughter, sisters and good friends on it as well.  </li>
            <li>It might smell good</li>
            <li>It will not however keep you from perspiring which IMO is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now have a good &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; option for overnight.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells soooo good</li>
            <li>But, it smells SOOOOO good that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>I really liked them because they smelt great and worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Excellent product,last for all day, very pleasant natural lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it has worked beautifully for my need.  </li>
            <li>The cheap-smelling scent at best covers body odor for couple of inactive hours after which we had to reapply more and more as the body odor got stronger and stronger.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging it is very cute and girly!</li>
            <li>Very healthy</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The scent is perfect and this really really works!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the effectiveness of this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>love this product!</li>
            <li>Love Lavanila deodorants!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>And I love this deodorant - won&#x27;t buy again though!</li>
            <li>stumbled upon this product by accident, and I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love using it and recommend everyone to try it!</li>
            <li>It is very mild on the skin but also very effective.</li>
            <li>Amazingly</li>
            <li>I have bought every kind under the sun, including antiperspirant, and never had an issue.</li>
            <li>The deodorant itself smells nice</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a nice smell, but just couldn&#x27;t mask the smell of sweat after working out or doing anything that made me feel nervous.</li>
            <li>to &amp;#34;actually kind of stinky&amp;#34; depending on the level of activity I had as well as the fabric I wore (cotton was best, synthetics not so much).</li>
            <li>You may have to apply twice in a day to keep that nice smell.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature ist</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>Lavanila has a pleasing fragrance and is non-irritating; however, it is not as effective at stopping order as I would like</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li>this interpretation smells nice too.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>The lavender vanilla scent is nice, the passion fruit scent is nice, the grapefruit scent is nice.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this because people on YouTube were giving it all kinds of great reviews.</li>
            <li>By far it&#x27;s the best product of its kind I have found.</li>
            <li>The roll up makes it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>When the item first arrived I loved the scent!  </li>
            <li>this deodorant is the best all natural one i have tried!</li>
            <li>The smell is so amazing &amp; refreshing .</li>
            <li>Best Ive found so far</li>
            <li>Nice smell, works most of the time.</li>
            <li>Awesome for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>the best natural deodorant I have tried</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I had a baby and started sweating more and had to eventually return to using antiperspirant once the temp rose to the 90s.</li>
            <li>The lavender is by FAR the best choice, as some of the others in this line are too perfumey.</li>
            <li>This is the best all natural deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best of these natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>worth the price i promise and smells great</li>
            <li>I like the roll-on cream style, the smell is light and pleasant, and it lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Love love love the smell of this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Smells great and so far so good with no B.O. by end of the day.</li>
            <li>I tested this deodorant on a very light activity day.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant,it&#x27;s really have a good scent and at the sametime very safe coz</li>
            <li>It does smell really nice and is totally fine for use around the house and running errands.</li>
            <li>the vanilla grapefruit smells better.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more perfume sent, But its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and lasts all day, most days.  </li>
            <li>As for the scent, it is lovely.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the lavender scented deodorant, I compared it to the vanilla scented deodorant (both LAVANILA the healthy deodorants)</li>
            <li>So if you are ok with that, then this product would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I had the vanilla lavendar and love the scent of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to Weleda Sage and that seems to work a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I also tried the Vanilla Grapefruit and same thing...smells good and works great</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It really works well and smells great, but then my aunt called to my attention that it contains carrageenan.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a safe deodorant without aluminum which has proven to be unsafe.</li>
            <li>Instead, it smells more like soap.</li>
            <li>Of all three this one is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; deodorant smell.</li>
            <li>I love how the product is not like a gel or liquid.</li>
            <li>is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>That said, this stuff worked just okay-</li>
            <li>just okay</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant of all time</li>
            <li>I do reapply this product throughout the day but don&#x27;t mind at all as the scent is that lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the container.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t decide which is a favorite because</li>
            <li>LOVE IT -</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok but doesn&#x27;t really work that great.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but it just does nothing to protect me from BO.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Mostly from my underarms, thank goodness, but I&#x27;m a sweaty person nonetheless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for my review: This deodorant is okay.</li>
            <li>It has a great list of gentle and safe ingredients (which is the reason why I purchased it).</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This one is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, so in an effort to minimize the aluminum seeping into my body</li>
            <li>I feel it deserves more.  </li>
            <li>This smells more like Lavender with a hint of Vanilla and lasts all day</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Works ok as a body odor mask.  </li>
            <li>That is something I can&#x27;t give up &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>It worked during the pregnancy because I was in air condition most of the time.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the Vanilla Lavender deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure those around me will be too.</li>
            <li>how glad I am that I switched over to this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This works better than Toms but is still just a deodorant not an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>the aroma was okay, but I didn&#x27;t think if worked well for odor protection.</li>
            <li>I also love that the products do not contain animal ingredients, and they are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, however I don&#x27;t love th product.</li>
            <li>If you can stand the musk, then I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing</li>
            <li>I still use it sometimes, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a healthy alternative to deodorant and was told this would do the trick.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li>While the smell is not terrible I just don&#x27;t want to smell like a baby or a man</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>A healthy product that works well.</li>
            <li>Better than using cancer sticks.</li>
            <li>I love lavanila products.</li>
            <li>I love the body wash and the deodorants.  </li>
            <li>You can find better deals for lavanila on sephora and ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for last 3 weeks and very happy with this product !!</li>
            <li>when It starts to wear off its not bad at all still helps a ton love this product!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Smells good at first but does not hold up to sweat.</li>
            <li>it smells pretty good, but i might as well just not wear deodorant.</li>
            <li>Smells good at first, but then fades to a soap smell like ivory.</li>
            <li>Pros: Smells good when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells really good on first application which lasts for about an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Created in a laboratory for people who are sensitive to regular antiperspirant deodorants, it is very effective, smells wonderful and lasts all day and all night.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>Lavanilla is more strongly scented than Toms</li>
            <li>I switched to this, and while it is not as good as Funk Butter, it is more gentle and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li>Cruelty-free, smells good, natural and effective....</li>
            <li>Smells fine until you sweat :)</li>
            <li>I ended up buying Avalon organics deodorants which are more citrusey and light.</li>
            <li>Was happy with the results for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many and this is the first one I liked.</li>
            <li>Great Natural Deodorant.</li>
            <li>When first transitioning from antiperspirant to natural deodorant it often felt like it wasn&#x27;t working, but once your body adjusts this becomes a really awesome product.</li>
            <li>And while it&#x27;s not HORRIFYING, I do smell</li>
            <li>Great natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>On days with light movement, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It is the closest texture wise to the real deal.</li>
            <li>I work in a restaurant, so I really need a good deodorant.</li>
            <li>thinking I&#x27;d use it for special occasions, since it matches the scent I use - but quickly found it&#x27;s much more effective than anything else</li>
            <li>It has a very light, clean smell - not chemically at all.</li>
            <li>My only qualm is the sent, although very nice, is very light.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sweating problem and most regular deodorants work great for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too strong but</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition and more quickly than I expected.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and easy and never shows on my skin or on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>Previous reviewers mentioned that the spray didn&#x27;t work, but this roll on deodorant is truly the best.  </li>
            <li>Finally found a healthy deodorant that smells amazing and works!</li>
            <li>To be fair, I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, very fresh and clean without being overly powerful or fragrant.</li>
            <li>We both have switched to a cream deodorant called DeodoMom which that has only two ingredients (water and magnesium hydroxide which is actually safe to eat!), is designed for pregnant women (and therefore completely toxin-free), and best of all, WORKS.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and it keeps me smelling fresh and dry all day.  </li>
            <li>Clean living &#x3D; clean smelling. :-)</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, like nice things, don&#x27;t sweat or smell a ton, this should be fine for you!</li>
            <li>smells great and goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li>By FAR is the BEST Natural deodorant out</li>
            <li>it did made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The application is smooth, and I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am SO HAPPY I FINALLY FOUND MY DEODORANT THAT WORKS!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best and most like traditional anti-persperants.  </li>
            <li>This goes on silky like a traditional deodorant and smells great.  </li>
            <li>and I can even retouch and not shower on light activity days when using Lavanila&lt;br</li>
            <li>It kind of feels like they&#x27;re skimping on the product, but I tend to apply very thoroughly</li>
            <li>The Health Deodorant smells great and works better than most, I&#x27;m still noticing an armpit smell after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than the chemically infused antiperspirant in drugstores and it has such a pleasant, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I did my research and have tried a few others before I found this perfect one!</li>
            <li>but it does not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Cost a bit more, but well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally free of cancer causing aluminum based deo and on the road of relightening my underarm again</li>
            <li>glad to know i can be fresh and avoid breast cancer.</li>
            <li>I love this as much as you can love a non antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really smooth going on and has a nice gentle formula so your armpits aren&#x27;t getting irritated.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because the stick didn&#x27;t work and wouldn&#x27;t advance, so I have to dig it out with my fingers... kind of defeats the purpose of taking a break from making my own.</li>
            <li>So far so good..</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>just right&#x27; Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering, like some; it&#x27;s a very fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful in its container, not a sweet smell, but more earthy and natural than most vanilla-scented products.  </li>
            <li>It is mild but strong and does work for me.  </li>
            <li>I smell no lavender or vanilla just super strong floral smell.</li>
            <li>their all unique in scent.</li>
            <li>My original rating was 2 stars, but since I did end up re-ordering this product</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells great and works all day long.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Like with many naturals, you might care to reapply after a workout or on a hot day.</li>
            <li>I also had to reapply during the day, but if you&#x27;re willing to deal with that, more power to you.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many brands of all-natural deodorant and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I walk alot, work out, clean the house</li>
            <li>I love te smell of this deodorant and that it&#x27;s safe and natural.</li>
            <li>This is feminine and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the ingredients are healthy and natural.</li>
            <li>This one smells great and is dry and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>While the smell is pleasant the product barely last a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>Overall great buy if your looking for a natural deodorant!! :)</li>
            <li>This deodorant goes on very smoothly and does not feel sticky and it prevents odor very well.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and BO never gets through, however it feels a bit wet from the moment you apply on, all day.</li>
            <li>but nothing gives me really great protection on days I exert myself doing yardwork or going to my fitness center</li>
            <li>I felt it gave good enough protection 90% of the time.</li>
            <li>It also makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Nice soft scent that is not offensive to others</li>
            <li>but it only smells good for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>but they are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>What more can you really say about deodorant?</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>While I like that the deodorant works and keeps me odor free I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to chemicals and love that this product is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Lavanilla is so fresh and clean everytime.</li>
            <li>so make sure the return policy is decent so you can get a replacement.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; when you rub on, smells good, keeps you smelling fresh, and ofcourse not too pricey -- and this is all of the above.</li>
            <li>It fades really quickly (&amp;#60;hour), but once it fades it smells like nothing, instead of</li>
            <li>but it does seem to start wearing off quickly, so I have needed to reapply.  </li>
            <li>I must say I bought into the healthy deodorant hype; I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite nice, I live in a hot climate</li>
            <li>I walk three miles every day, and sometimes get very hot.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I just made a light rub</li>
            <li>Hands down, THE best natural deodorant out there!</li>
            <li>A new healthy alternative</li>
            <li>One container has lasted me exactly 6 months!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat much, so not having antiperspirant qualities is fine, but the deodorant part still could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the first things I noticed about the product was the fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the reaction, the scent is really nice and it goes on easily (though it does feel somewhat &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as other reviewers described).</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic and works really well.</li>
            <li>It smells nice enough, but this deodorant does not give you all-day protection.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell, so have to wear perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li>I just love the soft fragrance and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>It took about a week for that to completely subside, but I&#x27;m so glad it did.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to switch over to more natural products but this is one thing that cannot be done.</li>
            <li>But this has such a good smell, and if I reapply every 3-4 hours I found it will keep me smelling fresh the whole day.</li>
            <li>; its worth the price.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a fantastic AND healthy alternative.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try if you are trying to avoid aluminum.  </li>
            <li>The label has a fun design, and the cap is twist-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t smelling as fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled to have found this product, I&#x27;ve already bought my second tube.  </li>
            <li>I have an all natural lavender body wash that I love and</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still one of the better natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried-- might just be the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this chemical free and natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>On super hot days you may have to reapply 1x.</li>
            <li>I find that the vanilla smell fades pretty quickly, after about a half-hour, and is replaced by a baby-powdery smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and feels silky smooth, but doesn&#x27;t last long. 😞</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s in there as I loved the product, but will no longer be using it due to this.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep buying it because it is gentle, smells great and is convenient in stick form, but in the Florida summer heat this alone just isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Also I use it on my underarms right out of the shower after shaving them-</li>
            <li>I was previously using Funk Butter, which is the best brand out there, but it was starting to give me a rash at times.</li>
            <li>but that goes away quick and really really helps with the order and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I rarely sweat anymore, and the fresh scent lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li>It works, its effective, and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it is enough to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>(and I do not sweat very much at all).  </li>
            <li>I still get a little smelly, but I haven&#x27;t found a brand that works as good as the Aluminum stuff -</li>
            <li>Who wants to smell stinky armpits while getting their hair done?!</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this I hadn&#x27;t been made aware of the dangers of carrageenan.  </li>
            <li>there!&lt;br /&gt;i used to use Dove before i switched to a cruelty free lifestyle and WOW</li>
            <li>This was the first &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant I bought.  </li>
            <li>Expensive but great product!</li>
            <li>While you get a pretty weighty deodorant for the price, it still hurts to have to cough up that cash.</li>
            <li>but you should definitely re-apply in a humid climate (it served me well in Florida&#x27;s humidity) or if you are heading to the gym or fitting in a sweaty workout.</li>
            <li>It is all natural, contains no harmful chemicals and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This was doing alright as a daily use product but as summer came on I found myself having to reapply twice or more a day.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really works!</li>
            <li>This deodorant works well when the weather isn&#x27;t too hot.</li>
            <li>I love this original Vanilla Scent, but am trying out the other scents soon.</li>
            <li>so it smells pretty floral.</li>
            <li>(personally, I prefer the pop-off type, but hopefully this preserves the already-weak $14 fragrance better).</li>
            <li>I first used this product, I put it on at night after a shower.</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; long lasting too.</li>
            <li>and I am very athletic!</li>
            <li>To me this deodorant has a masculine smell and reminds me of a light men&#x27;s after shave.</li>
            <li>so I will probably try this brand again as all natural is important to me</li>
            <li>Overall though, I think it&#x27;s a good natural deodorant and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>we ended up with pretty irritated underarms.</li>
            <li>This product feels really light, smooth and applies DRY onto skin.</li>
            <li>Finally a natural deodorant that works!!!!</li>
            <li>There are so many other natural deoderants on the market that are much more cheaper.</li>
            <li>So far have tried the lavender and original.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to switch to an all natural aluminum free deodorant but this seems to have burned my skin.</li>
            <li>I got this because its a clean, 100% natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I feel reassured that it is 100% natural and thrilled it has essential oils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it actually goes on like &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; deodorant (some of the natural stuff is goopy or whatever) and it does smell really nice.</li>
            <li>May have to reapply once on a really hot day but holds up really well compared to others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Fast service and exactly as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>I have used a few of the other scents (vanilla grapefruit, vanilla) and this is the best scent in my opinion.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried it and this one is easy to apply and actually lasts through the day.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m not so active that this is a very strong test of anything).  </li>
            <li>And the scent is very light, even after a workout - nothing that seems to be noticeable to anyone else at the fitness center I use.  </li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t smell too much sugary vanilla in the typical perfumes I&#x27;ve experienced before.</li>
            <li>I bought the Vanilla Grapefruit version with very high hopes.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, and I like it better than their plain vanilla (which smells kind of fake chemical vanilla-y) or their lemon vanilla (which smells a bit too masculine on me).  </li>
            <li>I really like the lavender scent too...</li>
            <li>but this one holds up an 8 hour shift of retail work very well.  </li>
            <li>The problem is its scent doesn&#x27;t help to cover odor and it leaves too much residue for me to shell out that much cash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a whole stick of deodorant and have since ordered another.</li>
            <li>Overall, I expected a more effective product, especially given the price, and will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>And since it&#x27;s natural, it isn&#x27;t inhibiting the sweat - which actually in turn causes your body to be more balanced in how much you sweat.  </li>
            <li>I saw that another reviewer said to rub baking soda on your pits before applying this &amp; that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars for scent (really - it&#x27;s luscious)</li>
            <li>I had to apply in the evening after showering, and in the morning before getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I have to reapply, but it works really well for a healthier deordorant</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Absolutely did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>Had high hopes!</li>
            <li>I found this in Whole Foods after Kiss</li>
            <li>I was skeptical to try a natural deodorant but this product has an AMAZING scent that covers up nicely but isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the best.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast an efficent</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t sweat much at all.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really like this product for an alternative to grocery store &#x27;deodorants&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Much easier than getting to Sephora for the purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what I think of this</li>
            <li>I was also really itchy after a workout with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if I should stick with it until something happens or toss it, even though it was quite pricey for a deodorant</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant</li>
            <li>The price didn&#x27;t shock me too much since my go-to deodorant is about $10, and this was eligible for Prime shipping when I got it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I really like Lavanila deodorant.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the smell and the fact that there aren&#x27;t harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>All the others I&#x27;ve tried make my underarms sticky or irritated and didn&#x27;t really make deodorize.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Unlike with Weleda though, I really don&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was smelly to everyone around me, which was really embarrassing at work.  </li>
            <li>After a very strenuous workout, I have to wash and reapply, but I figure you&#x27;re going to have that issue with ANY deodorant.  </li>
            <li>My search for a chemical free deoderant that actually works continues.....</li>
            <li>I noticed that you need to really rub it in cus</li>
            <li>Wore off within four hours every time and once you started to smell, reapplying didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the price tag, but since I don&#x27;t have to slather it on like inexpensive natural deodorant, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use regular chemical filled deodorants</li>
            <li>and it lasts me almost the whole time and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants and found that this is one of my favorites to use.  </li>
            <li>I will order one more and hopefully it will not be broken because I do love the product.</li>
            <li>I have used every kind of antiperspirant, even clinical ones and would still find myself smelling after just a few hours even if i reapplied.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many natural deodarents and this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised that this 100% natural deodorant really works!!!</li>
            <li>If it works for you, you will be in luck because it is natural!!!</li>
            <li>It actually works, except on super hot days when I am out all day gardening or on the beach.  </li>
            <li>right near lymph nodes?  </li>
            <li>And overall, after having used it for 3 weeks now, during workouts and long laborious days, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>I noticed pretty quickly after using it that I needed to reapply by mid/late afternoon, but I kind of expected that after reading other reviews and it did not bother me.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, and smell good, as there are not many choices for natural deodorants in the stores.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this deodorant would work well, considering how active I am.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of absorbing wetness</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent but does leave some white residue on clothes.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I always smell clean (even after a hot day, I didn&#x27;t ever smell &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34;) but the re-application cuts down on underarm wetness.</li>
            <li>, I could return it for a full refund&lt;br /&gt;- several hours after applying,</li>
            <li>This was my first adventure into natural deodorant, so I was not over-the-moon about it, but I would have recommended it and purchased it again,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat more than the average person, so it works well for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most recently I was using the crystal (both the actual crystal plus the spray) and at the end of the day, no matter how much I used, I STUNK.  </li>
            <li>I usually make my own deodorant</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this by itself, but it doesn&#x27;t make me sweat any less, nor does it mask the smell of my sweat.  </li>
            <li>I really have experienced less wetness, but what I am raving about is how even when I still sweat in my pits (though considerably LESS)</li>
            <li>I like smelling sweat free and being dry.</li>
            <li>decent.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one of LAVANILLA, I had a different scent before, I love this stuff, it works, its not sticky and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the Zinc thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used clinical protection deoderant for a few years and found that no matter what kind I tried, I seemed to have developed a sensitivity to it, causing my under arms to itch all the time.  </li>
            <li>I only use non aluminum deodorants and am constantly looking for something better.  </li>
            <li>, while natural, LAVANILLA does contain tea tree oil, which is not recommended for anyone with an estrogen positive cancer.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin healthy and not full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is like most other natural products - what works for some people doesn&#x27;t work for all people.  </li>
            <li>Other more natural deodorants have not worked at all for me.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and fresh!</li>
            <li>I noticed my underarms getting red and kind of raw, but I thought it was because I switched from an antiperspirant to a deodorant and that they were just more wet from sweat during the day (thus the redness).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying various \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; deodorants over the last year or so, and I was really excited when I read all the positive reviews for this one.  </li>
            <li>I have paid attention to the instructions - important not to apply to wet underarms.</li>
            <li>This natural product really works ..</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to try a natural deodorant because I&#x27;ve heard that they do not work as well..</li>
            <li>It honestly caused my skin to become bright red, itchy and painful.</li>
            <li>Many have been too sticky and just doesn&#x27;t work at odor protection after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I have been outside all day in 95 degree heat, and still feel/smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>You will still sweat (which is normal), but this takes care of any unwanted scents associated with the sweat.</li>
            <li>, it works, it does leave white marks and it lasts for a long time so actually it is a better value than I thought.has lessened with use</li>
            <li>, it works, it does leave white marks and it lasts for a long time so actually it is a better value than I thought.</li>
            <li>The deo is shaped round, (not oval like the aluminum deo&#x27;s out there) and I wish it was more oval for easier application.</li>
            <li>The coconut is ok too, but avoid the others if you don&#x27;t like heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>During a normal work day I come home and am not smelly at all.  </li>
            <li>like  a normal deo</li>
            <li>An interesting point is I was having some unusual body odor and discovered it was one of my supplements: too much choline bitartrate in my B-100 complex capsules.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant, not great.</li>
            <li>I use it right after I shower at night and then again the next day.</li>
            <li>I was debating over which to buy and was going to buy the plain lavender until I saw many comments saying it smelled like baby powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much more mellow, soft, but not sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Smells great for the first few hours but fades by late afternoon.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve used a bunch, and live in the south.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be switching to something new.</li>
            <li>had Lavanila been of assistance in exchanging my defective product for a new one.</li>
            <li>I have tried over 15-20 natural deodorants, most of which I disliked.</li>
            <li>I will still use Lavanilla when I don&#x27;t have time for the Thai to dry or when I want a quick, good-smelling &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li>I was almost about to give up on the whole natural deodorant thing but one of my goals for 2015 was to completely cut out unnatural products</li>
            <li>I love that this deodorant is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fast ship, exactly as expected, easy open packaging</li>
            <li>I also tried pit putty and that smelled great but left me smelling even worse afterward.</li>
            <li>I am still in search of a non-aluminum product for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my skin, which is very sensitive, but this burnt my skin...</li>
            <li>When looking for natural deodorants, I&#x27;ve found that the problem is that most are not strongly scented, and quite frankly, that&#x27;s what deodorant is all about.  </li>
            <li>The first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>I bought 2 by accident and thought I would return the extra but will be keeping it when I run out of the first Lavanilla.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>However, if you are willing to pay for it and can find it locally it&#x27;s definitely a quality product that works.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try other scents from this company.</li>
            <li>So I switched to Desert Essence from Sprouts and now having the same exact problem..grrr..</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>Perhaps due to the creamy consistency I actually felt as though I sweat more than wearing nothing at all while wearing this.</li>
            <li>Not sticky like other clean products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The nice dry powdery feel is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in regular packaging - I have used other natural deoderants that come in a pot or tin where you apply it with your fingers.</li>
            <li>and I did not feel clean after being active.</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works!</li>
            <li>First natural deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with strong smells causing headaches</li>
            <li>Finally a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling natural!</li>
            <li>body wash is only 15$ plus shipping, why is the deodorant more for less product?</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no sticky feeling when applying, NO white marks at all, and it completely masks odor and wetness throughout the day (even better than any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used, oddly).</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a highly effective/pleasant smelling all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>really want a natural deodorant and thought this was the answer, but now I&#x27;m back on the search!</li>
            <li>and would definitely recommend it to anyone like me who wants to transition to all natural products.  </li>
            <li>For this much money I expected a much richer, lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I would classify my skin as sensitive, but never in my life have I had a reaction to deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have found that during the day, especially when I&#x27;m running around and very stressed my underarms are not as drenched as before.</li>
            <li>This is a soft scent and works for me.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of it being all natural, but was looking for a nicer scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like wearing nothing nearly immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feminine without being too girly or floral.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have to reapply mid-day but not everyday.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the search for an all natural deodorant for YEARS</li>
            <li>In fact, it seemed to make my natural odors worse/more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I switched to geodeo natural deodorant and the redness completely went away.</li>
            <li>This natural deodorant doesn&#x27;t smell like deodorant and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky like regular deodorant does, and that it&#x27;s much easier to wash off.</li>
            <li>I really think a lot of whether it works or not has to do with body chemistry, so I&#x27;d suggest trying a number of different brands.</li>
            <li>Being all natural provides peace of mind.  </li>
            <li>Since removing things like refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, processed carbohydrates, etc., and adding more fresh fruits and veggies, I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the way my sweat smells.</li>
            <li>but my skin is so sensitive it gave me a rash.</li>
            <li>Lavanila may be natural but it&#x27;s also over-rated and and over-priced.</li>
            <li>smelled old I threw it out</li>
            <li>and I was really fed up with my hubby constantly complaining about my mustiness.</li>
            <li>So did my research and found out about natural deodorant brand Lavanila.</li>
            <li>More expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural ingredients and works and keeps my pits pretty dry.</li>
            <li>It is NOT fragrance free - and I had a worse reacting to this than many other fragranced products.</li>
            <li>The Lavender Vanilla scent is definitely my favorite - the grapefruit scent was a little strange.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several brands of natural deodorant and it is the first one to actually work!</li>
            <li>Previously I had used Burt&#x27;s Bees (ok for a couple of hours), Tom&#x27;s (worthless), and a brand I found on Etsy that I can no longer remember the name of (had to be applied by hand, so wasn&#x27;t as convenient, though worked great).  </li>
            <li>It pretty much wastes a whole stick</li>
            <li>I do notice that I have to apply it a couple of times a day to stay fresh smelling-especially of active-</li>
            <li>The results with LaVanila are no better on those days, but I would rather spend more on a product that works just as well as a traditional deodorant but doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals/aluminum in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this happen with some natural deodorants like Tom&#x27;s, but didn&#x27;t expect it from this product as no other reviews seem to mention it.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for several years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The plain vanilla scent was too masculine  and the grapefruit or pomegranate was too sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive but seems to last and work and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but ever since I was a kid I struggled with being a pretty smelly girl, but not necessarily really sweaty.</li>
            <li>Leaves a bit of a white residue, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with.</li>
            <li>After a while, the product seems to dry out and gets very chalky.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks I noticed things were feeling a bit more wet</li>
            <li>This works just like regular deodorant, but all natural!</li>
            <li>On active days, not so much!</li>
            <li>I saw this in a large chain store and I was curious about it and wanted to give it a try cus for years</li>
            <li>It goes on very creamy, which I&#x27;m not used to (I wish it went on thinner), and dries to a very dry powder.</li>
            <li>broke out under arm after using could be an allergic reaction but it was bad  smells great bit</li>
            <li>I am going back to old spice, even though it isn&#x27;t natural, because so far it is the only deodorant without aluminum that actually works for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on clothing.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so it&#x27;s not good enough to replace my industrial strength deo/anti-perspirant on a full-schedule day here in Arizona, but it keeps my pits unscented through a night of sleep</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now tried all of the natural deodorants and the only one that works is homemade coconut oil based deodorant.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t mind having to re-apply numerous times throughout the day and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you might like this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last overnight but considering that its natural - I&#x27;ll take it.  </li>
            <li>But for now I&#x27;ll go back to my old Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant (without aluminum.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to stick with natural, non-antiperspirant for about a year now, and this was the third one I tried and stuck with for almost 7 months.  </li>
            <li>I sweat moderately and this natural deodorant keeps up with me.</li>
            <li>I only use natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I know people question how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; it can be, but it&#x27;s natural enough for me (no aluminum?</li>
            <li>Even in the winter, this wore off by 3pm and left me self conscious about my stank.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin and have noticed a vast improvement in smoothness and moisturization in the skin on my underarms since I began using this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a search for a natural deodorant that actually works and have tried dozens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a natural deo that would actually work.</li>
            <li>So you should definitely give it a try if you are looking for a natural deodorant with no harmful substances that works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that actually works for some time now.</li>
            <li>but it is enough to make me feel self conscious and is why I no longer use it.</li>
            <li>This is the only vegan and natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>However, like all natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, I sometimes have to put more on in the late afternoon, so it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I wish it did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to keep you dry in the high heat of summer, but you will not have body odor.  </li>
            <li>This worked really, really well for a natural deodorant for a little while, but then it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells much like other lavendar products - with a bit of a warmth to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using LaVanila for the past 2 years, including very hot sweaty Texas summers.</li>
            <li>I am a stay at home active mom and after a day of using this product i am dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>After MONTHS of testing various natural deodorants I&#x27;ve finally found the one that can keep my BO in check!</li>
            <li>So difficult to find something more natural but that works and this one does.</li>
            <li>So I sought out a natural solution and stumbled upon this on a beauty retailer site (where it is more expensive).  </li>
            <li>I am very active and this is the only non-aluminum deodorant that I have found that consistently works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect natural deodorant and only stumbled upon this one after having a very violent reaction to Primal Pit Paste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey for a deodorant, but after exhausting every other kind I could get my hands on</li>
            <li>I looked for a long time for a natural deodorant that actually worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- an empty container feels almost as heavy as a full container, but one stick lasts for several months.</li>
            <li>It smells very cheap - like a fake vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I workout out every single day and this deoderant is the only in natural dept that works during and after a sweat session.</li>
            <li>On some of my more brutal workouts and on some particularly hot days on a vacation I felt it didn&#x27;t live up to my non-natural deodorant alternative.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great to be &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; but it does not work.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for sweat control, this is not your product; but if a deodorant is all you need, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I even had the owner of a health food store follow me around asking what I was wearing because I smelled so nice lol!  </li>

            <li> Very nice scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells really nice, feels very good on my skin... but doesn&#x27;t help me not to smell sweaty.  </li>
            <li> mom loves it and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this deodorant!</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells really great and works well to keep you smelling good all day.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderfully scented product.</li>
            <li> The best non alluminum I have ever tried and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it&#x27;s almost been a month, and let me tell you I didn&#x27;t smell the best during it, but it has gotten a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love it, excellent.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have found - it smells great and works the best.</li>
            <li> smell strong like lavender; it just has a wonderful fragrance that everyone seems to like.</li>
            <li> I was used to using strong deodorants but Lavanilla has been wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Great product , I love it!</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I;m bummed it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I still gave it 3 stars because it will be good for people who demand a chemical-free deodorant</li>
            <li> I was worried but it&#x27;s really a good product.</li>
            <li> How good can it be to use it under your arms,</li>
            <li> $15 is a fair price to pay for deodorant but it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells that good to me.</li>
            <li> Even though the product smells good and spreads well, it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This smells soooooo good.</li>
            <li> and I have recommended to my daughter, sisters and good friends on it as well.  </li>
            <li> It might smell good</li>
            <li> It will not however keep you from perspiring which IMO is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now have a good &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; option for overnight.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells soooo good</li>
            <li> But, it smells SOOOOO good that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I really liked them because they smelt great and worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,last for all day, very pleasant natural lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and it has worked beautifully for my need.  </li>
            <li> The cheap-smelling scent at best covers body odor for couple of inactive hours after which we had to reapply more and more as the body odor got stronger and stronger.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging it is very cute and girly!</li>
            <li> Very healthy</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The scent is perfect and this really really works!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the effectiveness of this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> love this product!</li>
            <li> Love Lavanila deodorants!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> And I love this deodorant - won&#x27;t buy again though!</li>
            <li> stumbled upon this product by accident, and I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love using it and recommend everyone to try it!</li>
            <li> It is very mild on the skin but also very effective.</li>
            <li> Amazingly</li>
            <li> I have bought every kind under the sun, including antiperspirant, and never had an issue.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself smells nice</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a nice smell, but just couldn&#x27;t mask the smell of sweat after working out or doing anything that made me feel nervous.</li>
            <li> to &amp;#34;actually kind of stinky&amp;#34; depending on the level of activity I had as well as the fabric I wore (cotton was best, synthetics not so much).</li>
            <li> You may have to apply twice in a day to keep that nice smell.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature ist</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> Lavanila has a pleasing fragrance and is non-irritating; however, it is not as effective at stopping order as I would like</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li> this interpretation smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> The lavender vanilla scent is nice, the passion fruit scent is nice, the grapefruit scent is nice.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this because people on YouTube were giving it all kinds of great reviews.</li>
            <li> By far it&#x27;s the best product of its kind I have found.</li>
            <li> The roll up makes it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> When the item first arrived I loved the scent!  </li>
            <li> this deodorant is the best all natural one i have tried!</li>
            <li> The smell is so amazing &amp; refreshing .</li>
            <li> Best Ive found so far</li>

            <li> This one is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li> the best natural deodorant I have tried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I had a baby and started sweating more and had to eventually return to using antiperspirant once the temp rose to the 90s.</li>
            <li> The lavender is by FAR the best choice, as some of the others in this line are too perfumey.</li>
            <li> This is the best all natural deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best of these natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> worth the price i promise and smells great</li>
            <li> I like the roll-on cream style, the smell is light and pleasant, and it lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Love love love the smell of this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Smells great and so far so good with no B.O. by end of the day.</li>
            <li> I tested this deodorant on a very light activity day.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I love this deodorant,it&#x27;s really have a good scent and at the sametime very safe coz</li>
            <li> It does smell really nice and is totally fine for use around the house and running errands.</li>
            <li> the vanilla grapefruit smells better.</li>
            <li> I prefer a more perfume sent, But its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and lasts all day, most days.  </li>
            <li> As for the scent, it is lovely.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the lavender scented deodorant, I compared it to the vanilla scented deodorant (both LAVANILA the healthy deodorants)</li>
            <li> So if you are ok with that, then this product would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I had the vanilla lavendar and love the scent of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to Weleda Sage and that seems to work a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Vanilla Grapefruit and same thing...smells good and works great</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It really works well and smells great, but then my aunt called to my attention that it contains carrageenan.  </li>
            <li> Wanted a safe deodorant without aluminum which has proven to be unsafe.</li>
            <li> Instead, it smells more like soap.</li>
            <li> Of all three this one is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; deodorant smell.</li>
            <li> I love how the product is not like a gel or liquid.</li>
            <li> is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> That said, this stuff worked just okay-</li>
            <li> just okay</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant of all time</li>
            <li> I do reapply this product throughout the day but don&#x27;t mind at all as the scent is that lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the container.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t decide which is a favorite because</li>
            <li> LOVE IT -</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok but doesn&#x27;t really work that great.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but it just does nothing to protect me from BO.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Mostly from my underarms, thank goodness, but I&#x27;m a sweaty person nonetheless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for my review: This deodorant is okay.</li>
            <li> It has a great list of gentle and safe ingredients (which is the reason why I purchased it).</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This one is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, so in an effort to minimize the aluminum seeping into my body</li>
            <li> I feel it deserves more.  </li>
            <li> This smells more like Lavender with a hint of Vanilla and lasts all day</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Works ok as a body odor mask.  </li>
            <li> That is something I can&#x27;t give up &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> It worked during the pregnancy because I was in air condition most of the time.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the Vanilla Lavender deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure those around me will be too.</li>
            <li> how glad I am that I switched over to this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This works better than Toms but is still just a deodorant not an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> the aroma was okay, but I didn&#x27;t think if worked well for odor protection.</li>
            <li> I also love that the products do not contain animal ingredients, and they are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, however I don&#x27;t love th product.</li>
            <li> If you can stand the musk, then I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing</li>
            <li> I still use it sometimes, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a healthy alternative to deodorant and was told this would do the trick.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li> While the smell is not terrible I just don&#x27;t want to smell like a baby or a man</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> A healthy product that works well.</li>
            <li> Better than using cancer sticks.</li>
            <li> I love lavanila products.</li>
            <li> I love the body wash and the deodorants.  </li>
            <li> You can find better deals for lavanila on sephora and ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for last 3 weeks and very happy with this product !!</li>
            <li> when It starts to wear off its not bad at all still helps a ton love this product!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells good at first but does not hold up to sweat.</li>
            <li> it smells pretty good, but i might as well just not wear deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells good at first, but then fades to a soap smell like ivory.</li>
            <li> Pros: Smells good when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells really good on first application which lasts for about an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Created in a laboratory for people who are sensitive to regular antiperspirant deodorants, it is very effective, smells wonderful and lasts all day and all night.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Lavanilla is more strongly scented than Toms</li>
            <li> I switched to this, and while it is not as good as Funk Butter, it is more gentle and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li> Cruelty-free, smells good, natural and effective....</li>
            <li> Smells fine until you sweat :)</li>
            <li> I ended up buying Avalon organics deodorants which are more citrusey and light.</li>
            <li> Was happy with the results for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many and this is the first one I liked.</li>
            <li> Great Natural Deodorant.</li>
            <li> When first transitioning from antiperspirant to natural deodorant it often felt like it wasn&#x27;t working, but once your body adjusts this becomes a really awesome product.</li>
            <li> And while it&#x27;s not HORRIFYING, I do smell</li>
            <li> Great natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> On days with light movement, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It is the closest texture wise to the real deal.</li>
            <li> I work in a restaurant, so I really need a good deodorant.</li>
            <li> thinking I&#x27;d use it for special occasions, since it matches the scent I use - but quickly found it&#x27;s much more effective than anything else</li>
            <li> It has a very light, clean smell - not chemically at all.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is the sent, although very nice, is very light.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sweating problem and most regular deodorants work great for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too strong but</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition and more quickly than I expected.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and easy and never shows on my skin or on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> Previous reviewers mentioned that the spray didn&#x27;t work, but this roll on deodorant is truly the best.  </li>
            <li> Finally found a healthy deodorant that smells amazing and works!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, very fresh and clean without being overly powerful or fragrant.</li>
            <li> We both have switched to a cream deodorant called DeodoMom which that has only two ingredients (water and magnesium hydroxide which is actually safe to eat!), is designed for pregnant women (and therefore completely toxin-free), and best of all, WORKS.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful scent and it keeps me smelling fresh and dry all day.  </li>
            <li> Clean living &#x3D; clean smelling. :-)</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, like nice things, don&#x27;t sweat or smell a ton, this should be fine for you!</li>
            <li> smells great and goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> By FAR is the BEST Natural deodorant out</li>
            <li> it did made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The application is smooth, and I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am SO HAPPY I FINALLY FOUND MY DEODORANT THAT WORKS!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and most like traditional anti-persperants.  </li>
            <li> This goes on silky like a traditional deodorant and smells great.  </li>
            <li> and I can even retouch and not shower on light activity days when using Lavanila&lt;br</li>
            <li> It kind of feels like they&#x27;re skimping on the product, but I tend to apply very thoroughly</li>
            <li> The Health Deodorant smells great and works better than most, I&#x27;m still noticing an armpit smell after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than the chemically infused antiperspirant in drugstores and it has such a pleasant, clean scent.</li>
            <li> I did my research and have tried a few others before I found this perfect one!</li>
            <li> but it does not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Cost a bit more, but well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally free of cancer causing aluminum based deo and on the road of relightening my underarm again</li>
            <li> glad to know i can be fresh and avoid breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I love this as much as you can love a non antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really smooth going on and has a nice gentle formula so your armpits aren&#x27;t getting irritated.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because the stick didn&#x27;t work and wouldn&#x27;t advance, so I have to dig it out with my fingers... kind of defeats the purpose of taking a break from making my own.</li>
            <li> So far so good..</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> just right&#x27; Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering, like some; it&#x27;s a very fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful in its container, not a sweet smell, but more earthy and natural than most vanilla-scented products.  </li>
            <li> It is mild but strong and does work for me.  </li>
            <li> I smell no lavender or vanilla just super strong floral smell.</li>
            <li> their all unique in scent.</li>
            <li> My original rating was 2 stars, but since I did end up re-ordering this product</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells great and works all day long.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Like with many naturals, you might care to reapply after a workout or on a hot day.</li>
            <li> I also had to reapply during the day, but if you&#x27;re willing to deal with that, more power to you.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many brands of all-natural deodorant and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I walk alot, work out, clean the house</li>
            <li> I love te smell of this deodorant and that it&#x27;s safe and natural.</li>
            <li> This is feminine and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> This one smells great and is dry and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> While the smell is pleasant the product barely last a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> Overall great buy if your looking for a natural deodorant!! :)</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on very smoothly and does not feel sticky and it prevents odor very well.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and BO never gets through, however it feels a bit wet from the moment you apply on, all day.</li>
            <li> but nothing gives me really great protection on days I exert myself doing yardwork or going to my fitness center</li>
            <li> I felt it gave good enough protection 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> It also makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent that is not offensive to others</li>
            <li> but it only smells good for 15 minutes</li>
            <li> but they are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> What more can you really say about deodorant?</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> While I like that the deodorant works and keeps me odor free I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals and love that this product is chemical free.</li>
            <li> Lavanilla is so fresh and clean everytime.</li>
            <li> so make sure the return policy is decent so you can get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; when you rub on, smells good, keeps you smelling fresh, and ofcourse not too pricey -- and this is all of the above.</li>
            <li> It fades really quickly (&amp;#60;hour), but once it fades it smells like nothing, instead of</li>
            <li> but it does seem to start wearing off quickly, so I have needed to reapply.  </li>
            <li> I must say I bought into the healthy deodorant hype; I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite nice, I live in a hot climate</li>
            <li> I walk three miles every day, and sometimes get very hot.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I just made a light rub</li>
            <li> Hands down, THE best natural deodorant out there!</li>
            <li> A new healthy alternative</li>
            <li> One container has lasted me exactly 6 months!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat much, so not having antiperspirant qualities is fine, but the deodorant part still could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the first things I noticed about the product was the fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the reaction, the scent is really nice and it goes on easily (though it does feel somewhat &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as other reviewers described).</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic and works really well.</li>
            <li> It smells nice enough, but this deodorant does not give you all-day protection.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, so have to wear perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li> I just love the soft fragrance and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It took about a week for that to completely subside, but I&#x27;m so glad it did.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to switch over to more natural products but this is one thing that cannot be done.</li>
            <li> But this has such a good smell, and if I reapply every 3-4 hours I found it will keep me smelling fresh the whole day.</li>
            <li> ; its worth the price.</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a fantastic AND healthy alternative.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try if you are trying to avoid aluminum.  </li>
            <li> The label has a fun design, and the cap is twist-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t smelling as fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to have found this product, I&#x27;ve already bought my second tube.  </li>
            <li> I have an all natural lavender body wash that I love and</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still one of the better natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried-- might just be the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this chemical free and natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> On super hot days you may have to reapply 1x.</li>
            <li> I find that the vanilla smell fades pretty quickly, after about a half-hour, and is replaced by a baby-powdery smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and feels silky smooth, but doesn&#x27;t last long. 😞</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in there as I loved the product, but will no longer be using it due to this.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep buying it because it is gentle, smells great and is convenient in stick form, but in the Florida summer heat this alone just isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Also I use it on my underarms right out of the shower after shaving them-</li>
            <li> I was previously using Funk Butter, which is the best brand out there, but it was starting to give me a rash at times.</li>
            <li> but that goes away quick and really really helps with the order and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I rarely sweat anymore, and the fresh scent lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li> It works, its effective, and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it is enough to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> (and I do not sweat very much at all).  </li>
            <li> I still get a little smelly, but I haven&#x27;t found a brand that works as good as the Aluminum stuff -</li>
            <li> Who wants to smell stinky armpits while getting their hair done?!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this I hadn&#x27;t been made aware of the dangers of carrageenan.  </li>
            <li> there!&lt;br /&gt;i used to use Dove before i switched to a cruelty free lifestyle and WOW</li>
            <li> This was the first &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant I bought.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but great product!</li>
            <li> While you get a pretty weighty deodorant for the price, it still hurts to have to cough up that cash.</li>
            <li> but you should definitely re-apply in a humid climate (it served me well in Florida&#x27;s humidity) or if you are heading to the gym or fitting in a sweaty workout.</li>
            <li> It is all natural, contains no harmful chemicals and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This was doing alright as a daily use product but as summer came on I found myself having to reapply twice or more a day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well when the weather isn&#x27;t too hot.</li>
            <li> I love this original Vanilla Scent, but am trying out the other scents soon.</li>
            <li> so it smells pretty floral.</li>
            <li> (personally, I prefer the pop-off type, but hopefully this preserves the already-weak $14 fragrance better).</li>
            <li> I first used this product, I put it on at night after a shower.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; long lasting too.</li>
            <li> and I am very athletic!</li>
            <li> To me this deodorant has a masculine smell and reminds me of a light men&#x27;s after shave.</li>
            <li> so I will probably try this brand again as all natural is important to me</li>
            <li> Overall though, I think it&#x27;s a good natural deodorant and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> we ended up with pretty irritated underarms.</li>
            <li> This product feels really light, smooth and applies DRY onto skin.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that works!!!!</li>
            <li> There are so many other natural deoderants on the market that are much more cheaper.</li>
            <li> So far have tried the lavender and original.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to switch to an all natural aluminum free deodorant but this seems to have burned my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this because its a clean, 100% natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I feel reassured that it is 100% natural and thrilled it has essential oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it actually goes on like &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; deodorant (some of the natural stuff is goopy or whatever) and it does smell really nice.</li>
            <li> May have to reapply once on a really hot day but holds up really well compared to others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Fast service and exactly as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used a few of the other scents (vanilla grapefruit, vanilla) and this is the best scent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried it and this one is easy to apply and actually lasts through the day.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not so active that this is a very strong test of anything).  </li>
            <li> And the scent is very light, even after a workout - nothing that seems to be noticeable to anyone else at the fitness center I use.  </li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t smell too much sugary vanilla in the typical perfumes I&#x27;ve experienced before.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vanilla Grapefruit version with very high hopes.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant, and I like it better than their plain vanilla (which smells kind of fake chemical vanilla-y) or their lemon vanilla (which smells a bit too masculine on me).  </li>
            <li> I really like the lavender scent too...</li>
            <li> but this one holds up an 8 hour shift of retail work very well.  </li>
            <li> The problem is its scent doesn&#x27;t help to cover odor and it leaves too much residue for me to shell out that much cash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a whole stick of deodorant and have since ordered another.</li>
            <li> Overall, I expected a more effective product, especially given the price, and will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> And since it&#x27;s natural, it isn&#x27;t inhibiting the sweat - which actually in turn causes your body to be more balanced in how much you sweat.  </li>
            <li> I saw that another reviewer said to rub baking soda on your pits before applying this &amp; that it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars for scent (really - it&#x27;s luscious)</li>
            <li> I had to apply in the evening after showering, and in the morning before getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply, but it works really well for a healthier deordorant</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Absolutely did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Had high hopes!</li>
            <li> I found this in Whole Foods after Kiss</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try a natural deodorant but this product has an AMAZING scent that covers up nicely but isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the best.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast an efficent</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t sweat much at all.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really like this product for an alternative to grocery store &#x27;deodorants&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Much easier than getting to Sephora for the purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what I think of this</li>
            <li> I was also really itchy after a workout with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if I should stick with it until something happens or toss it, even though it was quite pricey for a deodorant</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant</li>
            <li> The price didn&#x27;t shock me too much since my go-to deodorant is about $10, and this was eligible for Prime shipping when I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I really like Lavanila deodorant.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the smell and the fact that there aren&#x27;t harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> All the others I&#x27;ve tried make my underarms sticky or irritated and didn&#x27;t really make deodorize.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Unlike with Weleda though, I really don&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was smelly to everyone around me, which was really embarrassing at work.  </li>
            <li> After a very strenuous workout, I have to wash and reapply, but I figure you&#x27;re going to have that issue with ANY deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My search for a chemical free deoderant that actually works continues.....</li>
            <li> I noticed that you need to really rub it in cus</li>
            <li> Wore off within four hours every time and once you started to smell, reapplying didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the price tag, but since I don&#x27;t have to slather it on like inexpensive natural deodorant, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use regular chemical filled deodorants</li>
            <li> and it lasts me almost the whole time and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants and found that this is one of my favorites to use.  </li>
            <li> I will order one more and hopefully it will not be broken because I do love the product.</li>
            <li> I have used every kind of antiperspirant, even clinical ones and would still find myself smelling after just a few hours even if i reapplied.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodarents and this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised that this 100% natural deodorant really works!!!</li>
            <li> If it works for you, you will be in luck because it is natural!!!</li>
            <li> It actually works, except on super hot days when I am out all day gardening or on the beach.  </li>
            <li> right near lymph nodes?  </li>
            <li> And overall, after having used it for 3 weeks now, during workouts and long laborious days, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I noticed pretty quickly after using it that I needed to reapply by mid/late afternoon, but I kind of expected that after reading other reviews and it did not bother me.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, and smell good, as there are not many choices for natural deodorants in the stores.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this deodorant would work well, considering how active I am.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of absorbing wetness</li>
            <li> It has a clean scent but does leave some white residue on clothes.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I always smell clean (even after a hot day, I didn&#x27;t ever smell &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34;) but the re-application cuts down on underarm wetness.</li>
            <li> , I could return it for a full refund&lt;br /&gt;- several hours after applying,</li>
            <li> This was my first adventure into natural deodorant, so I was not over-the-moon about it, but I would have recommended it and purchased it again,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat more than the average person, so it works well for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most recently I was using the crystal (both the actual crystal plus the spray) and at the end of the day, no matter how much I used, I STUNK.  </li>
            <li> I usually make my own deodorant</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this by itself, but it doesn&#x27;t make me sweat any less, nor does it mask the smell of my sweat.  </li>
            <li> I really have experienced less wetness, but what I am raving about is how even when I still sweat in my pits (though considerably LESS)</li>
            <li> I like smelling sweat free and being dry.</li>
            <li> decent.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one of LAVANILLA, I had a different scent before, I love this stuff, it works, its not sticky and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the Zinc thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used clinical protection deoderant for a few years and found that no matter what kind I tried, I seemed to have developed a sensitivity to it, causing my under arms to itch all the time.  </li>
            <li> I only use non aluminum deodorants and am constantly looking for something better.  </li>
            <li> , while natural, LAVANILLA does contain tea tree oil, which is not recommended for anyone with an estrogen positive cancer.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin healthy and not full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is like most other natural products - what works for some people doesn&#x27;t work for all people.  </li>
            <li> Other more natural deodorants have not worked at all for me.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and fresh!</li>
            <li> I noticed my underarms getting red and kind of raw, but I thought it was because I switched from an antiperspirant to a deodorant and that they were just more wet from sweat during the day (thus the redness).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; deodorants over the last year or so, and I was really excited when I read all the positive reviews for this one.  </li>
            <li> I have paid attention to the instructions - important not to apply to wet underarms.</li>
            <li> This natural product really works ..</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to try a natural deodorant because I&#x27;ve heard that they do not work as well..</li>
            <li> It honestly caused my skin to become bright red, itchy and painful.</li>
            <li> Many have been too sticky and just doesn&#x27;t work at odor protection after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I have been outside all day in 95 degree heat, and still feel/smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> You will still sweat (which is normal), but this takes care of any unwanted scents associated with the sweat.</li>
            <li> , it works, it does leave white marks and it lasts for a long time so actually it is a better value than I thought.has lessened with use</li>
            <li> , it works, it does leave white marks and it lasts for a long time so actually it is a better value than I thought.</li>
            <li> The deo is shaped round, (not oval like the aluminum deo&#x27;s out there) and I wish it was more oval for easier application.</li>
            <li> The coconut is ok too, but avoid the others if you don&#x27;t like heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> During a normal work day I come home and am not smelly at all.  </li>
            <li> like  a normal deo</li>
            <li> An interesting point is I was having some unusual body odor and discovered it was one of my supplements: too much choline bitartrate in my B-100 complex capsules.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant, not great.</li>
            <li> I use it right after I shower at night and then again the next day.</li>
            <li> I was debating over which to buy and was going to buy the plain lavender until I saw many comments saying it smelled like baby powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much more mellow, soft, but not sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great for the first few hours but fades by late afternoon.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve used a bunch, and live in the south.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be switching to something new.</li>
            <li> had Lavanila been of assistance in exchanging my defective product for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 15-20 natural deodorants, most of which I disliked.</li>
            <li> I will still use Lavanilla when I don&#x27;t have time for the Thai to dry or when I want a quick, good-smelling &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li> I was almost about to give up on the whole natural deodorant thing but one of my goals for 2015 was to completely cut out unnatural products</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> Fast ship, exactly as expected, easy open packaging</li>
            <li> I also tried pit putty and that smelled great but left me smelling even worse afterward.</li>
            <li> I am still in search of a non-aluminum product for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my skin, which is very sensitive, but this burnt my skin...</li>
            <li> When looking for natural deodorants, I&#x27;ve found that the problem is that most are not strongly scented, and quite frankly, that&#x27;s what deodorant is all about.  </li>
            <li> The first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 by accident and thought I would return the extra but will be keeping it when I run out of the first Lavanilla.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> However, if you are willing to pay for it and can find it locally it&#x27;s definitely a quality product that works.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try other scents from this company.</li>
            <li> So I switched to Desert Essence from Sprouts and now having the same exact problem..grrr..</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Perhaps due to the creamy consistency I actually felt as though I sweat more than wearing nothing at all while wearing this.</li>
            <li> Not sticky like other clean products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The nice dry powdery feel is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in regular packaging - I have used other natural deoderants that come in a pot or tin where you apply it with your fingers.</li>
            <li> and I did not feel clean after being active.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works!</li>
            <li> First natural deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with strong smells causing headaches</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling natural!</li>
            <li> body wash is only 15$ plus shipping, why is the deodorant more for less product?</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no sticky feeling when applying, NO white marks at all, and it completely masks odor and wetness throughout the day (even better than any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used, oddly).</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a highly effective/pleasant smelling all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> really want a natural deodorant and thought this was the answer, but now I&#x27;m back on the search!</li>
            <li> and would definitely recommend it to anyone like me who wants to transition to all natural products.  </li>
            <li> For this much money I expected a much richer, lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I would classify my skin as sensitive, but never in my life have I had a reaction to deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have found that during the day, especially when I&#x27;m running around and very stressed my underarms are not as drenched as before.</li>
            <li> This is a soft scent and works for me.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of it being all natural, but was looking for a nicer scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like wearing nothing nearly immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and feminine without being too girly or floral.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have to reapply mid-day but not everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for an all natural deodorant for YEARS</li>
            <li> In fact, it seemed to make my natural odors worse/more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I switched to geodeo natural deodorant and the redness completely went away.</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant doesn&#x27;t smell like deodorant and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky like regular deodorant does, and that it&#x27;s much easier to wash off.</li>
            <li> I really think a lot of whether it works or not has to do with body chemistry, so I&#x27;d suggest trying a number of different brands.</li>
            <li> Being all natural provides peace of mind.  </li>
            <li> Since removing things like refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, processed carbohydrates, etc., and adding more fresh fruits and veggies, I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the way my sweat smells.</li>
            <li> but my skin is so sensitive it gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> Lavanila may be natural but it&#x27;s also over-rated and and over-priced.</li>
            <li> smelled old I threw it out</li>
            <li> and I was really fed up with my hubby constantly complaining about my mustiness.</li>
            <li> So did my research and found out about natural deodorant brand Lavanila.</li>
            <li> More expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural ingredients and works and keeps my pits pretty dry.</li>
            <li> It is NOT fragrance free - and I had a worse reacting to this than many other fragranced products.</li>
            <li> The Lavender Vanilla scent is definitely my favorite - the grapefruit scent was a little strange.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of natural deodorant and it is the first one to actually work!</li>
            <li> Previously I had used Burt&#x27;s Bees (ok for a couple of hours), Tom&#x27;s (worthless), and a brand I found on Etsy that I can no longer remember the name of (had to be applied by hand, so wasn&#x27;t as convenient, though worked great).  </li>
            <li> It pretty much wastes a whole stick</li>
            <li> I do notice that I have to apply it a couple of times a day to stay fresh smelling-especially of active-</li>
            <li> The results with LaVanila are no better on those days, but I would rather spend more on a product that works just as well as a traditional deodorant but doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals/aluminum in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this happen with some natural deodorants like Tom&#x27;s, but didn&#x27;t expect it from this product as no other reviews seem to mention it.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for several years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The plain vanilla scent was too masculine  and the grapefruit or pomegranate was too sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but seems to last and work and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but ever since I was a kid I struggled with being a pretty smelly girl, but not necessarily really sweaty.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a white residue, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with.</li>
            <li> After a while, the product seems to dry out and gets very chalky.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed things were feeling a bit more wet</li>
            <li> This works just like regular deodorant, but all natural!</li>
            <li> On active days, not so much!</li>
            <li> I saw this in a large chain store and I was curious about it and wanted to give it a try cus for years</li>
            <li> It goes on very creamy, which I&#x27;m not used to (I wish it went on thinner), and dries to a very dry powder.</li>
            <li> broke out under arm after using could be an allergic reaction but it was bad  smells great bit</li>
            <li> I am going back to old spice, even though it isn&#x27;t natural, because so far it is the only deodorant without aluminum that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on clothing.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so it&#x27;s not good enough to replace my industrial strength deo/anti-perspirant on a full-schedule day here in Arizona, but it keeps my pits unscented through a night of sleep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried all of the natural deodorants and the only one that works is homemade coconut oil based deodorant.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind having to re-apply numerous times throughout the day and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you might like this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last overnight but considering that its natural - I&#x27;ll take it.  </li>
            <li> But for now I&#x27;ll go back to my old Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant (without aluminum.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stick with natural, non-antiperspirant for about a year now, and this was the third one I tried and stuck with for almost 7 months.  </li>
            <li> I sweat moderately and this natural deodorant keeps up with me.</li>
            <li> I only use natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I know people question how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; it can be, but it&#x27;s natural enough for me (no aluminum?</li>
            <li> Even in the winter, this wore off by 3pm and left me self conscious about my stank.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin and have noticed a vast improvement in smoothness and moisturization in the skin on my underarms since I began using this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search for a natural deodorant that actually works and have tried dozens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a natural deo that would actually work.</li>
            <li> So you should definitely give it a try if you are looking for a natural deodorant with no harmful substances that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that actually works for some time now.</li>
            <li> but it is enough to make me feel self conscious and is why I no longer use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only vegan and natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> However, like all natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, I sometimes have to put more on in the late afternoon, so it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I wish it did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to keep you dry in the high heat of summer, but you will not have body odor.  </li>
            <li> This worked really, really well for a natural deodorant for a little while, but then it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells much like other lavendar products - with a bit of a warmth to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LaVanila for the past 2 years, including very hot sweaty Texas summers.</li>
            <li> I am a stay at home active mom and after a day of using this product i am dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> After MONTHS of testing various natural deodorants I&#x27;ve finally found the one that can keep my BO in check!</li>
            <li> So difficult to find something more natural but that works and this one does.</li>
            <li> So I sought out a natural solution and stumbled upon this on a beauty retailer site (where it is more expensive).  </li>
            <li> I am very active and this is the only non-aluminum deodorant that I have found that consistently works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect natural deodorant and only stumbled upon this one after having a very violent reaction to Primal Pit Paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey for a deodorant, but after exhausting every other kind I could get my hands on</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time for a natural deodorant that actually worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- an empty container feels almost as heavy as a full container, but one stick lasts for several months.</li>
            <li> It smells very cheap - like a fake vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I workout out every single day and this deoderant is the only in natural dept that works during and after a sweat session.</li>
            <li> On some of my more brutal workouts and on some particularly hot days on a vacation I felt it didn&#x27;t live up to my non-natural deodorant alternative.</li>
            <li> My underarms are less wet and MOST IMPORTANTLY no longer stinky!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other natural deoderants and they were all useless.</li>
            <li> Once the minimal scent wears off you smell like nothing at all but just clean skin and it lasts for at least an entire day.</li>
            <li> I vastly prefer other natural products.</li>
            <li> - my only critique is that its pretty expensive and finishes fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other natural deodorants and always found them lacking.  </li>
            <li> although it is more expensive it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough though.  </li>
            <li> (probably overuse it because of the other &#x27;natural&#x27; ones not working) and it does last a long time,</li>
            <li> I am completely dissatisfied with the product packaging (and Lavanila customer service) because after using the product for 2 weeks, the mechanism to roll the deodorant up, stopped working, so I was left with my previous deodorant.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s super expensive, and it&#x27;s not as natural as they want you to think.</li>
            <li> It really just smells like deodorant with a small hint of lavender.</li>
            <li> Had a strange &amp;#34;new car smell&amp;#34; mixed with lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> it is a white stick deodorant and will leave a white residue on my underarms, so I have to be careful to avoid getting it on the outside of my clothing when dressing&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no big deal to me as long as it&#x27;s doing its job</li>
            <li> By themselves, the essential oils don&#x27;t deodorize long, but the combination of EOs and Lavanila seem to do the trick.]  </li>
            <li> It does not last long.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it but found myself constantly re-applying in order to stay fresh and my search for natural yet long lasting deodorant continues :(</li>
            <li> But a few weeks ago, I developed an irritation that actually started to peel the skin.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very important to me, so this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The downside is that if I am active it only last me 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy but I love the scent of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> While I wanted to love this and did love the scent, it unfortunately gave me a pretty terrible allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several with not much luck.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Does not control perspiration or smell all day long</li>
            <li> I have never gotten a rash from any product, I am not sensitive at all??</li>
            <li> This product works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A long day at work and a trip to the gym?  </li>
            <li> Controls body odor minimally, but this is the only deodorant that I don&#x27;t have a reaction to (sulfite intolerance) that controls body odor at all.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work for a long day.</li>
            <li> I took this on a week long camping trip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that I sweat just as long as there is odor control</li>
            <li> After I showered I rubbed it in for few strokes (thinking it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> However when doing long (one hour) workouts it wears off before the end.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut odor for long.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that this is kind of expensive-</li>
            <li> Not sure about it overall yet - when I got hot this afternoon, my pits felt a little wet &amp; sticky</li>
            <li> i only went with this one bc all the reviews of the other ones</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s not exactly working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pricey but lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This product is dry when applied and works well even in the 80-90 degree days that we are having.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s already dry.</li>
            <li> It is a creamy roll on and at times appears to get a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> I even worked out for about an hour; it kept me dry and kept the odor away for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different things, I&#x27;ve looked around at some different types, so I have some idea of what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for deodorant, and I really wish it lasted longer, but hey... what&#x27;s $20 for using a natural product that won&#x27;t give you cancer.</li>
            <li> the only deodorant (without all of the icky stuff) we&#x27;ve found to work so far...</li>
            <li> Back to conventional deodorant for me.</li>
            <li> On a relatively cool day with limited activity, I found that the deoderant failed substantially.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on clear, so I would usually apply it immediately after getting out of the shower so that my body heat would \\&quot;melt\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li> I had been using Lavanila&#x27;s Vanilla Lavender deodorant for the past two years when I switched to natural deodorant after years of underarm irritation.</li>
            <li> It ends up smelling like sweet weird B.O.  </li>
            <li> Carrageenan, although naturally derived, has the known side effect of  inflammation when ingested, which is “a root cause” of a number of serious illnesses, such as Heart disease,  Gastrointestinal disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Diabetes, and Cancer.  </li>
            <li> For the price it should come in larger size though, hence not full 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY SINGLE BRAND at the market counter!</li>
            <li> Certainly as well as an aluminium-based, unhealthy product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this does tend to wear off after several hours of very active work, so I have begun to use a combo of Thai Crystal deodorant spray as a primer, the LIGHT formula of the lavender Primal Pit Paste jar (because I had such a violent reaction to the regular strength stick formula), and then I keep this product in my purse for touch-ups throughout the day!</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just isn&#x27;t a lovely lavender vanilla like I expected.</li>
            <li> The product smells great when you put it on, but after awhile it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I mean I like Lavender, but sometimes it can be a little much.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no protection after about thirty minutes.  </li>
            <li> , it goes on feeling a bit wet</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It goes on extremely wet.</li>
            <li> and now I find I have an odor  when wearing this even after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s and kiss my face just do not hold up on stench absorbing power, and kiss my face leaves irritating residue.</li>
            <li> So far I have no experienced it staining my clothes or leaving white flakes on my underarms after application.</li>
            <li> Keeps dry and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> It not only doesn&#x27;t create a rash; it cures the rash you had from the previous deodorant!</li>
            <li> Its not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a crusade to find the right &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant for myself and my teenage daughter and after having tried with great disappointment a few less expensive products (Almy and Arm &amp; Hammer) we decided to buy the expensive stuff thinking that it may end our search.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are looking for a better alternative to terrible aluminum antiperspirants!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this deodorant 5 stars is that the price is pretty crazy, though no fault of Amazon.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I ended up having to stop using it after about a week and a half because it started giving me a bad rash.</li>
            <li> The other organic deodorants do not compare.</li>
            <li> I have used other scents too and the Lavender is</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m staying free and clear from the nasty chemicals in regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> Given the price point, I just can&#x27;t justify paying shipping &amp; handling and tax to buy it on other beauty sites</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying other scents.</li>
            <li> Have tried Tom&#x27;s, Trader Joe&#x27;s, and one other whose name I don&#x27;t recall.</li>
            <li> I tried the crystal and all of the other brands, they did nothing.</li>
            <li> Never in my life did I feel so much wetness and had bad odor when using a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> My hormones get all crazy while breastfeeding and, for some reason, that means stinky pits even if I&#x27;m not sweaty...even if I had a shower 20 min ago - this is the only deodorant I have found (I must have tried 20 including homemade) that really combats the funk.  </li>
            <li> I will say though that sometimes body odor can be a sign of something not right in your diet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has become harder to find in local stores (my local Sephora stopped carrying it) and on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> A sour smell by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I wish the price would go down as $14 is quite pricey</li>
            <li> I would also say that prior to trying natural deodorants, I used Secret, and found that by the end of my worst stressful/hot days, I would smell a little - not horrible BO or anything, but needing a shower.  </li>
            <li> Will probably supplement with a regular antiperspirant every few days in the summer but at least I won&#x27;t be dosing my pits with toxic chemicals every day like I used to.</li>
            <li> Their price is about $5 less than Sephora charges.</li>
            <li> In fact, I felt as though I smelled LESS wearing nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I also feel like I sweat less wearing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying desperately to find a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers stated, it does not stop underarm odor...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing for my daughter too who&#x27;s really active and in a few sports.</li>
            <li> I would still sweat every now and then on very active days or stressful days, but there was no body odor.</li>
            <li> (I hate strong perfume smells myself and don&#x27;t want to offend others</li>
            <li> Little did I know..</li>
            <li> You still sweat a little bit but it does its job</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried it and not sure I will due to the smell.</li>
            <li> that odd, faintly-chemical smell regular deodorant leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> Beware of non-natural deoderants please, I know they are far less expensive</li>
            <li> After a few hours I started smelling a little like &amp;#34;old cheese&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was the first non aluminum deodorant I had tried in a couple years after taking a hiatus due to being disappointed with the effectiveness of previous ones I tried.</li>
            <li> Disappointingly, I have not had much luck once I apply it.  </li>
            <li> I discontinued use and went back to my Secret Clinical Strength and the rash went away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t thrown it out, but have switched to Thai Crystal for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> To accomplish that, I have to reapply a few times a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using regular drugstore deodorants - Secret, Lady Speed Stick, etc.</li>
            <li> (just a 30-minute session on an ellyptical and a few machines</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and the canister lasts me over 2 months</li>
            <li> They all wore off after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having trouble getting this in Australia</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Actually made me worse off than when I used nothing.</li>
            <li> The vanilla fragrance seems to die out after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Usually, my underarms will have a slight odor just from sleeping</li>
            <li> finally a all natural deo that works, I usually stink and stink bad, and this worked.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong odor</li>
            <li> not going to last all day but worth it to not expose your body to horrible chemicals I work 12 hour shifts</li>
            <li> I do sweat more with this but not an insane amount, however if you do sweat a lot</li>
            <li> Also, no more itching underarm.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is a shelf life problem, a container problem or just the way it is&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both times the packing failed when the twist part would never actually raise the product.</li>
            <li> I bought a small sample sized one at Sephora two years ago and have used since then.</li>
            <li> After a rigorous day, I pick up a small hint of what could be BO</li>
            <li> I have been moving away from non organic products this past year</li>
            <li> I have been using Weleda for a few years and do like it but couldn&#x27;t resist the vanilla scent when I saw this product at Sephora!</li>
            <li> and I am not sure this won&#x27;t give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also a very heavy scent and is almost musky.</li>
            <li> I do have slightly sensitive skin, but this is by far the worst reaction I&#x27;ve had to anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also less irritating - no more itching.  </li>
            <li> Few weeks to a month of using it I got an awful rash exactly like the rashes I used to get from conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> I also found that my armpits were not as dark as when I used Secret deodorant.</li>
            <li> Sadly, as a sweaty person who does indeed smell when she sweats, this did not live up to my hopes and dreams.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I think I might find something a little bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> The product was not effective.</li>
            <li> I had to re-apply at least three times a day - and it&#x27;s winter time,</li>
            <li> However, the biggest disappointment of all was how this deodorant burned my armpits and made them all red and blotchy, like a rash.</li>
            <li> Nothing horribly painful, just tender, but I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin and this has never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> And at least for me this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> in fact, I smelled worse after a few hours after putting it on, then when wearing nothing at all.</li>
            <li> will never go bk to ordinary toxic deodorant!</li>
            <li> so I do find myself applying this about 2x a day instead of my usual 1x with Secret deodorant.</li>
            <li> Antiperspirants are bad for you because they do not allow you to sweat and are being studied for their potential link to breast cancer in women.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this product from Sephora, but i&#x27;ve seen lots of bad comments about it since.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deoderant a few months and sadly it seems with time my body has got used to it in some way</li>
            <li> Very painful, very unsightly.</li>
            <li> The smell after using it is not pleasant</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> ( she had been previously using Vodka as she was desperate.)</li>
            <li> Not happy with the hype nor the lack of customer service.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I almost always smell, which I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed since my hopes were high on this one.</li>
            <li> After half a day you start smelling bad from the deodorant...</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Aluminum isn&#x27;t the only bad deodorant ingredient, people!</li>
            <li> I hated having to raise my arms, and this is sometimes necessary as I take a commute train to/from</li>
            <li> Wasted $14 :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The vanilla note is very weak</li>
            <li> I have he vanilla scented deodorant, but it was difficult to get the lavender scent.    </li>
            <li> weird - what are they going to do with used deodorant besides throw it out?)</li>
            <li> but not perfect-</li>
            <li> This smell is horrible and as a deodorant it does not last.</li>
            <li> It seems there&#x27;s some sort of weird, musky scent underneath the lavender</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago and was skeptical to try it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they were all dashed.</li>
            <li> sweaty girl nothing crazy</li>
            <li> Kinda of an awkward smell.</li>
            <li> Had to throw this expensive stuff in the trash. :(((</li>
            <li> And why is this so expensive?!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> I no longer get the bad odor associated with perspiration in my underarms.</li>
            <li> Painful rash in both armpits that cleared when I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Super disappointed and will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> - I hate that feeling.  </li>
            <li> I hate powder scent, so if you are like me, I do not recomend this scent.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I did not smell bad!</li>
            <li> Extremely painful!</li>
            <li> everyone kept saying it smelled horrible</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> decent.  nothing great.  the vanilla grapefruit smells better.</li>
            <li> The smell is so amazing &amp; refreshing .</li>
            <li> This worked really, really well for a natural deodorant for a little while, but then it stopped working.  Once the weather changed and it was warmer outside, LaVanila just didn&#x27;t cut it (and I do not sweat very much at all).  I&#x27;ve now tried all of the natural deodorants and the only one that works is homemade coconut oil based deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this as much as you can love a non antiperspirant deodorant. It is the closest texture wise to the real deal. The nice dry powdery feel is long lasting. My only qualm is the sent, although very nice, is very light. I prefer a more perfume sent, But its not a deal breaker. I keep one of these babies on me all the time for touch ups. Best Ive found so far</li>
            <li> Good. Its a DEODORANT remember...not an antiperspirant.  Very healthy</li>
            <li> While I wanted to love this and did love the scent, it unfortunately gave me a pretty terrible allergic reaction. I would classify my skin as sensitive, but never in my life have I had a reaction to deodorant. I have bought every kind under the sun, including antiperspirant, and never had an issue. This caused a red rash breakout where it had been applied, though it took about two weeks to develop. I discontinued use and went back to my Secret Clinical Strength and the rash went away. Then I used this Lavanila again and the rash came back within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the reaction, the scent is really nice and it goes on easily (though it does feel somewhat &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as other reviewers described). I felt it gave good enough protection 90% of the time. On some of my more brutal workouts and on some particularly hot days on a vacation I felt it didn&#x27;t live up to my non-natural deodorant alternative. I don&#x27;t sweat much, so not having antiperspirant qualities is fine, but the deodorant part still could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want a natural deodorant and thought this was the answer, but now I&#x27;m back on the search!</li>
            <li> I have tried over 15-20 natural deodorants, most of which I disliked. Being a hairstylist, it is crucial I have something that works well. Who wants to smell stinky armpits while getting their hair done?! This deodorant rocks. It smells lovely and lasts all day, most days.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a better alternative to terrible aluminum antiperspirants!</li>
            <li> The product was not effective. On a relatively cool day with limited activity, I found that the deoderant failed substantially. I am still in search of a non-aluminum product for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Working great during the heat of summer. No underarm odor at all. On super hot days you may have to reapply 1x. I have paid attention to the instructions - important not to apply to wet underarms. As for the scent, it is lovely. I don&#x27;t want my deodorant to smell like perfume!</li>
            <li> I have tried Tom&#x27;s and it simply does not work. I work in a restaurant, so I really need a good deodorant. This works just like regular deodorant, but all natural! Keeps dry and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> It smells nice enough, but this deodorant does not give you all-day protection. I had to re-apply at least three times a day - and it&#x27;s winter time, so I can only imagine what it would be like in the summer (yuck!). On top of that, I ended up having to stop using it after about a week and a half because it started giving me a bad rash. To be fair, I do have very sensitive skin though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind having to re-apply numerous times throughout the day and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you might like this product. I didn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be buying it again - I&#x27;m going to try Lavilin.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, works most of the time.</li>
            <li> Awesome for a natural deodorant. May have to reapply once on a really hot day but holds up really well compared to others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised that this 100% natural deodorant really works!!! I really like the lavender scent too...it&#x27;s not too strong but just right. I&#x27;ll be purchasing for my daughter too who&#x27;s really active and in a few sports.</li>
            <li> I wanted the lavender scent from this excellent nontoxic deodorant.  I have he vanilla scented deodorant, but it was difficult to get the lavender scent.    Upon receiving the lavender scented deodorant, I compared it to the vanilla scented deodorant (both LAVANILA the healthy deodorants) - there was no difference.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Gave it 2 stars for the smell. Loved it. But after 10 days of trying I had to go back to my traditional dove deodorant. I;m bummed it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Smells great and BO never gets through, however it feels a bit wet from the moment you apply on, all day. So if you are ok with that, then this product would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> smells great and goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  One container has lasted me exactly 6 months! I had the vanilla lavendar and love the scent of it.  Best of all though, it works.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of others that don&#x27;t work for me but this one holds up an 8 hour shift of retail work very well.  I&#x27;m buying another one now. Definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: October 2012. Just discovered it has carrageenan in. When I first purchased this I hadn&#x27;t been made aware of the dangers of carrageenan.  Shame it&#x27;s in there as I loved the product, but will no longer be using it due to this.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no protection after about thirty minutes.  I noticed I started to smell and sweat after a short time.  The deodorant itself smells nice but that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;ve since switched to Weleda Sage and that seems to work a lot better.</li>
            <li> The first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works! I wish they dropped the vanilla in the scent, though. Not crazy about the smell, so have to wear perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this by itself, but it doesn&#x27;t make me sweat any less, nor does it mask the smell of my sweat.  It ends up smelling like sweet weird B.O.  I got it from Sephora but had to return it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone thru Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Kiss My Face and this By FAR is the BEST Natural deodorant out there!&lt;br /&gt;i used to use Dove before i switched to a cruelty free lifestyle and WOW this Deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it goes on feeling a bit wet but that goes away quick and really really helps with the order and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I work 12 hour shift job in manufacturing and i do not need to reapply!&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sweaty girl nothing crazy but this does help me. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad i only went with this one bc all the reviews of the other ones everyone kept saying it smelled horrible so eh I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;This is a MUST BUY PEOPLES!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who was having some underarm pains. We had her switch to this which doesn&#x27;t have any alumina in it and her pains went away. We are very happy with the performance and the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This lavender-vanilla deodorant is the best of its kind. Created in a laboratory for people who are sensitive to regular antiperspirant deodorants, it is very effective, smells wonderful and lasts all day and all night. It not only doesn&#x27;t create a rash; it cures the rash you had from the previous deodorant! It also makes your skin nice and soft. It .doesn&#x27;t smell strong like lavender; it just has a wonderful fragrance that everyone seems to like. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this because its a clean, 100% natural deodorant. The problem is its scent doesn&#x27;t help to cover odor and it leaves too much residue for me to shell out that much cash. I still gave it 3 stars because it will be good for people who demand a chemical-free deodorant but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Wish the scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I have looked for ages for a naural non chemical deodorant that WORKS and this does.  I am totally sold on this product and will nver go back to the chemical deodorants.  I am a happy camper</li>
            <li> Smells good at first but does not hold up to sweat.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve tried several with not much luck.  Many have been too sticky and just doesn&#x27;t work at odor protection after a few hours.  This product is dry when applied and works well even in the 80-90 degree days that we are having.  I would say you can get 12 hours, but may need to reapply after that.  It doesn&#x27;t last overnight but considering that its natural - I&#x27;ll take it.  I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> This was a great find! I took a shot and ordered it based on the ingredients. I was not disappointed!  It has a wonderful scent and it keeps me smelling fresh and dry all day.  It goes on smooth and easy and never shows on my skin or on my clothes.  I also tried the Vanilla Grapefruit and same thing...smells good and works great &#x3D;) I will continue to reorder.  I bought it as gifts for friends and they have continued to you it as well.</li>
            <li> This deodorant lasts day and night!  Previous reviewers mentioned that the spray didn&#x27;t work, but this roll on deodorant is truly the best.  I have been outside all day in 95 degree heat, and still feel/smell fresh.  You will still sweat (which is normal), but this takes care of any unwanted scents associated with the sweat.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but it did not meet my expectations.  It smells very cheap - like a fake vanilla scent. It is also a very heavy scent and is almost musky. If you tend to gravitate towards fresher scents, this is not for you.  I ended up buying Avalon organics deodorants which are more citrusey and light.</li>
            <li> Smells great and so far so good with no B.O. by end of the day. I was worried but it&#x27;s really a good product. I will say I have not tried it yet working out at the gym.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging it is very cute and girly! The smell is quite nice, I live in a hot climate so I do find myself applying this about 2x a day instead of my usual 1x with Secret deodorant. I do sweat more with this but not an insane amount, however if you do sweat a lot I would not recommend this. I also found that my armpits were not as dark as when I used Secret deodorant. Overall great buy if your looking for a natural deodorant!! :)</li>
            <li> broke out under arm after using could be an allergic reaction but it was bad  smells great bit just cant use</li>
            <li> This is my second one of LAVANILLA, I had a different scent before, I love this stuff, it works, its not sticky and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the Zinc thing.</li>
            <li> This was the first &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant I bought.  It really works well and smells great, but then my aunt called to my attention that it contains carrageenan.  Carrageenan, although naturally derived, has the known side effect of  inflammation when ingested, which is “a root cause” of a number of serious illnesses, such as Heart disease,  Gastrointestinal disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Diabetes, and Cancer.  How good can it be to use it under your arms, right near lymph nodes?  I haven&#x27;t thrown it out, but have switched to Thai Crystal for everyday use.  I will still use Lavanilla when I don&#x27;t have time for the Thai to dry or when I want a quick, good-smelling &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34;, since Thai Crystal has no scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this deodorant! I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect natural deodorant and only stumbled upon this one after having a very violent reaction to Primal Pit Paste. I was almost about to give up on the whole natural deodorant thing but one of my goals for 2015 was to completely cut out unnatural products so I decided to try this deodorant as a last ditch effort. I&#x27;m very glad I did! This deodorant smells really great and works well to keep you smelling good all day. It&#x27;s also really smooth going on and has a nice gentle formula so your armpits aren&#x27;t getting irritated. Very happy with this and would definitely recommend it to anyone like me who wants to transition to all natural products.  ***Update!*** I&#x27;ve gone through a whole stick of deodorant and have since ordered another. I&#x27;ve found that this does tend to wear off after several hours of very active work, so I have begun to use a combo of Thai Crystal deodorant spray as a primer, the LIGHT formula of the lavender Primal Pit Paste jar (because I had such a violent reaction to the regular strength stick formula), and then I keep this product in my purse for touch-ups throughout the day! Still a great product and I will definitely keep buying it because it is gentle, smells great and is convenient in stick form, but in the Florida summer heat this alone just isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> Wanted a safe deodorant without aluminum which has proven to be unsafe.</li>
            <li> Found this product awesome to use.  I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants and found that this is one of my favorites to use.  I use the Crystal and another product but thought I would give this one a try.  I wish the price would go down as $14 is quite pricey but the results are fantastic.  I bought 2 by accident and thought I would return the extra but will be keeping it when I run out of the first Lavanilla.</li>
            <li> For me the deodorant did not work. At all. And the lovely fragrance I was looking forward to was so faint as to be basically nonexistant. I really wanted it to work, and smell good, as there are not many choices for natural deodorants in the stores. But for now I&#x27;ll go back to my old Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant (without aluminum.)</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just isn&#x27;t a lovely lavender vanilla like I expected. Instead, it smells more like soap. Fragrance is very important to me, so this was a disappointment. For this much money I expected a much richer, lavender scent. However, the biggest disappointment of all was how this deodorant burned my armpits and made them all red and blotchy, like a rash. I&#x27;ve had this happen with some natural deodorants like Tom&#x27;s, but didn&#x27;t expect it from this product as no other reviews seem to mention it. Very painful, very unsightly. I do have slightly sensitive skin, but this is by far the worst reaction I&#x27;ve had to anything. Extremely painful!</li>
            <li> Was happy with the results for a natural deodorant.  Have tried many and this is the first one I liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many brands of all-natural deodorant and this one is by far my favorite. Goes on well and smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought the Vanilla Grapefruit version with very high hopes.  It smells wonderful in its container, not a sweet smell, but more earthy and natural than most vanilla-scented products.  Disappointingly, I have not had much luck once I apply it.  I find that the vanilla smell fades pretty quickly, after about a half-hour, and is replaced by a baby-powdery smell.  After about an hour or two, I can smell my underarm odor over the deodorant.  Unlike crystal deodorants, Lavanila&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t block underarm odors from forming, it attempts to cover them with stronger smells.  To accomplish that, I have to reapply a few times a day. Overall, I expected a more effective product, especially given the price, and will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant before but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Now I know why. It doesn&#x27;t work well. After half a day you start smelling bad from the deodorant...not because you&#x27;re sweating.</li>
            <li> The smell after using it is not pleasant and I did not feel clean after being active.</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients. $15 is a fair price to pay for deodorant but it lasts quite a while. Of all three this one is my favorite scent. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; deodorant smell.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. Had a strange &amp;#34;new car smell&amp;#34; mixed with lavender fragrance. After a few hours I started smelling a little like &amp;#34;old cheese&amp;#34;. Had to throw this expensive stuff in the trash. :(((</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time for a natural deodorant that actually worked. This one is great! The application is smooth, and I like the fragrance. Definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderfully scented product. I just love the soft fragrance and would recommend it. Glides on like velvet.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve used clinical protection deoderant for a few years and found that no matter what kind I tried, I seemed to have developed a sensitivity to it, causing my under arms to itch all the time.  So I sought out a natural solution and stumbled upon this on a beauty retailer site (where it is more expensive).  I ended up purchasing it that way, didn&#x27;t think to get it on Amazon -- I definitely will next time.  The scent smells much like other lavendar products - with a bit of a warmth to it.  It lasts a long time.  And since it&#x27;s natural, it isn&#x27;t inhibiting the sweat - which actually in turn causes your body to be more balanced in how much you sweat.  I rarely sweat anymore, and the fresh scent lasts the whole day.  Also, no more itching underarm.  It took about a week for that to completely subside, but I&#x27;m so glad it did.  I have also noticed that I get a cleaner, softer shave on my underarms since starting to use this deoderant.  It keeps the skin healthy and not full of chemicals.  Great stuff, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a nice smell, but just couldn&#x27;t mask the smell of sweat after working out or doing anything that made me feel nervous. I am going back to old spice, even though it isn&#x27;t natural, because so far it is the only deodorant without aluminum that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> The lavender vanilla scent smells heavenly!  Not sure about it overall yet - when I got hot this afternoon, my pits felt a little wet &amp; sticky - I hate that feeling.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t claim to be an anti-perspirant.  I saw that another reviewer said to rub baking soda on your pits before applying this &amp; that it works very well.  I give this 5 stars for scent (really - it&#x27;s luscious) but at this point, I say 3 stars for function.  And why is this so expensive?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna start out by raving about this product! My underarms are less wet and MOST IMPORTANTLY no longer stinky! I have tried EVERY SINGLE BRAND at the market counter! I have gone through EVERY deodorant on Target&#x27;s deodorant shelves--LITERALLY. I have found that during the day, especially when I&#x27;m running around and very stressed my underarms are not as drenched as before. I really have experienced less wetness, but what I am raving about is how even when I still sweat in my pits (though considerably LESS) I no longer get the bad odor associated with perspiration in my underarms. I use it right after I shower at night and then again the next day. I love how the product is not like a gel or liquid. As soon as I apply the product it&#x27;s already dry. So far I have no experienced it staining my clothes or leaving white flakes on my underarms after application. This product feels really light, smooth and applies DRY onto skin. I am SO HAPPY I FINALLY FOUND MY DEODORANT THAT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I have tried 3-4 deodorants without all the harmful chemicals.  This one is by far the best I have used.  It is pricey but lasts a very long time.  It is a creamy roll on and at times appears to get a bit dry.  I just rub a tissue across the surface before applying. An interesting point is I was having some unusual body odor and discovered it was one of my supplements: too much choline bitartrate in my B-100 complex capsules.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; deodorants over the last year or so, and I was really excited when I read all the positive reviews for this one.  It smells really nice, feels very good on my skin... but doesn&#x27;t help me not to smell sweaty.  I can sniff and smell myself under the fragrance of the product, which kinda defeats the purpose.  This is like most other natural products - what works for some people doesn&#x27;t work for all people.  I&#x27;m very disappointed since my hopes were high on this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried every &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant out there.  This is by far the best and most like traditional anti-persperants.  This goes on silky like a traditional deodorant and smells great.  I have tried the salt rock, the pastes and this is my favorite.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Allergic to fragrance blend in this. It is NOT fragrance free - and I had a worse reacting to this than many other fragranced products. Painful rash in both armpits that cleared when I stopped using it. Lavanila offered me a refund if I sent back the deodorant - which would have been cost prohibitive (and weird - what are they going to do with used deodorant besides throw it out?) Not happy with the hype nor the lack of customer service.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this deodorant for a week but I am very pleased.  I love the fragrance and it has worked beautifully for my need.  I feel reassured that it is 100% natural and thrilled it has essential oils.  The product arrived promptly with my prime membership.</li>
            <li> This works. Love it. A new healthy alternative</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels silky smooth, but doesn&#x27;t last long. 😞</li>
            <li> This one is great! The scent is perfect and this really really works! The other organic deodorants do not compare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stick with natural, non-antiperspirant for about a year now, and this was the third one I tried and stuck with for almost 7 months.  The fragrance is pleasant, and I like it better than their plain vanilla (which smells kind of fake chemical vanilla-y) or their lemon vanilla (which smells a bit too masculine on me).  That said, this stuff worked just okay- I had to apply in the evening after showering, and in the morning before getting ready for the day. If I forgot the morning swipe? It was a one way ticket to Reektown, population: me.   Even when I did the morning application, by the time I reached the end of the day I was somewhere in the range of &amp;#34;not fresh&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;actually kind of stinky&amp;#34; depending on the level of activity I had as well as the fabric I wore (cotton was best, synthetics not so much). Either way, I wasn&#x27;t eager to push my armpits at someone&#x27;s face.  But a few weeks ago, I developed an irritation that actually started to peel the skin. Nothing horribly painful, just tender, but I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin and this has never happened to me before. So took a week off this to give my skin a rest, hoping that the irritation was maybe from overzealous shaving, and gave it a try again. Same deal, the irritation started again.  Oh well. I was thinking I should probably try something else since this was just okay but not perfect- my body just gave me the push I needed to actually follow through!</li>
            <li> Wanted to give up the aluminum based deodorants since all the info came out about their link to cancer.  This is a soft scent and works for me.</li>
            <li> Does not control perspiration or smell all day long</li>
            <li> I have to reapply, but it works really well for a healthier deordorant and I really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Works for me! I sweat moderately and this natural deodorant keeps up with me. I am a stay at home active mom and after a day of using this product i am dry and fresh. I walk alot, work out, clean the house and I do refresh during the day with this product may be 2 times. It keeps me dry and fresh!</li>
            <li> It works, its effective, and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant of all time and I will never change my mind.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant,it&#x27;s really have a good scent and at the sametime very safe coz it has no aluminum.</li>
            <li> Absolutely did not work for me.  A sour smell by the end of the day.  Had high hopes!</li>
            <li> Probably actually a 3.5 star, deduction on price, white marks and ease of use/container integrity. I found this in Whole Foods after Kiss My Face lavender deodorant did not work. A store employee in the personal product aisle pointed to this brand as one that worked because none of the non-aluminum containing ones I had tried actually deodorized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;notes:&lt;br /&gt;- I smell no BO all day and I can even retouch and not shower on light activity days when using Lavanila&lt;br /&gt;- it has no aluminum, which my daughter the chemist tells me will give me Alzheimer&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- I smell only lavender, no vanilla, but I prefer lavender anyway (they do have a vanilla scent)&lt;br /&gt;- container is wrapped in a protective seal so you can&#x27;t test sniff it at a store but I think WF has sample containers to sniff and they told me if I did not like it, I could return it for a full refund&lt;br /&gt;- several hours after applying, I smell nothing, no lavender, no BO and it stays that way all day, all thru the night and into the next day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I bought about 4 of these to bring with me to Canada during my husband&#x27;s assignment in case I could not find it here and am on the last stick. The deodorant has cracked away from the edge of the tube and the twist part on the bottom gets crooked when I wind it up a bit. Not sure if it is a shelf life problem, a container problem or just the way it is&lt;br /&gt;- it is a white stick deodorant and will leave a white residue on my underarms, so I have to be careful to avoid getting it on the outside of my clothing when dressing&lt;br /&gt;- an empty container feels almost as heavy as a full container, but one stick lasts for several months. It kind of feels like they&#x27;re skimping on the product, but I tend to apply very thoroughly (probably overuse it because of the other &#x27;natural&#x27; ones not working) and it does last a long time, so I guess there must be plenty of product and that the container is just weighty&lt;br /&gt;- sometimes it stings a bit after shaving but that has lessened with use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I think I might give it a solid 4 after summarizing my experience with Lavanila.  It has no aluminum, it works, it does leave white marks and it lasts for a long time so actually it is a better value than I thought.has lessened with use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I think I might give it a solid 4 after summarizing my experience with Lavanila.  It has no aluminum, it works, it does leave white marks and it lasts for a long time so actually it is a better value than I thought.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try a natural deodorant but this product has an AMAZING scent that covers up nicely but isn&#x27;t over powering. I actually don&#x27;t smell too much sugary vanilla in the typical perfumes I&#x27;ve experienced before. It&#x27;s a much more mellow, soft, but not sweet scent. I think I may buy the perfume scent of this even. It&#x27;s smells that good to me. Also I use it on my underarms right out of the shower after shaving them- no burning at all whatsoever with this. I do reapply this product throughout the day but don&#x27;t mind at all as the scent is that lovely. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the container. The downside is that if I am active it only last me 4 hours.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using regular drugstore deodorants - Secret, Lady Speed Stick, etc. - but nothing gives me really great protection on days I exert myself doing yardwork or going to my fitness center (just a 30-minute session on an ellyptical and a few machines - I&#x27;m not so active that this is a very strong test of anything).  I bought the Lavanila thinking I&#x27;d use it for special occasions, since it matches the scent I use - but quickly found it&#x27;s much more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also less irritating - no more itching.  And the scent is very light, even after a workout - nothing that seems to be noticeable to anyone else at the fitness center I use.  (I hate strong perfume smells myself and don&#x27;t want to offend others this way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using it every day.  More expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Great Natural Deodorant. Have had rashes and cysts from regular deodorant and been struggling to find something that works. This works great. No BO, lasts all day, no irritation or redness. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love all the scents from lavanilla !! Can&#x27;t decide which is a favorite because their all unique in scent. Truly a great product. Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT - The best non alluminum I have ever tried and I have tried many. yes you will need to reaply every 4-5 hrs but so what it smells great. I have used other scents too and the Lavender is the best.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast an efficent</li>
            <li> I love te smell of this deodorant and that it&#x27;s safe and natural. It is the only one I buy now.</li>
            <li> I only use natural deodorant. I was previously using Funk Butter, which is the best brand out there, but it was starting to give me a rash at times. I switched to this, and while it is not as good as Funk Butter, it is more gentle and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. I still get a little smelly, but I haven&#x27;t found a brand that works as good as the Aluminum stuff - but I would rather be smelly than get Alzheimer&#x27;s or breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Even though the product smells good and spreads well, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Doesn&#x27;t mask and odor whatsoever.  I vastly prefer other natural products.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals and love that this product is chemical free. Nice soft scent that is not offensive to others</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok but doesn&#x27;t really work that great. it smells pretty good, but i might as well just not wear deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this for a while now and I love it. But for the price, I would expect the tube to not break. The last one I ordered could not be pushed up-the bottom just keeps clicking and so I cannot use 90% of what is in the container. I am returning it. I will order one more and hopefully it will not be broken because I do love the product. It works great!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of it being all natural, but was looking for a nicer scent. It really just smells like deodorant with a small hint of lavender.</li>
            <li> Smells good at first, but then fades to a soap smell like ivory. I&#x27;m not into those types of smells. I hate powder scent, so if you are like me, I do not recomend this scent.&lt;br /&gt; It gave me a rash! I have never gotten a rash from any product, I am not sensitive at all??? I was really excited to try this because people on YouTube were giving it all kinds of great reviews. Just did not work for my body. So onto the next.</li>
            <li> Wow! Finally found a healthy deodorant that smells amazing and works! Expensive but great product!</li>
            <li> the best natural deodorant I have tried</li>
            <li> I tested this deodorant on a very light activity day. I didn&#x27;t sweat much at all.  I smelled like BO after only a couple hours.  It&#x27;s great to be &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; but it does not work.  You need an antiperspirant to avoid stinking and this just did not do it for me.  I love the scent, but it just does nothing to protect me from BO. It&#x27;s like wearing nothing nearly immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. When first transitioning from antiperspirant to natural deodorant it often felt like it wasn&#x27;t working, but once your body adjusts this becomes a really awesome product. I love the smell - my only critique is that its pretty expensive and finishes fast.</li>
            <li> Fast service and exactly as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  Will continue to buy until they discontinue it (hopefully, they won&#x27;t).  Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what you need to know about me:&lt;br /&gt;1. I sweat A LOT. Mostly from my underarms, thank goodness, but I&#x27;m a sweaty person nonetheless. And while it&#x27;s not HORRIFYING, I do smell when I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant for a while. I&#x27;ve tried a few different things, I&#x27;ve looked around at some different types, so I have some idea of what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for my review: This deodorant is okay. I know people question how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; it can be, but it&#x27;s natural enough for me (no aluminum? Close enough), so that&#x27;s not my issue. My issue is the PRICE (ughhhhhh) and its effectiveness. Price-wise, that&#x27;s a lot to pay for deodorant. While you get a pretty weighty deodorant for the price, it still hurts to have to cough up that cash. However, one of these should last you...6 months?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the effectiveness... Sadly, as a sweaty person who does indeed smell when she sweats, this did not live up to my hopes and dreams. Even in the winter, this wore off by 3pm and left me self conscious about my stank. I kept trying and trying, but it was always the same - around mid-afternoon, I&#x27;d be a stinky mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it actually goes on like &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; deodorant (some of the natural stuff is goopy or whatever) and it does smell really nice. So if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, like nice things, don&#x27;t sweat or smell a ton, this should be fine for you! It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for several years and highly recommend it. I have used a few of the other scents (vanilla grapefruit, vanilla) and this is the best scent in my opinion. It&#x27;s soft and feminine without being too girly or floral. I love that it comes in regular packaging - I have used other natural deoderants that come in a pot or tin where you apply it with your fingers. This doesn&#x27;t bother me at all but having a stick version is a lot quicker, especially if you are in a hurry. This lasts quite a while but you should definitely re-apply in a humid climate (it served me well in Florida&#x27;s humidity) or if you are heading to the gym or fitting in a sweaty workout. I always smell clean (even after a hot day, I didn&#x27;t ever smell &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34;) but the re-application cuts down on underarm wetness. It has a great list of gentle and safe ingredients (which is the reason why I purchased it). One thing to note however...of all the times I have purchased this over the years, twice I have received defective packaging. The bottom twists to raise the stick inside. Both times the packing failed when the twist part would never actually raise the product. It pretty much wastes a whole stick so make sure the return policy is decent so you can get a replacement.</li>
            <li> This natural product really works .. I love it , it smell wonderful and it truly does the job. Amazingly</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Other more natural deodorants have not worked at all for me.  This one is lovely.  The scent is not overpowering, like some; it&#x27;s a very fresh smell.  And overall, after having used it for 3 weeks now, during workouts and long laborious days, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> This product works well and lasts a long time. But, it&#x27;s super expensive, and it&#x27;s not as natural as they want you to think. For example, carrageenan has been linked to cancer. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s seaweed derived. Next, after. Few weeks to a month of using it I got an awful rash exactly like the rashes I used to get from conventional deodorants. Aluminum isn&#x27;t the only bad deodorant ingredient, people! Disappointed.    UPDATE: 5/17/14 - One month later I STILL have the rash! Horrible! Here&#x27;s pics of it! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  [...]  [...]</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it but found myself constantly re-applying in order to stay fresh and my search for natural yet long lasting deodorant continues :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used. And I&#x27;ve used a bunch, and live in the south.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the effectiveness of this deodorant!  I have always struggled with underarm perspiration and smell, yet do not want to continue using all of the chemically loaded antiperspirants.  I started using this 2 years ago and I love it!  Even though it&#x27;s just a deordorant, it works on my perspiration and smell also.  I sometimes have to reapply mid-day but not everyday.  It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on clothing.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE! I&#x27;ve been on the search for an all natural deodorant for YEARS and this is the only one that has done the job. I do notice that I have to apply it a couple of times a day to stay fresh smelling-especially of active- but it&#x27;s no big deal to me as long as it&#x27;s doing its job and I&#x27;m staying free and clear from the nasty chemicals in regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on very smoothly and does not feel sticky and it prevents odor very well.  It is not, nor does it claim to be, an anti-perspirant.  If you are looking for sweat control, this is not your product; but if a deodorant is all you need, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This did nothing to reduce underarm odor. In fact, it seemed to make my natural odors worse/more noticeable. I&#x27;d rather use nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, so in an effort to minimize the aluminum seeping into my body I use this on days that I&#x27;m just around the house.  I also put it on before bed.  The bottom line, though, is that after a couple hours the scent is vanilla BO and I can&#x27;t use this when I&#x27;m going out in public, so overall it&#x27;s not exactly working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update 5/7/13*** My original rating was 2 stars, but since I did end up re-ordering this product I feel it deserves more.  It does smell really nice and is totally fine for use around the house and running errands.</li>
            <li> Really like this product for an alternative to grocery store &#x27;deodorants&#x27;. Obviously a healthier choice but it does work well and smells wonderful. I bought a small sample sized one at Sephora two years ago and have used since then. It gets a bit crumbly toward the end but it has not deterred my from getting over and over again.</li>
            <li> I had been using Lavanila&#x27;s Vanilla Lavender deodorant for the past two years when I switched to natural deodorant after years of underarm irritation. I chose it after doing some research and finding it on a lot of \\&quot;best\\&quot; lists. It has a very subtle scent. It doesn&#x27;t go on clear, so I would usually apply it immediately after getting out of the shower so that my body heat would \\&quot;melt\\&quot; it. I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation at all. It would last all day without re-application. I would still sweat every now and then on very active days or stressful days, but there was no body odor. It is pricey, but a stick would last me several months. Unfortunately, it has become harder to find in local stores (my local Sephora stopped carrying it) and on Amazon. Given the price point, I just can&#x27;t justify paying shipping &amp; handling and tax to buy it on other beauty sites so I&#x27;ll be switching to something new. However, if you are willing to pay for it and can find it locally it&#x27;s definitely a quality product that works.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that works!!!! It works so well in fact that it makes me suspicious--what is in this that works so well???</li>
            <li> This smells soooooo good. I mean I like Lavender, but sometimes it can be a little much. This is feminine and clean smelling. Great natural deodorant. You may have to apply twice in a day to keep that nice smell. The roll up makes it very easy to apply. Did not irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> I adore this deodorant and have been recommending it to anybody who will listen to me!! It smells amazing, very fresh and clean without being overly powerful or fragrant. I also have extremely sensitive skin and have noticed a vast improvement in smoothness and moisturization in the skin on my underarms since I began using this deodorant. I am excited to try other scents from this company. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I will use and I have recommended to my daughter, sisters and good friends on it as well.  It is all natural, contains no harmful chemicals and smells fantastic.  It actually works, except on super hot days when I am out all day gardening or on the beach.  However, my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; regular deodorant didn&#x27;t work so well under those conditions either.  I just reapply once or twice throughout the day if needed and don&#x27;t worry that it will be infusing my body with harmful chemicals.  I re-order this product constantly.  Much easier than getting to Sephora for the purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells fine until you sweat :) This was doing alright as a daily use product but as summer came on I found myself having to reapply twice or more a day. Just not worth the hassle. Back to conventional deodorant for me.</li>
            <li> This smells more like Lavender with a hint of Vanilla and lasts all day</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works! I walk three miles every day, and sometimes get very hot. Even when I perspire a lot, this deodorant is up to the challenge. It is very mild on the skin but also very effective.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Most of the time it is enough to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I am completely dissatisfied with the product packaging (and Lavanila customer service) because after using the product for 2 weeks, the mechanism to roll the deodorant up, stopped working, so I was left with my previous deodorant. You would think the $14 deodorant would last 3-6 months! And there is plenty of product in the device, but it won&#x27;t move up. The product itself seems to work okay. This was my first adventure into natural deodorant, so I was not over-the-moon about it, but I would have recommended it and purchased it again, had Lavanila been of assistance in exchanging my defective product for a new one. I had to resort to returning it to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> Works ok as a body odor mask.  Kinda of an awkward smell. Also, it stays white on your armpit skin.</li>
            <li> This item does not work! It might smell good but it only smells good for 15 minutes and then your sweat breaks through. It&#x27;s not pretty. I am trying to switch over to more natural products but this is one thing that cannot be done. I like smelling sweat free and being dry. That is something I can&#x27;t give up &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> When looking for natural deodorants, I&#x27;ve found that the problem is that most are not strongly scented, and quite frankly, that&#x27;s what deodorant is all about.  Lavanilla is more strongly scented than Toms so seems to keep odor at bay for a bit longer but it&#x27;s 4 times the price.  A long day at work and a trip to the gym?  You&#x27;re going to need to reapply.  Another nice feature ist he texture of the deodorant which is creamy so it&#x27;s nice.  I&#x27;ll be trying other scents.</li>
            <li> I used both the vanilla lavender and the vanilla coconut versions. I really liked them because they smelt great and worked surprisingly well. I noticed my underarms getting red and kind of raw, but I thought it was because I switched from an antiperspirant to a deodorant and that they were just more wet from sweat during the day (thus the redness). However, I went to my dermatologist for mole removal and he spotted my underarms. He said that wetness from sweat would not cause what I had, that something in the deodorant was an irritation, and to stop using the deodorant immediately. I switched to geodeo natural deodorant and the redness completely went away.</li>
            <li> When the item first arrived I loved the scent!  I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 2 months.  I noticed pretty quickly after using it that I needed to reapply by mid/late afternoon, but I kind of expected that after reading other reviews and it did not bother me.  Now, however, I feel like I can&#x27;t apply it enough and that I smell almost immediately after starting my day.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how often I reapply it but I feel like I almost always smell, which I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  I like not having aluminum in my deodorant, but maybe this one&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well when the weather isn&#x27;t too hot. I had a baby and started sweating more and had to eventually return to using antiperspirant once the temp rose to the 90s. It worked during the pregnancy because I was in air condition most of the time. I would only use it in the fall, spring, and winter.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant, not great. Controls body odor minimally, but this is the only deodorant that I don&#x27;t have a reaction to (sulfite intolerance) that controls body odor at all.</li>
            <li> Love love love the smell of this deodorant!  It&#x27;s not going to keep you dry in the high heat of summer, but you will not have body odor.  I even had the owner of a health food store follow me around asking what I was wearing because I smelled so nice lol!  Will probably supplement with a regular antiperspirant every few days in the summer but at least I won&#x27;t be dosing my pits with toxic chemicals every day like I used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search for a natural deodorant that actually works and have tried dozens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While LAVANILLA The Health Deodorant smells great and works better than most, I&#x27;m still noticing an armpit smell after a few hours. (Disclosure: I don&#x27;t have a sweating problem and most regular deodorants work great for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while natural, LAVANILLA does contain tea tree oil, which is not recommended for anyone with an estrogen positive cancer.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works! It&#x27;s pricey for a deodorant, but after exhausting every other kind I could get my hands on I don&#x27;t care. Leaves a bit of a white residue, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but ever since I was a kid I struggled with being a pretty smelly girl, but not necessarily really sweaty. I have used every kind of antiperspirant, even clinical ones and would still find myself smelling after just a few hours even if i reapplied. But this has such a good smell, and if I reapply every 3-4 hours I found it will keep me smelling fresh the whole day. If I end up exercising, I do get a bit smelly still, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tldr; its worth the price.</li>
            <li> love this product! will never go bk to ordinary toxic deodorant!</li>
            <li> Pros: Smells good when you first put it on. Easy to wash off in the shower. Doesn&#x27;t get clogged in your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not help body odor if you&#x27;re going to sweat at all. I can only use it if I&#x27;m gonna sit at home all day in room temp weather and do nothing.</li>
            <li> I use sweat block antiperspirant and than deodorant daily. This deodorant has to be worn over my regular deodorant to work.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodarents and this is the only one that works. I workout out every single day and this deoderant is the only in natural dept that works during and after a sweat session.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it in my opinion. I&#x27;ve tried to like Tom&#x27;s, but it just doesn&#x27;t last. This natural deodorant doesn&#x27;t smell like deodorant and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win for lavanilla!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what I think of this yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some suggestions that you&#x27;re supposed to use it continually for  a month in order to let the toxins come out- so basically it&#x27;s not going to cover any body odor for the time being. I tried it and it&#x27;s almost been a month, and let me tell you I didn&#x27;t smell the best during it, but it has gotten a lot better. i wouldn&#x27;t say that it conceals it entirely, but I think it&#x27;s getting there. I was also really itchy after a workout with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good on first application which lasts for about an hour or so. I don&#x27;t think it does well with sweat, as it seems to rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t really know if I should stick with it until something happens or toss it, even though it was quite pricey for a deodorant</li>
            <li> Love Lavanila deodorants! So far have tried the lavender and original.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy but I love the scent of this deodorant. It will not however keep you from perspiring which IMO is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;If you wear deo while sleeping this is a safer alternative as their aren&#x27;t any chemicals. For the price it should come in larger size though, hence not full 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> mom loves it and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very active and this is the only non-aluminum deodorant that I have found that consistently works.  I am extremely pleased with the Vanilla Lavender deodorant.</li>
            <li> Lavanila has a pleasing fragrance and is non-irritating; however, it is not as effective at stopping order as I would like</li>
            <li> FINALLY!! After MONTHS of testing various natural deodorants I&#x27;ve finally found the one that can keep my BO in check! I&#x27;ve tried them all... the salt rock, Desert Essence, Queen Hellene&#x27;s, OE, etc., all of them! After a rigorous day, I pick up a small hint of what could be BO but it&#x27;s 90% masked by the remaining sent of this deodorant. I&#x27;m so relieved that my search is over and I&#x27;m sure those around me will be too.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant although it is more expensive it lasts a long time.  I use it everyday and the canister lasts me over 2 months so I think it&#x27;s worth it.  It smells good and works well!</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to try a natural deodorant because I&#x27;ve heard that they do not work as well.. However this one exceeded my expectations.  (Vanilla lavender scent) It&#x27;s even better than the chemically infused antiperspirant in drugstores and it has such a pleasant, clean scent. I worked an 8 hour day in a sweaty restaurant (wore this for a total of 10 hours that day) and by the end of the day, it only STARTED to smell like it was coming off.&lt;br /&gt;There is no sticky feeling when applying, NO white marks at all, and it completely masks odor and wetness throughout the day (even better than any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used, oddly). Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t take forever to scrub off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it enough how glad I am that I switched over to this product. Overall, a fantastic AND healthy alternative. Love it !</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a non-aluminum deodorant. I did my research and have tried a few others before I found this perfect one! I wanted to find a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; when you rub on, smells good, keeps you smelling fresh, and ofcourse not too pricey -- and this is all of the above. Using this once a day, each bottle lasts me about 3 months. I love this original Vanilla Scent, but am trying out the other scents soon. The deo is shaped round, (not oval like the aluminum deo&#x27;s out there) and I wish it was more oval for easier application. Other than that, if you want to go natural and avoid aluminum, this is the one!</li>
            <li> Effectiveness: Ok, so it&#x27;s not good enough to replace my industrial strength deo/anti-perspirant on a full-schedule day here in Arizona, but it keeps my pits unscented through a night of sleep**. Usually, my underarms will have a slight odor just from sleeping (I have to stick my nose close to smell it, but it&#x27;s there), so it&#x27;s nice to know I now have a good &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; option for overnight. [**might be cheating, but if you have any on hand, swipe two drops each of tea tree oil and lemon essential oil on your pits before the Lavanila stick. By themselves, the essential oils don&#x27;t deodorize long, but the combination of EOs and Lavanila seem to do the trick.]  Consistency: It goes on very creamy, which I&#x27;m not used to (I wish it went on thinner), and dries to a very dry powder. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky like regular deodorant does, and that it&#x27;s much easier to wash off. After a while, the product seems to dry out and gets very chalky.  Fragrance: The vanilla note is very weak so it smells pretty floral. While I was hoping for a sweeter smell (like Glade&#x27;s chemtastic Lavender-Vanilla plug-in) this interpretation smells nice too. It fades really quickly (&amp;#60;hour), but once it fades it smells like nothing, instead of that odd, faintly-chemical smell regular deodorant leaves behind.  Cost: The price didn&#x27;t shock me too much since my go-to deodorant is about $10, and this was eligible for Prime shipping when I got it. Supposedly it has high-quality ingredients, and even the container has heft and a schfancy screw-on lid (personally, I prefer the pop-off type, but hopefully this preserves the already-weak $14 fragrance better).</li>
            <li> First natural deodorant that actually works for me. Have tried Tom&#x27;s, Trader Joe&#x27;s, and one other whose name I don&#x27;t recall. They all wore off after just a few hours. This one lasts, for me (of course, it&#x27;s the most expensive.) I really think a lot of whether it works or not has to do with body chemistry, so I&#x27;d suggest trying a number of different brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this deodorant.  So difficult to find something more natural but that works and this one does.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic and works really well. Certainly as well as an aluminium-based, unhealthy product. I&#x27;m having trouble getting this in Australia so I thought I&#x27;d use Amazon instead. It arrived in perfect condition and more quickly than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great and I haven&#x27;t had any incidents yet. The smell is pleasant.  I do have sever eczema and it does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible... in fact, I smelled worse after a few hours after putting it on, then when wearing nothing at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I only use non aluminum deodorants and am constantly looking for something better.  This works better than Toms but is still just a deodorant not an antiperspirant.  It smells nice and goes on easily.  It is worth a try if you are trying to avoid aluminum.  The biggest con is the price.</li>
            <li> the aroma was okay, but I didn&#x27;t think if worked well for odor protection.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are healthy and natural. I also love that the products do not contain animal ingredients, and they are not tested on animals. One of the first things I noticed about the product was the fresh clean scent. It has a powdery feminine smell, and the dominant fragrance is passion fruit. The label has a fun design, and the cap is twist-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this product, I put it on at night after a shower. It worked throughout the next day! I even worked out for about an hour; it kept me dry and kept the odor away for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells soooo good but it did not last me through the day. I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, however I don&#x27;t love th product.</li>
            <li> This smell is horrible and as a deodorant it does not last. I was hoping for a natural deo that would actually work. Not the case here.</li>
            <li> I wear this product in a Texas summer and it works like a dream. And that&#x27;s saying something...</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells great and works all day long.  Being all natural provides peace of mind.  Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I really like Lavanila deodorant. Any fragrance works the same. Everything does not work for everyone, and depending on what you eat and your body chemistry...has a lot to do with how deodorant works. It is mild but strong and does work for me.  I tried the crystal and all of the other brands, they did nothing. So you should definitely give it a try if you are looking for a natural deodorant with no harmful substances that works. It is expensive but worth it. 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the scent, even after ordering two different kinds. It seems there&#x27;s some sort of weird, musky scent underneath the lavender and it just ended up giving me a headache. If you can stand the musk, then I guess it&#x27;s ok. I only wore it a short while but it seemed to work for that time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was a stick style deodorant but it does not go on smoothly.  It smells refreshing but I have found it does not work as well as the EO Organic.  I still use it sometimes, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to switch to an all natural aluminum free deodorant but this seems to have burned my skin. I used it for about 2 days and noticed that my armpits are really red and look started giving me discoloration.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it doesn&#x27;t work for a long day.</li>
            <li> This bar has lasted me since January with daily use. I absolutely adore the smell and the fact that there aren&#x27;t harmful ingredients. I don&#x27;t sweat more than the average person, so it works well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the list below:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis leaf juice (Aloe juice, water/aqua), Propanediol (Corn derived), Zea mays (Corn) starch, Sodium stearate (Coconut derived), Silica, Carrageenan (Seaweed derived), Stearyl behenate (Coconut derived), Citrus medica limonum (Lemon peel oil), Inulin (Artichoke derived), Saccharomyces ferment, Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide (Sugar derived), Yeast beta glucan, Lonicera caprifolium (Honeysuckle) flower extract, Usnea barbata (Lichen) extract, Valeriana officinalis root extract (Valerian), Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal) extract, Melaleuca alternifolia (Tea tree) flower/leaf/stem extract, Lycium barbarum fruit extract (Goji berry), Botanical fragrance blend.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this chemical free and natural deodorant. Little did I know..it would stop working! After a few weeks I noticed things were feeling a bit more wet and I wasn&#x27;t smelling as fresh. So I switched to Desert Essence from Sprouts and now having the same exact problem..grrr..</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been moving away from non organic products this past year and this is one deodorant I love!&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my purse for on the go and it works great!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this deodorant would work well, considering how active I am. I was used to using strong deodorants but Lavanilla has been wonderful!  And I&#x27;m really at rest knowing that toxins &amp; heavy metals are no longer entering my system.  Smells great &amp; long lasting too.</li>
            <li> It actually works! Not sticky like other clean products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that actually works for some time now. All the others I&#x27;ve tried make my underarms sticky or irritated and didn&#x27;t really make deodorize. This one smells great and is dry and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Hands down, THE best natural deodorant out there! A bit pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it in the long run. No harmful chemicals on your skin, no stinky pits! The lavender is by FAR the best choice, as some of the others in this line are too perfumey. The coconut is ok too, but avoid the others if you don&#x27;t like heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> Like the smell, the texture and the gentleness. Plus, it works!</li>
            <li> I was referred to this deoderant by a friend. Both my wife and I use it. It&#x27;s definitely unisex. I have tried many other natural deoderants and they were all useless. Actually made me worse off than when I used nothing. Beware of non-natural deoderants please, I know they are far less expensive but they are full of chemicals. This product works</li>
            <li> Fast ship, exactly as expected, easy open packaging</li>
            <li> I wore this for 1.5 days total.  On the second morning, I started to smell only after about 1 hour of wearing the product.</li>
            <li> I took this on a week long camping trip. I did not smell bad! haha Also, I see a lot of reviews on here that complain about sweating. This is not an antiperspirant: That&#x27;s the point. Antiperspirants are bad for you because they do not allow you to sweat and are being studied for their potential link to breast cancer in women. I don&#x27;t mind that I sweat just as long as there is odor control and I am very athletic! I&#x27;m a rock climber and fitness enthusiast. Even my husband has sneaked some of this stuff. It&#x27;s absolutely the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using Weleda for a few years and do like it but couldn&#x27;t resist the vanilla scent when I saw this product at Sephora! For me the scent lasts all day and the product works. I am used to sweating and am not looking for antiperspirant. Like with many naturals, you might care to reapply after a workout or on a hot day. Unlike with Weleda though, I really don&#x27;t have to reapply. It&#x27;ll depend on your personal chemistry. It&#x27;s a little expensive but seems to last and work and smell wonderful. By far it&#x27;s the best product of its kind I have found. (I have tried the rocks, the Tom&#x27;s, etc. and find them ineffective or sticky)</li>
            <li> Great product , I love it! You still sweat a little bit but it does its job well and I used prescription deodrant for years!</li>
            <li> This product is for women who have dealt with itchy and irritated underarm deodorants for  years.  I&#x27;m assured with it that there will only be lasting protection without irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. It has a very light, clean smell - not chemically at all. It does a decent job of absorbing wetness (although obviously does not stop perspiration altogether, like an antiperspirant would). It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, like a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants seem to do. I wear it all day and don&#x27;t have any noticeable odor afterward, even in the summer months. I will say though that sometimes body odor can be a sign of something not right in your diet. Since removing things like refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, processed carbohydrates, etc., and adding more fresh fruits and veggies, I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the way my sweat smells. Clean living &#x3D; clean smelling. :-) The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this deodorant 5 stars is that the price is pretty crazy, though no fault of Amazon. Their price is about $5 less than Sephora charges.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago and was skeptical to try it.  After I tried it, I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of it. It goes on extremely wet. I continued using it and it really works. It doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration but it does help stop odor. It has a clean scent but does leave some white residue on clothes. It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a healthy alternative to deodorant and was told this would do the trick. On days with light movement, it&#x27;s okay. On active days, not so much!</li>
            <li> This item smelled spoiled!  And I love this deodorant - won&#x27;t buy again though!</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like you&#x27;d think. Does not smell anything like essential oils. I smell no lavender or vanilla just super strong floral smell. There also is no lavender or vanilla in the ingredients list. I have not yet tried it and not sure I will due to the smell. I have trouble with strong smells causing headaches and I am not sure this won&#x27;t give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super disappointed and will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product. It does not last long. Never in my life did I feel so much wetness and had bad odor when using a natural deodorant. Wasted $14 :(&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed many fake reviews ...</li>
            <li> Like the smell but doesnt work to well with sweat. Its not strong enough. I wouldnt purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and I think she smells awesome.  Lol  What more can you really say about deodorant?</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant that works!! You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it and this one is easy to apply and actually lasts through the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my skin, which is very sensitive, but this burnt my skin...literally. I still have the scars under my arms and I had to go to the dermatologist and get treatment. It honestly caused my skin to become bright red, itchy and painful. I&#x27;m happy it worked for others but it did NOT work for me. I also had to reapply during the day, but if you&#x27;re willing to deal with that, more power to you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LaVanila lavender deodorant for about a month now.  I LOVE THIS STUFF.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other natural deodorants and always found them lacking.  Most recently I was using the crystal (both the actual crystal plus the spray) and at the end of the day, no matter how much I used, I STUNK.  I felt like I was smelly to everyone around me, which was really embarrassing at work.  I hated having to raise my arms, and this is sometimes necessary as I take a commute train to/from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon this product by accident, and I am so glad that I did!  I love the scent and it works really well for me.  During a normal work day I come home and am not smelly at all.  I can still smell the lavender scent.  After a very strenuous workout, I have to wash and reapply, but I figure you&#x27;re going to have that issue with ANY deodorant.  I am so thrilled to have found this product, I&#x27;ve already bought my second tube.  It is a bit expensive for deodorant, and I really wish it lasted longer, but hey... what&#x27;s $20 for using a natural product that won&#x27;t give you cancer.</li>
            <li> I think I might find something a little bit less expensive. It works in regards to odor protection. The fragrance is nice and clean. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stay with this scent.</li>
            <li> Cruelty-free, smells good, natural and effective....perfect deodorant. Cost a bit more, but well worth the price.  I&#x27;m trying the fragrance next!</li>
            <li> While I like that the deodorant works and keeps me odor free I am not crazy about the smell. I was debating over which to buy and was going to buy the plain lavender until I saw many comments saying it smelled like baby powder. Since I am not a fan of that scent I opted for this one but the smell is nothing like lavender or vanilla. I have an all natural lavender body wash that I love and this smells nothing like it. To me this deodorant has a masculine smell and reminds me of a light men&#x27;s after shave. While the smell is not terrible I just don&#x27;t want to smell like a baby or a man so I will probably try this brand again as all natural is important to me but I will opt for a different scent. I wish they had a citrus scent.    Update***    I have been using this deoderant a few months and sadly it seems with time my body has got used to it in some way and now I find I have an odor  when wearing this even after only a few hours. It is not a strong odor but it is enough to make me feel self conscious and is why I no longer use it. Keep in mind I work at a desk job indoors all day so there is no reason for this to be happening. I cannot recommend this deoderant as it does not keep body odor at bay even under the best conditions. My search for a chemical free deoderant that actually works continues.....</li>
            <li> This is the only vegan and natural deodorant that has worked for me. Tom&#x27;s and kiss my face just do not hold up on stench absorbing power, and kiss my face leaves irritating residue. I also tried pit putty and that smelled great but left me smelling even worse afterward. Lavanilla is so fresh and clean everytime.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I appreciate the natural ingredients and works and keeps my pits pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I usually make my own deodorant but this is my &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; one. This is the best natural deodorant I have found - it smells great and works the best. For something I would buy, I&#x27;m happy with the ingredients. However, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because the stick didn&#x27;t work and wouldn&#x27;t advance, so I have to dig it out with my fingers... kind of defeats the purpose of taking a break from making my own.</li>
            <li> Smells great for the first few hours but fades by late afternoon. However, it&#x27;s still one of the better natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried-- might just be the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li> This is the best all natural deodorant I have ever tried. It smells great too. I love using it and recommend everyone to try it! If it works for you, you will be in luck because it is natural!!!</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a highly effective/pleasant smelling all natural deodorant. The lavender-vanilla fits the bill! The plain vanilla scent was too masculine  and the grapefruit or pomegranate was too sweet. Like Goldilocks would say- &#x27;this one was just right&#x27; Enjoy!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite natural deodorants. I put on coconut oil and then this and it works all day.</li>
            <li> finally a all natural deo that works, I usually stink and stink bad, and this worked. and my friend tried it and it worked for her ( she had been previously using Vodka as she was desperate.)</li>
            <li> I saw this in a large chain store and I was curious about it and wanted to give it a try cus for years I&#x27;ve been using commercial brand deo and in time it  darken my underarm ( had no choice, I sweat there).. So far so good.. I noticed that you need to really rub it in cus it&#x27;s compact. The first time I used it I just made a light rub like  a normal deo and  after 3 hours my armpit smelled musty (eww )so I figured maybe it wasn&#x27;t enough. After I showered I rubbed it in for few strokes (thinking it&#x27;s natural anyway so no harm done)and it did made a huge difference. No sweat, no smell.. So I&#x27;m very happy!! I&#x27;m finally free of cancer causing aluminum based deo and on the road of relightening my underarm again</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant on dermstore after receiving an email from them advertising lavanila.  It was the first non aluminum deodorant I had tried in a couple years after taking a hiatus due to being disappointed with the effectiveness of previous ones I tried. I must say I bought into the healthy deodorant hype; I had high hopes. Unfortunately they were all dashed. This did not work for me AT ALL. In fact, I felt as though I smelled LESS wearing nothing at all. Wore off within four hours every time and once you started to smell, reapplying didn&#x27;t help much. Perhaps due to the creamy consistency I actually felt as though I sweat more than wearing nothing at all while wearing this. I am returning this to dermstore for a refund. I have since found a winner in Burt&#x27;s bees outdoor spray sage oil deodorant. Once the minimal scent wears off you smell like nothing at all but just clean skin and it lasts for at least an entire day. I also feel like I sweat less wearing it. I do not recommend lavanila. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing! I have tried several brands of natural deodorant and it is the first one to actually work! I love the scent and I only need to apply it once a day. I was worried about the price tag, but since I don&#x27;t have to slather it on like inexpensive natural deodorant, it is worth the price. I will be buying this product forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LaVanila for the past 2 years, including very hot sweaty Texas summers. Previously I had used Burt&#x27;s Bees (ok for a couple of hours), Tom&#x27;s (worthless), and a brand I found on Etsy that I can no longer remember the name of (had to be applied by hand, so wasn&#x27;t as convenient, though worked great).  This is the best of these natural deodorants.  I would also say that prior to trying natural deodorants, I used Secret, and found that by the end of my worst stressful/hot days, I would smell a little - not horrible BO or anything, but needing a shower.  The results with LaVanila are no better on those days, but I would rather spend more on a product that works just as well as a traditional deodorant but doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals/aluminum in it.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this product from Sephora, but i&#x27;ve seen lots of bad comments about it since. The product smells great when you put it on, but after awhile it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,last for all day, very pleasant natural lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and lasts all day. However when doing long (one hour) workouts it wears off before the end.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  This is my second time ordering this brand.  The Lavender Vanilla scent is definitely my favorite - the grapefruit scent was a little strange.  My hormones get all crazy while breastfeeding and, for some reason, that means stinky pits even if I&#x27;m not sweaty...even if I had a shower 20 min ago - this is the only deodorant I have found (I must have tried 20 including homemade) that really combats the funk.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. It smells wonderful but my skin is so sensitive it gave me a rash. unfortunately i will not be able to keep using it.</li>
            <li> So far so good but it does seem to start wearing off quickly, so I have needed to reapply.  But, it smells SOOOOO good that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying desperately to find a natural deodorant that actually works. And at least for me this isn&#x27;t it.  While the smell is pleasant the product barely last a couple of hours.  And after it wares off I smell like a locker room.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent.  Doesn&#x27;t last long enough though.  Have to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> I love it, excellent.</li>
            <li> A healthy product that works well.</li>
            <li> I like the roll-on cream style, the smell is light and pleasant, and it lasts most of the day.  However, like all natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, I sometimes have to put more on in the late afternoon, so it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I wish it did.  Overall though, I think it&#x27;s a good natural deodorant and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a crusade to find the right &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant for myself and my teenage daughter and after having tried with great disappointment a few less expensive products (Almy and Arm &amp; Hammer) we decided to buy the expensive stuff thinking that it may end our search. Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of money. The cheap-smelling scent at best covers body odor for couple of inactive hours after which we had to reapply more and more as the body odor got stronger and stronger. May be because of repeated applications, or may be because it actually includes synthetic fragrance (read the entire label) we ended up with pretty irritated underarms. We both have switched to a cream deodorant called DeodoMom which that has only two ingredients (water and magnesium hydroxide which is actually safe to eat!), is designed for pregnant women (and therefore completely toxin-free), and best of all, WORKS.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years. Works and smells great!</li>
            <li> It works! It works! It works!!! Wahoo!! Finally a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling natural!</li>
            <li> I put this to the test before a rigourous work-out in the gym. As previous reviewers stated, it does not stop underarm odor...it does seem to temporarily mask it.  The vanilla fragrance seems to die out after a few hours. This is will work in the Fall/ Winter seasons but not Spring /Summer. Lavanila may be natural but it&#x27;s also over-rated and and over-priced. There are so many other natural deoderants on the market that are much more cheaper.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut odor for long. Have to reapply. Better than using cancer sticks.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I will use. So thankyou for carrying it!</li>
            <li> smelled old I threw it out</li>
            <li> the only deodorant (without all of the icky stuff) we&#x27;ve found to work so far...</li>
            <li> I love lavanila products. I love the body wash and the deodorants.  The lavender vanilla scent is nice, the passion fruit scent is nice, the grapefruit scent is nice.  The only complaint I have is that this is kind of expensive- 18$ for 1.7 oz? You can find better deals for lavanila on sephora and ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is only 15$ plus shipping, why is the deodorant more for less product?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use regular chemical filled deodorants and I was really fed up with my hubby constantly complaining about my mustiness. So did my research and found out about natural deodorant brand Lavanila. I have been using this for last 3 weeks and very happy with this product !! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this deodorant is the best all natural one i have tried! glad to know i can be fresh and avoid breast cancer. not going to last all day but worth it to not expose your body to horrible chemicals I work 12 hour shifts and it lasts me almost the whole time and when It starts to wear off its not bad at all still helps a ton love this product! worth the price i promise and smells great</li>
