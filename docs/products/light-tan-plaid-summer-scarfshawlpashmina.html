            <li> It is long enough to wrap around your neck.  </li>
            <li> (scarves actually as I ordered 2) because shipping back to China is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I never wear them, but after chancing it with this purchase, I have bought several other scarves.</li>
            <li> It will compliment a wide range of spring and summer looks.  </li>

            <li> the rate should be less than one  </li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars but the packaging caused a slight pull.  </li>
            <li> It is thin enough to wear over a shirt.</li>
            <li> This was a small stocking stuffer for one of my daughters</li>
            <li> Not Burberry, and not great.</li>
            <li> so so, Soo sorry.</li>
            <li> And unfortunately it was not the one that is posted here in the picture.</li>
            <li> I find this one very disappointing</li>
            <li> i really hate it</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and would have not purchased this item if I knew it was going to look the way it did!&lt;br</li>

            <li> IT TRULY BEST BUY. HAVE FEW REAL BURBERRY SCARFS FROM SAKS, BURRBURRY IN LONDON&lt;br /&gt;THIS ONE CAN NOT TELL THE DIFFERENT. QUALITY IS GOOD.  ASKED ME FOR REVIEW ?&lt;br /&gt;I ORDER ANOTHER ONE.  THAT SPEAK ITSELF.</li>
            <li> Except for one edge, the fabric is faded out so it looks like it&#x27;s the back side of the fabric but it&#x27;s that way on both sides</li>
            <li> This is a good scarf. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, especially for the price. It&#x27;s pretty thin, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. I love it!</li>
            <li> the print is side way, the material is ok . Not as fancy as it looks... but the price is fair... Dont expect much, you get what you pay...</li>
            <li> the scarf received was different that shown on the pic!!!!!  the rate should be less than one  star  !! i really hate it</li>
            <li> It looks just as you think it would. It is made of a stiffer material than my store bought scarves but nothing that a wash with fabric softener won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The scarf does not look anything like the picture or description- I was very disappointed and would have not purchased this item if I knew it was going to look the way it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap looking</li>
            <li> love the style and it&#x27;s very well made. You get your moneys worth. I&#x27;ll buy it again. I&#x27;m Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for and more. The quality is great, it&#x27;s the right length and its lightweight fabric which is just what I wanted. The seller was prompt and kind I will be buying more from this seller!</li>
            <li> Not Burberry, and not great. Verrry so so, going to gift it.  It is very very very so so, Soo sorry.</li>
            <li> I got my scarf in a timely manner. And unfortunately it was not the one that is posted here in the picture. It is so beautiful scarf same pattern just a silky headscarf. It was definitely not what I was looking for. The scarf that I received is for an older woman to put over her head in the summertime.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this scarf! it goes with everything and is the perfect compliment to any outfit. sure to be a classic.</li>
            <li> This scarf has nice colors and is made of soft fibers. It is thin enough to wear over a shirt.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a pashmina/shawl with tassels as shown in the picture. This is not what I received. I received a short, rayon scarf in a similar pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep the scarf (scarves actually as I ordered 2) because shipping back to China is just not worth it. For the price, a good deal, but I really wish it had been as described/pictured.</li>
            <li> It is most beatiful and good qulity scalf!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more for my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you to get it.</li>

            <li> Perfect  for all year long wear!  Colors are great.  Service was so fast!  Definitely recommend!  If you&#x27;re uncertain, buy it.....incredible price.....</li>
            <li> This is a really nice colored scarf. The length was a little shorter than in the picture, but it still looks really nice. The customer service was good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thin and light so it wasn&#x27;t made for warmth, but it looks like it does in the picture. May end up ripping easily. I still like the ways it looks.</li>
            <li> This is a stylish lightweight scarf in neutral tones. It will compliment a wide range of spring and summer looks.  I would have given it five stars but the packaging caused a slight pull.  If you are careful unwrapping you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for summer or winter. The material is soft and thin. Best part is the pattern-just as the picture shows. Arrived quickly. Wish it came in different colors.</li>
            <li> Great Customer Service w/ a note inside package that states they will work toward making you a satisfied customer should you have a problem with the item. Item neatly packaged. Scarf is soft and light weight. It is an average sized pashmina in length.  I love it. Great for spring/summer. For the true Burberry fan, they do not make a pashmina, nor are the plaids in the right place, however, for the price, this is an excellent inspired item, priced well. Who wants to pay $200+ for a summer scarf anyway? Not me!! -- I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and classy scarf. I never wear them, but after chancing it with this purchase, I have bought several other scarves. This is lightweight and looks great with an all black outfit.</li>
            <li> The quality is great, it is better than the one in the picture, its perfect for any outfit or as a present</li>
            <li> I wanted a Burberry style summer scarf and that&#x27;s what I got -- it&#x27;s same color as this picture but if you care about getting the EXACT product it&#x27;s definitely NOT the same scarf.  I got a long smooth silk scarf in Burberry style check  (I&#x27;m not sure if its really silk but it sure feels like it) but it&#x27;s very nice feel/look for $5.65 so I really can&#x27;t complain!  If you&#x27;re willing to risk $5.65 go for it!</li>
            <li> The friend I gave this to for her birthday LOVED it. So much she sent a picture of how &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; she looked on the first day she wore it. Excellent!</li>
            <li> overall happy with the product, everyone complimented me on it. only drawback that it comes really wrinkled so i had to give it a mega steam out</li>
            <li> Looks like image online and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good scarf to wear with any outfit. Affordable price for a fashion scarf.</li>
            <li> I like this scarf, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it came all wrinkled.  It&#x27;s all cotton so that is why it was so wrinkled.  But&lt;br /&gt;It is large enough for me to wrap my head and wrap my face too if I needed to. Even though I have to iron it before wearing it I like it allot.</li>
            <li> Very nice material and great warm weather scarf. Excellent service and shipping. I bought 4 to give as gifts for children . Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought this scarf might be made of a coarse fabric but I am surprised at the softness of the material.  It&#x27;s comfortable to wear and not itchy.  It does not compare to the real deal though.</li>
            <li> VERY TRENDY, LOVE THE PATTERN AND IT&#x27;S LIGHT WEIGHT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SCARF TO EVERYONE. I RECEIVED IT PROMPTLY</li>
            <li> Cute scarf- great price. It looks a little bit cheap but it is a pretty good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Item as described, looks very trendy.  The material is very soft and it just feel good after wearing it.  A good buy!</li>
            <li> Just love it. It did came out wrinkled but I ironed it and it came out beautiful. I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> But at a very reasonable price!  This was a small stocking stuffer for one of my daughters and she LOVED it!</li>
