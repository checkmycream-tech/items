            <li>One of the best smelling hygiene products I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>The spray mechanism has a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; that makes this a perfect spray for the gym bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is about time that spray deodorants started being sold in America and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>It does its job so beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Great buy, great deal.</li>
            <li>And while it does smell great, it&#x27;s not a smell</li>
            <li>Smells great , works great.</li>
            <li>It also made me realize that this would go great in my gym bag after I work out, I am always either using a stick or worried that my spray will &amp;#34;leak&amp;#34; (aka get accidentally triggered).</li>
            <li>It also smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>: Featuring a scent to jumpstart your senses with bright bursts of lily of the valley and tiare flower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good spray deodorant to have in your arsenal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for good spray deodorant/antiperspirants for years.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>This spray smells really good and seems to work well as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>This spray stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>A nice smell that was not overpowering.</li>
            <li>From a marketing standpoint I also liked the shape of the bottle and the feel of it in your hand which is nice and</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t provide the superb protection that it advertises.  </li>
            <li>Excellent smell and works really well.</li>
            <li>The bottle shape is nice and the button works well.</li>
            <li>I find the scent pleasant but a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Even the really cheap kind you want to try just because it look like it smell good.</li>
            <li>found that the DEGREE ANTIPERSPIRANT worked better than the DOVE Aerosol ANTIPERSPIRANT I also just reviewed.  </li>
            <li>Eh. Smells ok.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely floral/fresh scent, but I had to stop using this because the scent was too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>family thinks I&#x27;m nuts, they love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I find that the best way to deal with this is to open a window and turn on a fan while applying it, and then leaving the room for a while since the smell</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is OK</li>
            <li>Degree is my favorite antiperspirant, it doesn&#x27;t stain my whites and it works.</li>
            <li>I took off a star because I&#x27;m not so sure I like the spray part</li>
            <li>It has a healthy volume with each spray.</li>
            <li>Very impressed; there were no white marks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inset into the top of the can and you need to sort of push it up for it to spray.</li>
            <li>What this means is it doesn&#x27;t need a top to cover the spray mechanism (which I&#x27;m gonna lose anyway)</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the scent is also overwhelming for about 25 minutes, and then there is no odor control.</li>
            <li>Push forward to unlock - cute.</li>
            <li>This product held up really well through my morning gym class, and by 6:00pm that evening, it still smelled great.</li>
            <li>This is probably something I would choose when going to the gym or wearing a strapless top.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on, the way it feels, the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>love this deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and slender and sleek, however, I&#x27;m not that excited about the push button.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m athletic and hot flashing, so I know it works, but for me, the aerosol may not be a good idea.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and smelling great all day, and I get to keep my shirts!</li>
            <li>My hands and fingers at my age 89 are not as strong and agile as in my youth.  </li>
            <li>This Degree Women Dry Spray Antiperspirant works great!</li>
            <li>It works pretty good for a strong antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>and I think this one works even better than my favorite tried and true</li>
            <li>I spend many hours training in a kung fu school and this product keeps my silk tai chi uniforms stain free and</li>
            <li>She says this product is very easy to use and goes on quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the spray button can be locked.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to over do it</li>
            <li>, the scent is just too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is too perfumery and it goes on rather strong.  </li>
            <li>(To be fair, I&#x27;ve been sweating a LOT, but even my old deodorant that isn&#x27;t working as well does a better job than this stinky stuff.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like every strong scent does it.</li>
            <li>lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not irritate my skin and is very gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>- it is a very light mild perfume type smell that for others might not be bothersome however for myself</li>
            <li>First the spray design is really nice.</li>
            <li>The new way to get superior protection</li>
            <li>As an antiperspirant this DEGREE product worked fine.</li>
            <li>The product sprays on really fast and easy, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and has a light scent that is not overpowering if you spray lightly.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just gently press the button and it smoothly dust you with a nice, invisible yet impenetrable layer of a sweat and odor shield.</li>
            <li>It does smell fantastic, but the fumes and scent are so overpowering.</li>
            <li>I wanted something light that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores but that would still give me protection.</li>
            <li>I remain sweat and odor free all day without the greasy, gunky residue of a stick.  </li>
            <li>Still has that sticky feel of a stick deodorant, so I expect it won&#x27;t be stain free</li>
            <li>ANY deodorant is better than NO deodorant right?</li>
            <li>But, I have arthritis and tendonitis, so that&#x27;s most likely my own</li>
            <li>If I decide I like this better than the solids and gels, I may switch to the spray, as I really like the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>enjoy the fresh fragrance</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells good enough that I use it underneath my arms but also under my boobs too.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I am a migraneur and very occasionally a scent can send me into headache land.</li>
            <li>True.</li>
            <li>As far as keeping me dry - it works great!!  </li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It is always great to have a choice of two staple items in case a store is out of one or the other.</li>
            <li>The scent was mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;►</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on quick, so one quick push of the button should suffice.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent that fades away quickly after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, a quick way to freshen up.</li>
            <li>The scent is really pleasant, and it goes on dry, it just doesn&#x27;t protect as well as</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t think I have super hero strength B.O...</li>
            <li>Dries really quickly once applied.</li>
            <li>Also, the aroma went away relatively quickly, while the dryness lasted all day.</li>
            <li>This though is quick to put on when maybe running out to the store for s quick errand but.</li>
            <li>The spray has a pronounced but not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Just a light press and the spray covers the whole area and then some.</li>
            <li>That is to say, you have 8 weeks worth of spray in the can.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t fun) and choke.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, and definitely works.</li>
            <li>Reading the direction of pushing up on the top container I pushed it completely off.  </li>
            <li>B004DH1BQI Dove go fresh Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Revive 2.6 oz, Twin Pack]]</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ll smell like fresh citrus and B.O....</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>It does keep me fresh</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat a lot and it keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick, convenient, effective, dry, not too smelly, at a tall 3.8 oz.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, it is quick to dry and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not too overpowering and is just right.</li>
            <li>right--</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a decent deodorant that keeps me dry all day and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The shape of the bottle is smart too!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I tried to put my shirt on right away, and it smeared all over my shirt.</li>
            <li>not used a spray very much before.</li>
            <li>Every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used leaves me smelly by mid-afternoon, and if I try to reapply (normally in the bathroom at work), I start sweating more and smell more offensive.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t smell B.O.! ;)</li>
            <li>It is a pretty floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She does think that the roll on stick type works a lot better especially when working out.</li>
            <li>I gasped for air but only inhaled more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>would absolutely buy this product again!</li>
            <li>decided to do the first test run of this product before I went to the gym.</li>
            <li>have been using Dove go fresh Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Cool Essentials for years&lt;br /&gt;due to being so sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that the scent is not nice; it smells very nice.  </li>
            <li>spray is very fine, and it is dry on contact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this has happened to everyone: you get dressed, put on a nice top or dress for work, go to apply your deodorant, and a few minutes later you notice white stains under your arms.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty large bathroom too and always have the exhaust fan running, but this spray just seems to linger in the air for quite a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite all of its positive attributes, I doubt I will buy this product.</li>
            <li>it just is too strong when used daily.</li>
            <li>certain cleansers (409), and this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have to get a new deodorant because my faithful favorite for YEARS has recently stopped working as well.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to get a good grip on the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Maybe I sprayed too much?  </li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife to use as she really likes degree antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>There is a mist when sprayed; I don&#x27;t want to inhale too much of that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reality: This stuff does smell really</li>
            <li>Now this product I was quite surprised that the scent did not bother me too much right away</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent, but its not strong.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because it stated that it would not leave any kind of &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; behind after it was applied.</li>
            <li>It does go on dry, which is good as I like a dry antiperspirant and the feel of that</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t have this issue, I would use this deodorant more often and try other scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Claim: All the ingredients are safe.&lt;br /&gt;Reality: Probably as safe as any other spray on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive nose, and strong scents really bother me, ESPECIALLY if they&#x27;re attached to my person.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the smell is too strong so if you are sensitive to smells this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh and pleasant smell, but unfortunately I had problems with it making me sneeze.  </li>
            <li>I mean, entirely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product left no marks on my clothing and genuinely did its job ... and at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small can fits nicely in my gear bag.</li>
            <li>Actually the first time I sprayed it the rest of the house asked if we had a new air freshener lol.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a highly active person but it seemed to work just fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have to hold a towel over my mouth and nose when I spray it and quickly dash out of the room to avoid breathing it in and gagging a little, but that effort is completely worth it!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent and it seems to keep my dry all day, unless I run a lot.</li>
            <li>interesting to me was how this antiperspirant did on a black t-shirt test.</li>
            <li>All day dry and its smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not last 48 hours.. more like 5 hours.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with different stick deodorants for years, from gel to power to $15-a-stick clinical protections of all brands, and I feel confident enough to say that I am done with my search.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of quick changes from yoga to work and don&#x27;t want to walk around all day with white marks all over my clothes.</li>
            <li>One quick push is enough to cover each armpit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can use candles and deal with junior high school students no problem, but some chemicals just get me.</li>
            <li>early morning class straight through work and home.</li>
            <li>As someone who really needs to use a clinical strength deodorant I was surprised how well this Degree works.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dryer than normal.</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the smell (which is OK in the stick version, but not my fave).</li>
            <li>Anywho...every other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant I have every used has been perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy is an aerosol that doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the area.</li>
            <li>I bought this one last night because I thought the smell was tolerable and it looked all right.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant ... not too strong, not too faint (it is not &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or any other polarizing scent.</li>
            <li>my boxing tee shirts clean looking without underarm wet marks.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I very much like the spray on better than the gel, as it goes on practically instantly dry, and I don&#x27;t have to wave my arms around waiting for it to dry enough to put my clothes on.</li>
            <li>: This didn&#x27;t work any better than my usual brand</li>
            <li>Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy&lt;br</li>
            <li>Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy, 3.8 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can go several days without applying deodorant, because I don&#x27;t sweat much.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I do sweat a lot and have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li>and it lasted through the hot day, but not as long as they claim it would.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>i developed an itch.</li>
            <li>Quite a few of the (many) different deodorants and antiperspirants</li>
            <li>I usually use solid stick antiperspirant because it works better for me and my skin is sometimes sensitive to spray antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>I saw the commercials and thought it looked good, which probably should have been my first clue that it was a bad idea to purchase this.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant spray worked very well for me and did not cause any skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Besides these minor issues, it&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>It is extremely convenient, though, especially post-workout when you need to freshen up quickly.</li>
            <li>She said it works very well and keeps her armpits dry, without visible residues or a tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>and it really goes go on dry</li>
            <li>I walked back in the room when I thought it was clear to finish my morning routine, and immediately started coughing uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>a pretty small bottle, and will likely go fast.</li>
            <li>: Features motion sense technology that responds directly to your body movement, releasing extra protection with every move you make.&lt;br /&gt;Reality:</li>
            <li>: Yes, it does dry quickly after application but it feels like any other antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Likewise, this spray really does dry nearly instantly.</li>
            <li>The other thing is that by the end of 12 hours, it was fading fast.  </li>
            <li>The Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy, 3.8 Oz appears to work about as well an any other.</li>
            <li>I found this antiperspirant spray very cooling and goes on dry and stays dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;It is about time that spray deodorants started being sold in America and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> It does its job so beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Great buy, great deal.</li>
            <li> And while it does smell great, it&#x27;s not a smell</li>
            <li> Smells great , works great.</li>
            <li> It also made me realize that this would go great in my gym bag after I work out, I am always either using a stick or worried that my spray will &amp;#34;leak&amp;#34; (aka get accidentally triggered).</li>
            <li> It also smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also quite pleasant.  </li>

            <li> A good spray deodorant to have in your arsenal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for good spray deodorant/antiperspirants for years.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> This spray smells really good and seems to work well as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This spray stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> A nice smell that was not overpowering.</li>
            <li> From a marketing standpoint I also liked the shape of the bottle and the feel of it in your hand which is nice and</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t provide the superb protection that it advertises.  </li>
            <li> Excellent smell and works really well.</li>
            <li> The bottle shape is nice and the button works well.</li>
            <li> I find the scent pleasant but a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Even the really cheap kind you want to try just because it look like it smell good.</li>
            <li> found that the DEGREE ANTIPERSPIRANT worked better than the DOVE Aerosol ANTIPERSPIRANT I also just reviewed.  </li>
            <li> Eh. Smells ok.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely floral/fresh scent, but I had to stop using this because the scent was too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> family thinks I&#x27;m nuts, they love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I find that the best way to deal with this is to open a window and turn on a fan while applying it, and then leaving the room for a while since the smell</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is OK</li>
            <li> Degree is my favorite antiperspirant, it doesn&#x27;t stain my whites and it works.</li>
            <li> I took off a star because I&#x27;m not so sure I like the spray part</li>
            <li> It has a healthy volume with each spray.</li>
            <li> Very impressed; there were no white marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inset into the top of the can and you need to sort of push it up for it to spray.</li>
            <li> What this means is it doesn&#x27;t need a top to cover the spray mechanism (which I&#x27;m gonna lose anyway)</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the scent is also overwhelming for about 25 minutes, and then there is no odor control.</li>
            <li> Push forward to unlock - cute.</li>
            <li> This product held up really well through my morning gym class, and by 6:00pm that evening, it still smelled great.</li>
            <li> This is probably something I would choose when going to the gym or wearing a strapless top.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, the way it feels, the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> love this deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice and slender and sleek, however, I&#x27;m not that excited about the push button.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m athletic and hot flashing, so I know it works, but for me, the aerosol may not be a good idea.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and smelling great all day, and I get to keep my shirts!</li>
            <li> My hands and fingers at my age 89 are not as strong and agile as in my youth.  </li>
            <li> This Degree Women Dry Spray Antiperspirant works great!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good for a strong antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> and I think this one works even better than my favorite tried and true</li>
            <li> I spend many hours training in a kung fu school and this product keeps my silk tai chi uniforms stain free and</li>
            <li> She says this product is very easy to use and goes on quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the spray button can be locked.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to over do it</li>
            <li> , the scent is just too strong.  </li>
            <li> It is too perfumery and it goes on rather strong.  </li>
            <li> (To be fair, I&#x27;ve been sweating a LOT, but even my old deodorant that isn&#x27;t working as well does a better job than this stinky stuff.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like every strong scent does it.</li>
            <li> lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not irritate my skin and is very gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> - it is a very light mild perfume type smell that for others might not be bothersome however for myself</li>
            <li> First the spray design is really nice.</li>
            <li> The new way to get superior protection</li>
            <li> As an antiperspirant this DEGREE product worked fine.</li>
            <li> The product sprays on really fast and easy, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and has a light scent that is not overpowering if you spray lightly.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just gently press the button and it smoothly dust you with a nice, invisible yet impenetrable layer of a sweat and odor shield.</li>
            <li> It does smell fantastic, but the fumes and scent are so overpowering.</li>
            <li> I wanted something light that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores but that would still give me protection.</li>
            <li> I remain sweat and odor free all day without the greasy, gunky residue of a stick.  </li>
            <li> Still has that sticky feel of a stick deodorant, so I expect it won&#x27;t be stain free</li>
            <li> ANY deodorant is better than NO deodorant right?</li>
            <li> But, I have arthritis and tendonitis, so that&#x27;s most likely my own</li>
            <li> If I decide I like this better than the solids and gels, I may switch to the spray, as I really like the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> enjoy the fresh fragrance</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> It smells good enough that I use it underneath my arms but also under my boobs too.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I am a migraneur and very occasionally a scent can send me into headache land.</li>
            <li> True.</li>
            <li> As far as keeping me dry - it works great!!  </li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is always great to have a choice of two staple items in case a store is out of one or the other.</li>
            <li> The scent was mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;►</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on quick, so one quick push of the button should suffice.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent that fades away quickly after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, a quick way to freshen up.</li>
            <li> The scent is really pleasant, and it goes on dry, it just doesn&#x27;t protect as well as</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t think I have super hero strength B.O...</li>
            <li> Dries really quickly once applied.</li>
            <li> Also, the aroma went away relatively quickly, while the dryness lasted all day.</li>
            <li> This though is quick to put on when maybe running out to the store for s quick errand but.</li>
            <li> The spray has a pronounced but not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Just a light press and the spray covers the whole area and then some.</li>
            <li> That is to say, you have 8 weeks worth of spray in the can.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t fun) and choke.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and definitely works.</li>
            <li> Reading the direction of pushing up on the top container I pushed it completely off.  </li>
            <li> B004DH1BQI Dove go fresh Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Revive 2.6 oz, Twin Pack]]</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ll smell like fresh citrus and B.O....</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> It does keep me fresh</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat a lot and it keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick, convenient, effective, dry, not too smelly, at a tall 3.8 oz.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, it is quick to dry and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not too overpowering and is just right.</li>
            <li> right--</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a decent deodorant that keeps me dry all day and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The shape of the bottle is smart too!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I tried to put my shirt on right away, and it smeared all over my shirt.</li>
            <li> not used a spray very much before.</li>
            <li> Every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used leaves me smelly by mid-afternoon, and if I try to reapply (normally in the bathroom at work), I start sweating more and smell more offensive.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t smell B.O.! ;)</li>
            <li> It is a pretty floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She does think that the roll on stick type works a lot better especially when working out.</li>
            <li> I gasped for air but only inhaled more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> would absolutely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> decided to do the first test run of this product before I went to the gym.</li>
            <li> have been using Dove go fresh Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Cool Essentials for years&lt;br /&gt;due to being so sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the scent is not nice; it smells very nice.  </li>
            <li> spray is very fine, and it is dry on contact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this has happened to everyone: you get dressed, put on a nice top or dress for work, go to apply your deodorant, and a few minutes later you notice white stains under your arms.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty large bathroom too and always have the exhaust fan running, but this spray just seems to linger in the air for quite a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite all of its positive attributes, I doubt I will buy this product.</li>
            <li> it just is too strong when used daily.</li>
            <li> certain cleansers (409), and this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have to get a new deodorant because my faithful favorite for YEARS has recently stopped working as well.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to get a good grip on the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe I sprayed too much?  </li>
            <li> and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really...</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to use as she really likes degree antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> There is a mist when sprayed; I don&#x27;t want to inhale too much of that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reality: This stuff does smell really</li>
            <li> Now this product I was quite surprised that the scent did not bother me too much right away</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent, but its not strong.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because it stated that it would not leave any kind of &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; behind after it was applied.</li>
            <li> It does go on dry, which is good as I like a dry antiperspirant and the feel of that</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t have this issue, I would use this deodorant more often and try other scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Claim: All the ingredients are safe.&lt;br /&gt;Reality: Probably as safe as any other spray on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive nose, and strong scents really bother me, ESPECIALLY if they&#x27;re attached to my person.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the smell is too strong so if you are sensitive to smells this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh and pleasant smell, but unfortunately I had problems with it making me sneeze.  </li>
            <li> I mean, entirely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product left no marks on my clothing and genuinely did its job ... and at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small can fits nicely in my gear bag.</li>
            <li> Actually the first time I sprayed it the rest of the house asked if we had a new air freshener lol.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a highly active person but it seemed to work just fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have to hold a towel over my mouth and nose when I spray it and quickly dash out of the room to avoid breathing it in and gagging a little, but that effort is completely worth it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and it seems to keep my dry all day, unless I run a lot.</li>
            <li> interesting to me was how this antiperspirant did on a black t-shirt test.</li>
            <li> All day dry and its smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It definitely does not last 48 hours.. more like 5 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with different stick deodorants for years, from gel to power to $15-a-stick clinical protections of all brands, and I feel confident enough to say that I am done with my search.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of quick changes from yoga to work and don&#x27;t want to walk around all day with white marks all over my clothes.</li>
            <li> One quick push is enough to cover each armpit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can use candles and deal with junior high school students no problem, but some chemicals just get me.</li>
            <li> early morning class straight through work and home.</li>
            <li> As someone who really needs to use a clinical strength deodorant I was surprised how well this Degree works.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dryer than normal.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell (which is OK in the stick version, but not my fave).</li>
            <li> Anywho...every other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant I have every used has been perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy is an aerosol that doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the area.</li>
            <li> I bought this one last night because I thought the smell was tolerable and it looked all right.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant ... not too strong, not too faint (it is not &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or any other polarizing scent.</li>
            <li> my boxing tee shirts clean looking without underarm wet marks.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I very much like the spray on better than the gel, as it goes on practically instantly dry, and I don&#x27;t have to wave my arms around waiting for it to dry enough to put my clothes on.</li>
            <li> : This didn&#x27;t work any better than my usual brand</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy&lt;br</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy, 3.8 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can go several days without applying deodorant, because I don&#x27;t sweat much.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I do sweat a lot and have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li> and it lasted through the hot day, but not as long as they claim it would.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> i developed an itch.</li>
            <li> Quite a few of the (many) different deodorants and antiperspirants</li>
            <li> I usually use solid stick antiperspirant because it works better for me and my skin is sometimes sensitive to spray antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> I saw the commercials and thought it looked good, which probably should have been my first clue that it was a bad idea to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant spray worked very well for me and did not cause any skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Besides these minor issues, it&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> It is extremely convenient, though, especially post-workout when you need to freshen up quickly.</li>
            <li> She said it works very well and keeps her armpits dry, without visible residues or a tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> and it really goes go on dry</li>
            <li> I walked back in the room when I thought it was clear to finish my morning routine, and immediately started coughing uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> a pretty small bottle, and will likely go fast.</li>
            <li> : Features motion sense technology that responds directly to your body movement, releasing extra protection with every move you make.&lt;br /&gt;Reality:</li>
            <li> : Yes, it does dry quickly after application but it feels like any other antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Likewise, this spray really does dry nearly instantly.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that by the end of 12 hours, it was fading fast.  </li>
            <li> The Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy, 3.8 Oz appears to work about as well an any other.</li>
            <li> I found this antiperspirant spray very cooling and goes on dry and stays dry.  </li>
            <li> I do not use an excessive amount either, so it is not due to me using too much or spraying too long etc.</li>
            <li> I constantly have to throw away shirts and buy new ones (on a tight budget, that means lots of Hanes Men&#x27;s undershirt 5-packs).</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is Aluminum Chlorhydrate, which it has in common with many other sprays.</li>
            <li> The disadvantage is that it is only 3.8 ounces and thus will not last as long.</li>
            <li> was very curious when I saw this new dry antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> It really meant to push the small spray tab and after figuring that out it worked.  </li>
            <li> I even sprayed it directly on some dark clothing to test this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept dry all day, all night and when time for my next shower, there was still no problem with sweat or smell.</li>
            <li> I have Degree Dry Antiperspirant in 3 different scents.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, too, and it does last at least a whole day for me; but sorry, waiting 48 hrs without a shower just to see if it holds seems to be too much.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use again because I&#x27;m wondering what the long term effects of inhaling this stuff will be.</li>
            <li> I have long nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not highly sensitive to that type of thing though so it may be that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an aerosol antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> is not one that I can use daily due to the scent of it</li>
            <li> My other deodorants left the pits in my shirts smelling so foul</li>
            <li> only other problem is that during application there is a cloud of the spray that I can&#x27;t help but breathing in.</li>
            <li> Definitely turn your face the other way when spraying so not to inhale -</li>
            <li> /&gt;DEGREE DRY</li>
            <li> This spray goes on dry and it kept me dry.&lt;br /&gt;►</li>
            <li> Goes on dry and keeps you dry.  </li>
            <li> It goes on quite dry.</li>
            <li> This product kept me dry through a power yoga</li>
            <li> It went on dry and didn&#x27;t feel sticky or clammy.</li>
            <li> This spray comes out dry to the touch and does the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Claim: Goes on instantly dry for a cleaner feel</li>
            <li> I could never use deodorant sprays because they would burn my skin - alcohol or something else would make the skin red and painful, even so the same brand/scent of the deodorant in a stick or gel form would work fine with no</li>
            <li> As antiperspirants go, this Degree Dry Spray did indeed go on dry and the Fresh Energy scent was mildly floral without smelling sickening.</li>
            <li> It kept me dry as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Having very dry skin, I like to use products that don&#x27;t contain alcohol, this one does not.</li>
            <li> However, somehow, the intense scent fades slightly but seems to stick around while a faint B.O. smell begins to shine through near the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The smell seems to fade after a while though, and towards the end of an active day it is not a complete coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is an add-on only item</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful of using something that is not going to irritate my skin</li>
            <li> vs. the wet type of sprays.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on as a spray (read: liquid), and it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I put it on after my shower last night, and I guess it reacted with dead skin or something?</li>
            <li> Because clumps of dead skin mixed with deodorant got EVERYWHERE after about a minute of it being on (including my clothes, and it WOULDN&#x27;T COME OUT!!).</li>
            <li> Took me a sec to figure that you needed to slide the &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; forward a notch, then spray.</li>
            <li> have also learned that I can not spray this in our tiny small guest bathroom or i feel like i walk through a cloud of scent.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I have to order other stuff to get it,</li>
            <li> I usually use Degree solid</li>
            <li> other problem I have with this is the spray button.  </li>
            <li> daughter, on the other hand, had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Active ingredient:</li>
            <li> It is a little harder to grip the can and press with your finger on this small nozzle with enough pressure to make it spray.</li>
            <li> Obviously, their marketing department works hard.</li>
            <li> bottle is rather tall though, which can be a minor issue when you want to store it in a small bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> No noticeable marks on dark clothing from it also.</li>
            <li> Plus, the spray didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my dark blouses.</li>
            <li> I like the spray&#x27;s button, as I can slide it down slightly to lock it from accidental hits or drops.</li>
            <li> I used this product and immediately put on a black t-shirt.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard for me to depress the spray button.  </li>
            <li> It dries a little wierd...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a stinky or overly active person and I live somewhere quite cold, so I&#x27;m almost never sweating.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months now, and it gets the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also leaves behind a white residue</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t become my go-to, everyday choice for deodorant.</li>
            <li> I could smell it through a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to secret&#x27;s va-va-vanilla.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy of a scent, and works okayish.</li>
            <li> so it will be easier to press down on the small nozzle.  </li>
            <li> These would be things like imitation Angel (yes I mean those drugstore imitations of fragrances)  </li>
            <li> This spray wasn&#x27;t so bad the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> So, I have learned to spray it on and then try to run out of the bathroom for at least 15 minutes or so,which is inconvenient because normally after applying my deodorant I go on with my routine and finish doing my hair, makeup etc.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Degree gel.</li>
            <li> my usual deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost twice as expensive as my regular Dove deodorant/ antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried in the past year</li>
            <li> However, The next morning, it smells stale and I still need a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually buy is sometimes hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the button itself, it&#x27;s hard to press because it&#x27;s too close to the edge of the container</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard to push.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s working into the late evening and through the night.  </li>
            <li> That does not hold water, at least for me and my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> One squirt and be prepared to be engulfed in a thick cloud of toxic dust that linger in the air for hours.</li>
            <li> It seems a little bit difficult to push.</li>
            <li> And then, I put it on this morning, and not two hours later I&#x27;m already beginning to smell bad.</li>
            <li> But it seems rather hard to spray your arm pits the wrong way.</li>
            <li> But I played a softball game and had no body odor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that difficult.&amp;#34; Boy should I have listened to the poor asthmatic lady.</li>
            <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t seem to do that, or at least, not as badly.</li>
            <li> In addition, the spray lock can sometimes be difficult to engage/disengage without accidentally pressing the button (to spray).</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> What could possibly be wrong with it?&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Even if you weren&#x27;t afraid of all that being hosed onto your lymph nodes, at 3.8 oz.</li>
            <li> All around a bad product.</li>
            <li> Bad headaches, tasting it in the air, can smell it over my perfume and candles in the house, etc.</li>
            <li> but, I am disappointed with the design of the spray button.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These have been retired to the gym bag deodorant, the car deodorant, and the &#x27;just in case I run out of deodorant and I can&#x27;t steal my husbands deodorant&#x27; deodorant. :(</li>
            <li> hate how the solids and gels gunk up under the arms of your clothing.</li>
            <li> (my life looks really boring when I see it written down...need to work on that)</li>
            <li> This is AWFUL!!!!</li>

            <li> The Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy, 3.8 Oz appears to work about as well an any other. The active ingredient is Aluminum Chlorhydrate, which it has in common with many other sprays. Here the percentage is slightly higher, 23.3 percent vs. the usual 20 percent.  The spray has a pronounced but not unpleasant fragrance. The advantage of a 3.8 ounce container is that it is easier to grip than larger spray cans. The disadvantage is that it is only 3.8 ounces and thus will not last as long.</li>
            <li> As an antiperspirant this DEGREE product worked fine. It kept me dry as I expected.  However the mixture that was put in the air aggravated my asthma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEGREE DRY&lt;br /&gt;► It works!  This spray goes on dry and it kept me dry.&lt;br /&gt;► The scent was mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;► Easy-to-hold shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I found that the DEGREE ANTIPERSPIRANT worked better than the DOVE Aerosol ANTIPERSPIRANT I also just reviewed.  But I won&#x27;t be using either as either something in the propellant I suspect bothers my asthma.</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy&lt;br /&gt;Ok thought I would try this antiperspirant for a change of routine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Dove go fresh Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Cool Essentials for years&lt;br /&gt;due to being so sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Have not used a spray very much before. Now this product I was quite surprised that the scent did not bother me too much right away but I have learned that over time it is too overpowering and gives me a headache by the end of the day -&lt;br /&gt;I have also learned that I can not spray this in our tiny small guest bathroom or i feel like i walk through a cloud of scent.&lt;br /&gt; Actually the first time I sprayed it the rest of the house asked if we had a new air freshener lol.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a highly active person but it seemed to work just fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;This is not one that I can use daily due to the scent of it - it is a very light mild perfume type smell that for others might not be bothersome however for myself it just is too strong when used daily.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a spray on antiperspirant in years. I usually use the Degree gel. I very much like the spray on better than the gel, as it goes on practically instantly dry, and I don&#x27;t have to wave my arms around waiting for it to dry enough to put my clothes on. I like the scent of it, once the aerosol smell goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on quick, so one quick push of the button should suffice. The can says it will last for 8 weeks. That is to say, you have 8 weeks worth of spray in the can. I like the shape of the can, it&#x27;s nice and slender and sleek, however, I&#x27;m not that excited about the push button. It seems a little bit difficult to push. But, I have arthritis and tendonitis, so that&#x27;s most likely my own issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate how the solids and gels gunk up under the arms of your clothing. This spray doesn&#x27;t seem to do that, or at least, not as badly. If I decide I like this better than the solids and gels, I may switch to the spray, as I really like the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful of using something that is not going to irritate my skin so a lot of times I use women’s deodorant so my under arms don’t start burning and give me a rash. My wife and I have both been using this product and we are in agreement that we will be adding this to our grocery list when this bottle runs out. A nice smell that was not overpowering. From a marketing standpoint I also liked the shape of the bottle and the feel of it in your hand which is nice and cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be using again!</li>
            <li> Eh. Smells ok. Not the best scent I&#x27;ve tried. Keeps me dryer than normal. I have has it make those gross deodorant balls under my arms. Maybe I sprayed too much?  Will make a cloud of product so hold your breath and prepare to run out of the room. Won&#x27;t use again because I&#x27;m wondering what the long term effects of inhaling this stuff will be.</li>
            <li> I ordered this antiperspirant spray for my wife. She said it works very well and keeps her armpits dry, without visible residues or a tacky feeling. There is no stinging sensation of alcohol when praying on the skin and it dries fast. It is easy to use and the spray button can be locked. It has a mild scent that fades away quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is rather tall though, which can be a minor issue when you want to store it in a small bathroom cabinet. In addition, the spray lock can sometimes be difficult to engage/disengage without accidentally pressing the button (to spray). Besides these minor issues, it&#x27;s very convenient to use. She just leaves it in her gym bag and sprays it after exercises.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have mixed feelings. It does smell fantastic, but the fumes and scent are so overpowering. It is extremely convenient, though, especially post-workout when you need to freshen up quickly. When I use it in the morning, sometimes it chokes up my boyfriend who is in the shower. I have to hold my breath and step out of the room when I use it so I don&#x27;t inhale it (which will happen..it isn&#x27;t fun) and choke. It definitely does not last 48 hours.. more like 5 hours. BUT, unlike stick deodorant, you can reapply without feeling like it&#x27;s layered on your skin. Again, a quick way to freshen up. All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a daily deodorant, but one to keep in your gym bag.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and definitely works. It dries a little wierd...filmy almost.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have to hold a towel over my mouth and nose when I spray it and quickly dash out of the room to avoid breathing it in and gagging a little, but that effort is completely worth it! I have been struggling with different stick deodorants for years, from gel to power to $15-a-stick clinical protections of all brands, and I feel confident enough to say that I am done with my search. My other deodorants left the pits in my shirts smelling so foul I constantly have to throw away shirts and buy new ones (on a tight budget, that means lots of Hanes Men&#x27;s undershirt 5-packs). Every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used leaves me smelly by mid-afternoon, and if I try to reapply (normally in the bathroom at work), I start sweating more and smell more offensive. This spray stuff is amazing. It keeps me dry and smelling great all day, and I get to keep my shirts! 10 stars if I could! My only complaint is that it is an add-on only item and I have to order other stuff to get it, but that&#x27;s on Amazon, not the product! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent, but its not strong.  Takes a backseat to any perfume you might wear.  Goes on dry and keeps you dry.  A good spray deodorant to have in your arsenal.  No noticeable marks on dark clothing from it also.</li>
            <li> I found this antiperspirant spray very cooling and goes on dry and stays dry.  It is a wonderful product and after I figured out howto use the spray.  Reading the direction of pushing up on the top container I pushed it completely off.  It really meant to push the small spray tab and after figuring that out it worked.  It is a little harder to grip the can and press with your finger on this small nozzle with enough pressure to make it spray. My hands and fingers at my age 89 are not as strong and agile as in my youth.  I find it hard to get a good grip on the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the fresh fragrance and it really goes go on dry which is what I appreciate.  I will keep working at getting a stronger grip on the can so it will be easier to press down on the small nozzle.  Other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this one.  As far as keeping me dry - it works great!!  I know it&#x27;s working into the late evening and through the night.  I usually use Degree solid and I think this one works even better than my favorite tried and true antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the scent is just too strong.  It&#x27;s not that the scent is not nice; it smells very nice.  But, I smell it every time I lift my arm or move around or even when I&#x27;m just sitting.  It&#x27;s a lovely floral/fresh scent, but I had to stop using this because the scent was too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family thinks I&#x27;m nuts, they love the scent.  I like it, too!  Really... But it&#x27;s just too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I have with this is the spray button.  I have long nails and it&#x27;s really hard for me to depress the spray button.  It&#x27;s not the button itself, it&#x27;s hard to press because it&#x27;s too close to the edge of the container and there&#x27;s not enough room for my finger and nail.  It&#x27;s hard to describe...  but, I am disappointed with the design of the spray button.  It&#x27;s too hard to push.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t provide the superb protection that it advertises.  I can go several days without applying deodorant, because I don&#x27;t sweat much.  I had to apply this daily, or I would have a problem with odor.  The scent is really pleasant, and it goes on dry, it just doesn&#x27;t protect as well as my usual deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use [[ASIN:B004DH1BQI Dove go fresh Anti-Perspirant Deodorant, Revive 2.6 oz, Twin Pack]] and I can sometimes go 5 days without applying it.  I will stick with my Dove deodorant.</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy is an aerosol that doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the area. Just a light press and the spray covers the whole area and then some. It has a fresh and pleasant smell, but unfortunately I had problems with it making me sneeze.  For me, the antiperspirant work wonderfully - I kept dry all day, all night and when time for my next shower, there was still no problem with sweat or smell. Things smelled as if I had just sprayed the antiperspirant on - scent and all. However, I ended up with problems with irritation and itching and even days after, it is still bothering me. For me, I give it a 3 star rating because of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, on the other hand, had no problems with it. It works well for her and she really likes it. She says it&#x27;s a 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to work well. Wish I could have used it!</li>
            <li> I usually use solid stick antiperspirant because it works better for me and my skin is sometimes sensitive to spray antiperspirants.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant spray worked very well for me and did not cause any skin issues.  I like the fragrance and will consider buying the product in the future as the brand and type I usually buy is sometimes hard to find.  It is always great to have a choice of two staple items in case a store is out of one or the other.</li>
            <li> ANY deodorant is better than NO deodorant right? I really wanted to love this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for good spray deodorant/antiperspirants for years. In college I lived in Europe and everyone used spray deodorant so I tried it. Loved it. AND IT WORKED. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to find any American equivalent. I have Degree Dry Antiperspirant in 3 different scents. They&#x27;re all very....intense. I can see why some people say they choke or can&#x27;t breathe when they spray them. However, somehow, the intense scent fades slightly but seems to stick around while a faint B.O. smell begins to shine through near the end of the day. So you&#x27;ll smell like fresh citrus and B.O.... YUMM.... Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong? But it seems rather hard to spray your arm pits the wrong way. I&#x27;m not a stinky or overly active person and I live somewhere quite cold, so I&#x27;m almost never sweating. I wake up shower go to work, workout, come home shower. Repeat. (my life looks really boring when I see it written down...need to work on that) Anywho...every other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant I have every used has been perfectly fine. Even the really cheap kind you want to try just because it look like it smell good. So, I don&#x27;t think I have super hero strength B.O... I&#x27;m still on the search for the perfect spray deodorant/antiperspirant that I miss from college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have been retired to the gym bag deodorant, the car deodorant, and the &#x27;just in case I run out of deodorant and I can&#x27;t steal my husbands deodorant&#x27; deodorant. :(</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and I tend to sweat. I work out a lot, both at the gym, and running outdoors. I wanted something light that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores but that would still give me protection. This is exactly what I needed! I enjoy the scent and it seems to keep my dry all day, unless I run a lot. The smell seems to fade after a while though, and towards the end of an active day it is not a complete coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other problem is that during application there is a cloud of the spray that I can&#x27;t help but breathing in. It sometimes triggers my asthma. I find that the best way to deal with this is to open a window and turn on a fan while applying it, and then leaving the room for a while since the smell lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not irritate my skin and is very gentle but effective. I have used it for a few months now, and it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a decent deodorant that keeps me dry all day and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is awesome it doesn&#x27;t make me sweat  and I&#x27;m totally gonna keep ordering cuz I can&#x27;t find them in the store</li>
            <li> Has a musty scent I don&#x27;t care for</li>
            <li> It works pretty good for a strong antiperspirant. For those of you having the issues inhaling it I found if I put my tshirt on then spray it under my shirt it&#x27;s way better. The fumes don&#x27;t go everywhere, they stay inside the shirt. Anyways its worked for me using this method. I&#x27;m not highly sensitive to that type of thing though so it may be that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t bother me. But I played a softball game and had no body odor and I do sweat a lot and have a sensitive nose so I smell everything! Haha. But I didn&#x27;t smell B.O.! ;)</li>
            <li> Great scent and long-lasting! Dries really quickly once applied. Set it and forget it! Great buy, great deal.</li>
            <li> Just bought this one since I wanted a change from the one I was using until now. I like the smell of this and it lasted through the hot day, but not as long as they claim it would.&lt;br /&gt;Its a pretty small bottle, and will likely go fast.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel of this product.  The can is not bulky and it had perfect application with the contoured can.  I can go all day without having to worry about underarm odors.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but I do not think it does what it ways that it does.  It does go on dry, which is good as I like a dry antiperspirant and the feel of that vs. the wet type of sprays.  However, I am not too fond of the smell of this one.  It is too perfumery and it goes on rather strong.  The other thing is that by the end of 12 hours, it was fading fast.  So, that product says it is a 48 hour deodorant.  That does not hold water, at least for me and my body chemistry.  So, this would not be a product that I would order again.</li>
            <li> Degree is my favorite antiperspirant, it doesn&#x27;t stain my whites and it works. I took off a star because I&#x27;m not so sure I like the spray part, it&#x27;s easy to over do it and I&#x27;m always coughing afterwards. I like it, I&#x27;m athletic and hot flashing, so I know it works, but for me, the aerosol may not be a good idea.</li>
            <li> I have not used a spray-on antiperspirant in years, preferring a roll on. I thought i&#x27;d give this a try. The spray has a locking cap. It has a healthy volume with each spray. This version was &amp;#34;Fresh Energy&amp;#34; and I like the scent a lot. It is a pretty floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most interesting to me was how this antiperspirant did on a black t-shirt test. I do a lot of quick changes from yoga to work and don&#x27;t want to walk around all day with white marks all over my clothes. I used this product and immediately put on a black t-shirt.Very impressed; there were no white marks. It goes on quite dry. This product kept me dry through a power yoga early morning class straight through work and home. Lasted all day. I&#x27;m still not convinced about the spray part but I like the product quite a bit. It works.</li>
            <li> As antiperspirants go, this Degree Dry Spray did indeed go on dry and the Fresh Energy scent was mildly floral without smelling sickening. Also, the aroma went away relatively quickly, while the dryness lasted all day. I like the spray&#x27;s button, as I can slide it down slightly to lock it from accidental hits or drops. One quick push is enough to cover each armpit.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s quick, convenient, effective, dry, not too smelly, at a tall 3.8 oz. it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space. What could possibly be wrong with it?&lt;br /&gt;1. Active ingredient: aluminum chlorohydrate 23.3%, inactive ingredients include: butane, cyclopentasiloxane, hydrofluorocarbon, PPG-14, even hydrolyzed corn starch. Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;2. Even if you weren&#x27;t afraid of all that being hosed onto your lymph nodes, at 3.8 oz. and flammable, you can&#x27;t take it on a plane.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s made in Mexico, whose environmental policies may not be in line with current &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; standards.&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll go back to my salt crystal rock until something else comes along that&#x27;s not toxic.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to use as she really likes degree antiperspirant. She says this product is very easy to use and goes on quickly. The smell is not too overpowering and is just right. She does think that the roll on stick type works a lot better especially when working out. This though is quick to put on when maybe running out to the store for s quick errand but.</li>
            <li> I could never use deodorant sprays because they would burn my skin - alcohol or something else would make the skin red and painful, even so the same brand/scent of the deodorant in a stick or gel form would work fine with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I was very curious when I saw this new dry antiperspirant. It claims not to have alcohol in it, so I gave it a try. Well, it works and there is no burning. The smell is fine, too, and it does last at least a whole day for me; but sorry, waiting 48 hrs without a shower just to see if it holds seems to be too much.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is very fine, and it is dry on contact. Definitely turn your face the other way when spraying so not to inhale - I forgot about this aspect of the sprays!</li>
            <li> This Degree Women Dry Spray Antiperspirant works great! All day dry and its smells fantastic. As someone who really needs to use a clinical strength deodorant I was surprised how well this Degree works. The shape of the bottle is smart too! It&#x27;s slim so if you have to put it on under your shirt it&#x27;s not a hassle. I highly recommend this product! Price is perfect as well!</li>
            <li> So far I love it. First the spray design is really nice. It&#x27;s inset into the top of the can and you need to sort of push it up for it to spray. What this means is it doesn&#x27;t need a top to cover the spray mechanism (which I&#x27;m gonna lose anyway) and it doesn&#x27;t get accidently sprayed while in my gym bag. It smells good enough that I use it underneath my arms but also under my boobs too. I sweat there also and, like I said it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need extra protection and this seems to cover it.</li>
            <li> This irritated the skin on my underarms..  i developed an itch. Also leaves behind a white residue</li>
            <li> This is AWFUL!!!! Don&#x27;t buy it! I saw the commercials and thought it looked good, which probably should have been my first clue that it was a bad idea to purchase this. I glanced over the reviews here and decided to try out this deodorant. I&#x27;m ashamed to admit that I scoffed at the review that said it caused an asthma attack. I though, &amp;#34;just don&#x27;t breathe it in, lady. It&#x27;s not that difficult.&amp;#34; Boy should I have listened to the poor asthmatic lady. This product sprays EVERYWHERE. You can&#x27;t just gently press the button and it smoothly dust you with a nice, invisible yet impenetrable layer of a sweat and odor shield. If only. One squirt and be prepared to be engulfed in a thick cloud of toxic dust that linger in the air for hours. I sprayed myself (while holding my breath), and then left the room while the fumes subsided. I walked back in the room when I thought it was clear to finish my morning routine, and immediately started coughing uncontrollably. I gasped for air but only inhaled more of this stuff. It is invisible--they got that part right-- but it has been over a week and I still feel it in my lungs as this cough still lingers. Save your lungs and don&#x27;t buy this. Not to mention that the scent is also overwhelming for about 25 minutes, and then there is no odor control. And at no point was there sweat control. All around a bad product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an aerosol antiperspirant. The design is nicer and much different from aerosol cans back in the day. Push forward to unlock - cute. I find the scent pleasant but a bit strong. There is a mist when sprayed; I don&#x27;t want to inhale too much of that. It does keep me fresh but I&#x27;ll stick with the Degree Invisible Solid.</li>
            <li> This spray smells really good and seems to work well as an antiperspirant. I can smell it throughout the day sometimes when I use it. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that when you spray it on, it sprays a lot and clouds up the bathroom and you end up inhaling it. There&#x27;s no way to avoid it. It seems to hang in the air for quite a bit. So, I have learned to spray it on and then try to run out of the bathroom for at least 15 minutes or so,which is inconvenient because normally after applying my deodorant I go on with my routine and finish doing my hair, makeup etc. I have a pretty large bathroom too and always have the exhaust fan running, but this spray just seems to linger in the air for quite a while. If it didn&#x27;t have this issue, I would use this deodorant more often and try other scents. I do not use an excessive amount either, so it is not due to me using too much or spraying too long etc.</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray is a good product. It went on dry and didn&#x27;t feel sticky or clammy. Plus, the spray didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my dark blouses. Also, it didn&#x27;t burn to put the product on after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of its positive attributes, I doubt I will buy this product. It&#x27;s almost twice as expensive as my regular Dove deodorant/ antiperspirant. I know the Degree spray says that it lasts for 48 hours but, I didn&#x27;t like the idea of skipping my daily application of deodorant enough to test this out. So, I will go back to using my regular, cheaper deodorant that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> To activate the product, simply push/slide the button forward. This unlocks the canister. It can also be moved backed to a locked position if one wishes to take it on a vacation, a hike, etc. The fragrance is pleasant ... not too strong, not too faint (it is not &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or any other polarizing scent. &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; seems like the perfect word to describe it). Likewise, this spray really does dry nearly instantly. No greasiness, no moisture, no stickiness. I mean, entirely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product left no marks on my clothing and genuinely did its job ... and at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This spray comes out dry to the touch and does the job.  I remain sweat and odor free all day without the greasy, gunky residue of a stick.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  The fragrance is also quite pleasant.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because it stated that it would not leave any kind of &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; behind after it was applied. I&#x27;m sure this has happened to everyone: you get dressed, put on a nice top or dress for work, go to apply your deodorant, and a few minutes later you notice white stains under your arms. Quite a few of the (many) different deodorants and antiperspirants I&#x27;ve tried in the past year have left this residue.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do the first test run of this product before I went to the gym. The product sprays on really fast and easy, which is nice. It has a simple turn and lock cap. It also smells AMAZING! One of the best smelling hygiene products I&#x27;ve ever had. This product held up really well through my morning gym class, and by 6:00pm that evening, it still smelled great. These are the pros. Now, as for the con.. This is definitely not something I would use unless I was undressed and had SEVERAL minutes to kill between spraying on my antiperspirant and getting dressed. This product goes on as a spray (read: liquid), and it&#x27;s wet. The first time I used it, I tried to put my shirt on right away, and it smeared all over my shirt. And while it does smell great, it&#x27;s not a smell I want all over my clothes. In conclusion, I would use this product occasionally. It won&#x27;t become my go-to, everyday choice for deodorant. This is probably something I would choose when going to the gym or wearing a strapless top.</li>
            <li> I have to get a new deodorant because my faithful favorite for YEARS has recently stopped working as well. I bought this one last night because I thought the smell was tolerable and it looked all right. I put it on after my shower last night, and I guess it reacted with dead skin or something? Because clumps of dead skin mixed with deodorant got EVERYWHERE after about a minute of it being on (including my clothes, and it WOULDN&#x27;T COME OUT!!). The smell? Not tolerable. I have a really sensitive nose, and strong scents really bother me, ESPECIALLY if they&#x27;re attached to my person. And then, I put it on this morning, and not two hours later I&#x27;m already beginning to smell bad. This deodorant is NOT for me. (To be fair, I&#x27;ve been sweating a LOT, but even my old deodorant that isn&#x27;t working as well does a better job than this stinky stuff.)</li>
            <li> This spray wasn&#x27;t so bad the first time I used it. Not a huge fan of the smell (which is OK in the stick version, but not my fave). By the second and third use I can&#x27;t stand it. Bad headaches, tasting it in the air, can smell it over my perfume and candles in the house, etc. To be fair, I am a migraneur and very occasionally a scent can send me into headache land. It&#x27;s not like every strong scent does it. I can use candles and deal with junior high school students no problem, but some chemicals just get me. These would be things like imitation Angel (yes I mean those drugstore imitations of fragrances)  certain cleansers (409), and this deodorant. I could smell it through a heavy sweater. It&#x27;s the middle of winter here in kansas land, so even through my layers it permeates the air. It does go on dryish. Still has that sticky feel of a stick deodorant, so I expect it won&#x27;t be stain free which is what I was aiming for. I&#x27;m going back to secret&#x27;s va-va-vanilla. Not too heavy of a scent, and works okayish.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell and works really well.</li>
            <li> Degree Women Dry Antiperspirant Spray, Fresh Energy, 3.8 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product.  I love the way it goes on, the way it feels, the way it smells.  It does its job so beautifully.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  This product does its job so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that everybody is different, but this product works for me.  I would recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product in the future.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> Having very dry skin, I like to use products that don&#x27;t contain alcohol, this one does not. It dries very quickly and has a light scent that is not overpowering if you spray lightly. I spend many hours training in a kung fu school and this product keeps my silk tai chi uniforms stain free and my boxing tee shirts clean looking without underarm wet marks. The small can fits nicely in my gear bag.</li>
            <li> Smells great , works great. The spray mechanism has a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; that makes this a perfect spray for the gym bag. Took me a sec to figure that you needed to slide the &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; forward a notch, then spray. It also made me realize that this would go great in my gym bag after I work out, I am always either using a stick or worried that my spray will &amp;#34;leak&amp;#34; (aka get accidentally triggered). This one does it all!</li>
            <li> Claim: The new way to get superior protection&lt;br /&gt;Reality: This didn&#x27;t work any better than my usual brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim: Goes on instantly dry for a cleaner feel&lt;br /&gt;Reality: Yes, it does dry quickly after application but it feels like any other antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim: Provides 48 hour odor and wetness protection&lt;br /&gt;Reality: I don&#x27;t sweat a lot and it keeps me fresh all day. However, The next morning, it smells stale and I still need a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim: No visible residue&lt;br /&gt;Reality: True. It does not leave any residue. I even sprayed it directly on some dark clothing to test this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim: Features motion sense technology that responds directly to your body movement, releasing extra protection with every move you make.&lt;br /&gt;Reality: OH PLEASE! Is this antiperspirant or body armor? Obviously, their marketing department works hard. I definitely did NOT feel any extra protection when I moved. Conversely, If I sweat a lot, this does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim: Featuring a scent to jumpstart your senses with bright bursts of lily of the valley and tiare flower.&lt;br /&gt;Reality: This stuff does smell really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim: All the ingredients are safe.&lt;br /&gt;Reality: Probably as safe as any other spray on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Notes:&lt;br /&gt;* When I spray this stuff, I have to turn on the bathroom fan and hold my breath. All the particles all over make me choke.&lt;br /&gt;* The bottle shape is nice and the button works well.</li>
            <li> love this deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is about time that spray deodorants started being sold in America and this one is perfect. The smell is amazing, it is quick to dry and lasts all day.  Only downside is the smell is too strong so if you are sensitive to smells this might not be for you.</li>
