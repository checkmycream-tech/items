            <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted to this soap since my trip to Spain, but $5 plus S&amp;H?  Yikes!  I think I&#x27;ll just go to Walgreens and get it for $2 instead!</li>

            <li> Have been using this soap for about a month now. It is great. Lasts so much longer than other soaps and smells very very fresh. It is my new favorite soap of the year. It is at Target for about $4 for 3 bars and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice clean scented soap that leaves the skin feeling moist and not dry.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and hope to continue to do so.  The seller sent it in a timely fashion without high shipping costs which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Once I tried this soap, I will never use another.  The lather is silky smooth and the fragrance fresh without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> love this soap, it&#x27;s my all-time favorite, natural, non-irritating with light, fresh scent    shipping was a bit expensive</li>
            <li> This soap is very famous in spain. And I notice that it is very popular but also used by mens.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lemon grass fragrance for freshness feel. People are suffering from Gender Identity Disorder (GID).</li>
            <li> I am of the male gender and I have been using this soap for years. it makes me smell fresh and clean all day. I do not why they say its for women does not say it the package.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap. I receive compliments and questions about &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;. When I shower with this soap, it radiates throughout the whole house!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED SAME PRODUCT FROM TWO SELLERS, ONE OF THEM ( THIS ONE) THIS SOAP IS MADE IN MEXICO, I AM NOT SURE IF HENO DE PRAVIA HAS THIS PRODUCT MANUFACTURED IN MEXICO.  I COMPARED SOAP MADE IN SPAIN AND SOAP MADE IN MEXICO, YOU CAN FEEL DIFFERENCES IN QUALITY.</li>
            <li> I found out about this soap from my sister. I love the smell. I&#x27;d call it uni-sex soap. Amazon offers a good soap for a good price. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great! Leaves you feeling very clean, lasts a lot longer than your average store-bought soap, and I&#x27;d even swear that it leaves almost zero soap scum on my tub or my skin! My grandmother and mother both have used this soap forever, but now that I&#x27;ve brought it into my own home by bf and my son don&#x27;t want to use anything else!</li>
            <li> great gift for women...clean, fresh scent.</li>

            <li> We love this fresh, clean smelling soap.  It lasts well too.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> They write in the description that the soaps  made in Spain -  got it and it&#x27;s not ! made in Mexico !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap in Lima, Peru every time I went there to visit my family, until I discovered that Amazon was selling it! Since I bought the cologne, it made sense to buy the soap, too . . . I love this scent!  It&#x27;s similar to Jean Nate, but the fragance of Heno De Pravia is way better!</li>
            <li> please change my name to Gladsusie as this soap is just wonderful.  I found in years ago when I lived in FL at the local CVS store.  Once it gained popularity, tho, it was very difficult to find.  Thanks for making my day with this exceptional product!</li>
            <li> We discovered this soap while traveling in Spain. We love the fragrance and texture, and were delighted to discover that it is available on amazon.</li>
