            <li>I LOVED the color.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The first week of use it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>The color when its not as bright is what I like better.</li>
            <li>So be sure you want something bright when you put it on.</li>
            <li>this just isn&#x27;t a good option unless you are looking for a very bold reaction.</li>
            <li>It went on very smoothly and felt sort of like a chapstick.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>There are better items on the market.</li>
            <li>But I do love it.</li>
            <li>Love the fuchsia color.</li>
            <li>Would like to find a better product in the &#x27;mood lipsticks&#x27;.</li>
            <li>But I  love it</li>
            <li>I love this..</li>
            <li>So its okay.</li>
            <li>At lest it was a cute color on everyone.</li>
            <li>Cute novelty item.</li>
            <li>I love the product!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The more you put, the darker the color.</li>
            <li>They vary, but it&#x27;s pretty bright fuchsia every time.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t turn a very good similar to lipstick color.</li>
            <li>It is not the perfect pink for me.  </li>
            <li>I think that is the most important factor.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product but not a crazy good one either</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool though!</li>
            <li>Love that the color is unique for each person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a beautiful pinkish red.</li>
            <li>Looks great on my fair skin - very bright and fun, but not overwhelming and definitely still office appropriate.</li>
            <li>This has a nice color and the price is cheap but it has a funny smell and taste.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is supposed to change into the shade that&#x27;s supposed to fit your ph levels and skin tone.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy mood changing lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>, color change too light, and dries out lips.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly and it has no scent.</li>
            <li>This product felt good going on and didn&#x27;t leave your lips sticky, but turned my lips a bright shade of unattractive hot pink.</li>
            <li>This is so fun!</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t make any of them like the original ones...</li>
            <li>the next time i did one layer and it looked nice!</li>
            <li>right away I knew I had to get it!</li>
            <li>Most PH reactive lip colors turn my lips a nice light pink shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to spend the extra money and buy Dior &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; if you want a lipstick, or if you are looking for a sticky lip gloss L.A. Colors &amp;#34;Mood&amp;#34; is is a good inexpensive option.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get a super bright pink color.</li>
            <li>My lips turn out a great HOT PINK!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the pink color this gave me, and also enjoyed freaking people out as I applied &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; lipstick.</li>
            <li>Loved the pink color it gave!</li>
            <li>Was delivered very very fast.</li>
            <li>It does go on clear but then turns into a super bright pink.</li>
            <li>Intended placing larger orders if product was ok - but I guarantee that is not going to happen</li>
            <li>It goes on a very sheer pink, but within a minute or two it blooms into a bright, rich pinkish color.</li>
            <li>The color was very bright pink for me at first but after a while it calmed down.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick and it does stay on for a long time.  </li>
            <li>many long wear products are very drying on the lips</li>
            <li>It lasts fairly well and is hard to get off.</li>
            <li>Expected to get more of a stain like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>It works really well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>You can build up color as much as you want</li>
            <li>The pigment really matches her skin tone.</li>
            <li>I guess for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Tracking only became available 2 days ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend this to someone who is open minded and fun when it comes to lip colors!</li>
            <li>Although I was not crazy about the shade of pink this turned out to be (it was darker than I had hoped it would be), t&#x27;s still a cool product</li>
            <li>The intensity of the color wouldn&#x27;t change based on how much you put, the color started appearing instantly and it wouldn&#x27;t last more than hour!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My lips were smooth and it stayed on for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>but I happen to love less product as it makes it look</li>
            <li>It was fun but not for daily wear.</li>
            <li>everyone loves it and it gets pinkier if you layer it on top of itself a few times.</li>
            <li>It turns very pink, but she has dark skin and lips and looks good wearing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s green and is extremely bright pink when I put it on.</li>
            <li>This is my Moms favorite lipstick due to its moisturizing ability and lasting color.</li>
            <li>But the only thing for me is that it looked like a lip stain at first, which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
            <li>the first time i put it on, i did multiple layers and it looked like i ate a cherry popsicle.</li>
            <li>It lasts but the color is a a very hot neon pink - everytime</li>
            <li>Pretty much made everyones lips the same pinkey red.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and this lipsticks stays on for a long time without drying out your lips.</li>
            <li>It had no smell as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>But it pretty much has the same color pink nearly every time.</li>
            <li>But once you later it it&#x27;ll look less like a stain and more like an actual lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>though it was going to be a natural pink, but I was very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Everyone turned out HOT PINK!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect everything from light pink to dark red.</li>
            <li>like I naturally have soft pink lips</li>
            <li>It is VERY vivid pink.</li>
            <li>It is very hard to get off and pretty much stains your lips</li>
            <li>and it does go from clear to pink.</li>

            <li> Everyone turned out HOT PINK!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect everything from light pink to dark red.</li>
            <li> like I naturally have soft pink lips</li>
            <li> It is VERY vivid pink.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get off and pretty much stains your lips</li>
            <li> and it does go from clear to pink.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and not too drying.</li>
            <li> A friend tried a little on her hand and it didn&#x27;t completely disappear for several days.</li>
            <li> but this was moisturizing and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> but this color suits me and even though it does not stay on for as long I still like it.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really about mood</li>
            <li> My lips were fluorescent pink for days.  </li>
            <li> The color was way too pink and didn&#x27;t match my complexion well.</li>
            <li> lips were also neon pink.</li>
            <li> Used to stay on longer and change to a darker pink color</li>
            <li> It is not really a &amp;#34;mood lipstick&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this product really works.  </li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t dry out my lips, but won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I heard about this lipstick a few weeks before I purchased it and</li>
            <li> No sign of green.</li>
            <li> Not a cute color.  </li>
            <li> The item broke right away at the base.</li>
            <li> The color it turns to doesn&#x27;t really match my tan Filipino skin :(</li>
            <li> not really thrilled about this lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 24 hour wear and for the price its really not that bad.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this lipstick.</li>

            <li> I enjoyed the pink color this gave me, and also enjoyed freaking people out as I applied &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is my Moms favorite lipstick due to its moisturizing ability and lasting color. It turns very pink, but she has dark skin and lips and looks good wearing it. It arrived in sealed package, excellent condition and at promised time.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lipstick! Individual shade for each wearer.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my mom because she said she couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  She is so pleased because it always is her perfect color since it is enhanced by mood.</li>
            <li> Love it! It is long lasting and not too drying. Excellent color!</li>
            <li> This lipstick was very nice. It went on very smoothly and felt sort of like a chapstick. It had no smell as far as I could tell. I LOVED the color.  It was a beautiful pinkish red. I had no makeup on at the time and it still looked great. LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> I heard about this lipstick a few weeks before I purchased it and right away I knew I had to get it! It&#x27;s not really about mood it&#x27;s about your ph levels and such. This lipstick is supposed to change into the shade that&#x27;s supposed to fit your ph levels and skin tone. It&#x27;s anvil itself amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I think it works perfectly! But the only thing for me is that it looked like a lip stain at first, which I&#x27;m not a fan of. But once you later it it&#x27;ll look less like a stain and more like an actual lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to someone who is open minded and fun when it comes to lip colors!</li>
            <li> My lips were fluorescent pink for days.  Not a cute color.  I&#x27;ll probably never use it again</li>
            <li> The item broke right away at the base. Peeled on my lips. Expected to get more of a stain like others I have tried. At least it didn&#x27;t dry out my lips, but won&#x27;t be ordering again. There are better items on the market.</li>
            <li> The color was way too pink and didn&#x27;t match my complexion well. It was fun but not for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Used this lipstick years ago and is as great as I remember!  Was delivered very very fast. My lips turn out a great HOT PINK!</li>
            <li> Its a beautiful pink/red color, but IT WONT COME OFF!! Its not a lipstick.. Its more like a lip permanent marker!! Still waiting for all of it to come off!</li>
            <li> I like it and the color and it is comparable to Sarah Aloe Lips. Which I have been using&lt;br /&gt;for several years.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy mood changing lipsticks.  Wish they would make one in a &amp;#34;coral&amp;#34; color too.  Please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> This product felt good going on and didn&#x27;t leave your lips sticky, but turned my lips a bright shade of unattractive hot pink. Most PH reactive lip colors turn my lips a nice light pink shade. I had several of my friends try it and they had the same results as I did. this just isn&#x27;t a good option unless you are looking for a very bold reaction. It&#x27;s worth it to spend the extra money and buy Dior &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; if you want a lipstick, or if you are looking for a sticky lip gloss L.A. Colors &amp;#34;Mood&amp;#34; is is a good inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> It is not the perfect pink for me.  It is a magenta color.  I gave it to my daughter to use.</li>
            <li> This is so fun! But it pretty much has the same color pink nearly every time. They vary, but it&#x27;s pretty bright fuchsia every time. Don&#x27;t expect everything from light pink to dark red. But I do love it. It works really well with my skin tone. I think that is the most important factor.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick and it does stay on for a long time.  Now wish I could find another color.</li>
            <li> Love it! exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> everyone loves it and it gets pinkier if you layer it on top of itself a few times. very happy and its moisturizing</li>
            <li> The products itself is great. My lips were smooth and it stayed on for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;My lips were also neon pink. I though it was going to be a natural pink, but I was very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does not scrub off either.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It goes on a very sheer pink, but within a minute or two it blooms into a bright, rich pinkish color. Looks great on my fair skin - very bright and fun, but not overwhelming and definitely still office appropriate. It&#x27;s also moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have any funky smell or taste. I will keep this in my purse for a pop of color during the day.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and this lipsticks stays on for a long time without drying out your lips. Love the fuchsia color.</li>
            <li> Used to stay on longer and change to a darker pink color but this color suits me and even though it does not stay on for as long I still like it.</li>
            <li> Nope. Doesn&#x27;t stay on well, color change too light, and dries out lips. Would like to find a better product in the &#x27;mood lipsticks&#x27;. They just don&#x27;t make any of them like the original ones...</li>
            <li> The color will last all day if you are not eating, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li> Looked the same on everyone</li>
            <li> The color it turns to doesn&#x27;t really match my tan Filipino skin :( but it&#x27;s actually not based on mood. It&#x27;s rather based on your skin&#x27;s pH level. It&#x27;s really cool though!</li>
            <li> Color is too bright for me but might be good for others.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! It&#x27;s a 24 hour wear and for the price its really not that bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  stay on like they said  it would.  But I  love it</li>
            <li> I like these color changing lipsticks. This has a nice color and the price is cheap but it has a funny smell and taste.</li>
            <li> I love this..many long wear products are very drying on the lips but this was moisturizing and very long lasting. You can build up color as much as you want but I happen to love less product as it makes it look like I naturally have soft pink lips A+</li>
            <li> It does go on clear but then turns into a super bright pink. It is very hard to get off and pretty much stains your lips whatever color it comes out as. I have learned to only dab a tiny amount on my lips so I don&#x27;t get a super bright pink color. The color when its not as bright is what I like better. So its okay.</li>
            <li> It lasts but the color is a a very hot neon pink - everytime</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this product really works.  And it works well. I bought it for my wife and she loves it. The pigment really matches her skin tone.</li>
            <li> not really thrilled about this lipstick. I understand it&#x27;s a mood lipstick but it doesn&#x27;t turn a very good similar to lipstick color. I do not use this product any longer.</li>
            <li> Pretty much made everyones lips the same pinkey red. At lest it was a cute color on everyone.</li>
            <li> Everyone turned out HOT PINK!  Cute novelty item.</li>
            <li> Loved the pink color it gave!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My cousin has it and lent it to me once and it does go from clear to pink. No sign of green. The only problem is that it is not very pigmented. But still great product!!!!</li>
            <li> the first time i put it on, i did multiple layers and it looked like i ate a cherry popsicle. the next time i did one layer and it looked nice! it goes on smoothly and it has no scent. i would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the product!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it before, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores. I was thrilled to find it on line!</li>
            <li> Although I was not crazy about the shade of pink this turned out to be (it was darker than I had hoped it would be), t&#x27;s still a cool product and it does work as it states.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this lipstick. It is not really a &amp;#34;mood lipstick&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s green and is extremely bright pink when I put it on. It is VERY vivid pink. It does not change color. I would recommend this to someone who likes lip stains. It lasts fairly well and is hard to get off. I guess for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> The idea is very nice. The first week of use it worked perfectly. You would use it, nothing would show up on the lips. As time passes, the color would start showing. The more you put, the darker the color. I would go through the entire day and the color wouldn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a week after use, it stopped working as advertised. The intensity of the color wouldn&#x27;t change based on how much you put, the color started appearing instantly and it wouldn&#x27;t last more than hour!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li> But service is abysmal - took a week to ship, almost a week to get to my city - and still waiting. Tracking only became available 2 days ago. Intended placing larger orders if product was ok - but I guarantee that is not going to happen</li>
            <li> Love that the color is unique for each person.&lt;br /&gt;Typically it is BRIGHT and it lasts. Like overnight. A friend tried a little on her hand and it didn&#x27;t completely disappear for several days. So be sure you want something bright when you put it on.</li>
            <li> The color was very bright pink for me at first but after a while it calmed down. Not a bad product but not a crazy good one either</li>
