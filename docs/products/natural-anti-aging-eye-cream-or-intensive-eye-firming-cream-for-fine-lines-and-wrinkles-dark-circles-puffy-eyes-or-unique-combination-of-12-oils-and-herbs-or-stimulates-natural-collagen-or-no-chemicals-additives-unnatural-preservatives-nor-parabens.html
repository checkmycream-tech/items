            <li>&quot; kind of people (except the glycolic!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the eye cream twice a day for a week now, so I could give it a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and feels great, and absorbs well</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li>I really love this eye cream!</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream!</li>
            <li>This product is ok!</li>
            <li>I saw a noticeable difference when I started using this cream, I love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is just amazing.</li>
            <li>and I was  offered a promotional discount  in exchange for testing and leaving my honest and unbiased opinion of this product</li>
            <li>It is creamier than most eye creams that I have used before but that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I am very optimistic and expect to see great result!</li>
            <li>It is nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>I really did see great results!</li>
            <li>I have always taken care of my fair skin and because I have always sunburned easily</li>
            <li>(this cream is the most effective one I&#x27;ve ever used, including high-priced cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>I was hoping those would fade, as the product page claims, but maybe that will just take a bit more time.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>But they are considerably better.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product</li>
            <li>One of the things I worry most about using eye cream is that the cream will be too greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a week now and can already see my skin getting softer and looking more refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I SPECIALLY LOVE THE AROMA.</li>
            <li>I want to comment, however, on the outstanding service, and devoted attention this merchant has exhibited.  </li>
            <li>My wife love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any drugstore eye cream is better than this.  </li>
            <li>More than a month to see noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would give them a more youthful look.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for more results.</li>
            <li>Also I read some reviews where people thought the jar wasn&#x27;t the most sanitary</li>
            <li>and perhaps some more work is need on the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the Mary Kay eye firming cream.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to buy eye cream at Walgreen or CVS better than spend money for this.</li>
            <li>so I restarted and the results are fabulous!</li>
            <li>With all sorts of fragrant flowers and spices out there like lavender you would think the creators could come up with a better smell.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone of any age who would want to get a great eye look.</li>
            <li>The first time I use, it smell like herb and seems good.</li>
            <li>the fine lines around my eyes began to deepen and become more prominent.</li>
            <li>and I am excited to see how it works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, light and odorless cream that absorbs quickly, which I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that there is no harsh odor to the cream as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, refreshing fragrance that seems soothing at night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about my skin becoming irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the light feeling of this product.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is silky and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs into my skin well.  </li>
            <li>Product easy to use and soothing around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have taken good care of my skin over the years with using sunscreen, good skincare, etc., but I have noticed more fine lines not specifically wrinkles ,  around my eyes and  dark circles plus hollowness underneath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, and sort of smells like the frankincense and myrrh that my aunt and uncle sent me for Christmas when I was a girl.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>This product helps with fine lines.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and is completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>What a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>The lines have filled in a bit and the puffiness has subsided some.</li>
            <li>gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I appreciate the fact that it is free of parabens,dyes,fragrance,chemicals,</li>
            <li>My spouse also confirmed my observation.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, so fresh</li>
            <li>and more than made right.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my hands first just to make sure I was not going to have any allergy issues.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and it has a natural smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The jar is small and fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet as well as my travel bag.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Also this is a company with excellent customer support - I had a slight problem with first order and they contacted me immediately</li>
            <li>The right hand was noticeably improved!</li>
            <li>So Much :)</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and fresh</li>
            <li>I apply it after using a %5 glycolic serum and I look forward to the time of day when I apply the cool and soothing cream to my face.</li>
            <li>and I would like to see a full face moisturizing cream in a larger more economical size because it absorbs well and feel nice on.</li>
            <li>I love it, it really worked.</li>
            <li>There is no chemical smell or discomfort that I have experienced with other eye creams.  </li>
            <li>It also would be better and more beneficial if the cream was in a glass container, rather than plastic, and the inner seal can use an update as well, for the price point.</li>
            <li>puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for a great facial product.</li>
            <li>I received my product quickly just about 4 days ago.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs and dries quickly</li>
            <li>It feels good going on and is a nice thick cream.</li>
            <li>Deborah was more than kind enough to send me a new one, free of charge so that I can give this product a chance.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and it goes on well, absorbing easily.  </li>
            <li>I love that this eye cream is natural and not a bunch of ingredients that can&#x27;t be pronounced!</li>
            <li>I really like it and would recommend it!!</li>
            <li>This is the first product to make a difference!</li>
            <li>I love this Natural Anti Anti Aging wrinkle Intensive skin care cream for eyes by</li>
            <li>I also love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s all natural and non greasy.</li>
            <li>: I received this at a deep discount to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It is so fresh.</li>
            <li>I also love that it contains all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a rich but not heavy, smooth cream.  </li>
            <li>That was a bonus right there.</li>
            <li>the right has the cream.</li>
            <li>so I like to see results right away.</li>
            <li>That said, I will most likely pay the $50 for another tiny container of this amazing cream when I am out of the one I have now.</li>
            <li>This product is nice that it is all natural, but as far as wrinkles, I did not see a difference.</li>
            <li>I am constantly looking for natural products as its amazing how many so called natural products contain carcinogens,</li>
            <li>It works well to moisturize the area around my eyes, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed my skin looks better in the 12X magnifying mirror I use to pluck my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of them just left my eye area feeling greasy or just didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy one more once I finish this.</li>
            <li>I am patiently awaiting the replacement product and after reading all the other fabulous reviews, I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying it for myself with a newly-opened mind :)  </li>
            <li>As an avid skin care junkie and after trying numerous other brands (both natural and high-end), this is the best natural brand and right up there with the cutting-edge eye creams with contents</li>
            <li>like how gentle it is and I very much like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I bought this eye cream after reading positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping to see better than minor results.</li>
            <li>Well rested or not my eyes always have some kind of dark circles underneath.</li>
            <li>First off, I couldn&#x27;t even open the box without tearing the cheaply made packaging.  </li>
            <li>Not only was I delighted with this reply, but I was pretty surprised at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It also seems very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love products that are all natural as opposed to products that are heavily perfumed and filled with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It spreads well, absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that it does not take much at all to rub in around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I feel it is very overpriced for the quantity</li>
            <li>and I have not noticed any of the unusual benefits as claimed for the product..</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t worry too much about that</li>
            <li>Bags under my eyes run in my family and I have been serching for the eye cream that will give me a much need it boost; I think I found it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It moisturizes quite well).&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful cream that really blends the age from your skin</li>
            <li>Feeling very ripped off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is light, feels cool and has reduced the puffiness around my eyes by half.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a great eye cream over the past few months; however, nothing ever seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Most other eye creams are oily, this one is not.  </li>
            <li>a little expensive but sometimes good products cost good money</li>
            <li>So far I like this, though it&#x27;s my first time buying an eye cream</li>
            <li>I wanted a cream more than anything that would help with my dark circles but also</li>
            <li>I ordered it and my eyes look so much better, not as puffy and my dark circles seem to be diminishing.  </li>
            <li>My skin type is normal/combination, but as I age I am noticing dryness mainly around my eye area.</li>
            <li>If it happens at some point in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update this review.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>but that might take a little more time.</li>
            <li>Thanks  courtesy of Naturally Mediterranean .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of this product being all natural</li>
            <li>At first it seemed kind of thin</li>
            <li>having read all the ingredients i know that this is all natural and not tested on animals, the fact that it leaves your skin softer and with less wrinkles, even better.</li>
            <li>It feels nice when applied and in the past month it has made a difference!</li>
            <li>I will include left and right hand pictures for you to see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a cheap lotion than an expensive eye cream.  </li>
            <li>And the high quality organic ingredients are all I want for around my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>This product is agreeable with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it is actually in plastic, that&#x27;s my first problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially considering the ingredients aren&#x27;t even certified organic, all natural is NOT the same thing as organic though since this product is from spain I assume it is free of gmo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The jar, however, is quite small, I do wish you got a bit more for the money.  </li>
            <li>From what I have seen so far, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try out a new eye cream.</li>
            <li>This helps me achieve a smoother look when putting on my makeup and diminishes the little fine lines</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed significant improvement in reducing dark circles yet</li>
            <li>Naturally Mediterranean</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Then I saw Natural Anti-Aging Anti-Wrinkle Intensive Skin Care Eye Firming Cream by Naturally Mediterranean</li>
            <li>This stuff is all natural and there are no ingredients that make my skin crawl.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is all natural is an A+ in my book.</li>
            <li>This cream being natural</li>
            <li>leaves her skin soft and she likes that it is fragrance</li>
            <li>The product encourages natural collagen production which is why I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I like that it has no harsh chemical or additives and no parabens.</li>
            <li>It does make skin soft.</li>
            <li>I like this Natural Anti Aging eye cream.</li>
            <li>It contains all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you are into natural products, this is the eye cream you want to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning my skincare products to all natural lines.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the first non-book review I&#x27;ve ever left, and I know the headline sounds generic, but I have about six minutes before the kid gets up</li>
            <li>I was looking for facial products online, particularly for my eyes.</li>
            <li>:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have looked at a few creams but they are so full of junk and GMOs and petrochemicals</li>
            <li>The most important thing in any facial cream for me is that it be light weight and not heavy and terribly</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes.</li>
            <li>I may have used a little bit more than I should each time I applied (it was hard to control how much I got on my fingers when getting the cream out of the jar)</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so the little tub you get will last a good while.</li>
            <li>I have used it only a couple of times, so far  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen immediate results after applying it, but I will continue to use it and provide an update later.</li>
            <li>Actually the jar caught my eye, it appealed to me, looked natural.</li>
            <li>The skin there is less wrinkled than my eye area but even after the first use I could see a major difference.  </li>
            <li>and I agree something like a pump or something other than a jar would be much nicer.</li>
            <li>After just a few days now my eyes are more firm</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because of all the great reviews, but I have to say that I have never been so disappointed.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot really see any dark circles.  </li>
            <li>For those who mentioned the cost, it is nominal compared to most other eye creams out there, without any the negative effects.  </li>
            <li>When I stumbled upon this product I decided it was worth a try because the price wasn&#x27;t unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for the past three days and already feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t liked eye creams in the past because they are so thick and don&#x27;t absorb well.  </li>
            <li>but I soon realized that it&#x27;s light consistency works much then the thick eye creams I&#x27;d tried in the past.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> More than a month to see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would give them a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for more results.</li>
            <li> Also I read some reviews where people thought the jar wasn&#x27;t the most sanitary</li>
            <li> and perhaps some more work is need on the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the Mary Kay eye firming cream.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to buy eye cream at Walgreen or CVS better than spend money for this.</li>
            <li> so I restarted and the results are fabulous!</li>
            <li> With all sorts of fragrant flowers and spices out there like lavender you would think the creators could come up with a better smell.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone of any age who would want to get a great eye look.</li>
            <li> The first time I use, it smell like herb and seems good.</li>
            <li> the fine lines around my eyes began to deepen and become more prominent.</li>
            <li> and I am excited to see how it works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, light and odorless cream that absorbs quickly, which I love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that there is no harsh odor to the cream as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, refreshing fragrance that seems soothing at night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about my skin becoming irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the light feeling of this product.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is silky and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and absorbs into my skin well.  </li>
            <li> Product easy to use and soothing around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have taken good care of my skin over the years with using sunscreen, good skincare, etc., but I have noticed more fine lines not specifically wrinkles ,  around my eyes and  dark circles plus hollowness underneath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, and sort of smells like the frankincense and myrrh that my aunt and uncle sent me for Christmas when I was a girl.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> This product helps with fine lines.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and is completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> What a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> The lines have filled in a bit and the puffiness has subsided some.</li>
            <li> gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I appreciate the fact that it is free of parabens,dyes,fragrance,chemicals,</li>
            <li> My spouse also confirmed my observation.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, so fresh</li>
            <li> and more than made right.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my hands first just to make sure I was not going to have any allergy issues.</li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and it has a natural smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The jar is small and fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet as well as my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Also this is a company with excellent customer support - I had a slight problem with first order and they contacted me immediately</li>
            <li> The right hand was noticeably improved!</li>
            <li> So Much :)</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> I apply it after using a %5 glycolic serum and I look forward to the time of day when I apply the cool and soothing cream to my face.</li>
            <li> and I would like to see a full face moisturizing cream in a larger more economical size because it absorbs well and feel nice on.</li>
            <li> I love it, it really worked.</li>
            <li> There is no chemical smell or discomfort that I have experienced with other eye creams.  </li>
            <li> It also would be better and more beneficial if the cream was in a glass container, rather than plastic, and the inner seal can use an update as well, for the price point.</li>
            <li> puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for a great facial product.</li>
            <li> I received my product quickly just about 4 days ago.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs and dries quickly</li>
            <li> It feels good going on and is a nice thick cream.</li>
            <li> Deborah was more than kind enough to send me a new one, free of charge so that I can give this product a chance.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and it goes on well, absorbing easily.  </li>
            <li> I love that this eye cream is natural and not a bunch of ingredients that can&#x27;t be pronounced!</li>
            <li> I really like it and would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This is the first product to make a difference!</li>
            <li> I love this Natural Anti Anti Aging wrinkle Intensive skin care cream for eyes by</li>
            <li> I also love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s all natural and non greasy.</li>
            <li> : I received this at a deep discount to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It is so fresh.</li>
            <li> I also love that it contains all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a rich but not heavy, smooth cream.  </li>
            <li> That was a bonus right there.</li>
            <li> the right has the cream.</li>
            <li> so I like to see results right away.</li>
            <li> That said, I will most likely pay the $50 for another tiny container of this amazing cream when I am out of the one I have now.</li>
            <li> This product is nice that it is all natural, but as far as wrinkles, I did not see a difference.</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for natural products as its amazing how many so called natural products contain carcinogens,</li>
            <li> It works well to moisturize the area around my eyes, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed my skin looks better in the 12X magnifying mirror I use to pluck my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of them just left my eye area feeling greasy or just didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy one more once I finish this.</li>
            <li> I am patiently awaiting the replacement product and after reading all the other fabulous reviews, I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying it for myself with a newly-opened mind :)  </li>
            <li> As an avid skin care junkie and after trying numerous other brands (both natural and high-end), this is the best natural brand and right up there with the cutting-edge eye creams with contents</li>
            <li> like how gentle it is and I very much like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream after reading positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping to see better than minor results.</li>
            <li> Well rested or not my eyes always have some kind of dark circles underneath.</li>
            <li> First off, I couldn&#x27;t even open the box without tearing the cheaply made packaging.  </li>
            <li> Not only was I delighted with this reply, but I was pretty surprised at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It also seems very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I love products that are all natural as opposed to products that are heavily perfumed and filled with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It spreads well, absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that it does not take much at all to rub in around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I feel it is very overpriced for the quantity</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any of the unusual benefits as claimed for the product..</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t worry too much about that</li>
            <li> Bags under my eyes run in my family and I have been serching for the eye cream that will give me a much need it boost; I think I found it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It moisturizes quite well).&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful cream that really blends the age from your skin</li>
            <li> Feeling very ripped off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is light, feels cool and has reduced the puffiness around my eyes by half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great eye cream over the past few months; however, nothing ever seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Most other eye creams are oily, this one is not.  </li>
            <li> a little expensive but sometimes good products cost good money</li>
            <li> So far I like this, though it&#x27;s my first time buying an eye cream</li>
            <li> I wanted a cream more than anything that would help with my dark circles but also</li>
            <li> I ordered it and my eyes look so much better, not as puffy and my dark circles seem to be diminishing.  </li>
            <li> My skin type is normal/combination, but as I age I am noticing dryness mainly around my eye area.</li>
            <li> If it happens at some point in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update this review.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> but that might take a little more time.</li>
            <li> Thanks  courtesy of Naturally Mediterranean .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this product being all natural</li>
            <li> At first it seemed kind of thin</li>
            <li> having read all the ingredients i know that this is all natural and not tested on animals, the fact that it leaves your skin softer and with less wrinkles, even better.</li>
            <li> It feels nice when applied and in the past month it has made a difference!</li>
            <li> I will include left and right hand pictures for you to see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a cheap lotion than an expensive eye cream.  </li>
            <li> And the high quality organic ingredients are all I want for around my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> This product is agreeable with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it is actually in plastic, that&#x27;s my first problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially considering the ingredients aren&#x27;t even certified organic, all natural is NOT the same thing as organic though since this product is from spain I assume it is free of gmo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The jar, however, is quite small, I do wish you got a bit more for the money.  </li>
            <li> From what I have seen so far, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try out a new eye cream.</li>
            <li> This helps me achieve a smoother look when putting on my makeup and diminishes the little fine lines</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed significant improvement in reducing dark circles yet</li>
            <li> Naturally Mediterranean</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Then I saw Natural Anti-Aging Anti-Wrinkle Intensive Skin Care Eye Firming Cream by Naturally Mediterranean</li>
            <li> This stuff is all natural and there are no ingredients that make my skin crawl.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is all natural is an A+ in my book.</li>
            <li> This cream being natural</li>
            <li> leaves her skin soft and she likes that it is fragrance</li>
            <li> The product encourages natural collagen production which is why I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no harsh chemical or additives and no parabens.</li>
            <li> It does make skin soft.</li>
            <li> I like this Natural Anti Aging eye cream.</li>
            <li> It contains all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you are into natural products, this is the eye cream you want to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning my skincare products to all natural lines.  </li>
            <li> I think this is the first non-book review I&#x27;ve ever left, and I know the headline sounds generic, but I have about six minutes before the kid gets up</li>
            <li> I was looking for facial products online, particularly for my eyes.</li>
            <li> :  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have looked at a few creams but they are so full of junk and GMOs and petrochemicals</li>
            <li> The most important thing in any facial cream for me is that it be light weight and not heavy and terribly</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes.</li>
            <li> I may have used a little bit more than I should each time I applied (it was hard to control how much I got on my fingers when getting the cream out of the jar)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the little tub you get will last a good while.</li>
            <li> I have used it only a couple of times, so far  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen immediate results after applying it, but I will continue to use it and provide an update later.</li>
            <li> Actually the jar caught my eye, it appealed to me, looked natural.</li>
            <li> The skin there is less wrinkled than my eye area but even after the first use I could see a major difference.  </li>
            <li> and I agree something like a pump or something other than a jar would be much nicer.</li>
            <li> After just a few days now my eyes are more firm</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of all the great reviews, but I have to say that I have never been so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot really see any dark circles.  </li>
            <li> For those who mentioned the cost, it is nominal compared to most other eye creams out there, without any the negative effects.  </li>
            <li> When I stumbled upon this product I decided it was worth a try because the price wasn&#x27;t unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for the past three days and already feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t liked eye creams in the past because they are so thick and don&#x27;t absorb well.  </li>
            <li> but I soon realized that it&#x27;s light consistency works much then the thick eye creams I&#x27;d tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered appeared to be used as it had dried cream on the outer part of the container and the contents were just about empty.</li>
            <li> It make wrinkles less visible however, the process takes much longer than expected.</li>
            <li> already.&lt;br /&gt;Being an insomniac I have developed dark circles and puffy eyes and lot of wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it will get rid of wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> did stop using it after the first try because of the price, but saw a negative difference</li>
            <li> and it feels like it is making a difference in the little lines I have been starting to notice as I get closer to 54 years old.</li>
            <li> I did not want to apply harsh chemicals on the sensitive area around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I feel like I would want to use it long term if I can afford it.  </li>
            <li> and I have found it hard to find a wrinkle cream that actually works that is natural ingredient focused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a daily eye cream user because of my dark circles</li>
            <li> but since you should use such a small amount I thought it would last a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried many brands of eye creams including some very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the size and type of container.</li>
            <li> Has a faint smell but that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is such a minuscule amount for what you pay.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days since I&#x27;ve started using this eye cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll jump back in in a few weeks to update.</li>
            <li> Been using it only a few weeks</li>
            <li> I bought the Naturally Mediterranean eye cream because I&#x27;ve had a problem with dark circles under my eyes lately.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this product it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I like to be careful with what I put around my eyes!</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> As one other reviewer noted, when it arrived, there was some product residue that escaped the jar.  </li>
            <li> my dark circles have reduced a bit and puffiness in my eyes due to lack of sleep seems to be a bit gone now.</li>
            <li> I had no negative reaction but what I did see was dramatic.</li>
            <li> only negative I would note is the fact that I still have dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> But I wanted to say, I&#x27;ve been plagued by dark circles and wrinkles under the eyes since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> It also helps with dark spots and eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell, feels a bit grainy and really did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> Save your money not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The jar is fairly small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My black eyes disappear after using a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> have used this cream for 2 days now and already see less darkening under my eyes and MUCH less</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see a change but after using half a jar I do not see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have used other eye creams, some quite expensive, but so far this is the one for me.  </li>
            <li> It also had crusty dried up eyecream around the perimeter when I opened it</li>
            <li> No Chemicals, No Additives, No Unnatural Preservatives, No Parabens, No Free Radicals.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product in a very small jar that will not last long</li>
            <li> I never really started noticing wrinkles or chicken skin until the last few years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with very low expectations because it wasn&#x27;t outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of moderate skin and was skeptical before ordering.</li>
            <li> I knew it came in a small jar</li>
            <li> not sure whose fault it is</li>
            <li> Well, at least I haven&#x27;t found anything that is.  </li>
            <li> review was NOT about the product itself because I honestly never had a chance to try it.</li>
            <li> However, that is not even a complaint for me.  </li>
            <li> I had originally written abut this product because I was VERY disappointed with the condition in which it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> PLASTIC IS NO GOOD</li>
            <li> I would still be ahead of the game.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really not happy about that.</li>
            <li> sad</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Not happy!</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but it don&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> * Not impressed.</li>
            <li> so I was no about to take a chance with these crazy chemical cesspools.</li>
            <li> Already wary because of the packaging and size of jar (which is not noted on description btw), I was also thoroughly disappointed when I tried the &#x27;cream&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I am 54 and my eyes are not to bad yet.</li>
            <li> And the smell is terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this Natural Anti Anti Aging wrinkle Intensive skin care cream for eyes by Naturally Mediterranean I have already noticed a big difference. I have taken good care of my skin over the years with using sunscreen, good skincare, etc., but I have noticed more fine lines not specifically wrinkles ,  around my eyes and  dark circles plus hollowness underneath. My skin type is normal/combination, but as I age I am noticing dryness mainly around my eye area. This helps me achieve a smoother look when putting on my makeup and diminishes the little fine lines but if you have wrinkles it helps with that too .. It also seems very hydrating. I have used it only a couple of times, so far  so I look forward to seeing it long-term results. Thanks  courtesy of Naturally Mediterranean .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Hi, this is Terry&#x27;s wife.  I bought the Naturally Mediterranean eye cream because I&#x27;ve had a problem with dark circles under my eyes lately.  I love products that are all natural as opposed to products that are heavily perfumed and filled with chemicals.  I&#x27;ve been using the eye cream twice a day for a week now, so I could give it a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how gentle it is and I very much like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s not too strong, and sort of smells like the frankincense and myrrh that my aunt and uncle sent me for Christmas when I was a girl.  It works well to moisturize the area around my eyes, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed my skin looks better in the 12X magnifying mirror I use to pluck my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I would note is the fact that I still have dark circles under my eyes.  I was hoping those would fade, as the product page claims, but maybe that will just take a bit more time.  If it happens at some point in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update this review.</li>
            <li> I love that this eye cream is natural and not a bunch of ingredients that can&#x27;t be pronounced! I&#x27;ve been using it a short time and I am excited to see how it works!</li>
            <li> I have never used a wrinkle cream before. I have always taken care of my fair skin and because I have always sunburned easily I have always sed sunblock or covered up. I never really started noticing wrinkles or chicken skin until the last few years. I have looked at a few creams but they are so full of junk and GMOs and petrochemicals I avoided them. I am not an automobile and I have sensitive skin so I was no about to take a chance with these crazy chemical cesspools. Then I saw Natural Anti-Aging Anti-Wrinkle Intensive Skin Care Eye Firming Cream by Naturally Mediterranean and I was  offered a promotional discount  in exchange for testing and leaving my honest and unbiased opinion of this product so I knew I had to try it! This stuff is all natural and there are no ingredients that make my skin crawl. That was a bonus right there. I thought even if it did not do anything but moisturize I would still be ahead of the game. I tried it on my hands first just to make sure I was not going to have any allergy issues. I had no negative reaction but what I did see was dramatic. The skin there is less wrinkled than my eye area but even after the first use I could see a major difference.  I will include left and right hand pictures for you to see. The left had was untreated and the right has the cream. Both were equal looking before the cream application. The right hand was noticeably improved! Just one application! I was so excited. After just a few days now my eyes are more firm and I cannot really see any dark circles.  What a huge improvement. Goodbye crows feet!! This stuff is just amazing. I cannot wait to try all the products in their line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days since I&#x27;ve started using this eye cream so I haven&#x27;t seen entirely big results yet. The first one I ordered appeared to be used as it had dried cream on the outer part of the container and the contents were just about empty. Deborah was more than kind enough to send me a new one, free of charge so that I can give this product a chance. Thank you again Deborah!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, light and odorless cream that absorbs quickly, which I love. I also love the natural ingredients. I&#x27;m a daily eye cream user because of my dark circles so I like to see results right away. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen immediate results after applying it, but I will continue to use it and provide an update later. It also would be better and more beneficial if the cream was in a glass container, rather than plastic, and the inner seal can use an update as well, for the price point.</li>
            <li> I have used the eye cream for 3 days&amp;nights now. It spreads well, absorbs fast. Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet, but will check back in in a couple of weeks to update my review.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye cream! At first it seemed kind of thin but I soon realized that it&#x27;s light consistency works much then the thick eye creams I&#x27;d tried in the past. It goes on very smooth and is completely absorbed. And the high quality organic ingredients are all I want for around my sensitive eye area. Also this is a company with excellent customer support - I had a slight problem with first order and they contacted me immediately and more than made right. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. It&#x27;s very refreshing and it has a natural smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m putting chemicals on my skin, rather a good&lt;br /&gt;natural product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t seen&lt;br /&gt;the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; around my eyes as it claims.  But it does minimize the wrinkles, even just for the day.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order.  I really love this product.  My black eyes disappear after using a couple weeks. I will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> The most important thing in any facial cream for me is that it be light weight and not heavy and terribly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this cream for 2 days now and already see less darkening under my eyes and MUCH less puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for a great facial product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great eye cream over the past few months; however, nothing ever seemed to fit the bill. When I stumbled upon this product I decided it was worth a try because the price wasn&#x27;t unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for the past three days and already feel a difference. I put it on at night, after I take a shower, and there is an instant cooling sensation. The cream itself is silky and spreads easily. I&#x27;m finding that it does not take much at all to rub in around my eyes. It&#x27;s great that there is no harsh odor to the cream as well. It&#x27;s a light, refreshing fragrance that seems soothing at night. The fact that it is all natural is an A+ in my book. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my skin becoming irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t wait to see the results that I achieve after continuing to use this cream. From what I have seen so far, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try out a new eye cream.</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for natural products as its amazing how many so called natural products contain carcinogens, having read all the ingredients i know that this is all natural and not tested on animals, the fact that it leaves your skin softer and with less wrinkles, even better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with very low expectations because it wasn&#x27;t outrageously expensive. I have to say, I&#x27;m extremely impressed. As I entered my mid 30s the fine lines around my eyes began to deepen and become more prominent. I tried many brands of eye creams including some very expensive ones. Most of them just left my eye area feeling greasy or just didn&#x27;t work at all. For the price of this product it works extremely well. The lines have filled in a bit and the puffiness has subsided some. And I love that it&#x27;s all natural and non greasy. Smells like nature, not a lab. A little goes a long way so the little tub you get will last a good while.</li>
            <li> After I read what they were advertising, I decided to order this product and try it out......I really like it and would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t liked eye creams in the past because they are so thick and don&#x27;t absorb well.  This product doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  It goes on easily and is absorbed very quickly.  I like that it is made in Spain.</li>
            <li> I think this is the first non-book review I&#x27;ve ever left, and I know the headline sounds generic, but I have about six minutes before the kid gets up and I have to get to work. But I wanted to say, I&#x27;ve been plagued by dark circles and wrinkles under the eyes since I was a kid. This is the first product to make a difference! No, they are not gone entirely. But they are considerably better. I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on these eye products. Never would&#x27;ve thought a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; one would be the remedy. Who knew? HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! It is light, feels cool and has reduced the puffiness around my eyes by half.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe  any product is a miracle in a bottle.  Well, at least I haven&#x27;t found anything that is.  This is an ok product but I was hoping to see better than minor results.</li>
            <li> So far I like this, though it&#x27;s my first time buying an eye cream so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it too.  The scent is mild and it goes on well, absorbing easily.  I&#x27;ll jump back in in a few weeks to update.</li>
            <li> One of the things I worry most about using eye cream is that the cream will be too greasy.  This is not the case with this product.  It is creamier than most eye creams that I have used before but that is a good thing.  It goes on easily and absorbs into my skin well.  There is no chemical smell or discomfort that I have experienced with other eye creams.  The jar is small and fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet as well as my travel bag. I have been using this product for about a week now and can already see my skin getting softer and looking more refreshed.  I received this product from the seller at a promotional discount.</li>
            <li> This cream never stings as some eye creams may do if used too close to the eye.  I feel it is very overpriced for the quantity and I have not noticed any of the unusual benefits as claimed for the product..</li>
            <li> In the photo this eye cream appears to be in glass but it is actually in plastic, that&#x27;s my first problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second problem is the price,after looking over the ingredients I don&#x27;t see anything that warrants the $40 price tag..especially considering the ingredients aren&#x27;t even certified organic, all natural is NOT the same thing as organic though since this product is from spain I assume it is free of gmo&#x27;s so I won&#x27;t worry too much about that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I appreciate the fact that it is free of parabens,dyes,fragrance,chemicals, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except of course the potential chemicals leached into an otherwise untainted product because this eyecream is in plastic instead of being in GLASS like it should be. It also had crusty dried up eyecream around the perimeter when I opened it &amp;i&#x27;m wondering about heat exposure in that plastic container. PLASTIC IS NO GOOD i&#x27;m really not happy about that.</li>
            <li> Initially I ordered it so that I can try it. I have a bit of moderate skin and was skeptical before ordering. Ordered to check if it works for me. It worked wonders on me. I have been using this from atleast 4 days and I can see the change already.&lt;br /&gt;Being an insomniac I have developed dark circles and puffy eyes and lot of wrinkles around the eyes. I did not want to apply harsh chemicals on the sensitive area around the eyes. This cream being natural my dark circles have reduced a bit and puffiness in my eyes due to lack of sleep seems to be a bit gone now. I couldn&#x27;t believe how it worked on my wrinkles. I would highly recommend this product for anyone of any age who would want to get a great eye look. Will definitely buy one more once I finish this. Disclaimer: I received this at a deep discount to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Bags under my eyes run in my family and I have been serching for the eye cream that will give me a much need it boost; I think I found it. I SPECIALLY LOVE THE AROMA.</li>
            <li> I had originally written abut this product because I was VERY disappointed with the condition in which it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;My review was NOT about the product itself because I honestly never had a chance to try it. I want to comment, however, on the outstanding service, and devoted attention this merchant has exhibited.  Within a brief period of placing my comment I received a response with an apology and a request for giving their product another chance...which I&#x27;m doing.  Not only was I delighted with this reply, but I was pretty surprised at the same time.  When was the last time someone actually took the time to respond to one lowly customer who had a less-than-stellar experience?  I am patiently awaiting the replacement product and after reading all the other fabulous reviews, I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying it for myself with a newly-opened mind :)  Thanks So Much :)</li>
            <li> I received my product quickly just about 4 days ago.  I have been using it at night and in the morning before I put my makeup on and it feels like it is making a difference in the little lines I have been starting to notice as I get closer to 54 years old. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is such a minuscule amount for what you pay.  I feel like I would want to use it long term if I can afford it.  I am very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and smoothly.  Product easy to use and soothing around the eyes.  Too early to tell if it will get rid of wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> My wife love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves her skin soft and she likes that it is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;She sad (this cream is the most effective one I&#x27;ve ever used, including high-priced cosmetic products. This product is agreeable with my very sensitive skin. It moisturizes quite well).&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful cream that really blends the age from your skin the wrinkles are lessened and you are happy.&lt;br /&gt;Really like this cream.</li>
            <li> I had to return this item because it was not concealed, and looked like it had been used, and open.&lt;br /&gt;  Not happy!</li>
            <li> I have seen no progress or difference with my daily use.  My spouse also confirmed my observation.  The only thing I find satisfactory is the smell.  This product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> this earthy scented cream smooths on and absorbs into your skin.  Skin feels smooth and fresh looking.&lt;br /&gt;I used up the tiny jar and have to reorder.</li>
            <li> This anti aging cream is great for firming the skin around the eyes. It promises to help fill in those fill lines and wrinkles. It also helps with dark spots and eye puffiness. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are mine. The product encourages natural collagen production which is why I wanted to give it a try. I like that it has no harsh chemical or additives and no parabens. I like to be careful with what I put around my eyes! The jar is fairly small but a little goes a long way. I have only used the product a short time so I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes. However, It has caused no irritation to my eyes or skins at all. It feels good going on and is a nice thick cream. I am very optimistic and expect to see great result!</li>
            <li> Customer service was great. This product is nice that it is all natural, but as far as wrinkles, I did not see a difference. It does make skin soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of all the great reviews, but I have to say that I have never been so disappointed.  It&#x27;s more like a cheap lotion than an expensive eye cream.  First off, I couldn&#x27;t even open the box without tearing the cheaply made packaging.  Already wary because of the packaging and size of jar (which is not noted on description btw), I was also thoroughly disappointed when I tried the &#x27;cream&#x27;.  It has a weird smell, feels a bit grainy and really did nothing for me.  Any drugstore eye cream is better than this.  And to think I paid $49 for this?!  Feeling very ripped off.</li>
            <li> I like this Natural Anti Aging eye cream. It contains all natural ingredients. I can feel a tightening of skin around my eyes as soon as I put it on. Absorbs and dries quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to absorb and go on with my morning routine. No Chemicals, No Additives, No Unnatural Preservatives, No Parabens, No Free Radicals. Has a faint smell but that dissipates quickly. Have great customer service too.</li>
            <li> This product is ok! It is nothing spectacular. It make wrinkles less visible however, the process takes much longer than expected. More than a month to see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Started using as soon as I received.  I can definitely see a difference.  Would order again and recommend!  Thank You</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like about this product except the price. That said, I will most likely pay the $50 for another tiny container of this amazing cream when I am out of the one I have now. I do as the instructions suggest and keep in the fridge. I apply it after using a %5 glycolic serum and I look forward to the time of day when I apply the cool and soothing cream to my face. I am one of those \\&quot;if you can&#x27;t eat it, then don&#x27;t put it on your skin\\&quot; kind of people (except the glycolic!) and I have found it hard to find a wrinkle cream that actually works that is natural ingredient focused. Its a good product and if you can afford it, I say buy it!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see a change but after using half a jar I do not see a difference. I am 54 and my eyes are not to bad yet. I thought this product would give them a more youthful look. This is an expensive product in a very small jar that will not last long so I was looking for more results. I really like the idea of this product being all natural and I would like to see a full face moisturizing cream in a larger more economical size because it absorbs well and feel nice on.</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference when I started using this cream, I love it! Well rested or not my eyes always have some kind of dark circles underneath. And I&#x27;m 24! So I searched for the creams with the best results and this one came up. I love it, it really worked. I wanted a cream more than anything that would help with my dark circles but also something that I could use as an every day preventative. I know it&#x27;s a little expensive but sometimes good products cost good money so I&#x27;m fine with that. The only down side is the size and type of container. I knew it came in a small jar but since you should use such a small amount I thought it would last a long time. I may have used a little bit more than I should each time I applied (it was hard to control how much I got on my fingers when getting the cream out of the jar) but I was hoping it would have lasted longer (mine lasted me about 2 months, maybe with a different type of container / application form it would have lasted longer?). Also I read some reviews where people thought the jar wasn&#x27;t the most sanitary and I agree something like a pump or something other than a jar would be much nicer. But I will keep using this cream! I really did see great results!</li>
            <li> Have been using this eye firming cream for about 1 week and already see and feel the difference. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the light feeling of this product. It is so fresh. If you are into natural products, this is the eye cream you want to use. You only need to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> Most other eye creams are oily, this one is not.  It feels nice when applied and in the past month it has made a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning my skincare products to all natural lines.  As an avid skin care junkie and after trying numerous other brands (both natural and high-end), this is the best natural brand and right up there with the cutting-edge eye creams with contents I can no longer tolerate.  I can feel a tightening around my eyes after applying it and will look forward to seeing any skin improvements after using it for a month.  As one other reviewer noted, when it arrived, there was some product residue that escaped the jar.  Although that reviewer attributed it to being a used package, my opinion is the consistency of the product caused it to seep a bit and perhaps some more work is need on the packaging.  However, that is not even a complaint for me.  I am extremely happy with this eye cream and will continue to purchase it.  For those who mentioned the cost, it is nominal compared to most other eye creams out there, without any the negative effects.  The way I look at it, we can&#x27;t replace our skin, so how do you put a price tag on it?  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for about a week.I love the smell, so fresh and it&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly. I also love that it contains all natural ingredients. Haven&#x27;t noticed significant improvement in reducing dark circles yet but that might take a little more time.</li>
            <li> This product helps with fine lines. You can feel it firming your skin. I like it better than the Mary Kay eye firming cream.</li>
            <li> This is a rich but not heavy, smooth cream.  I love the way it feels on my skin.  I have used other eye creams, some quite expensive, but so far this is the one for me.  Been using it only a few weeks but I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman. I have wrinkle and puffy eyes. I ordered this item because people rate. The first time I use, it smell like herb and seems good. I use it every day. Day by day, month by month is nothing proved. This product is expensive but it don&#x27;t work on me. I prefer to buy eye cream at Walgreen or CVS better than spend money for this.</li>
            <li> I was looking for facial products online, particularly for my eyes. Actually the jar caught my eye, it appealed to me, looked natural. I ordered it and my eyes look so much better, not as puffy and my dark circles seem to be diminishing.  The jar, however, is quite small, I do wish you got a bit more for the money.  It smells nice, and feels great, and absorbs well, you have to use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;I did stop using it after the first try because of the price, but saw a negative difference so I restarted and the results are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream after reading positive reviews. I have tried to like it, but I just don&#x27;t. Everything about the cream doesn&#x27;t meet my needs and expectations. And the smell is terrible!</li>
            <li> *** Not impressed. Off puting smell, stings your eyes, don&#x27;t see a difference with wrinkles around my eyes and the cream&#x27;s texture is offputting. Save your money not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not sure whose fault it is but the packaging was not done correctly for heat proofing. I can see the cream melted inside the container. With all sorts of fragrant flowers and spices out there like lavender you would think the creators could come up with a better smell. I am not being picky the smell is horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading.</li>
