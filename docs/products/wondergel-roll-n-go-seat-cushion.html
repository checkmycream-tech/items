            <li>My assets felt great.</li>
            <li>My dad has improved greatly since sitting on the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go.  </li>
            <li>Also, the Wonergel Roll &amp; Go has not lost any of it&#x27;s ability to provide comfort and support, and the ability to move it around or even take it with me on trips adds greatly to it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Fits my needs perfectly, quite a comfortable cushion!</li>
            <li>but after the wife made one it is good to use as I drive.</li>
            <li>It is good quality</li>
            <li>works good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s quite good.  </li>
            <li>good product for the money.  </li>
            <li>If you are a student and want something that can fit into your backpack, this is your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a student and want something that can fit into your backpack, this is your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the gel pad also fit perfectly in my Honda Civic and Honda Element.</li>
            <li>its good to have.</li>
            <li>If you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion is the next best cushion and the best cushion for the price.</li>
            <li>Great product... very comfortable.</li>
            <li>My butt was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the comfort.</li>
            <li>Good product, but collects lint very easy.</li>
            <li>I got two of these before I decided to go on vacation, and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic coushion!!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>We are hoping she will enjoy it!!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have warmers on your car seats, then your body heat has to warm it......</li>
            <li>Would have liked a custom cover included,  did not come with one.</li>
            <li>Cleans nicely.</li>
            <li>the best price &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li>She said she liked it.  </li>
            <li>However what I did not like is that when i try to get out of the car it would kind of stick to my pants and then become off.</li>
            <li>Nice gel cushion.  </li>
            <li>This pad provides some nice cushioning while I&#x27;m recovering from a tailbone injury.  </li>
            <li>It looks very cool!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the Drive Gel Seat Cushion provided a good level of support, I did not find it comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable and softly good choice</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be noted that the ConforMax cushions cost $20 to $25 more than the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion, so if you are on a budget or do not want to spend as much money on the Comformax cushions, this is the next best cushion and the best cushion under $40 that</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is a great improvement over the first cushion I tried (the Obus Wonderform), and I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li>Perfect I actually used this in my shower seat to be able to sit there for a longer period of time since I can&#x27;t stand on my own two feet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, a real butt-saver!</li>
            <li>Drove 2,000 miles and was  very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I GOT THIS TO PUT ON TOP OF MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S WHEELCHAIR TRAY FOR TOUCH</li>
            <li>Makes my butt feel so much better....</li>
            <li>and I have never been more comfortable!  </li>
            <li>Please, please, make them available again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I have ever tried, so I ordered a 2nd pad for the passenger side in my Van.</li>
            <li>Wondergel cushion mostly solves this problem.</li>
            <li>Pressure is more evenly distributed along my buttocks and legs, and the seat pan issue disappears.</li>
            <li>So if you can&#x27;t take it inside with you and have to leave it in the car you might not be able to sit on it until it cools off a little--the instructions say that when it&#x27;s overheated sitting on it can ruin the gel.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would make one that was the shape of a bucket seat because that might stay put a bit better.</li>
            <li>I also have a 2\\&quot; one where I watch TV, so obviously, I really think they are great.</li>
            <li>For the money I had hoped for a better product.</li>
            <li>I need to be able to scoot or slide on the surface.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed it on  Vacation.</li>
            <li>Nicely supportive.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my cushion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It did, but then that reduced the comfort and just got more bulky.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also a great conversation piece because everyone wants to hold it and fold it and squeeze it.</li>
            <li>buy it because you think it&#x27;s going to be cushy and soft</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am going on an auto trip and will use so will have a better idea of its benefits.</li>
            <li>I called Amazon to see if they would have a problem with me purchasing a bunch of items and then returning them as well as to make sure that my Amazon prime account would not get</li>
            <li>The top side of the cushion is a foamy type of cloth, and the bottom side of the cushion has a rubber-ish type of cover to keep it from sliding around on the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason for that it is, the ConforMax cushions were more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You are better off with the either of the Comformax cushions ($30 more) and if you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion ($11 more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was barely able to squeeze it into the laptop section of my backpack.</li>
            <li>I was barely able to squeeze it into the laptop section of my backpack.</li>
            <li>satisfied with price and quality.</li>
            <li>I knew my bottom needed more cushion if this was going to work out.</li>
            <li>This is a roll and go&lt;br /&gt;gel seat cushion which I love and it hits all the pressure points when sitting for any length of time.  </li>
            <li>It would have been better if this was</li>
            <li>Thought cushion would provide more support.  </li>
            <li>Works ok after 12 hours in a car your still going to be hurting</li>
            <li>Thought it&#x27;d be thicker, does cushion but must have a towel on top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Its ok but not the solution</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed the fit/feel.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I loved the cushion from the first day, and I&#x27;ve just ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the most comfortable cushion of all of the questions that I tried and the one I would recommend the most.</li>
            <li>, this one was the most comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this one was the most comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for a more comfortable ride.</li>
            <li>, I found this cushion the easiest to carry around because it folded easily</li>
            <li>and I could easily get it into my duffle bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I found this cushion the easiest to carry around because it folded easily</li>
            <li>and I could easily get it into my duffle bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not expect cushion to slide off chair so easily.  </li>
            <li>I did cut it to fit the seat dimensions which made it a bit more secure.</li>
            <li>I have used the WonderGel Seat Cushion for 3weeks now and its still strong as ever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pads and cushions, so I was looking for something special and innovative.</li>
            <li>Specifically, each time you get out of the car it moves and kind of bunches up becasue the gel material grips you pretty well.</li>
            <li>It makes the seat more cool as well.</li>
            <li>- I put it in a light weight shopping bag to carry easily and keep the dirt off of it.  </li>
            <li>It seems sturdy and may be fine for some folks</li>
            <li>The cushion is fine for my office chair</li>
            <li>I have used it; it feels fine</li>
            <li>and this one does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>My bottom was fine after our 9 hour flight.</li>
            <li>Recently I a bought a new car; it&#x27;s great on gas mileage, not so good on my bottom.  </li>
            <li>Using the Wondergel was a HUGE improvement</li>
            <li>Now, with the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go being used on this chair, it makes a huge improvement in comfort.</li>
            <li>My sister works for a company that doesn&#x27;t believe in making an employee comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be everything advertised, but I just couldn&#x27;t get comfortable on it.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm, allowing me to sit comfortably for longer periods.</li>
            <li>Fortunately this didn&#x27;t happen to me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not designed to be custom fit to the seat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable for her, and isn&#x27;t bulky.  </li>
            <li>Makes warn seats comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This product is GREAT, I would recommend it totally.</li>
            <li>It is really comfortable for the Tailbone.</li>
            <li>It works as promised and is comfortable pad</li>
            <li>Can be cut to fit if you wish.</li>
            <li>If you buy this cushion, don&#x27;t expect to sit on it because it won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Good size, not too thick and great to sit on.</li>
            <li>it works in the car, but I find it is very useful in the office.</li>
            <li>AND SO VERY WORTH</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the time that I used it, the cushion did not go flat, and provided a great deal of support.</li>
            <li>Other wondergel products are incredible.</li>
            <li>I recommend the ORIGINAL Wondergel cushion instead because it comes with a cover that has a handle.</li>
            <li>I have five or six of THE ORIGINAL WONDER GEL cushions</li>
            <li>cushion significantly reduces the amount of pain you would experience if you did not have this cushion</li>
            <li>This was despite a higher level on inconvenience of lugging around the CONFORMAX &amp;#34;On the Go&amp;#34; in a duffle bag versus of greater level of convenience of carrying around the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go in my backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Comfortable and cool in summer.  </li>
            <li>This cushion provided significant relief for my butt when sitting for lengthy periods.  </li>
            <li>You cannot clean it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I guess, but it really isn&#x27;t that comfortable and it&#x27;s somewhat bouncy.</li>
            <li>I used it on vacation and it made the trip far more injoyable!</li>
            <li>If you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion is the next best cushion and the best cushion for the price.posterior did get a little sore after sitting for a couple of hours and moderately sore after sitting for 14 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it is still too large for me to get inside my backpack, I am able to get it inside my duffel bag/gym bag and take it with me without any difficulty to the computer lab or library.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t find this comfortable or useful</li>
            <li>The gel must cool, taking up to 30 minutes</li>
            <li>I used it on a car trip from KS to MN and loved the support it gave my back.</li>
            <li>cushion also provided good level of support and kept my posterior and back from getting sore.</li>
            <li>This pad is an okay cushion, but it costs too much.</li>
            <li>not a bad cushion, but still hurts after awhile on the road.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job of relieving some of the pressure on my back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not good for long time but 4 stars for comforting me 7 hrs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was really happy with the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion and would highly recommend it Especially for folks on the heavier side since it did not flatten out when I used it.</li>
            <li>Wondergel cushions work as advertised and the other reviews are accurate, but I found the Comformax cushions to do the best job of keeping my back and posterior pain-free.</li>
            <li>Wondergel cushions work as advertised and the other reviews are accurate, but I found the Comformax cushions to do the best job of keeping my back and posterior pain-free.</li>
            <li>A HANDY DANDY ITEM TO ACTUALLY SIT ON!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>was the second most comfortable cushion.</li>
            <li>the ConforMax cushions, this was the next most comfortable cushion.</li>
            <li>I will get my monies worth</li>
            <li>worth the price considering</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see how it will ever be right for me.</li>
            <li>It makes long trips in my truck much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I use it when driving around and makes the seat way more comfortable for those long rides home from work.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t leave it in the car full time here in Texas.</li>
            <li>I would consider buying one for the car but the manufacturer label said if it was left in the hot car, don&#x27;t  use it until it is at normal room temperature (about 30 min) or risk damaging it for good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this seat cushion, I can sit at my desk for long hours and it makes long car rides much more pleasant, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it out on my international flight in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a while my new cars seat is not as comfortable as I need it to be  </li>
            <li>The Wondergel seat cushion is very comfortable and helped keep my legs working during some recent all-day driving.  </li>
            <li>I need these because my boney toosh hurts very much when I sit for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>This gel cushion was very comforable!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely swears that it has saved her backside!</li>
            <li>This product would be great if it was twice as thick.</li>
            <li>For skinny bums, this feels pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondergel</li>
            <li>The cushion can&#x27;t be used if it becomes hot from the sun hitting the car.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say I was completely ache free</li>
            <li>but it was so much better than my last car trip.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would have been better, is that it could have been sent</li>
            <li>It comes with a warning not to leave it in a vehicle on hot days because it will deform which is a problem because I got it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution to my uncomfortable car seat.  </li>
            <li>helped for the first 7 hrs</li>
            <li>It makes sitting for long distances great as well as short trips.  </li>
            <li>By posterior or back did not get sore and I was able to study for 14 hours a day,</li>
            <li>I was able to hold this cushion, put it in my duffle bag and take it with me to the library, but it should be noted I only used it for two days before I returned it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to sit and study for 14 hours per day, only having to get up to eat or use the restroom.</li>
            <li>and I just love what this pad does for my back, legs and tailbone.</li>
            <li>Also, they said not to leave it in  a hot car during the day.</li>
            <li>so it does not get hot.</li>
            <li>Pretty squishy.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This cushion really cushions!</li>
            <li>Looks like it holds up pretty well too.</li>
            <li>Now I can go through a whole day (with normal ups and downs) and feel comfortable at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I would like it ten times better, though, if they added a couple of inches on each side.  </li>
            <li>I found the two Comformax cushions and the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion more comfortable and the the Comformax cushions were a little bit</li>
            <li>I found the two Comformax cushions and the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion more comfortable and the the Comformax cushions were a little bit</li>
            <li>These cushions (we now have two) are very comfortable for long term sitting without fatigue.</li>
            <li>Good for somepne with back problems especially when seated for prolonged periods like traveling.</li>
            <li>If headroom is not an issue,The ORIGINAL WONDERGEL cushion will give a little more relief because of the thickness.</li>
            <li>While delivery was quick and easy, the product itself did not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t tried anything near as comfortable to keep my butt from going to sleep and the pressure point problems you normally get.</li>
            <li>At 6&#x27;1 and 225 lbs, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overly large(??).  </li>
            <li>It is pure comfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One side note – out of all of the large cushions</li>
            <li>/&gt;One side note – out of all of the large cushions</li>
            <li>I bought the &#x27;large&#x27; size and if your bottom is the size of a baby&#x27;s, it might accomodate you.</li>
            <li>For sure, it&#x27;s a much different experience then a typical cushion, but I love it</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really add much cushion.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Perfectly comfortable the entire time.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Really helps the toosh.  </li>
            <li>This seat cushion really works and cushions airplane seats and seats at home.</li>
            <li>It really did.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it in the car yet, but it&#x27;s giving as much cushion as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>In a 40 hour flight in our 177 to California and back made a worn seat comfortable.  </li>
            <li>He says irs very comfortbale.</li>
            <li>It did not cushion as much as I need and my buttock still hurt after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>We had taken a trip, about 6 hours, stopped every 1 1/2 to 2 hours and got out and walked, when we got there and on the return trip, I was very stoved up, with a lot of pain.</li>
            <li>After spending two weeks with this thing under my butt and really trying to see how this provides any comfort at all, I&#x27;m giving it the heave-ho out of the car.  </li>
            <li>but so far I say worth it.  </li>
            <li>These gel cushions really help ALOT.</li>
            <li>It works very well, just as I thought i would.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re trying to get it straight under your bottom..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the only cushion I could fit into my backpack and did not have to put it in my duffle bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the only cushion I could fit into my backpack and did not have to put it in my duffle bag.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell much difference sitting on this versus just sitting on the sofa.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference for me</li>
            <li>but they are twice as much</li>
            <li>This cushion works very well for me.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I am using a pillow case and it looks really unprofessional at work.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>When I wrote to the company, they referred me to a medical supply house (unrelated to them) for a \\&quot;cushion that would fit.\\&quot; If you are looking for driving comfort or sitting on something comfortable; don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>my bucket seat, not over the whole seat</li>
            <li>, I will try the thicker but more expensive kind</li>
            <li>I have tried every other seat cushion I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>the WonderGel Extreme more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the WonderGel Extreme more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably OK for other uses, but not for auto.</li>
            <li>I sit far too long (thanks to the many OT hours I put in at work)</li>
            <li>We have used this for over one year now and it is still in its original shape and same level of support.</li>
            <li>I am 6 feet tall and about 210 pounds and even at the end of the day, it is just as soft as when you first sit on the cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wondergel Roll was cheaper than several other gel seat cushions, but the reviews were good, so I took a chance and ordered it (overnight delivery; it was nearly time for me to leave).  </li>
            <li>but I was able to slightly fold it and get it into my duffle bag</li>
            <li>I am able to sit for an entire day without my rear end or back getting sore.</li>
            <li>The price was decent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too high</li>
            <li>The Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion has a layer of gel encased in a layer of high density</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it...may get another.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a little more comfort on their bum.</li>
            <li>The seats aren&#x27;t very comfortable, especially during a long drive.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that it is a large cushion that is also kind of heavy, so it is not a cushion that can be carried around or is transportable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>I sit nearly all day and this really reduces the stiffness at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>WONDER HOW GREAT THE EXPENSIVE VERSION IS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These Wondergel cushions are top of the line&lt;br /&gt;and should last a very long time...</li>
            <li>I think that it adapts easily to your body when you move, and stays intact (doesn&#x27;t break down) over time.  </li>
            <li>For reference purposes, the other five star reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried other cushions but didn&#x27;t find any of them comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Wondergel Doublegel Gel Seat Cushion NEW Model - 2&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wondergel Doublegel Gel Seat Cushion NEW Model - 2&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And of course, sitting side way or on my leg create new issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought it to make an uncomfortable car seat more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It fits my car seat and in when I place it in the seat cool to your touch, the only down side is you have to remove from car in case the weather is too hot, sometimes I forget it when ready to travel.</li>
            <li>Despite my small bottom, it takes a certain amount of struggle to get seated on it in precisely the right way, and males who don&#x27;t get it just right may find, as I do, that  their scrotum is ever so slightly</li>
            <li>Is pretty bulky for local driving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very similar to the WonderGel Extreme seat cushion but with more gel cushioning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very similar to the WonderGel Extreme seat cushion but with more gel cushioning.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ll be driving in hot climes, it&#x27;s enough for me to take care of myself and not have to care for the cushion.  </li>
            <li>When I received the cushion, a surprise note came with it, declaring that the cushion could not be left in a hot car.</li>
            <li>However the little chambers are much more comfortable then those old spacey wired seats we used to buy years ago to keep your back and butt dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of other things, this is a large cushion and covers the entire seat which allows you to move around your seats comfortably.</li>
            <li>It would also fit inside a large briefcase or a small suitcase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A male friend of mine also sat on it after a long bicycle ride and he made the &amp;#34;aaaahhhhhhhhh&amp;#34; sound.  </li>
            <li>Drive Medical Deluxe Skin Protection Gel &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; 3&amp;#34; Wheelchair Seat Cushion, Dark Blue, 18&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It has a layer of high density foam and a very thick gel which provides a great deal of support without going flat, even if you are a big guy.</li>
            <li>I really like it for long periods of sitting, particularly driving.</li>
            <li>previously mentioned, whilethe cushion significantly reduces the pain and soreness on your posterior, my posterior was still sore at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>previously mentioned, whilethe cushion significantly reduces the pain and soreness on your posterior, my posterior was still sore at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I have tried foam seat cushions, pillows, etc, but this gel cushion is super affordable (compared to the other options) and does the trick.</li>
            <li>advice to Wondergel is please clearly state that the cover&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>It also does what those old pads used to do</li>
            <li>If you have back pain you know how much you wish for relief.</li>
            <li>Sew an old pillowcase over it for a cover, and it works well.</li>
            <li>my back really hurts.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really soft to the touch</li>
            <li>I obtained considerable pain relief while using.</li>
            <li>Although this product was a fairly soft rubbery (silicon type feel) substance it was not gel.</li>
            <li>We got this for my 91 year old father in law who was experiencing heel pain when he was in bed.</li>
            <li>It is soft to seat on and felling the pressure has been reduced.</li>
            <li>Since I live in hot climate, and drive is only 20 minutes, I decided against buying a second one.</li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be big enough based on some of the reviews here, but it turned out to be just right.</li>
            <li>and I got tired of purchasing new chairs, so I decided to purchase cushions as a more cost-effective approach to purchasing new chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which had those wired like slinky rolls in them that allow your butt to stay dry on hot days, remember sweating on vinyl seats?</li>
            <li>We think it will work, but we need to find a slick pillow case to go over it so his heels slide easily.</li>
            <li>Besides the above, if it gets too hot from the sun there are warnings that it will essentially melt and lose its shape.</li>
            <li>With that said, while I was able to study for 14 hours per day and my back did not get sore, but my posterior did get a little sore after sitting for a couple of hours and moderately sore after sitting for 14 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s real relief for sore butts while driving long hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;cushion is not thick enough.  </li>
            <li>Kinda works, maybe this one is not thick enough for me?&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fit inside the small inset seat area</li>
            <li>Recently started a new job which places me on the road for 6hrs a day.</li>
            <li>According to the literature supplied with the product, if the cushion reaches a mere 105 degrees F. (a hot car can easily exceed 120 degrees F), it will deform permanently when you sit on it.</li>
            <li>SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE IS TACTILE SENSITIVE.</li>
            <li>I put a thin cushion on top for added softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our seats can at times be pretty worn down.  </li>
            <li>the large number of 5 star reviews from other reviewers, I found this item to be junk and would not recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li>the large number of 5 star reviews from other reviewers, I found this item to be junk and would not recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to test it in my car seat - too bad because of the super heated temperatures in Atlanta&#x27;s summer and the warning not to leave it in the car.</li>
            <li>I previously had to take two Aleve before using this cushion to be able to sit down and study for an entire day.</li>
            <li>because it is smaller due to it being portable, it does not cover the chair completely, so you can not move around as much on a chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, this isn&#x27;t what I expected and certainly did not help with the discomfort in my vehicle.  </li>
            <li>I have to tell you that this cushion looks odd but it really does work.</li>
            <li>Because of the \\&quot;cell-like\\&quot; construction,&lt;br /&gt;the cushion pretty much just flattens out to a thin layer of the gel&lt;br /&gt;material</li>
            <li>I just drove 1600 miles last week and that would normally give me an extremely sore a@@.</li>

            <li> My assets felt great.</li>
            <li> My dad has improved greatly since sitting on the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go.  </li>
            <li> Also, the Wonergel Roll &amp; Go has not lost any of it&#x27;s ability to provide comfort and support, and the ability to move it around or even take it with me on trips adds greatly to it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Fits my needs perfectly, quite a comfortable cushion!</li>
            <li> but after the wife made one it is good to use as I drive.</li>

            <li> good product for the money.  </li>
            <li> If you are a student and want something that can fit into your backpack, this is your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are a student and want something that can fit into your backpack, this is your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the gel pad also fit perfectly in my Honda Civic and Honda Element.</li>
            <li> its good to have.</li>
            <li> If you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion is the next best cushion and the best cushion for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product... very comfortable.</li>
            <li> My butt was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the comfort.</li>
            <li> Good product, but collects lint very easy.</li>
            <li> I got two of these before I decided to go on vacation, and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic coushion!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> We are hoping she will enjoy it!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have warmers on your car seats, then your body heat has to warm it......</li>
            <li> Would have liked a custom cover included,  did not come with one.</li>
            <li> Cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> the best price &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> She said she liked it.  </li>
            <li> However what I did not like is that when i try to get out of the car it would kind of stick to my pants and then become off.</li>
            <li> Nice gel cushion.  </li>
            <li> This pad provides some nice cushioning while I&#x27;m recovering from a tailbone injury.  </li>
            <li> It looks very cool!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the Drive Gel Seat Cushion provided a good level of support, I did not find it comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable and softly good choice</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be noted that the ConforMax cushions cost $20 to $25 more than the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion, so if you are on a budget or do not want to spend as much money on the Comformax cushions, this is the next best cushion and the best cushion under $40 that</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this is a great improvement over the first cushion I tried (the Obus Wonderform), and I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li> Perfect I actually used this in my shower seat to be able to sit there for a longer period of time since I can&#x27;t stand on my own two feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, a real butt-saver!</li>
            <li> Drove 2,000 miles and was  very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS TO PUT ON TOP OF MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S WHEELCHAIR TRAY FOR TOUCH</li>
            <li> Makes my butt feel so much better....</li>
            <li> and I have never been more comfortable!  </li>
            <li> Please, please, make them available again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have ever tried, so I ordered a 2nd pad for the passenger side in my Van.</li>
            <li> Wondergel cushion mostly solves this problem.</li>
            <li> Pressure is more evenly distributed along my buttocks and legs, and the seat pan issue disappears.</li>
            <li> So if you can&#x27;t take it inside with you and have to leave it in the car you might not be able to sit on it until it cools off a little--the instructions say that when it&#x27;s overheated sitting on it can ruin the gel.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would make one that was the shape of a bucket seat because that might stay put a bit better.</li>
            <li> I also have a 2\\&quot; one where I watch TV, so obviously, I really think they are great.</li>
            <li> For the money I had hoped for a better product.</li>
            <li> I need to be able to scoot or slide on the surface.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it on  Vacation.</li>
            <li> Nicely supportive.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my cushion.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It did, but then that reduced the comfort and just got more bulky.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great conversation piece because everyone wants to hold it and fold it and squeeze it.</li>
            <li> buy it because you think it&#x27;s going to be cushy and soft</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am going on an auto trip and will use so will have a better idea of its benefits.</li>
            <li> I called Amazon to see if they would have a problem with me purchasing a bunch of items and then returning them as well as to make sure that my Amazon prime account would not get</li>
            <li> The top side of the cushion is a foamy type of cloth, and the bottom side of the cushion has a rubber-ish type of cover to keep it from sliding around on the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason for that it is, the ConforMax cushions were more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are better off with the either of the Comformax cushions ($30 more) and if you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion ($11 more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was barely able to squeeze it into the laptop section of my backpack.</li>
            <li> I was barely able to squeeze it into the laptop section of my backpack.</li>
            <li> satisfied with price and quality.</li>
            <li> I knew my bottom needed more cushion if this was going to work out.</li>
            <li> This is a roll and go&lt;br /&gt;gel seat cushion which I love and it hits all the pressure points when sitting for any length of time.  </li>
            <li> It would have been better if this was</li>
            <li> Thought cushion would provide more support.  </li>
            <li> Works ok after 12 hours in a car your still going to be hurting</li>
            <li> Thought it&#x27;d be thicker, does cushion but must have a towel on top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Its ok but not the solution</li>
            <li> and I really enjoyed the fit/feel.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I loved the cushion from the first day, and I&#x27;ve just ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the most comfortable cushion of all of the questions that I tried and the one I would recommend the most.</li>
            <li> , this one was the most comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this one was the most comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for a more comfortable ride.</li>
            <li> , I found this cushion the easiest to carry around because it folded easily</li>
            <li> and I could easily get it into my duffle bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I found this cushion the easiest to carry around because it folded easily</li>
            <li> and I could easily get it into my duffle bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not expect cushion to slide off chair so easily.  </li>
            <li> I did cut it to fit the seat dimensions which made it a bit more secure.</li>
            <li> I have used the WonderGel Seat Cushion for 3weeks now and its still strong as ever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pads and cushions, so I was looking for something special and innovative.</li>
            <li> Specifically, each time you get out of the car it moves and kind of bunches up becasue the gel material grips you pretty well.</li>
            <li> It makes the seat more cool as well.</li>
            <li> - I put it in a light weight shopping bag to carry easily and keep the dirt off of it.  </li>
            <li> It seems sturdy and may be fine for some folks</li>
            <li> The cushion is fine for my office chair</li>
            <li> I have used it; it feels fine</li>
            <li> and this one does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> My bottom was fine after our 9 hour flight.</li>
            <li> Recently I a bought a new car; it&#x27;s great on gas mileage, not so good on my bottom.  </li>
            <li> Using the Wondergel was a HUGE improvement</li>
            <li> Now, with the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go being used on this chair, it makes a huge improvement in comfort.</li>
            <li> My sister works for a company that doesn&#x27;t believe in making an employee comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be everything advertised, but I just couldn&#x27;t get comfortable on it.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm, allowing me to sit comfortably for longer periods.</li>
            <li> Fortunately this didn&#x27;t happen to me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not designed to be custom fit to the seat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable for her, and isn&#x27;t bulky.  </li>
            <li> Makes warn seats comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This product is GREAT, I would recommend it totally.</li>
            <li> It is really comfortable for the Tailbone.</li>
            <li> It works as promised and is comfortable pad</li>
            <li> Can be cut to fit if you wish.</li>
            <li> If you buy this cushion, don&#x27;t expect to sit on it because it won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Good size, not too thick and great to sit on.</li>
            <li> it works in the car, but I find it is very useful in the office.</li>
            <li> AND SO VERY WORTH</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the time that I used it, the cushion did not go flat, and provided a great deal of support.</li>
            <li> Other wondergel products are incredible.</li>
            <li> I recommend the ORIGINAL Wondergel cushion instead because it comes with a cover that has a handle.</li>
            <li> I have five or six of THE ORIGINAL WONDER GEL cushions</li>
            <li> cushion significantly reduces the amount of pain you would experience if you did not have this cushion</li>
            <li> This was despite a higher level on inconvenience of lugging around the CONFORMAX &amp;#34;On the Go&amp;#34; in a duffle bag versus of greater level of convenience of carrying around the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go in my backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Comfortable and cool in summer.  </li>
            <li> This cushion provided significant relief for my butt when sitting for lengthy periods.  </li>
            <li> You cannot clean it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I guess, but it really isn&#x27;t that comfortable and it&#x27;s somewhat bouncy.</li>
            <li> I used it on vacation and it made the trip far more injoyable!</li>
            <li> If you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion is the next best cushion and the best cushion for the price.posterior did get a little sore after sitting for a couple of hours and moderately sore after sitting for 14 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it is still too large for me to get inside my backpack, I am able to get it inside my duffel bag/gym bag and take it with me without any difficulty to the computer lab or library.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t find this comfortable or useful</li>
            <li> The gel must cool, taking up to 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I used it on a car trip from KS to MN and loved the support it gave my back.</li>
            <li> cushion also provided good level of support and kept my posterior and back from getting sore.</li>
            <li> This pad is an okay cushion, but it costs too much.</li>
            <li> not a bad cushion, but still hurts after awhile on the road.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job of relieving some of the pressure on my back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not good for long time but 4 stars for comforting me 7 hrs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was really happy with the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion and would highly recommend it Especially for folks on the heavier side since it did not flatten out when I used it.</li>
            <li> Wondergel cushions work as advertised and the other reviews are accurate, but I found the Comformax cushions to do the best job of keeping my back and posterior pain-free.</li>
            <li> Wondergel cushions work as advertised and the other reviews are accurate, but I found the Comformax cushions to do the best job of keeping my back and posterior pain-free.</li>
            <li> A HANDY DANDY ITEM TO ACTUALLY SIT ON!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> was the second most comfortable cushion.</li>
            <li> the ConforMax cushions, this was the next most comfortable cushion.</li>
            <li> I will get my monies worth</li>
            <li> worth the price considering</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see how it will ever be right for me.</li>
            <li> It makes long trips in my truck much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I use it when driving around and makes the seat way more comfortable for those long rides home from work.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t leave it in the car full time here in Texas.</li>
            <li> I would consider buying one for the car but the manufacturer label said if it was left in the hot car, don&#x27;t  use it until it is at normal room temperature (about 30 min) or risk damaging it for good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this seat cushion, I can sit at my desk for long hours and it makes long car rides much more pleasant, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it out on my international flight in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a while my new cars seat is not as comfortable as I need it to be  </li>
            <li> The Wondergel seat cushion is very comfortable and helped keep my legs working during some recent all-day driving.  </li>
            <li> I need these because my boney toosh hurts very much when I sit for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> This gel cushion was very comforable!</li>
            <li> and she absolutely swears that it has saved her backside!</li>
            <li> This product would be great if it was twice as thick.</li>
            <li> For skinny bums, this feels pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondergel</li>
            <li> The cushion can&#x27;t be used if it becomes hot from the sun hitting the car.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I was completely ache free</li>
            <li> but it was so much better than my last car trip.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would have been better, is that it could have been sent</li>
            <li> It comes with a warning not to leave it in a vehicle on hot days because it will deform which is a problem because I got it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution to my uncomfortable car seat.  </li>
            <li> helped for the first 7 hrs</li>
            <li> It makes sitting for long distances great as well as short trips.  </li>
            <li> By posterior or back did not get sore and I was able to study for 14 hours a day,</li>
            <li> I was able to hold this cushion, put it in my duffle bag and take it with me to the library, but it should be noted I only used it for two days before I returned it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to sit and study for 14 hours per day, only having to get up to eat or use the restroom.</li>
            <li> and I just love what this pad does for my back, legs and tailbone.</li>
            <li> Also, they said not to leave it in  a hot car during the day.</li>
            <li> so it does not get hot.</li>
            <li> Pretty squishy.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> This cushion really cushions!</li>
            <li> Looks like it holds up pretty well too.</li>
            <li> Now I can go through a whole day (with normal ups and downs) and feel comfortable at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I would like it ten times better, though, if they added a couple of inches on each side.  </li>
            <li> I found the two Comformax cushions and the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion more comfortable and the the Comformax cushions were a little bit</li>
            <li> I found the two Comformax cushions and the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion more comfortable and the the Comformax cushions were a little bit</li>
            <li> These cushions (we now have two) are very comfortable for long term sitting without fatigue.</li>
            <li> Good for somepne with back problems especially when seated for prolonged periods like traveling.</li>
            <li> If headroom is not an issue,The ORIGINAL WONDERGEL cushion will give a little more relief because of the thickness.</li>
            <li> While delivery was quick and easy, the product itself did not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t tried anything near as comfortable to keep my butt from going to sleep and the pressure point problems you normally get.</li>
            <li> At 6&#x27;1 and 225 lbs, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overly large(??).  </li>
            <li> It is pure comfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One side note – out of all of the large cushions</li>
            <li> /&gt;One side note – out of all of the large cushions</li>
            <li> I bought the &#x27;large&#x27; size and if your bottom is the size of a baby&#x27;s, it might accomodate you.</li>
            <li> For sure, it&#x27;s a much different experience then a typical cushion, but I love it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really add much cushion.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfectly comfortable the entire time.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Really helps the toosh.  </li>
            <li> This seat cushion really works and cushions airplane seats and seats at home.</li>
            <li> It really did.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it in the car yet, but it&#x27;s giving as much cushion as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> In a 40 hour flight in our 177 to California and back made a worn seat comfortable.  </li>
            <li> He says irs very comfortbale.</li>
            <li> It did not cushion as much as I need and my buttock still hurt after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> We had taken a trip, about 6 hours, stopped every 1 1/2 to 2 hours and got out and walked, when we got there and on the return trip, I was very stoved up, with a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> After spending two weeks with this thing under my butt and really trying to see how this provides any comfort at all, I&#x27;m giving it the heave-ho out of the car.  </li>
            <li> but so far I say worth it.  </li>
            <li> These gel cushions really help ALOT.</li>
            <li> It works very well, just as I thought i would.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re trying to get it straight under your bottom..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the only cushion I could fit into my backpack and did not have to put it in my duffle bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the only cushion I could fit into my backpack and did not have to put it in my duffle bag.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t tell much difference sitting on this versus just sitting on the sofa.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference for me</li>
            <li> but they are twice as much</li>
            <li> This cushion works very well for me.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I am using a pillow case and it looks really unprofessional at work.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I wrote to the company, they referred me to a medical supply house (unrelated to them) for a \\&quot;cushion that would fit.\\&quot; If you are looking for driving comfort or sitting on something comfortable; don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> my bucket seat, not over the whole seat</li>
            <li> , I will try the thicker but more expensive kind</li>
            <li> I have tried every other seat cushion I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> the WonderGel Extreme more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the WonderGel Extreme more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably OK for other uses, but not for auto.</li>
            <li> I sit far too long (thanks to the many OT hours I put in at work)</li>
            <li> We have used this for over one year now and it is still in its original shape and same level of support.</li>
            <li> I am 6 feet tall and about 210 pounds and even at the end of the day, it is just as soft as when you first sit on the cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wondergel Roll was cheaper than several other gel seat cushions, but the reviews were good, so I took a chance and ordered it (overnight delivery; it was nearly time for me to leave).  </li>
            <li> but I was able to slightly fold it and get it into my duffle bag</li>
            <li> I am able to sit for an entire day without my rear end or back getting sore.</li>
            <li> The price was decent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too high</li>
            <li> The Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion has a layer of gel encased in a layer of high density</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it...may get another.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a little more comfort on their bum.</li>
            <li> The seats aren&#x27;t very comfortable, especially during a long drive.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that it is a large cushion that is also kind of heavy, so it is not a cushion that can be carried around or is transportable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> I sit nearly all day and this really reduces the stiffness at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> WONDER HOW GREAT THE EXPENSIVE VERSION IS.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These Wondergel cushions are top of the line&lt;br /&gt;and should last a very long time...</li>
            <li> I think that it adapts easily to your body when you move, and stays intact (doesn&#x27;t break down) over time.  </li>
            <li> For reference purposes, the other five star reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried other cushions but didn&#x27;t find any of them comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Wondergel Doublegel Gel Seat Cushion NEW Model - 2&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wondergel Doublegel Gel Seat Cushion NEW Model - 2&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And of course, sitting side way or on my leg create new issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought it to make an uncomfortable car seat more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It fits my car seat and in when I place it in the seat cool to your touch, the only down side is you have to remove from car in case the weather is too hot, sometimes I forget it when ready to travel.</li>
            <li> Despite my small bottom, it takes a certain amount of struggle to get seated on it in precisely the right way, and males who don&#x27;t get it just right may find, as I do, that  their scrotum is ever so slightly</li>
            <li> Is pretty bulky for local driving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very similar to the WonderGel Extreme seat cushion but with more gel cushioning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very similar to the WonderGel Extreme seat cushion but with more gel cushioning.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ll be driving in hot climes, it&#x27;s enough for me to take care of myself and not have to care for the cushion.  </li>
            <li> When I received the cushion, a surprise note came with it, declaring that the cushion could not be left in a hot car.</li>
            <li> However the little chambers are much more comfortable then those old spacey wired seats we used to buy years ago to keep your back and butt dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of other things, this is a large cushion and covers the entire seat which allows you to move around your seats comfortably.</li>
            <li> It would also fit inside a large briefcase or a small suitcase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A male friend of mine also sat on it after a long bicycle ride and he made the &amp;#34;aaaahhhhhhhhh&amp;#34; sound.  </li>
            <li> Drive Medical Deluxe Skin Protection Gel &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; 3&amp;#34; Wheelchair Seat Cushion, Dark Blue, 18&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It has a layer of high density foam and a very thick gel which provides a great deal of support without going flat, even if you are a big guy.</li>
            <li> I really like it for long periods of sitting, particularly driving.</li>
            <li> previously mentioned, whilethe cushion significantly reduces the pain and soreness on your posterior, my posterior was still sore at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> previously mentioned, whilethe cushion significantly reduces the pain and soreness on your posterior, my posterior was still sore at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried foam seat cushions, pillows, etc, but this gel cushion is super affordable (compared to the other options) and does the trick.</li>
            <li> advice to Wondergel is please clearly state that the cover&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> It also does what those old pads used to do</li>
            <li> If you have back pain you know how much you wish for relief.</li>
            <li> Sew an old pillowcase over it for a cover, and it works well.</li>
            <li> my back really hurts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really soft to the touch</li>
            <li> I obtained considerable pain relief while using.</li>
            <li> Although this product was a fairly soft rubbery (silicon type feel) substance it was not gel.</li>
            <li> We got this for my 91 year old father in law who was experiencing heel pain when he was in bed.</li>
            <li> It is soft to seat on and felling the pressure has been reduced.</li>
            <li> Since I live in hot climate, and drive is only 20 minutes, I decided against buying a second one.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be big enough based on some of the reviews here, but it turned out to be just right.</li>
            <li> and I got tired of purchasing new chairs, so I decided to purchase cushions as a more cost-effective approach to purchasing new chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which had those wired like slinky rolls in them that allow your butt to stay dry on hot days, remember sweating on vinyl seats?</li>
            <li> We think it will work, but we need to find a slick pillow case to go over it so his heels slide easily.</li>
            <li> Besides the above, if it gets too hot from the sun there are warnings that it will essentially melt and lose its shape.</li>
            <li> With that said, while I was able to study for 14 hours per day and my back did not get sore, but my posterior did get a little sore after sitting for a couple of hours and moderately sore after sitting for 14 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s real relief for sore butts while driving long hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;cushion is not thick enough.  </li>
            <li> Kinda works, maybe this one is not thick enough for me?&lt;br</li>
            <li> This fit inside the small inset seat area</li>
            <li> Recently started a new job which places me on the road for 6hrs a day.</li>
            <li> According to the literature supplied with the product, if the cushion reaches a mere 105 degrees F. (a hot car can easily exceed 120 degrees F), it will deform permanently when you sit on it.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE IS TACTILE SENSITIVE.</li>
            <li> I put a thin cushion on top for added softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our seats can at times be pretty worn down.  </li>
            <li> the large number of 5 star reviews from other reviewers, I found this item to be junk and would not recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li> the large number of 5 star reviews from other reviewers, I found this item to be junk and would not recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to test it in my car seat - too bad because of the super heated temperatures in Atlanta&#x27;s summer and the warning not to leave it in the car.</li>
            <li> I previously had to take two Aleve before using this cushion to be able to sit down and study for an entire day.</li>
            <li> because it is smaller due to it being portable, it does not cover the chair completely, so you can not move around as much on a chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, this isn&#x27;t what I expected and certainly did not help with the discomfort in my vehicle.  </li>
            <li> I have to tell you that this cushion looks odd but it really does work.</li>
            <li> Because of the \\&quot;cell-like\\&quot; construction,&lt;br /&gt;the cushion pretty much just flattens out to a thin layer of the gel&lt;br /&gt;material</li>
            <li> I just drove 1600 miles last week and that would normally give me an extremely sore a@@.</li>
            <li> It helps a little on our long distance auto trips, but not so much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It is square and therefore does not fit the seat well and causes my leg to be raised too high with no support under it.</li>
            <li> my whole life and 15 hour drives would usually result in a infection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the Wondergel seat in hopes it would help with several long days in the car.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get back pain from sitting long periods and this has stopped that from happening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have gone flat.</li>
            <li> These cushions work and will not go flat.</li>
            <li> After sitting on this cushion for 30 minutes, the cushion went flat.</li>
            <li> After sitting on this cushion for 30 minutes, the cushion went flat.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who has lower back issues or has to commute long distances.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a pad to sit on a flat elevated rock where I hunt sometimes to 20 degrees without getting hard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cushion isn&#x27;t quite wide enough to cover my chair and shifts enough to cause discomfort and require constant readjustment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So instead of going to the library to study, I purchased new chairs, but after a few months the cushions and the chairs had gone flat.</li>
            <li> Not knowing which cushions to purchase and not wanting to spend time trying out a bunch of different cushions I decided to try out a dozen or so different cushions, all of which had an average rating above four.</li>
            <li> The ConforMax “On The Go” cushion provides the same amount of support as the “ConforMax Anywhere” cushion but is portable due to its smaller size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews to replace an old egg crate type cushion that had lost its cushioning due to age.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has to sit for a long period of time...whether it is in an airplane, car, or even office desk.</li>
            <li> It Adds comfort for long drives.  </li>
            <li> This makes studying for long periods of time</li>
            <li> only getting up to eat or use the restroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cushion really is not portable do to it</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone sitting or taking long drives.</li>
            <li> Long trips are excrutiating until I found this gel seat cushion on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> He is long distance driver who has a problem with kidney stones.  </li>
            <li> but it has not yet been tested on a long trip.</li>
            <li> the product descriptions do not clearly state if a cover is included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other pads all seem to about the same, and just get compressed after a while, but Wondergel has these chambers which allow the pressure points which kill your butt and shift around</li>
            <li> WonderGel Extreme Seat Cushion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried three different Wondergel cushions, and they all work, but not as well as I would like them to.</li>
            <li> IF YOU LIKE TO FEEL YOUR BACKSIDE AFTER A LONG DRIVE!..</li>
            <li> The surface is not smooth but consists entirely of 1/2&amp;#34; open squares.</li>
            <li> Wondergel single gel pad fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I was not able to do my normal 20 mins drive home without extreme pain.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that,</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little bigger and had a cover on both sides.</li>
            <li> My husband is a long distance truck driver and has a skinny butt!!!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but I have a real bony rear end, and sitting in regular chairs for an extended period of time (i.e., at work) is torture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an airline pilot and, as expected, do a ton of traveling.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something thin, non-slip and with enough body that it actually cushioned.and supported at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm enough that I feel I&#x27;m jacked up an inch and that messes with the height adjustment of my footrest and seat.  </li>
            <li> but I ordered this cushion because I have a sciatic nerve problem and can only drive for about 30 minutes without having to stop and walk for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My weight just pushed into the walls of the cushion after sitting for a few hours, and I got the same feeling that you get when you have a sock that is bunched up underneath your foot when you are walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My weight just pushed into the walls of the cushion after sitting for a few hours, and I got the same feeling that you get when you have a sock that is bunched up underneath your foot when you are walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> It is also a little bigger and thinner than the other versions that come with covers.</li>
            <li> This is similar to the WonderGel extreme, but has a smaller footprint and is not as thick, so it is easier to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is similar to the WonderGel extreme, but has a smaller footprint and is not as thick, so it is easier to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a back problem, drive a Rav4 with a stiff suspension.</li>
            <li> I bought cushion to soften all my seating including car, due to comfort demands of healing pelvis fractures.</li>
            <li> hope other people try it they will like it to wondergel roll &amp; go you can take it anyplace</li>
            <li> Other than that,  it works.</li>
            <li> Usually the pressure would build up week after week till I finally had to call in to work and take a day or two off.</li>

            <li> but it is not what I expected -keeps moving around in my driver&#x27;s seat - not worth $50.oo</li>
            <li> the other models came with a cover...</li>
            <li> I just brought the cushion inside when in extreme temps.</li>
            <li> long deskwork.&lt;br /&gt;The cushion is a bit heavy, so it&#x27;s not something that you would like to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s surprisingly heavy and not particularly portable.</li>
            <li> I tried a number of other products before this one...and they either proved to be too thick or didn&#x27;t have enough cushion.  </li>
            <li> usually when I drive for long periods</li>
            <li> Not worth putting into your car</li>
            <li> Roll &amp; Go is only one inch thick</li>
            <li> It is just thick enough but not so thick that it makes my back hurt which some cushions do.</li>
            <li> You must wait until the car has cooled down to room temperature and stayed there for 30 minutes before sitting on it again.</li>
            <li> If you ever need a product to help with the ache of sitting down a lot i would recommend this product it helped me out a lot</li>
            <li> so it becomes part of the seat, and you can relax and think about other things instead of being reminded that you butt is killing you!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time buying any other brand of cushion.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would not be thick enough to do the job but that concern was misplaced.</li>
            <li> I cut the Wondergel in half to make 2 cushions.  </li>
            <li> If you want to sit on half of something, then this is the cushion for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m average weight - maybe if you&#x27;re heavy it will help.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I bought a spots car that was a little to jarring.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE.  </li>
            <li> The walker has a small hard flat seat.  </li>
            <li> cushion seems tough, and a cover not necessary.</li>
            <li> Any rides longer than an hour cause lower back and tail bone pain that progressively gets worse the longer we drive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s too firm.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s too narrow and my butt falls of the edge.  </li>
            <li> The cushion actually only made it worse.</li>
            <li> I take it class everyday.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as heavy as some of the others I have felt while shopping in stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days, I ended up returning the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go and just decided to lug around the CONFORMAX &amp;#34;On the Go&amp;#34; in my duffle bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days, I ended up returning the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go and just decided to lug around the CONFORMAX &amp;#34;On the Go&amp;#34; in my duffle bag.</li>
            <li> at 95 pounds and no fat I could not fit on it...</li>
            <li> AND MY BUTT DIDNT GET TIRED TILL LAST 100 MILES</li>
            <li> This does relieve pressure on my tailbone in the truck and on hard surfaces, not so well on some other softer surfaces.</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS IS THE SMALLER LESS EXPENSIVE VERSION...</li>
            <li> a little longer will hope you guys take my advise!</li>
            <li> So his gift was a little late</li>
            <li> I have trouble sitting on hard chairs for any length of time and this cushion relieves the pain on my hips and the pressure on my tail bone.</li>
            <li> The size is a bit small for the car but is acceptable.  </li>
            <li> Too sticky, and too small for my driver&#x27;s side seat.  </li>
            <li> It was no better than putting a magazine or two on the chair.</li>
            <li> No more pain at all.</li>
            <li> but thats a small price to pay for added comfort.  </li>
            <li> Bought to use in the car, it was way to small for that.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> Using cushion for small amount of support.</li>
            <li> There is one small problem with it, it should not be allowed to reach the temperature of 120 degrees--warnings come with the package.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure my tailbone pain started becaus</li>
            <li> it gave him no more relief than a throw pillow off the couch.</li>
            <li> but it was very heavy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Two days, I drove over 500 miles, one day over 700, and unlike other trips, I didn&#x27;t have to stop and give my poor aching bottom a rest.  </li>
            <li> I am often uncomfortable on long car rides.  </li>
            <li> have nerve damage in my lower spine and am unable to sit for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> The patient said it was then too hard</li>
            <li> It felt hard.  </li>
            <li> It seems just as hard to be seated on as the truck seat, and it falls out of the vehicle each time I try to exit.</li>
            <li> As it turns out this product feels sort of hard when you sit on it.</li>
            <li> left in the car in cooler weather, it gets really cold.  </li>
            <li> The cushion is firm enough to become somewhat noticeable--not painful, but noticeable--after 30 minutes or so of driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have no butt at all, or at least it seems that way.</li>
            <li> when you read all the negative reviews keep that in mind</li>
            <li> 1 inch isnt thick enuf.</li>
            <li> thick Wondergel and</li>
            <li> one thick slab of the gel</li>
            <li> BUT IS LIKE ONE INCH THICK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different cushions becasue the seats in our 2009 Subaru Legacy are horrible in terms of comfort.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is becasue it can be a bit annoying to use at times.</li>
            <li> Too thIn.  </li>
            <li> This was frustrating</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update, I will never fly without one of these cushions again.</li>
            <li> BUT STILL NOT AS TIRED AS A 3 HOUR DRIVE BEFORE.  </li>
            <li> but when you sit on it the honeycomb pattern causes it to feel sturdy, not cushy.</li>
            <li> The other sometimes annoying thing is that becasue</li>
            <li> which is terribly uncomfortable and takes over an hour.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cushion because the driver&#x27;s seat in my new-to-me 2002 Lexus ES 300 is uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to transport because of no cover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also uncomfortable to my legs where they exit the edge of it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but it helps.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t as expensive.</li>
            <li> Trying to adjust it is difficult once it&#x27;s stuck to your clothes</li>
            <li> difficult</li>
            <li> Also the material made it difficult to move on the cushion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet during the winter, so we&#x27;ll see how it performs when it gets cold.  </li>
            <li> awful chairs.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We used this cushion a part of an existing cushion for a MS patient confined to a wheelchair. The problem we had was that there is no edging in which to sew to anything without damaging it. But we folded it around the front and made it work. The patient said it was then too hard so we ended up removing it. I realize this is not the fault of the cushion in any way, just did not work out like we had hoped.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really add much cushion.  It felt hard.  Gave it away</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS TO PUT ON TOP OF MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S WHEELCHAIR TRAY FOR TOUCH SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE IS TACTILE SENSITIVE. ALTHGOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE A HANDY DANDY ITEM TO ACTUALLY SIT ON!!</li>
            <li> great for my motorcyle seat</li>
            <li> This gel cushion was very comforable! I used it on vacation and it made the trip far more injoyable! I just thought it needed a cover.</li>
            <li> Makes my butt feel so much better....would like a twin XL &#x27;just like this&#x27; for my bed!  Good stuff!!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1 inch version. The size is a bit small for the car but is acceptable.  But I see no difference sitting on it or without it.</li>
            <li> My sister works for a company that doesn&#x27;t believe in making an employee comfortable.  She was having a lot of problems with her office chair.  I purchased this for her and she absolutely swears that it has saved her backside!</li>
            <li> Took it to the Hollywood Bowl for 8 hour event. Perfectly comfortable the entire time. I recommend it for all stadium bench seating.</li>
            <li> I found out about this cushion from a coworker who uses one.  I&#x27;m an airline pilot and, as expected, do a ton of traveling.  Our seats can at times be pretty worn down.  I use this for flying, and also when I sit as a passenger in the back.  It really does a great job of relieving some of the pressure on my back.  I think that it adapts easily to your body when you move, and stays intact (doesn&#x27;t break down) over time.  Great product.  I actually just purchased a second one for my wife...she tried it out in the car and mentioned to me that she had to get one too!  I would recommend this product to anyone who has to sit for a long period of time...whether it is in an airplane, car, or even office desk.</li>
            <li> This product would be great if it was twice as thick. I can feel how well it works but there just isn&#x27;t enoug of it to do the proper job</li>
            <li> This is the best cushion I have used. It really works.  Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey I may get another one just so I don&#x27;t have to remember to take it back and forth from home to work.</li>
            <li> Too sticky, and too small for my driver&#x27;s side seat.  Seems to be everything advertised, but I just couldn&#x27;t get comfortable on it.</li>
            <li> Our neighbors let us borrow these for a trip across country and I have never been more comfortable!  I have been searching for them ever since.  Please, please, make them available again!</li>
            <li> For skinny bums, this feels pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondergel does not make a cover for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When left in the car in cooler weather, it gets really cold.  If you don&#x27;t have warmers on your car seats, then your body heat has to warm it......which is terribly uncomfortable and takes over an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pads and cushions, so I was looking for something special and innovative. Wondergel single gel pad fits the bill. It&#x27;s just what I needed. Other pads all seem to about the same, and just get compressed after a while, but Wondergel has these chambers which allow the pressure points which kill your butt and shift around so it&#x27;s real relief for sore butts while driving long hours. You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there after a while, and that is what you need. It&#x27;s not too high so it becomes part of the seat, and you can relax and think about other things instead of being reminded that you butt is killing you! It&#x27;s the best I have ever tried, so I ordered a 2nd pad for the passenger side in my Van. It also does what those old pads used to do which had those wired like slinky rolls in them that allow your butt to stay dry on hot days, remember sweating on vinyl seats? However the little chambers are much more comfortable then those old spacey wired seats we used to buy years ago to keep your back and butt dry. For sure, it&#x27;s a much different experience then a typical cushion, but I love it and I haven&#x27;t tried anything near as comfortable to keep my butt from going to sleep and the pressure point problems you normally get. I got two of these before I decided to go on vacation, and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> Really helps the toosh.  It Adds comfort for long drives.  I took this on vacation.  And great for motorcycle rides too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews to replace an old egg crate type cushion that had lost its cushioning due to age. It provided no cushioning for me. The cells didn&#x27;t compress to give any comfort. It was no better than putting a magazine or two on the chair. I&#x27;m average weight - maybe if you&#x27;re heavy it will help. My hip and back pain increased. The company will not take a return unless the item is received damaged.</li>
            <li> I bought cushion to soften all my seating including car, due to comfort demands of healing pelvis fractures. It works like a charm, allowing me to sit comfortably for longer periods.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked very well. It was suggested by my home physical therapist. I&#x27;m so thankful that she gave me this suggestion and information.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cushion because the driver&#x27;s seat in my new-to-me 2002 Lexus ES 300 is uncomfortable for me. There&#x27;s a place in the seat pan where your rear end is supposed to go, but my personal rear end doesn&#x27;t have enough padding to sit there comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wondergel cushion mostly solves this problem. Pressure is more evenly distributed along my buttocks and legs, and the seat pan issue disappears. However, there are three problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cushion is firm enough to become somewhat noticeable--not painful, but noticeable--after 30 minutes or so of driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The cushion could be a bit larger. Despite my small bottom, it takes a certain amount of struggle to get seated on it in precisely the right way, and males who don&#x27;t get it just right may find, as I do, that  their scrotum is ever so slightly pinched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The cushion can&#x27;t be used if it becomes hot from the sun hitting the car. According to the literature supplied with the product, if the cushion reaches a mere 105 degrees F. (a hot car can easily exceed 120 degrees F), it will deform permanently when you sit on it. You must wait until the car has cooled down to room temperature and stayed there for 30 minutes before sitting on it again. (You can often avoid having it heat up by storing it on the floor of the car, out of the sun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a great improvement over the first cushion I tried (the Obus Wonderform), and I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li> This seat cushion really works and cushions airplane seats and seats at home.</li>
            <li> works well - I put it in a light weight shopping bag to carry easily and keep the dirt off of it.  I also have the larger thicker covered version of this but it was very heavy to travel with.</li>
            <li> The Wondergel seat cushion is very comfortable and helped keep my legs working during some recent all-day driving.  Because it isn&#x27;t solid gel (the gel is molded into a grid) it&#x27;s lightweight and flexible.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it cannot be used if it is overheated.  So if you can&#x27;t take it inside with you and have to leave it in the car you might not be able to sit on it until it cools off a little--the instructions say that when it&#x27;s overheated sitting on it can ruin the gel.  Fortunately this didn&#x27;t happen to me but I really can&#x27;t leave it in the car full time here in Texas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different cushions becasue the seats in our 2009 Subaru Legacy are horrible in terms of comfort. Any rides longer than an hour cause lower back and tail bone pain that progressively gets worse the longer we drive. I have to tell you that this cushion looks odd but it really does work. No more pain at all. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is becasue it can be a bit annoying to use at times. Specifically, each time you get out of the car it moves and kind of bunches up becasue the gel material grips you pretty well. The other sometimes annoying thing is that becasue it&#x27;s a rectangle shape it&#x27;s not designed to be custom fit to the seat so you can feel where the cushion ends under your legs. The back side of the cushion has a fabric like material to protect your car&#x27;s seat fabric.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wheelchair-bound mother.  She&#x27;s tried other cushions but didn&#x27;t find any of them comfortable.  This is the one cushion that works for her.  It&#x27;s comfortable for her, and isn&#x27;t bulky.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am often uncomfortable on long car rides.  I bought the Wondergel seat in hopes it would help with several long days in the car.  It really did.  I won&#x27;t say I was completely ache free but it was so much better than my last car trip.  I may bring it in for my office chair.  I wish they would make one that was the shape of a bucket seat because that might stay put a bit better. I&#x27;ll definately need another wondergel seat cushion before the next car trip so I don&#x27;t have to share.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom who uses a wheelchair and per her report she has a happy booty these days</li>
            <li> best seat cover anyone could buy</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic coushion!! I have one in the car, one on my office chair, and one in both the dining and living rooms. I also have a 2\\&quot; one where I watch TV, so obviously, I really think they are great.</li>
            <li> I carry to home and work and I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing another.  This product is comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with a bag for the gel.  Especially for the price you are paying for.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Would have liked a custom cover included,  did not come with one.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have low spinal problems and this is helpful. Great to take when going out to dinner!  But don&#x27;t forget to take it home or someone else will! This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve bought one of these as I forget and leave it!</li>
            <li> It helps a little on our long distance auto trips, but not so much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Too thIn.  Wish I would have bout the thicker one.</li>
            <li> It fits my car seat and in when I place it in the seat cool to your touch, the only down side is you have to remove from car in case the weather is too hot, sometimes I forget it when ready to travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my chair at my computer, and to take in the car.  Haven&#x27;t used it in the car yet, but it&#x27;s giving as much cushion as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Makes warn seats comfortable.  In a 40 hour flight in our 177 to California and back made a worn seat comfortable.  It makes the seat more cool as well.</li>
            <li> my dad fell and hurt his back and I was reading on line about this cushion.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for him for his birthday in October, he loves it and takes it everywhere&lt;br /&gt;with him. The only thing that would have been better, is that it could have been sent&lt;br /&gt;directly to him in Indiana, Instead it had to come to me and then, I had to turn around&lt;br /&gt;and resend it to him. So his gift was a little late and I had to spend an extra $17.00 for&lt;br /&gt;shipping. I don&#x27;t know why some items can&#x27;t be sent to a different address especially&lt;br /&gt;since I wanted it for a gift. Otherwise he loves the item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pickup, I have low back injuries, and was hopeful it would help. It does not work for me. This is not to say it will not help  someone else but I got no relief.  It seems just as hard to be seated on as the truck seat, and it falls out of the vehicle each time I try to exit. For the money I had hoped for a better product. Well this time it was this fool parted from his money. If you have back pain you know how much you wish for relief. So my advice, spend your money on a product that someone you know got relief from. good luck!</li>
            <li> Did not come with a cover but after the wife made one it is good to use as I drive.</li>
            <li> For my dad who is chair blund. He sits onit and as a doctor, i feel it helps prevent skin breakdown. He says irs very comfortbale. It is good quality</li>
            <li> I sit nearly all day and this really reduces the stiffness at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Fits my needs perfectly, quite a comfortable cushion! I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be big enough based on some of the reviews here, but it turned out to be just right.</li>
            <li> WORK GREAT IN OUR SHOWER WHERE I USE THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> works good but if you have someone who is in a wheelchair all day, it needs to be thicker.  1 inch isnt thick enuf.</li>
            <li> I like the wondergel cushions.  They are the best I have found for my sore tailbone. What I don&#x27;t like about THIS model is that it has no cover and I tend to stick to it getting in and out of my truck. It is also difficult to transport because of no cover. It comes with a warning not to leave it in a vehicle on hot days because it will deform which is a problem because I got it for that purpose. I recommend the ORIGINAL Wondergel cushion instead because it comes with a cover that has a handle. This does relieve pressure on my tailbone in the truck and on hard surfaces, not so well on some other softer surfaces.</li>
            <li> I spend all my waking hours in a power wheelchair.  I wanted something thin, non-slip and with enough body that it actually cushioned.and supported at the same time.  It&#x27;s definitely non-slip.  It sticks to the chair and to my skin, clothes. I need to be able to scoot or slide on the surface.  It&#x27;s firm enough that I feel I&#x27;m jacked up an inch and that messes with the height adjustment of my footrest and seat.  It&#x27;s also uncomfortable to my legs where they exit the edge of it.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s too firm.  It seems sturdy and may be fine for some folks but I can&#x27;t see how it will ever be right for me.</li>
            <li> While delivery was quick and easy, the product itself did not work as well as I expected. It did not cushion as much as I need and my buttock still hurt after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> We already have the thicker Wondergel cushions and they are great. We bought this smaller version for traveling overseas where space and weight are at a premium. Sew an old pillowcase over it for a cover, and it works well.</li>
            <li> I have a back problem, drive a Rav4 with a stiff suspension. We had taken a trip, about 6 hours, stopped every 1 1/2 to 2 hours and got out and walked, when we got there and on the return trip, I was very stoved up, with a lot of pain. I ordered 2 of the Wondergel&#x27;s , we then took a trip of about 20 hours, took only breaks for fuel, with no stiffness or pain. This product is GREAT, I would recommend it totally. Also our Rav4 has bucket seats, and the Wondergel works with NO problems&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;WFM</li>
            <li> After spending two weeks with this thing under my butt and really trying to see how this provides any comfort at all, I&#x27;m giving it the heave-ho out of the car.  For me it&#x27;s too narrow and my butt falls of the edge.  At 6&#x27;1 and 225 lbs, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overly large(??).  I just didn&#x27;t find this comfortable or useful and it&#x27;s too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution to my uncomfortable car seat.  After a while my new cars seat is not as comfortable as I need it to be  so I was searching for a solution. This gel seat has helped a lot, it does often come off the seat when i get out because it has &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; to me but thats a small price to pay for added comfort.  It is a little pricey but so far I say worth it.  I can move it from car to car or take it on trips easily enough.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was flying from Los Angeles to Hong Kong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helped for the first 7 hrs but my flight was 14hrs 50mins &#x3D; &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for long time but 4 stars for comforting me 7 hrs</li>
            <li> i like it  hope other people try it they will like it to wondergel roll &amp; go you can take it anyplace</li>
            <li> I have no butt at all, or at least it seems that way. Thus a search for nature&#x27;s padding brought me to this product with its implied promise to exit a chair without regret. I&#x27;ve had Roll &amp; Go for a couple of weeks and it helps. Not perfect, but it helps. I&#x27;m keeping it with no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s surprisingly heavy and not particularly portable. I haven&#x27;t been able to test it in my car seat - too bad because of the super heated temperatures in Atlanta&#x27;s summer and the warning not to leave it in the car. The gel must cool, taking up to 30 minutes or it deforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cushion seems tough, and a cover not necessary.</li>
            <li> The Gel Wondergel Seat Cushion is really great to sit on.  It makes sitting for long distances great as well as short trips.  You do not get sore from sitting.  It bounces back after you get up.  It is really comfortable for the Tailbone. I really enjoyed it on  Vacation.</li>
            <li> Perfect I actually used this in my shower seat to be able to sit there for a longer period of time since I can&#x27;t stand on my own two feet.  Since it&#x27;s gel, and it has holes it&#x27;s great for the shower seat itself.</li>
            <li> Good product. Indestructible. Cleans nicely. Used as a cushion on a shower stool.</li>
            <li> I got the 1&amp;#34; thick Wondergel and it is great. I was concerned that it would not be thick enough to do the job but that concern was misplaced. I am very happy with it. Definitely worth the money. It is pure comfort.</li>
            <li> These cushions (we now have two) are very comfortable for long term sitting without fatigue. Nicely supportive.</li>
            <li> worked just as I had hoped</li>
            <li> I gave it the rating it deserves!&lt;br /&gt;I have nerve damage in my lower spine and am unable to sit for long periods of time. I absolutely love my cushion. I am not as sore from sitting after sitting on my Wondergel roll &amp; go. I have tried every other seat cushion I have been able to find. This one is the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> The cushion is fine for my office chair but I ordered this cushion because I have a sciatic nerve problem and can only drive for about 30 minutes without having to stop and walk for a few minutes. The cushion actually only made it worse. It is square and therefore does not fit the seat well and causes my leg to be raised too high with no support under it. If I pull the seat forward there is a gap between the seat and the back.</li>
            <li> I have tried foam seat cushions, pillows, etc, but this gel cushion is super affordable (compared to the other options) and does the trick.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time buying any other brand of cushion. This is the brand to buy!  I have five or six of THE ORIGINAL WONDER GEL cushions and They are great. they are the ones that are thicker. I bought this version because I needed the headroom in my car. This cushion is good for me because of the headroom issue in the car. If headroom is not an issue,The ORIGINAL WONDERGEL cushion will give a little more relief because of the thickness. I need these because my boney toosh hurts very much when I sit for an extended period of time. These gel cushions really help ALOT. Hope this review helps, Yogi......</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband to use when driving.  I borrowed it for my sewing chair.  A friend used it during a work session at the computer and wanted to take it for use in her kayak.  Good size, not too thick and great to sit on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite good.  I bought a spots car that was a little to jarring.  It does give you 2 inches so not for tall people in drivers seat.The cushion makes the difference.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve bought--one for the desk chair and one for the car. I really like it for long periods of sitting, particularly driving. I put it in a pillow case so that I don&#x27;t get dents in my legs. It&#x27;s a great product, a real butt-saver!</li>
            <li> not a fan of waffle pattern</li>
            <li> good product for the money.  it works in the car, but I find it is very useful in the office.</li>
            <li> buy the cover.  when you sit on it without one,  you become glued to it and can&#x27;t squirm around.  Other than that,  it works.</li>
            <li> Great product... very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love it. I take it class everyday. It isn&#x27;t as heavy as some of the others I have felt while shopping in stores and it isn&#x27;t as expensive. I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a little more comfort on their bum.</li>
            <li> not a bad cushion, but still hurts after awhile on the road. next time I will get the larger one&lt;br /&gt;that also has the cover.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I sit at a desk all day.  It works very well, just as I thought i would.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I did not purchase a larger version. It works as promised and is comfortable pad</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel a difference every day in my back and sciatic area now that I&#x27;m using this cushion. I got one for my office chair and one for the car. I won&#x27;t go any where without them now. I&#x27;ve not had a sciatic flare up since using this cushion. Usually the pressure would build up week after week till I finally had to call in to work and take a day or two off. It&#x27;s been several weeks and I don&#x27;t feel it coming on. Yeah!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than I thought.  Bought it to make an uncomfortable car seat more comfortable.  I&#x27;m a commuter.  Without a cover, it sticks to your clothes and bunches up.  Trying to adjust it is difficult once it&#x27;s stuck to your clothes and you&#x27;re trying to get it straight under your bottom..  I tried to put a towel or pillow cover over it to reduce the sticking.  It did, but then that reduced the comfort and just got more bulky.  Overall, this isn&#x27;t what I expected and certainly did not help with the discomfort in my vehicle.  Would not recommend it for a car.  Besides the above, if it gets too hot from the sun there are warnings that it will essentially melt and lose its shape.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing. I used it on a car trip from KS to MN and loved the support it gave my back. usually when I drive for long periods my back really hurts. my back did not hurt at all during this last trip and I can only chalk it up to using this to sit on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great conversation piece because everyone wants to hold it and fold it and squeeze it. I took it to a conference where I knew they would be using metal folding chairs for seating. Everyone wanted to feel it and try it out. It saved my back from those awful chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it because you think it&#x27;s going to be cushy and soft, it&#x27;s not. it&#x27;s really soft to the touch but when you sit on it the honeycomb pattern causes it to feel sturdy, not cushy. I put a thin cushion on top for added softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy if you have back problems. I tend to get back pain from sitting long periods and this has stopped that from happening.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Is pretty bulky for local driving. I am going on an auto trip and will use so will have a better idea of its benefits.</li>
            <li> Great seat cushion, use it in office chair and in my car.</li>
            <li> Not worth putting into your car</li>
            <li> I am a college student taking classes at Harvard. The chairs in the library don&#x27;t have cushions or the cushions have gone flat. This makes studying for long periods of time difficult /painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead of going to the library to study, I purchased new chairs, but after a few months the cushions and the chairs had gone flat. This was frustrating and I got tired of purchasing new chairs, so I decided to purchase cushions as a more cost-effective approach to purchasing new chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a cushion that would allow me to study for 14 hours a day. Not knowing which cushions to purchase and not wanting to spend time trying out a bunch of different cushions I decided to try out a dozen or so different cushions, all of which had an average rating above four. I called Amazon to see if they would have a problem with me purchasing a bunch of items and then returning them as well as to make sure that my Amazon prime account would not get canceled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a list of the cushions that I purchased and the experience I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) CONFORMAX Anywhere, Anytime Gel Car/Truck Seat Cushion&lt;br /&gt;This was the most comfortable cushion of all of the questions that I tried and the one I would recommend the most. I am able to sit for an entire day without my rear end or back getting sore. I previously had to take two Aleve before using this cushion to be able to sit down and study for an entire day. It has a layer of high density foam and a very thick gel which provides a great deal of support without going flat, even if you are a big guy. I am 6 feet tall and about 210 pounds and even at the end of the day, it is just as soft as when you first sit on the cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other things, this is a large cushion and covers the entire seat which allows you to move around your seats comfortably. The top side of the cushion is a foamy type of cloth, and the bottom side of the cushion has a rubber-ish type of cover to keep it from sliding around on the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it is a large cushion that is also kind of heavy, so it is not a cushion that can be carried around or is transportable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) CONFORMAX &amp;#34;On the Go&amp;#34; Gel Travel Seat Cushion&lt;br /&gt;This was the second most comfortable cushion. I bought the ConforMax “On The Go Gel” cushion because the ConforMax Anywhere cushion was too big to carry around so I got them both. The ConforMax “On The Go” cushion provides the same amount of support as the “ConforMax Anywhere” cushion but is portable due to its smaller size. While it is still too large for me to get inside my backpack, I am able to get it inside my duffel bag/gym bag and take it with me without any difficulty to the computer lab or library. It would also fit inside a large briefcase or a small suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ConforMax “On The Go” cushion also allows me to sit for up to 14 hours a day at the library without my posterior or my back getting sore. The only down side is that, because it is smaller due to it being portable, it does not cover the chair completely, so you can not move around as much on a chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a cushion that is portable, this is the best cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion for 18 Inches X 16 Inches Wheelchair, Medium, 3 Inch, Black&lt;br /&gt;After the ConforMax cushions, this was the next most comfortable cushion. The Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion has a layer of gel encased in a layer of high density foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the time that I used it, the cushion did not go flat, and provided a great deal of support. By posterior or back did not get sore and I was able to study for 14 hours a day, only getting up to eat or use the restroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cushion really is not portable do to it’s size, but I was able to slightly fold it and get it into my duffle bag so I could take it with me to the library /computer lab at the university.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really happy with the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion and would highly recommend it Especially for folks on the heavier side since it did not flatten out when I used it. I am giving this product a five star rating. With that said, I ended up returning this item. The reason for that it is, the ConforMax cushions were more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that the ConforMax cushions cost $20 to $25 more than the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion, so if you are on a budget or do not want to spend as much money on the Comformax cushions, this is the next best cushion and the best cushion under $40 that I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Drive Medical Deluxe Skin Protection Gel &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; 3&amp;#34; Wheelchair Seat Cushion, Dark Blue, 18&amp;#34; x 16&amp;#34; 3&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cushion also provided good level of support and kept my posterior and back from getting sore. The cushion also did not flatten out during the time that I used it. I was able to hold this cushion, put it in my duffle bag and take it with me to the library, but it should be noted I only used it for two days before I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Drive Gel Seat Cushion provided a good level of support, I did not find it comfortable. The reason for that is because the gel is liquidy and moves /slouches around. You get the same type of feeling you get when you sit on a waterbed. I would recommend this product, but with reservations. You are better off with the either of the Comformax cushions ($30 more) and if you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion ($11 more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) WonderGel Extreme Seat Cushion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried three different Wondergel cushions, and they all work, but not as well as I would like them to. For reference purposes, the other five star reviews are accurate. These cushions work and will not go flat. I was able to sit and study for 14 hours per day, only having to get up to eat or use the restroom. With that said, while I was able to study for 14 hours per day and my back did not get sore, but my posterior did get a little sore after sitting for a couple of hours and moderately sore after sitting for 14 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem was my size. I am 6’ and 210 pounds. My weight just pushed into the walls of the cushion after sitting for a few hours, and I got the same feeling that you get when you have a sock that is bunched up underneath your foot when you are walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three Wondergel cushions I tried, this one was the most comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I returned these cushions after a week. I found the two Comformax cushions and the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion more comfortable and the the Comformax cushions were a little bit cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note – out of all of the large cushions, I found this cushion the easiest to carry around because it folded easily and I could easily get it into my duffle bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Wondergel Doublegel Gel Seat Cushion NEW Model - 2&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the review of the WonderGel Extreme Seat Cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very similar to the WonderGel Extreme seat cushion but with more gel cushioning. Dispite the extra thickness, I still found the WonderGel Extreme more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.) Wondergel Roll &amp; Go - Gel Seat Cushion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the review of the WonderGel Extreme Seat Cushion. This is similar to the WonderGel extreme, but has a smaller footprint and is not as thick, so it is easier to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cushion significantly reduces the amount of pain you would experience if you did not have this cushion and it did allow me to study up to 14 hours a day, but my posterior was sore at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the only cushion I could fit into my backpack and did not have to put it in my duffle bag. I was barely able to squeeze it into the laptop section of my backpack. If you are a student and want something that can fit into your backpack, this is your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previously mentioned, whilethe cushion significantly reduces the pain and soreness on your posterior, my posterior was still sore at the end of the day. It just reduced the soreness enough for me to be functional all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, I ended up returning the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go and just decided to lug around the CONFORMAX &amp;#34;On the Go&amp;#34; in my duffle bag. This was despite a higher level on inconvenience of lugging around the CONFORMAX &amp;#34;On the Go&amp;#34; in a duffle bag versus of greater level of convenience of carrying around the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go in my backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.) Duro-Med Polyfoam Wheelchair Cushion, Poly/Cotton Cover, Navy, 3 Inch x 16 Inch x 18 Inch&lt;br /&gt;Despite the large number of 5 star reviews from other reviewers, I found this item to be junk and would not recommend this item at all. After sitting on this cushion for 30 minutes, the cushion went flat. I can not recommend the Duro-Med Polyfoam Wheelchair Cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;The Wondergel cushions work as advertised and the other reviews are accurate, but I found the Comformax cushions to do the best job of keeping my back and posterior pain-free. If you are on a budget, the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion is the next best cushion and the best cushion for the price.posterior did get a little sore after sitting for a couple of hours and moderately sore after sitting for 14 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem was my size. I am 6’ and 210 pounds. My weight just pushed into the walls of the cushion after sitting for a few hours, and I got the same feeling that you get when you have a sock that is bunched up underneath your foot when you are walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three Wondergel cushions I tried, this one was the most comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I returned these cushions after a week. I found the two Comformax cushions and the Nova Ortho Gel Foam Cushion more comfortable and the the Comformax cushions were a little bit cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note – out of all of the large cushions, I found this cushion the easiest to carry around because it folded easily and I could easily get it into my duffle bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Wondergel Doublegel Gel Seat Cushion NEW Model - 2&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the review of the WonderGel Extreme Seat Cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very similar to the WonderGel Extreme seat cushion but with more gel cushioning.

            <li> This seat cushion is great! I use it when driving around and makes the seat way more comfortable for those long rides home from work. If you ever need a product to help with the ache of sitting down a lot i would recommend this product it helped me out a lot and it will probably help you too.</li>
            <li> I obtained considerable pain relief while using. It was especially helpful while driving. I purchased a second one for my computer chair.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with price and quality.</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it on a 13 hour drive. My assets felt great.</li>
            <li> Recently started a new job which places me on the road for 6hrs a day. I knew my bottom needed more cushion if this was going to work out. I tried a number of other products before this one...and they either proved to be too thick or didn&#x27;t have enough cushion.  I have used the WonderGel Seat Cushion for 3weeks now and its still strong as ever.  I appreciate that while they make a more expensive model with a cover, the company sells this one cheaper without a cover.</li>
            <li> the best price &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and bought this product based on those. I think it relieves the pain a tiny bit but I really can&#x27;t tell much difference sitting on this versus just sitting on the sofa.</li>
            <li> I have used this gel pad on four 15 hour drives in a Lexus CT200H Hybrid(horrible factory seating),about 120 hours on my desk chair and I just love what this pad does for my back, legs and tailbone. I&#x27;ve had tailbone issues my whole life and 15 hour drives would usually result in a infection.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars because of the price and the lack of a cover. I&#x27;d imagine this cost about a dollar twenty five to make and the lack of cover results in crumps, sand, anything and everything collecting inside. You cannot clean it. I am going to try and have someone custom make a cover for it. I recommend it to anyone sitting or taking long drives. FYI the gel pad also fit perfectly in my Honda Civic and Honda Element.</li>
            <li> I use this for my wooden chair at the kitchen nook table.  It seems to help my back when I&#x27;m sitting at the table for extended period&#x27;s of time (studying, working, etc.). A male friend of mine also sat on it after a long bicycle ride and he made the &amp;#34;aaaahhhhhhhhh&amp;#34; sound.  So, yay.  I may use it in my car for a 1500 mile trip.  I might be back to update the stats!</li>
            <li> This thing is made for a child...at 95 pounds and no fat I could not fit on it...total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable and softly good choice</li>
            <li> My husband is a long distance truck driver and has a skinny butt!!!  He was having a lot of discomfort.  I bought this cushion for him and VOILA.....his problem is gone.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Although this product was a fairly soft rubbery (silicon type feel) substance it was not gel. I bought it for my mother who has joint problems thinking the waffle texture would allow air circulation, avoid the &amp;#34;slippy-slidey&amp;#34; feel of gel bags, and avoid pressure points. As it turns out this product feels sort of hard when you sit on it. Even under another cushion it just didn&#x27;t support her in the same way as the gel bag type products do.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help my back but it is not what I expected -keeps moving around in my driver&#x27;s seat - not worth $50.oo plus</li>
            <li> I just took mine out of the box,put it on my desk chair,this is GREAT if you have a skinny butt!! I do,and this is great!!</li>
            <li> Good product, but collects lint very easy. Works as a child&#x27;s car seat pad. Would buy again if I needed too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to make a cushion for my daughter&#x27;s walker.  The walker has a small hard flat seat.  I cut the Wondergel in half to make 2 cushions.  Then I covered them with fabric to which I had attached iron-on Velcro. The cushion was secured to the seat with stick-on Velcro.  The product worked well because it provided enough padding without being bulky.</li>
            <li> Good for somepne with back problems especially when seated for prolonged periods like traveling.</li>
            <li> Bought to use in the car, it was way to small for that. Also, they said not to leave it in  a hot car during the day. What am I supposed to walk around with this thing all day so it does not get hot. Probably OK for other uses, but not for auto.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and cool in summer.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Product needs a cover / I ordered this separately (this was a surprise need). Have not yet tried product as it was purchased for travel. Other wondergel products are incredible.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cushion because I have problems after hip replacement in being&lt;br /&gt;comfortable in some chairs and when travelling by bus.  This is a roll and go&lt;br /&gt;gel seat cushion which I love and it hits all the pressure points when sitting for any length of time.  I recommend this to others and it was purchaed hrough Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who has sciatica.  She said she liked it.  I have used it; it feels fine but my butt doesn&#x27;t hurt ever so it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference for me</li>
            <li> Pretty squishy. Used this on a 12 hour trip to Colorado. My butt was very pleased.</li>
            <li> never go anywhere without item</li>
            <li> Update 1/4/13&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a while now, I have decided this&lt;br /&gt;cushion is not thick enough.  Because of the \\&quot;cell-like\\&quot; construction,&lt;br /&gt;the cushion pretty much just flattens out to a thin layer of the gel&lt;br /&gt;material when you sit on it.  It would have been better if this was&lt;br /&gt;just one thick slab of the gel material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice. Kinda works, maybe this one is not thick enough for me?&lt;br /&gt;If I buy again, I will try the thicker but more expensive kind</li>
            <li> Riding in husbands&#x27; 4-wheel drive pickup is a pain in the rear (literally).  Seats are unforgiving.  Long trips are excrutiating until I found this gel seat cushion on Amazon.com.  Highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve survived 3 trips of 4+ hours without squirming and hitting the Tylenol bottle.  Get it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It really works! I&#x27;ve let friends seat on it and they are amazed!  I recommend this to everyone who has lower back issues or has to commute long distances.</li>
            <li> I purchased all five of the listed Wondergel cushions&lt;br /&gt;all the other models came with a cover...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why all five...because each person and chair is different&lt;br /&gt;the cushions vary in thickness and each will feel differently&lt;br /&gt;based on the type of chair its used on&lt;br /&gt;but the cushions are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Wondergel cushions are top of the line&lt;br /&gt;and should last a very long time...&lt;br /&gt;so I will get my monies worth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Roll &amp; Go one star because no factory supplied cover&lt;br /&gt;for this reason I would not purchase it...of course&lt;br /&gt;you could use a pillow case or buy a cover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the illustrations and photos of the Wondergel products&lt;br /&gt;do not show a cover (I understand this because Wondergel wants&lt;br /&gt;you to see how its made and designed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the product descriptions do not clearly state if a cover is included.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to Wondergel is please clearly state that the cover&lt;br /&gt;is or is not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this purchase I never purchased a Wondergel product&lt;br /&gt;nor a cushion of this type...so I had no way of knowing&lt;br /&gt;if the product came with or without the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Roll &amp; Go is only one inch thick&lt;br /&gt;so when you read all the negative reviews keep that in mind</li>
            <li> Too small. You can get the bigger one but they are twice as much</li>
            <li> My guy is a truck driver and likes it a lot</li>
            <li> Thought cushion would provide more support.  Did not expect cushion to slide off chair so easily.  Using cushion for small amount of support.</li>
            <li> Recently I a bought a new car; it&#x27;s great on gas mileage, not so good on my bottom.  The seats aren&#x27;t very comfortable, especially during a long drive.  When I decided to drive to my son&#x27;s house in Canada, a 1900 mile trip, one way, I knew I needed help with the seat.&lt;br /&gt;The Wondergel Roll was cheaper than several other gel seat cushions, but the reviews were good, so I took a chance and ordered it (overnight delivery; it was nearly time for me to leave).  It was wonderful.  Two days, I drove over 500 miles, one day over 700, and unlike other trips, I didn&#x27;t have to stop and give my poor aching bottom a rest.  No complaints at all--not one.  I highly recommend it.  There is one small problem with it, it should not be allowed to reach the temperature of 120 degrees--warnings come with the package.  I just brought the cushion inside when in extreme temps. No problem.</li>
            <li> Works ok after 12 hours in a car your still going to be hurting</li>
            <li> Thought it&#x27;d be thicker, does cushion but must have a towel on top.</li>
            <li> I loved the cushion from the first day, and I&#x27;ve just ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;I regret not checking this before and bearing with a backache after long deskwork.&lt;br /&gt;The cushion is a bit heavy, so it&#x27;s not something that you would like to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sitting on hard chairs for any length of time and this cushion relieves the pain on my hips and the pressure on my tail bone.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband.  He is long distance driver who has a problem with kidney stones.  He says he likes it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Makes for a more comfortable ride.</li>
            <li> For my health issue, Pudendal nerve pain, this did not help at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I did not expect anything different from what I got.&lt;br /&gt;As a seat cushion it functions well but it has not yet been tested on a long trip.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different seat cushions on my recumbent exercise bike. I&#x27;m on it a lot and don&#x27;t like being sore when I&#x27;m off it. This cushion really cushions! Looks like it holds up pretty well too. I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and it works as well as the day I got it. Will definitely buy again if I should need another.</li>
            <li> This cushion provided significant relief for my butt when sitting for lengthy periods.  I am a computer programmer so I spend my days sitting in front of a computer. By mid-day, my butt was starting to hurt...until I bought this cushion! Now I can go through a whole day (with normal ups and downs) and feel comfortable at the end of the day.  Despite the &#x27;no slide&#x27; backing, it still slides around on the (fabric) chair seat, so I have to adjust it a lot. Overall, recommended.</li>
            <li> This cushion works very well for me. It is just thick enough but not so thick that it makes my back hurt which some cushions do. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> its good to have. i wish there is a cover included to this cushion.</li>
            <li> So this is a very good support cushion. However what I did not like is that when i try to get out of the car it would kind of stick to my pants and then become off. So every time I needed to get back in the car I would need to readjust. I ended up covering it with a t shirt in order to stop it from sticking to me. I still use it and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a pad to sit on a flat elevated rock where I hunt sometimes to 20 degrees without getting hard.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it at home it my recliner.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it...may get another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the comfort. It makes long trips in my truck much more comfortable. It keeps my backside from aching. I just wish it was a little bigger and had a cover on both sides. They offer a thicker one but I weigh 200lbs and this one does the job just fine.I also wish I could find a mattress made out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice gel cushion.  Comfy.</li>
            <li> I bought this seat because I was feeling a spring poking up in my car&#x27;s driver&#x27;s seat.  The spring pressed against my hip and the nerve there, so I was limping when I got out of the car.  This gel seat molds itself around me enough so I don&#x27;t feel that spring and can get out of the car and walk properly.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet during the winter, so we&#x27;ll see how it performs when it gets cold.  But I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Upon arrival the cushion had instructions about caring for it in the heat.  Since I&#x27;ll be driving in hot climes, it&#x27;s enough for me to take care of myself and not have to care for the cushion.  That warning about the heat should be spelled out up front.</li>
            <li> The product did not meet my expectation. Nothing in the ad suggested that the gel cushion did not come with a pillow cover. When you sit on it, it sticks to your bottom. The surface is not smooth but consists entirely of 1/2&amp;#34; open squares. Who ever heard of a cushion being used w/o a cover? I would have sent it back but did not want to go through the hassle. I&#x27;m hoping to find a pillow cover that fits the cushion. If the manufacturer has a suggestion for this problem, I&#x27;d like to hear it.</li>
            <li> i bought this not to ease my back ache, but to ease my Coccyx. I am not sure my tailbone pain started becaus I sit far too long (thanks to the many OT hours I put in at work) or it was injured from over exerting myself in boot camp class. Maybe both. At work I can shift myself to sit sideway or sit with one leg under my rear, but that is not feasible for driving. I was not able to do my normal 20 mins drive home without extreme pain. And of course, sitting side way or on my leg create new issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was researching cushion seat and came across this. The price was decent so I thought I give it a try.  This wonderful cushion relieved my coccyx pain from sitting at my desk. Since I am not in pain for 8-11 hours during the work day, the 20 minutes drive home was bearable. I would consider buying one for the car but the manufacturer label said if it was left in the hot car, don&#x27;t  use it until it is at normal room temperature (about 30 min) or risk damaging it for good. Since I live in hot climate, and drive is only 20 minutes, I decided against buying a second one. If I have to do it over, I would buy one with the cover. I am using a pillow case and it looks really unprofessional at work.</li>
            <li> Its ok but not the solution</li>
            <li> We got this for my mother-in law as a  &amp;#34;Christmas&amp;#34; gift! It looks very cool! We are hoping she will enjoy it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! If you need something for an elderly person that sits a lot during the day, this is the product for you! My dad has improved greatly since sitting on the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go.  He is no longer squirming in his recliner and his pressure sores are healing.  I want one for myself now!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I have a real bony rear end, and sitting in regular chairs for an extended period of time (i.e., at work) is torture.  So I sit on this gel seat cushion.  It makes all the difference in the world!</li>
            <li> We have used this for over one year now and it is still in its original shape and same level of support. Very good for sciatic pain relief while driving or sitting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I guess, but it really isn&#x27;t that comfortable and it&#x27;s somewhat bouncy. I did cut it to fit the seat dimensions which made it a bit more secure.</li>
            <li> I just drove 1600 miles last week and that would normally give me an extremely sore a@@. Using the Wondergel was a HUGE improvement and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This pad is an okay cushion, but it costs too much. My parents use cloth cushions from hardwood chairs and I am envious because they cushion as well on the gym bleachers at one-fouirth the cost!</li>
            <li> Is a wonderful cushion for the price. Can be used on a stool or in the car and I really enjoyed the fit/feel. Can be cut to fit if you wish. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> We got this for my 91 year old father in law who was experiencing heel pain when he was in bed. We think it will work, but we need to find a slick pillow case to go over it so his heels slide easily.</li>
            <li> The seat gave my Dad the same relief as the throw pillows he had been using. He still had to use two cushions. Also the material made it difficult to move on the cushion. Had to make a silk slip cover so he could slide into the correct seat position.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price considering it gave him no more relief than a throw pillow off the couch.</li>
            <li> Driving a lot &#x3D; sore hip!. This has helped a lot!</li>
            <li> This pad provides some nice cushioning while I&#x27;m recovering from a tailbone injury.  I like that it&#x27;s lightweight enough to be portable.  I would like it ten times better, though, if they added a couple of inches on each side.  The cushion isn&#x27;t quite wide enough to cover my chair and shifts enough to cause discomfort and require constant readjustment.</li>
            <li> If you buy this cushion, don&#x27;t expect to sit on it because it won&#x27;t fit. I bought the &#x27;large&#x27; size and if your bottom is the size of a baby&#x27;s, it might accomodate you. In fact if you use it for your car, because of its size, it will cause pressure discomfort on your upper thighs. When I received the cushion, a surprise note came with it, declaring that the cushion could not be left in a hot car. When I wrote to the company, they referred me to a medical supply house (unrelated to them) for a \\&quot;cushion that would fit.\\&quot; If you are looking for driving comfort or sitting on something comfortable; don&#x27;t buy this product. If you want to sit on half of something, then this is the cushion for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this seat cushion, I can sit at my desk for long hours and it makes long car rides much more pleasant, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it out on my international flight in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, I will never fly without one of these cushions again. My bottom was fine after our 9 hour flight.</li>
            <li> I had one of these cushions for years, but lost it on a train. The one I had came with a cover and had a carry handle. This version does not come with a cover. What you see in the picture is what you get. It is also a little bigger and thinner than the other versions that come with covers. If you want one for use in a car, this is probably not the version to buy - get one with a cover.</li>
            <li> while this cushion serves the purpose i think i would like it to be wider and a little longer will hope you guys take my advise!</li>
            <li> I DROVE ALMOST 950 MILES IN ONE SITTING, ONLY STOPPING FOR GAS AND FOOD ( USUALLY AT SAME TIME) AND MY BUTT DIDNT GET TIRED TILL LAST 100 MILES BUT STILL NOT AS TIRED AS A 3 HOUR DRIVE BEFORE.  SO YES EVERYONE NEEDS TO BUY ONE IF YOU LIKE TO FEEL YOUR BACKSIDE AFTER A LONG DRIVE!.. BUT IS LIKE ONE INCH THICK OR SO, SO SITS YOU UP IN YOUR SEAT A LITTLE.  I GOT USED TO IT ON THE DRIVE AS WAS SO CUMFY AND SO VERY WORTH THE INCH.. BUY ONE TODAY.  I THINK THIS IS THE SMALLER LESS EXPENSIVE VERSION... WONDER HOW GREAT THE EXPENSIVE VERSION IS.  This fit inside the small inset seat area n my bucket seat, not over the whole seat</li>
            <li> Drove 2,000 miles and was  very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is soft to seat on and felling the pressure has been reduced. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again when Walmart online order is 24 and I paid 36.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> The roll and go is really great! It is currently used on a chair that was losing it&#x27;s comfort level. Now, with the Wondergel Roll &amp; Go being used on this chair, it makes a huge improvement in comfort. Also, the Wonergel Roll &amp; Go has not lost any of it&#x27;s ability to provide comfort and support, and the ability to move it around or even take it with me on trips adds greatly to it&#x27;s value.</li>
