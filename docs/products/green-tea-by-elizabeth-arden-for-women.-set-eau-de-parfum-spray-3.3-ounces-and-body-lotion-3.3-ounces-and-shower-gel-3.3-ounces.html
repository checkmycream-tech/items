            <li>I also gave it a five because of the quick service.</li>
            <li>Can only recommend this product :-)</li>

            <li> This fragrance is refreshing and light.  Perfect for those who don&#x27;t want a heavy scent.      Like other reviewers said, it doesn&#x27;t last long, but that is fine with me.  Carry the lotion in my purse for a refresher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a big disaster, I don&#x27;t recomend to use this service with AAAMerchants.  I order two things, only one arrive and this was need to pay.  I claim to AAAMerchant but they answer saying that was not their fault.    No les recomiendo que usen este servicio con AAA Merchants.  Encargue 2 items, solo llego uno y en la entrega se tuvo que pagar.  Realmente desagradable, aunque he intentado saber donde esta el otro paquete,esta gente de AAAMerchant no han sido capaces de responder y ademas se han despreocupado del tema.  Esto no es una opinión, es una exposición de los hechos y un aviso a navegantes.  Solo espero que no le vuelva a pasar a nadie mas.  Son los peligros de comprar en Internet.</li>
            <li> got the green tea parfum for my daughter for christmas she loved it couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores where we live thanks to amazon and the great service they provide. amazon has always had great service i&#x27;ve been very satisfied with everthing i order and the delivery is so fast thanks again amazon  dorothy wilson</li>
            <li> The price is very good. Maybe the best deal on Elizabeth Arden Green Tea perfume.  The package has shower gel, body lotion, and perfume. The scent fades very fast, but I love it. (You can re-apply whenever you want, anyway) And the shower gel smells very fresh. The package arrived in a very good condition - no dent, no delay. It was a perfect 5 star purchase. I&#x27;ve already recommended this for my friends.</li>
            <li> This product was delightfully received by me and the gift recipient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a Christmas gift for my mother who loves perfumes. She is already a big fan of other Elizabeth Arden fragrances so I thought giving her something different this year would be a welcome change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product I was impressed by the size, and packaging. It comes in a pretty green box with lotion and shower gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my mother opened the gift she was so excited. She sprayed some on and it was a hit! It definitely has the essence of green tea. It is sweet and light smelling. It would be great for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the product and the purchase.</li>
            <li> Light and airy green tea fragrance.  Doesn&#x27;t linger long enough to get sick of it!  Great for summertime and keeps the bugs away too!!</li>
            <li> I liked the gift set and so did my Mom.  I received the package within one week of placing me order.  Great service and will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> Nice set, clean scent, the best part is the spray. I used it on me, my sheets, my clothes in the closet, my towels in the bathroom... I like it because for work it&#x27;s low profile, discreet.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because for me does not have a good quality. The essence of the perfume does not endure.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized set that is displayed well.  Will make a nice gift.  Package shipped well.  I was overall happy with this transaction.</li>
            <li> This beautifully package set arrive on time is fantastic.  Each item delivers more than what was promised and everyone loves the odor.</li>
            <li> I gave it a five because of the genuine quality with additional green tea products at a great price! And because it also comes in a stylish green box that my fiance like! I also gave it a five because of the quick service. Although they said it might take a couple weeks to send it, it only took less than a week to get to Hawaii! At least that was my experience.</li>
            <li> I love the light fragrance!  It isn&#x27;t heavy or strong, which is what I like about it.  If you like strong or powerful scents, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this fragrance.  It has a long lasting \\&quot;green\\&quot; fragrance.  Not too heavy, but stays with you.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my Aunt. She loved it! She also requested me to get this for her again next year.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is very affordable buy as a gift and it makes happy girls. I highly recommend this I bought it in several occasions.</li>
            <li> Green Tea matches and exceeds other more expensive eau de parfums.  The lotion truly softens and the shower gel cleans.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this cost less than $30. Wonderful scent and generous sizes. Would order this again for myself and as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was given this gift set for Christmas about three years ago and love this scent. It smells great and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments and have re-ordered numerous times. Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> Got this set for my mom and she loved it. It is a full size set no little teaser bottles and it costs less at Amazon than at the Elizabeth Arden site.</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s better than what i thought.&lt;br /&gt;This kit can take you out of any hurry, if you have to buy a gift.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume forever and I cant find it where I live! So worth it! Love! Will buy again</li>
