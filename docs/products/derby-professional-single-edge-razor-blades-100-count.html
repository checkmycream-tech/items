            <li>Great blades</li>
            <li>a great buy</li>
            <li>Great blades.</li>
            <li>Derby may do great for some</li>
            <li>Good news is...</li>
            <li>Price is great but there is definitely better blades out there.</li>
            <li>Great product just as described everything arrived in super good condition and worked as its suppose too..</li>
            <li>This blade is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My favorite blades to use</li>
            <li>I love that they come pre split and individualy warped</li>
            <li>Way Better than the &amp;#34;Sharp&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;&amp;#60; love the price and the close shave</li>
            <li>Derby blades are great if you are just getting into straight shaving.</li>
            <li>Pretty good blade.  </li>
            <li>A bit short for what I have discovered is right for me, but they fit the razor I bought perfectly.</li>
            <li>Close shave on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to dispose of.</li>
            <li>These were for my first straight razor (a cheaper Dovo) but they are a great deal.</li>
            <li>I got these to go with a cheap blade holder to see if I liked straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Very good quality steel and extremly sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I use the [[ASIN:B000ZXB94I Dovo Silver Stainless Steel Shavette Straight Razor Replaceable Blade with Red Blade Holder]] and these blades are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>That is not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li>It is by far the most economical means of shaving I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but it just goes to show that you need the right blade for your beard type.</li>
            <li>the Right Blade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It should help guide you to find the blade sharpness that is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know if my experience with them was fair, due to being a total novice at the art of throat-slitting, or if they simply aren&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>but it was easy enough to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Because they&#x27;re already half blades you just slip into your holder and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>when I first used them I  would leave them in my shavette and reuse them.</li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying I&#x27;ve used so many different blades.</li>
            <li>Use &#x27;em, love &#x27;em, will never go back to shaving with a multi-blade handles.</li>
            <li>I switched to a different blade holder and better shave products</li>
            <li>- I am proud to say I had the technique more or less down.</li>
            <li>although to be honest I haven&#x27;t tried any other blades.</li>
            <li>Have tried several different blades, and I&#x27;d say this is as good as any.</li>
            <li>Individually wrapped and a sliding-box holder, it is easy to keep these blades organized and sterile.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s only 10 cents per shave, which is fine by</li>
            <li>I really really wish I could give it NO stars.</li>
            <li>So you can imagine how much I go through razors</li>
            <li>This went much smoother.  </li>
            <li>They are some of the dullest razors of the straight razors.</li>
            <li>I bought this box so I can refill my beginners straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li>I love shaving with a straight razor, and with the DERBY straight razor with replaceable blades, I spend about $10 a year on shaving (as opposed to $10 every 2 or 3 weeks with conventional razors).</li>
            <li>Works well with my New Taize Straight Razor</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these for anyone new to straight shaving.</li>
            <li>These are cheap, super sharp, and typically last me 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li>I use each blade for 2 or 3 days, throw it out for a new one, and spend $1.00 a month on a bar of shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing these blades, I was using double edged blades that had to be trimmed to fit.  </li>
            <li>Feeling like a cross between Sweeney Todd and a kid with his first pocket knife, I started hacking away at my face.  </li>
            <li>Although the very first time I tried shaving with the new system, I cut myself quite a bit (due to a simple lack of technique), by the 3rd shave, I had given myself a very satisfactory shave that left my face smooth as a baby&#x27;s buttocks</li>
            <li>They are not too sharp, but sharp enough to give you a good shave, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>So after getting 1 bad first shave and 1 decent one, and 3 very good ones out of the 1/2 of the Merkur blade, I decided to give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, during my first pass WITH the grain of my hair, I noticed that there was a significantly less amount of hair being cut with each stroke (barely any hair on the towel as I wiped the blade)</li>
            <li>second time I shaved in this manner, I did a little bit better, but was still getting a bit of burn/nicks.  </li>
            <li>so it would attach to my straight razor properly!</li>
            <li>I purchased a Parker SRB &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34; style straight razor to delve into the extra bit of manliness that is manual shaving.  </li>
            <li>They work very well in my shavette and give me a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>my wife lets me use, or if these blades just don&#x27;t fit my face (from my research, it seems that different people have different experiences with different brands of different blades....</li>
            <li>I walked out of the bathroom looking like Carrie (not the new Chloe Moretz version, but the original with Sissy Spacek) wondering what went wrong the first time I used these.</li>
            <li>First shave and several after really made my face raw and would &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; and cut me.</li>
            <li>(Every little bit helps, right?)  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the extra $1.00 to not have to snap the blades in half.</li>
            <li>As a Master Barber in NYS, we must use a shavette instead of a conventional blade straight razor.</li>

            <li> As a Master Barber in NYS, we must use a shavette instead of a conventional blade straight razor.</li>
            <li> The new blade holder contained a few shark blades..</li>
            <li> as you have 100 blades it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> They are SHARP and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> And the difference is night and day, they last longer, cut closer, edges aren&#x27;t as sharp..</li>
            <li> The ends were also very sharp and I only could get 2 shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that my beard hair is so thick that I have to use 2-3 of these to get a shave that I think is close enough.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blades get really dull while I&#x27;m in the middle of shaping my goatee.  </li>
            <li> SHARP!</li>
            <li> Thick and coarse hair can be a little tricky with these blades</li>
            <li> and this helped slightly.</li>
            <li> I use the blades just once and discard them and still it can&#x27;t even finish one shave without getting really dull to the point of struggling to cut a single hair.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a problem with the blade itself but rather after a few uses they would begin to rust and that the rust got on my shavette</li>
            <li> i have thin hair and these blades last me for ever</li>
            <li> Blades do not insert into my straight razor (that it came with in a set) evenly, I&#x27;ve never been cut so bad from razor blades in my life</li>
            <li> Then these arrived in the mail, and I was anxious to try them.</li>
            <li> you find these are too dull for you, which will probably happen eventually, then check out \\&quot;Shaving 101\\&quot; and look for the article \\&quot;Choosing</li>
            <li> During one session I go through at least two blades.</li>
            <li> Too thin &amp; caused razor burn &amp; had missing hooks</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> A necessary evil.  </li>
            <li> They cut, scrape and feel awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using these for years now although to be honest I haven&#x27;t tried any other blades. the only recommendation I have is that you throw them out after one use. when I first used them I  would leave them in my shavette and reuse them. It wasn&#x27;t a problem with the blade itself but rather after a few uses they would begin to rust and that the rust got on my shavette but it was easy enough to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and as you have 100 blades it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very good quality steel and extremly sharp blades. Because they&#x27;re already half blades you just slip into your holder and you&#x27;re good to go. This 100 pack will probably last me for years to come!!! I definitely recommend!!! Great blades</li>
            <li> Too thin &amp; caused razor burn &amp; had missing hooks so it would attach to my straight razor properly!</li>
            <li> My favorite blades to use</li>
            <li> So my Dovo Shavette came with a Merkur double edge razor blade. Although the very first time I tried shaving with the new system, I cut myself quite a bit (due to a simple lack of technique), by the 3rd shave, I had given myself a very satisfactory shave that left my face smooth as a baby&#x27;s buttocks - I am proud to say I had the technique more or less down. Then these arrived in the mail, and I was anxious to try them. So after getting 1 bad first shave and 1 decent one, and 3 very good ones out of the 1/2 of the Merkur blade, I decided to give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, during my first pass WITH the grain of my hair, I noticed that there was a significantly less amount of hair being cut with each stroke (barely any hair on the towel as I wiped the blade) - I had to keep going over the same spot over and over. Then when I started going against the grain on my second pass…I&#x27;ll just say that when I got done, my face looked like Edward Scissor Hands and Sweeney Todd went at it tag-team style…even on my cheeks where I found it to be the easiest to shave both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 99 I have left will just sit in my medicine cabinet until they rust and become dust. I really really wish I could give it NO stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered two packs of these.  The blades get really dull while I&#x27;m in the middle of shaping my goatee.  I use the blades just once and discard them and still it can&#x27;t even finish one shave without getting really dull to the point of struggling to cut a single hair.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying I&#x27;ve used so many different blades. This blade is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. They are SHARP and last for a long time. I am a barber. I love that they come pre split and individualy warped but I also use them to shave myself. I would recommend them .</li>
            <li> these last forever! a great buy</li>
            <li> Blades do not insert into my straight razor (that it came with in a set) evenly, I&#x27;ve never been cut so bad from razor blades in my life</li>
            <li> Way Better than the &amp;#34;Sharp&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> Pretty good blade.  Close shave on fine hair.  Thick and coarse hair can be a little tricky with these blades however sharper blades make it easier to nic a person.</li>
            <li> Great product just as described everything arrived in super good condition and worked as its suppose too..</li>
            <li> SHARP! Be careful! Work great thought &amp; saved me some money! I&#x27;m a barber... So you can imagine how much I go through razors</li>
            <li> Great blades. Totally worth the extra $1.00 to not have to snap the blades in half.</li>
            <li> Works well with my New Taize Straight Razor</li>
            <li> I love shaving with a straight razor, and with the DERBY straight razor with replaceable blades, I spend about $10 a year on shaving (as opposed to $10 every 2 or 3 weeks with conventional razors). I use each blade for 2 or 3 days, throw it out for a new one, and spend $1.00 a month on a bar of shaving soap. It is by far the most economical means of shaving I have ever used. I feel like I get a closer shave as well, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> Very good blades.  Have tried several different blades, and I&#x27;d say this is as good as any. Quality is on pat with Shark, Wilkerson Sword, and Astra. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> These razors seem to lack consistency.  It seems that about 1 out of 4 or so has obvious lack of sharpness.  I purchased the two 100ct pack and have tried both packages.  I&#x27;ve been using these for about 6 months now.  I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the Shark blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Parker SRB &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34; style straight razor to delve into the extra bit of manliness that is manual shaving.  (Every little bit helps, right?)  Feeling like a cross between Sweeney Todd and a kid with his first pocket knife, I started hacking away at my face.  I won&#x27;t include pictures, but let&#x27;s just say Freddie Kruger woulda been proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I shaved in this manner, I did a little bit better, but was still getting a bit of burn/nicks.  (Thank you local retailer for having a styptic pencil in an emergency.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third time I taunted God by incessantly plotting my obvious self-destruction; I decided to use the Shark blades that came with my Parker SRB razor.  This went much smoother.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the &amp;#34;third time&#x27;s a charm&amp;#34; luck, the fact I&#x27;m finally learning how to handle something sharper than the rounded plastic safety scissors my wife lets me use, or if these blades just don&#x27;t fit my face (from my research, it seems that different people have different experiences with different brands of different blades....differently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know if my experience with them was fair, due to being a total novice at the art of throat-slitting, or if they simply aren&#x27;t that great.  Good news is...they slice things.  They&#x27;re sharp.  Believe me.  I walked out of the bathroom looking like Carrie (not the new Chloe Moretz version, but the original with Sissy Spacek) wondering what went wrong the first time I used these.</li>
            <li> Use &#x27;em, love &#x27;em, will never go back to shaving with a multi-blade handles. These are cheap, super sharp, and typically last me 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our butchering/processing needs. Cheap, easy to dispose of.</li>
            <li> 10 cents a shave? cant go wrong with that. i have thin hair and these blades last me for ever</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;&amp;#60; love the price and the close shave and i can change the blades daily and still save money &amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I got these to go with a cheap blade holder to see if I liked straight razor shaving. First shave and several after really made my face raw and would &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; and cut me. The ends were also very sharp and I only could get 2 shaves out of it. I switched to a different blade holder and better shave products and this helped slightly. The new blade holder contained a few shark blades.. And the difference is night and day, they last longer, cut closer, edges aren&#x27;t as sharp.. Derby may do great for some but it just goes to show that you need the right blade for your beard type. Price is great but there is definitely better blades out there.</li>
            <li> It fills my expectations</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing these blades, I was using double edged blades that had to be trimmed to fit.  These blades are perfectly priced and work great.</li>
            <li> These were for my first straight razor (a cheaper Dovo) but they are a great deal. A bit short for what I have discovered is right for me, but they fit the razor I bought perfectly. All in all a very good deal.</li>
            <li> As a Master Barber in NYS, we must use a shavette instead of a conventional blade straight razor. I use the [[ASIN:B000ZXB94I Dovo Silver Stainless Steel Shavette Straight Razor Replaceable Blade with Red Blade Holder]] and these blades are a perfect fit. Individually wrapped and a sliding-box holder, it is easy to keep these blades organized and sterile.</li>
            <li> Derby blades are great if you are just getting into straight shaving. They are some of the dullest razors of the straight razors. That is not necessarily a bad thing. If you are just starting out KNOW that you will cut yourself, even with these blades. They work very well in my shavette and give me a close enough shave. The only issue I have is that my beard hair is so thick that I have to use 2-3 of these to get a shave that I think is close enough. That may be my lack of experience/technique or the quality of my shavette. Even at 3 blades per shave that&#x27;s only 10 cents per shave, which is fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find these are too dull for you, which will probably happen eventually, then check out \\&quot;Shaving 101\\&quot; and look for the article \\&quot;Choosing the Right Blade\\&quot;. It should help guide you to find the blade sharpness that is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the epitome of budget blades. I would highly recommend these for anyone new to straight shaving. They are not too sharp, but sharp enough to give you a good shave, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> A necessary evil.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this box so I can refill my beginners straight edge razor.  Derby was not the type that came with my razor but I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Every pass I shave, I need to replace the razor. They cut, scrape and feel awful.  During one session I go through at least two blades.</li>
