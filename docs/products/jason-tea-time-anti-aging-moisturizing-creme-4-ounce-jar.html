            <li>It&#x27;s excellent and you are not paying extra for fancy packaging or perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this creme.</li>
            <li>Maybe it needs more time to work?</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This cream is ok.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Jason&#x27;s Vitamin E cream.  </li>
            <li>That is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Will keep trying to see if it takes more time.</li>
            <li>Regardless of other comments, the smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Fine lotion.  </li>
            <li>but the fragance is too strong in cheap way.</li>
            <li>I love the wonderful smell of this product, but was initially concerned that this would cause my sensitive skin to breakout.</li>
            <li>I use this to supplement my primary moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I got this for a Christmas present from a good friend.</li>
            <li>It is just too heavy for that time of year as warm weather makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li>This is one of those face/body lotions that your skin will LOVE all winter long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Just keep this for the winter months and switch to something much lighter for spring/summer (like the aloe vera version by jason).</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well into my skin.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>, if it is  not broken then don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li>THE MAGAZINE ARTICLE SAID IT WOULD REALLY HELP WITH SAGGING NECK SKIN...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>and it always works well on my older skin.</li>
            <li>Seems better than more expensive creams.</li>
            <li>AND AT SUCH AN ECONOMICAL PRICE.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to live up to it&#x27;s claims to tighten skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used a number of jason products in the past and have found them to be superior to other products in this category.</li>
            <li>Wear this in warm weather and you will be an oil slick!!</li>
            <li>It works so well for me, as I have sensitive hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other expensive brands and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The creme is so subtle and refreshing.  </li>

            <li> Just love this stuff. I have very sensitive skin and it always works well on my older skin. Can;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It works so well for me, as I have sensitive hands.  Makes my facial skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The price of this product is wonderful... It lasts along time and a little goes a long way. I love the wonderful smell of this product, but was initially concerned that this would cause my sensitive skin to breakout. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction to this product. It is moisturizing and I love it. I&#x27;m not so sure how well the anti-aging works for this product, but as a moisturizer it works well.</li>
            <li> I got this for a Christmas present from a good friend. When I ran out, I had to get another jar.  The creme is so subtle and refreshing.  Regardless of other comments, the smell is wonderful.  Most importantly it is effective.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  I have been using it for 3 years!!  While living in Arizona, I noticed the brown spots appearing on my face and when I started using this product, there was a noticeable difference .... absolutely amazing!  The consistency of the creme was lighter than other Jason products.  I also love their Aloe 84% creme.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well. Lots of antioxidants. Great moisturizer. Heals sun damage. Light smell that is pleasant. Highly recommended! Seems better than more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Illinois but since I moved to AZ I have not been able to find it in a store.  I was so happy when I found it on Amazon.  I order 3 at a time.</li>
            <li> This is one of those face/body lotions that your skin will LOVE all winter long. Cold weather will not be able to damage or dry out your face with this on! It is wonderfully soothing, moist, and feels amazing and refreshing all day!! Your skin will have a dewy \\&quot;glow\\&quot; from how wonderfully moisturizing this is! But then spring/summer comes along and EVERYTHING changes. It is just too heavy for that time of year as warm weather makes you sweat more. Wear this in warm weather and you will be an oil slick!! But no worries! Just keep this for the winter months and switch to something much lighter for spring/summer (like the aloe vera version by jason). Your skin will adjust smoothly and will look great all year!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for more than a year now. It absorbs nicely, and moisturizes thoroughly. Does not make face oily, works well all year round (winter and summer)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream on a daily basis for the last 13 years. It&#x27;s excellent and you are not paying extra for fancy packaging or perfume. Just a basic organic face cream that will do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great companion to the Tea Tree Body Wash.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of jason products in the past and have found them to be superior to other products in this category.</li>
            <li> I love this creme. I have dry skin and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. It lasts up to 12 hours. I use it all over my face, eyes, neck and sometimes on my legs and arms. I&#x27;ve tried many other expensive brands and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like that this creme is thick and has natural ingredients.  I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well into my skin.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin since I bought it (3 weeks ago).  Maybe it needs more time to work?</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised in a magazine and ordered it...I have been very pleased with this product and I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing creme is on of the best I have ever use. It works really well. Will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Thick cream which is helpful for my dry skin but the fragance is too strong in cheap way. Jason needs to make this product without any perfume scent. I use this to supplement my primary moisturizer. It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any effect to my skin. Overall, I prefer their Vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li> Fine lotion.  I wish it gave a little shine/glow to the face.  Have only applied it twice so far.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  I love it, I get compliments on my face all the time.  I never try other creams cause this works, if it is  not broken then don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 10+ years now and it is the best moisturizer out there. It is cooling and all the ingredients are amazing for your skin. I will always have Tea Time as my moisturizer. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I READ ABOUT THIS STUFF IN A MAGAZINE AND COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE.  IT REALLY IS GOOD AT FIRMING AND TIGHTENING AGING SKIN.  AND AT SUCH AN ECONOMICAL PRICE.  HOPE AMAZON NEVER STOPS CARRYING IT BECAUSE I PLAN TO KEEP ON USING IT. THE MAGAZINE ARTICLE SAID IT WOULD REALLY HELP WITH SAGGING NECK SKIN...AND IT DOES!! GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all of the great reviews.  I am not sure what product they were talking about.  This cream is ok.  The fragrance is very obnoxious.  I am not normally bothered by the fragrance of products but this cream I am.  I LOVE the Jason&#x27;s Vitamin E cream.  That is my favorite.  I hope I can return this for the cream I prefer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to live up to it&#x27;s claims to tighten skin. Will keep trying to see if it takes more time.</li>
