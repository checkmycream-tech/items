            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I thought with my complexion, I would be able to highlight and contour...</li>
            <li>this palette has many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>love the color</li>
            <li>and I am in LOVE with this concealer,</li>
            <li>This is awesome, I urge all women to try this concealer, goes on smooth and creamy not heavy, I have been highlighting my brows and this is something I would have never attempted.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>Blends very well great for contouring</li>
            <li>however, it has become 1 of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Best same as pictureüëåüèø</li>
            <li>Love the colours.</li>
            <li>This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve used in a long time</li>
            <li>It can rub off easily though because it&#x27;s kinda like a cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend .....</li>
            <li>I can custom blend for undereye circles using all of the shades instead of trying to find the right shade for my skintone, and there are many many skintones for women of color.  </li>
            <li>The blending is perfect for my skin color(medium dark).  </li>
            <li>Blendable and light.</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage you don&#x27;t need to use much</li>
            <li>and it is so smooth</li>
            <li>smooth and the brush that comes with</li>
            <li>The product goes on smoothly with the enclosed brush and I use my beauty blender for even complexion.</li>
            <li>so I want something cheap to play around with.</li>
            <li>I am a 340 in Maybelline Fit Me foundation.</li>
            <li>though my skin look light tone,&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Especially if you don&#x27;t have a concealer that is good for your shade.</li>
            <li>It could last a good while if used moderately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, definitely have better..</li>
            <li>The only down side is it doesn&#x27;t stick quickly so can easily be smudged but so long as you have a good powder to layer on, you get a perfect finish.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for, like to use it to highlight my face!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>all of the shades blend well with my skin which is rare</li>
            <li>I love how creamy it is, covers better than anything else I have, great range of color for dark skinned black women .</li>
            <li>and I have used several popular brands trying to find the right consistency, shade, packaging, etc.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s all good if you let it sit inside or put it in somewhere cold and nice .. !</li>
            <li>And it really gives that full covered look .....</li>
            <li>Its a tiny flat head, soft bristled, brush that is perfect for shaping brows and lining lips.</li>
            <li>I will most likely continuing buying this concealer.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>but it blends real well!</li>
            <li>My favorite part is actually the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>As a woman with dark skin, I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>, this came in a day (or more; I cant really remember) earlier than Amazon said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice concealer, I only use the first and third color for over and under my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It does not feel heavy on my face and the application was surprisingly smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>The colors are great for all types of African American skin tones, and some of the colors blend so well that I wish I could get foundations in the exact same colors.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The concealers are really creamy, so I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li>and it blended very well.</li>
            <li>If you live in a hot climate it may be just a little melted on top from heat ..</li>
            <li>Love the coverage and all the other color choices included in this concealer!</li>
            <li>The first color on the left is an exact match to Sephora&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I use mainly for contouring</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent concealer palette.</li>
            <li>This was the one that worked the very first color was perfect.the last 3 too</li>
            <li>My dark spots is becoming lighter.</li>
            <li>Its oily and its not thick at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to make up</li>
            <li>I have always either gotten my concealers too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>I order the light one and tone it down with darker powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is nice and has a very creamy texture and coverage is great, the dark shade wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought it would be, that&#x27;s the only disappointment.</li>
            <li>The shades are much darker than they look, too dark to use for contouring on my complexion, so my first thought was to return the item</li>
            <li>Where the concealer is completely noticeable.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li>Received this a day early.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using the lightest shade as a concealer and will continue moving towards the right until the palette is empty.</li>
            <li>The first color matched decently with my skin tone, but it was still on the dark side.</li>
            <li>I have very oily and dry skin, it depends on how my skin feels on that day and this concealer isn&#x27;t affected by that.</li>
            <li>The colors are deeply pigmented, so a tiny bit blends out very well.</li>
            <li>For reference I usually wear loreal true match foundation in nut brown C7.</li>
            <li>so I use the lighter ones for highlighting because they are a little too light for my dark skin.</li>
            <li>and i have reviewed other high end concealer palettes</li>
            <li>Not long lasting even when set.</li>

            <li> I love this concealer. Perfect match to my skin tone. Blendable and light.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage you don&#x27;t need to use much and it is so smooth, you don&#x27;t even feel you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> Great product, matches perfectly, will order again</li>
            <li> This product is doing a excellent job. My dark spots is becoming lighter. It takes sometime before you see the results .</li>
            <li> Love it very smooth application stays in place excellent choice will purchase again and it matched perfectly to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> great for women of color, has a glossy tint to it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for, like to use it to highlight my face!</li>
            <li> Love the coverage and all the other color choices included in this concealer! The first color on the left is an exact match to Sephora&#x27;s. I like the fact I get 4 colors for one third the priceüòÑ</li>
            <li> Nice concealer, I only use the first and third color for over and under my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The coverage is great. A little goes a long way. I will be buying this product again. I like the ease of use.</li>
            <li> I thought with my complexion, I would be able to highlight and contour...this product is nice and has a very creamy texture and coverage is great, the dark shade wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought it would be, that&#x27;s the only disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great! Got it earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Amazing concealer. I am very dark so I use the lighter ones for highlighting because they are a little too light for my dark skin. They work great. I love how creamy they are without being too creamy! They don&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin. I have very oily and dry skin, it depends on how my skin feels on that day and this concealer isn&#x27;t affected by that. I will most likely continuing buying this concealer.</li>
            <li> Good contour palette. It blends after a little work.</li>
            <li> This is like Gold to me it&#x27;s perfect I even use it on my legs for some of my scratches and it allows my eyebrow tint to last longer</li>
            <li> I love that this concealer matches my skin tone perfectly. It does not feel heavy on my face and the application was surprisingly smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> Not really a makeup person.. But tried this and it works well</li>
            <li> im not good at using making but im learnng and im happy this palette has many colors to choose from. especally when the seasons change.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for!  The blending is perfect for my skin color(medium dark).  I use mainly for contouring</li>
            <li> Love it love it !!!!!!love the color it match my dark color skin..</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful Colors. I am Brown Skin AA woman and I am in LOVE with this concealer, Really Considering Giving a Reviw of this product on my Face Book Page, It is that good!!! I am a Really skeptical person, but this is one concealer that really hit the nail on the head. I have always either gotten my concealers too dark or too light. AA&#x27;s Skin colors have lots of range so what may work on one person may not work on the next, I am a dark brown, dark mocha girl. Not Darker toned but not Lighter toned either, I am somewhere in the middle. This is awesome, I urge all women to try this concealer, goes on smooth and creamy not heavy, I have been highlighting my brows and this is something I would have never attempted. I have seen this go wrong. Where the concealer is completely noticeable. I am a Lifer!!!</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time. Great price, blended perfectly.</li>
            <li> having use it yet but can&#x27;t wait to try it out I love this product....</li>
            <li> This has got to be by far one of the best concealer palettes ive bought i also have a youtube channel and i have reviewed other high end concealer palettes BUT!! as a woman of color i can honestly say elf hit it on the nail with this one. I use this For blemishes, dark under eye circles, and brow highlighting And this is my 7th purchase i scrape the pan with these...lol</li>
            <li> Love it, my new best friend, muah.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Received it the next day! That has never happened before. The product was exactly what I wanted...I will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> Blends very well great for contouring</li>
            <li> It came in four different dark shades. It covered places that expensive name brand concealers couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Its smaller than I thought it would be but I can&#x27;t complain bc I love it! As having darker skin its hard to find a product that can both conceal, highlight and contour your skin. Even though its a concealer palette and I use it to do all 3 things.</li>
            <li> Very nice, kind of greasy though.</li>
            <li> I have it 4 starts based on quality. This is a good item but my caramel skin is more on the brown side and there&#x27;s tones are on the reddish side.&lt;br /&gt;Since I like e.l.f. products I decided to give it a good rating.</li>
            <li> Every black girl needs to have this. Especially if you don&#x27;t have a concealer that is good for your shade. This gives you variety of options for different skin types. The only down side is it doesn&#x27;t stick quickly so can easily be smudged but so long as you have a good powder to layer on, you get a perfect finish.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PERFECT !!!! It arrived earlier than it said !!! Very nice ..! Good for contorting ... If you live in a hot climate it may be just a little melted on top from heat .. But it&#x27;s all good if you let it sit inside or put it in somewhere cold and nice .. ! It&#x27;s really nice you can blend easily &amp;&amp; everything . Good for contouring ...! I would recommend this to anyone .. They also have different shades ..</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Sunday night and it arrived Thursday morning. I love it! It goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t too heavy. Blends really nicely. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great for contouring, blends easily. Average lasting time, but I use a setting spray and primer, it will stay overnight. Good coverage.</li>
            <li> Nice choices to choose from for coverage.</li>
            <li> The shades are much darker than they look, too dark to use for contouring on my complexion, so my first thought was to return the item but I tried it as an eye shadow and it works great.  The colors are deeply pigmented, so a tiny bit blends out very well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> nice range of colors. smooth and the brush that comes with it is great. coverage is medium buildable, blends well. might have a problem with it sweating off though, but if you set it well and lock it on with elf spray, its wonderful.</li>
            <li> As a woman with dark skin, I absolutely love this product! So far, I&#x27;ve been using the lightest shade as a concealer and will continue moving towards the right until the palette is empty. The product goes on smoothly with the enclosed brush and I use my beauty blender for even complexion. You cannot go wrong with this palette!</li>
            <li> Its oily and its not thick at all.  When you go to blend it , it looks as if you&#x27;ve rubbed it in, the after result of it is a  off white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent concealer palette. I&#x27;m relatively new to make up so I want something cheap to play around with. The concealers are really creamy, so I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it for oily skin. I ordered mine in the deep and I wish I went a shade lighter. The first color matched decently with my skin tone, but it was still on the dark side. The other 3 are way darker than they appear. But I feel that they would be good for contouring. For reference I usually wear loreal true match foundation in nut brown C7.</li>
            <li> I love how creamy it is, covers better than anything else I have, great range of color for dark skinned black women . Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Too dark for concealer. I am a 340 in Maybelline Fit Me foundation. I use this for contouring my cheekbones, nose and jawline.</li>
            <li> Elf products are the best!</li>
            <li> Really great! It can rub off easily though because it&#x27;s kinda like a cream but it blends real well!</li>
            <li> Not long lasting even when set. The colors are great for my skin tone though.</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer. The colors are great for all types of African American skin tones, and some of the colors blend so well that I wish I could get foundations in the exact same colors. My favorite part is actually the brush that comes with it. Its a tiny flat head, soft bristled, brush that is perfect for shaping brows and lining lips. I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact is a little smaller than the average hand and each color pan is about thumb sized. It could last a good while if used moderately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this came in a day (or more; I cant really remember) earlier than Amazon said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> i use this for contouring and it&#x27;s good for that. does take awhile to dry. and also it is cheaper on the e.l.f website. i like the brand though. all of the shades blend well with my skin which is rare</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works.  I can custom blend for undereye circles using all of the shades instead of trying to find the right shade for my skintone, and there are many many skintones for women of color.  One size (shade) does not fit all.  This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve used in a long time and I have used several popular brands trying to find the right consistency, shade, packaging, etc.  Thank you e.l.f. and Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> $2.00 less for same product on my last purchase.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my make-up collection. It concealed my imperfections well. Still learning how to use the concealer fully.  I have always been a fan of ELF products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, definitely have better..I like to use it when I&#x27;m contouring &amp; highlighting</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger...however, it has become 1 of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best ..... It&#x27;s easy to blend ..... And it really gives that full covered look ..... It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This concealer is great for the undereye area, the texture is very creamy smooth and the color range is excellent! I am a medium complexion so I bought the light/medium and the darker pallet to compare them. The under eye area is tender skin so using a creamy concealer is the way to go, flawless.</li>
            <li> Best same as pictureüëåüèø</li>
            <li> Received this a day early. Love the colours. I&#x27;m a mocha brown. It was a bit reddish brown the darkest one, but I used the brown one with it to get the colours I achieved. I pur on my BB cream over the concealer and it blended very well. Will order again~</li>
            <li> I use this for sculpting my brows and it always does the trick .</li>
            <li> This was the one that worked the very first color was perfect.the last 3 too dark.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a woman of color and deep works&lt;br /&gt;Even though my skin look light tone,&lt;br /&gt;So I order the light one and tone it down with darker powder.&lt;br /&gt;However, the darker set was less work .</li>
