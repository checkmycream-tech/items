            <li>I am now am in my 70&#x27;s and have beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Product---Great for oily skin--Have never been able to find a replacement for this product--</li>
            <li>Its still a good product</li>
            <li>Really an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I bought my own, and I can see the difference in my skin clarity and youthfulness.  </li>
            <li>I think they were just being nice</li>
            <li>Love the product and have been using it for years and years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and have found it to be excellent for oily/blemished skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the ingredients and lemon smell as well.</li>
            <li>but the reality is - is that it costs MORE per oz if you buy it this way.</li>
            <li>The prices start at $65 but go up to $79 mostly.</li>
            <li>Use &amp;#34;on top of&amp;#34</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad Amazon carries this product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how quick these products arrived in the mail.  </li>
            <li>and I love how clean it gets my skin!</li>
            <li>I hope to remain beautiful when I&#x27;m 100 years old.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>Best to use if you have oily or acne prones skin due to oil or sweat build up.</li>
            <li>Now I just use it because I love how clean my face feels and it makes shaving easier after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It is a strong exfoliant</li>
            <li>; cleanser already on face with no pressure to reduce abrasiveness and yield effective gentle sloughing.</li>
            <li>Its&lt;br /&gt;not cheap.</li>
            <li>the price is right!</li>
            <li>I worked for many years as a circus clown and used Pernox to keep my face clear of the greasepaint and dirt from the road.  </li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>Great way to do your own exfoliation rather than pay for expensive microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>But worth it.</li>
            <li>This product has no hype, no sex appeal, not even a pretty, colorful bottle.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount on the face cleans pores and creates a great scrub.</li>
            <li>Shipping was accomplished quickly.  </li>
            <li>It feels so refreshing as it deep cleans the pores.</li>
            <li>First - there is a price of 19.95 for a 4oz tube of the scrub.</li>
            <li>The soap is not generally available in stores, so Amazon is a good source.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if I just have good genes or Pernox is part of it, but to keep hearing you look</li>
            <li>more like a cream than the older version which definitely left the face&lt;br /&gt;feeling scrubbed and squeaky</li>
            <li>I have tried Proactive and many other expensive products but this always worked the best.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and that just played havoc with acne.  </li>
            <li>it really works for oily skin.</li>
            <li>yes...it works very well.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your skin thoroughly and tightens the pores.</li>
            <li>ten to twenty years younger does an old man good.</li>
            <li>Other, more Jazzy, types had taken up the space on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Tried so many products only to come back to Pernox.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend &amp;</li>
            <li>give it a high rating</li>
            <li>have used Pernox - an exfoliante - recommended by a dermatologist over 30 years ago - use it faithfully once a week - every one comments on my skin - at 65 years old - no fillers or surgery!</li>
            <li>Wow, I had not really thought about that, but it is true.  </li>
            <li>sure what they did, but the current version has less cleaning ability and&lt;br /&gt;feels</li>
            <li>Its an oldie but a goody that will clear your blemishes.</li>
            <li>I will never be too old for this product even tho I started using it as a kid.  </li>
            <li>old doesn&#x27;t?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pernox all my adult life /</li>
            <li>No other face wash has ever worked as well for my skin.</li>
            <li>WOW, it was like having a facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li>I tried many other products, but next to Pernox they were not effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It apparently went through several owner companies over the years, but only in the&lt;br /&gt;last 2 (two) years or so has it been changed.</li>
            <li>and I think the fact that my skin remains as smooth as it does (and acne free, which frighteningly I can still get in my 50&#x27;s) is attributable at least in part to this soap.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the product and have been using it for years and years. I do think it&#x27;s too expensive, and the manufacturer should reconsider pricing, but...</li>
            <li> I will never be too old for this product even tho I started using it as a kid.  It feels so refreshing as it deep cleans the pores.</li>
            <li> My father used to work for the company that makes Pernox (Westwood) and I have used it since I was a teenager when I actually had acne.  I worked for many years as a circus clown and used Pernox to keep my face clear of the greasepaint and dirt from the road.  Now I just use it because I love how clean my face feels and it makes shaving easier after I get out of the shower.  I&#x27;m 57 and my friends ask me what my \\&quot;beauty secret\\&quot; is.  Not sure if I just have good genes or Pernox is part of it, but to keep hearing you look ten to twenty years younger does an old man good.</li>
            <li> and was disappointed when my &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; was discontinued in local pharmacies and groceries.  I like purchasing this product in quantities of three as I&#x27;ve always got enough before I need to reorder.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without my Pernox for anything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pernox for years.  Expensive, but there simply is no better exfoliating face wash.</li>
            <li> Shipping was accomplished quickly.  The product is as advertised.  I swift, efficient transaction.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I had to go to the dermatologist regularly.  My skin is very oily and that just played havoc with acne.  He recommended Pernox and I guess my skin has gotten use to the product and it continues to be the only thing I can find that lessens the oiliness on  a daily basis.  I continue to use it although I can no longer find it in the drugstores.  I am thankful I can find it online.</li>
            <li> For my oily skin there is not a better scrub. I have been using Pernox for a very long time and it has become an essential for me. It is expensive so I buy it in bulk. It is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have found it to be excellent for oily/blemished skin.  While it may be expensive, buy it in bulk (3 or 6 pack) and check for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have an over active oil gland condition and this product is the only thing that works for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years now and yes...it really works for oily skin. Love the ingredients and lemon smell as well. It&#x27;s a little pricy, but yes...it works very well.</li>
            <li> wish it was still on the market! Great product!</li>
            <li> Pernox scrub is excellent. It acts like a microderm abrasion with a dash of lemon (or lime). It really cleans your skin thoroughly and tightens the pores. Definately a deep cleanser. Best to use if you have oily or acne prones skin due to oil or sweat build up. I&#x27;ve used it for years off/on it used to be impossible to get but now.... with internet it&#x27;s easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, that being said, I have an issue about how it&#x27;s sold here. First - there is a price of 19.95 for a 4oz tube of the scrub. But, there is also a \\&quot;3 PACK\\&quot; deal. It consists of one bottle - 5oz lotion scrub, one 2oz tube of scrub, &amp; one 4oz tube of scrub - totalling 11oz of the product. It claims to be a deal but the reality is - is that it costs MORE per oz if you buy it this way. The prices start at $65 but go up to $79 mostly. If you purchase this \\&quot;deal\\&quot; you will be paying around $23 per 4oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should just buy the 4oz tubes individually or order three of those. Then you will only pay $20 per 4oz&#x27;s! You&#x27;ll get 12oz for $60 not 11oz for $65 to $80!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Used this for over about 25 years...Really hard to find Pernox now.  Highly recommend &amp; the price is right!</li>
            <li> Have used this product twice day for decades. Use &amp;#34;on top of&amp;#34; cleanser already on face with no pressure to reduce abrasiveness and yield effective gentle sloughing. Seems to change manufacturer over the years and is currently unavailable to my knowledge. Hope another company produces it soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Great way to do your own exfoliation rather than pay for expensive microdermabrasion.  A bit expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has been this product for over 30 years for his face. I tried once on my face by my face is dry and did not work well well.</li>
            <li> At age 15 I went to see a dermatologist about acne.  What 15 yr. old doesn&#x27;t?  He prescribed Pernox which I used until I could no longer find it in the drug store.  Other, more Jazzy, types had taken up the space on the shelf.  This product has no hype, no sex appeal, not even a pretty, colorful bottle. I tried many other products, but next to Pernox they were not effective.  When I did find it again I bought the entire shipment the store had and started to buy from the manufacturer.  Now I am 61 and I have very few wrinkles and my acne, which persists even now, is under control.  I now realize I have been giving myself dermabrasion all these years as well!</li>
            <li> The title says it all. Its an oldie but a goody that will clear your blemishes. What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Pernox is the best for your skin!  Cleans away blemishes and keeps them away.  You can use it on your back, neck, face, anywhere your skin is extra oily.</li>
            <li> I started using Pernox back in middle school. I&#x27;m almost 30 and still use it to this day. No other face wash has ever worked as well for my skin. I have tried Proactive and many other expensive products but this always worked the best. Some pharmacies used to carry it, but it&#x27;s been a decade since I&#x27;ve found it in a store. I&#x27;m really glad Amazon carries this product. The exfoliant may be a bit harsh for those with sensitive skin but I personally have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product---Great for oily skin--Have never been able to find a replacement for this product--Have used it exclusively for years</li>
            <li> have used Pernox - an exfoliante - recommended by a dermatologist over 30 years ago - use it faithfully once a week - every one comments on my skin - at 65 years old - no fillers or surgery!</li>
            <li> Was visiting a friend and used this scrub in their shower.  WOW, it was like having a facial at a spa.  I bought my own, and I can see the difference in my skin clarity and youthfulness.  Really an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for 34 years. Tried so many products only to come back to Pernox. I have oily skin. I could never find a product that could remove the oil without drying it out. I&#x27;m 54. I am told I look late 30&#x27;s. I think they were just being nice but I&#x27;ll take the compliment. I think it would work for all skin types. Give it a try. A bit pricey. But worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and now getting my teenagers to use it also.  Just a small amount on the face cleans pores and creates a great scrub.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pernox since I was in my 20&#x27;s. It was recommended by a dermatologist.  I have used it since.  I am now am in my 70&#x27;s and have beautiful skin.  The product has become increasingly difficult to come by in pharmacies.  I hope to remain beautiful when I&#x27;m 100 years old.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product! Been using it for 15 years plus on my oily, olive skin.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I will bye this from here from now on&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;and recomend it to my friends&lt;br /&gt;I give it a high rating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pernox all my adult life / about 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It apparently went through several owner companies over the years, but only in the&lt;br /&gt;last 2 (two) years or so has it been changed. Its still a good product but it used&lt;br /&gt;to be an EXCELLENT product before they changed its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what they did, but the current version has less cleaning ability and&lt;br /&gt;feels more like a cream than the older version which definitely left the face&lt;br /&gt;feeling scrubbed and squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I granted it a 4 star now... rather than the 5 star I used to give it. In fact,&lt;br /&gt;I might even consider it only a 3.5 star now when you consider the cost. Its&lt;br /&gt;not cheap. I didn&#x27;t mind the cost when it was a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this or a product similar to it for over 40 years.  Wow, I had not really thought about that, but it is true.  1970&#x27;s teen with acne, soap recommended by the dermatologist, made a big difference.  Every time I run out and try a different product, I am always disappointed and go back to this.  The soap is not generally available in stores, so Amazon is a good source.  It is a strong exfoliant and I think the fact that my skin remains as smooth as it does (and acne free, which frighteningly I can still get in my 50&#x27;s) is attributable at least in part to this soap.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how quick these products arrived in the mail.  The price is pretty good too.  This product is a little pricey but I have been using it for years and I love how clean it gets my skin!</li>
