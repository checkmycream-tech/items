            <li>I attempted exercise with my crutches but experienced chaffing and soreness.</li>

            <li>Loved the comfort.</li>
            <li>The ability to cool or warm them makes them especially appealing.  </li>
            <li>very very pleased I don&#x27;t have sore underarms anymore[[ASIN</li>
            <li>The gel crutch pads are very worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>so more people could en joy</li>
            <li>Very comfortable!</li>
            <li>I broke my ankle and was facing two months on crutches and wanted to make them more comfortable - these were a perfect choice.  </li>
            <li>Another must have if you are on crutches more than a week!</li>
            <li>Glad I found this!  </li>
            <li>did find them &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; but it was better to have them on than not at all!</li>
            <li>pads work great and easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li>These gel Crutch-Mates are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been on crutches for over 30 years now and these are absolutely the best arm pads ever made!!!</li>
            <li>They provide nice padding and I have had no problems with them.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel that cushy, but they really work!</li>
            <li>As others noted, it is best to slip them over your normal pads.  </li>
            <li>These were, however, very easy to stretch over the existing underarm pads and they made an immediate noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>The gel filled crutch covers are good.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best underarm crutch pad I have ever come across.  </li>
            <li>these were a dream come true !!</li>
            <li>When we first got them they felt great</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>They were very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This product has provided him a lot more comfort</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a big deal at all since they are so wonderful.</li>
            <li>These worked great and not so much because of the gel</li>
            <li>You are better off getting a pair of gloves for the longer stretches that you have to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SOOOOO comfortable under your arms!</li>
            <li>made using crutches better.</li>
            <li>My orthopaedic surgeon looked at them on a recent visit and was very impressed.</li>
            <li>I have been using these elasto-gel pads on my crutches for so many years I&#x27;ve lost count.  </li>
            <li>Works great really adds comfort</li>
            <li>Ok so I broke my leg and was on crutches for 6 weeks, and the crutches were hurting after the 1st week.</li>
            <li>It does give you more padding when you are using the crutches.</li>
            <li>The 2 covers give you more support under the arms.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 5th week of walking with the Crutch Mate Underarm Gel Pads and I have one more week to go.</li>
            <li>More an operator malfunction than a product deficiency.  </li>
            <li>have four more</li>
            <li>his physical therapist was impressed with them..</li>
            <li>I think some of those that have the fuzzy material would feel better under my arms.</li>
            <li>felt the price was okay for these two pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company logo ad is prominent</li>
            <li>awesom :-)</li>
            <li>Padding on the sides protects my ribs and the top protects the armpits.</li>
            <li>Way better than the rubber crutches come with</li>
            <li>I have recommended them to many people - including to my orthopedic surgeon.</li>
            <li>Love these Gel Pads.</li>
            <li>So, these were the next best solution I could find for underarm pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hand grip pads that cAme with the crutches work better.  </li>
            <li>Made the underarm crutch so much more comfortable!  </li>
            <li>Having used crutches many times before, I was dreading the underarm rubbing and chaffing .</li>
            <li>I covered it with magic marker, but it still shone through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on crutches for 5 months this time and am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I bought these just to test it out when I recently broke my ankle and was so happy I did!  </li>
            <li>The gel pads are much better.</li>
            <li>Glad I came to amazon and found these.</li>
            <li>I know you are not supposed to put your body weight on the top of the crutches, in your armpits.  </li>
            <li>used it for almost a month or more after knee surgery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on crutches for 25 yrs &amp; haven&#x27;t found better yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found them.</li>
            <li>needed something to help with the pain of the crutches under his arms and these sure alleviated that</li>
            <li>Although I am not a fan of the logo on both sides of the tops either, it&#x27;s under my arms most of the time</li>
            <li>If you have no alternative - guess its better than no padding on crutches.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who will be on crutches for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price ! !</li>
            <li>Easy to apply to the crutch top, nd to remove for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The fabric on top is some type of nylon that glides over your clothing and makes it even more comfortable</li>
            <li>Would recommend buying some kind of padding for extended use and these gel ones were nice and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>They work just fine and helped me get more corfortable as I walked.  </li>
            <li>These pads are the most comfortable that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>These pads make using crutches much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard they may be more comfortable, but I don&#x27;t have experience with them.</li>
            <li>The gel made using my crutches a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wish they were more readily available</li>
            <li>It makes using the crutches more comfortable.</li>
            <li>My crutches were practically bruising my ribs/armpits, and these made them much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use a prosthesis,I use crutches so I&#x27;m always looking for products that may make using crutches easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are a lot more comfortable , I don&#x27;t get sores under my arms.</li>
            <li>The fit is slimmer and more</li>
            <li>More comfortable to rest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The under arm gel crutch supports were shipped very quickly and make it extremely more comfortable while walking with crutches.  </li>
            <li>These underarm crutch pads are very very comfortable and are far superior to the hand pads also produced by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it feels like &amp;#34;clouds&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;pillows&amp;#34; they are just better than the original padding.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>These were easy to install with Velcro to fasten them in place.  </li>
            <li>The material also doesn&#x27;t grab your clothes and they slide easily making them easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on and help with comfort.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on and the strong velcro closures ensures they will not slip off.  </li>
            <li>so I put them OVER the new rubber for a very nice comfortable fit</li>
            <li>The best product out there, hands down.</li>
            <li>The crutch-mates provide excellent protection and padding with less bulk so they are also a bit cooler than rubber crutch pads.</li>
            <li>but if you can overlook it, the gel pads made a huge difference on the crutches.</li>
            <li>Why the huge advert on the side?  </li>
            <li>Huge fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes a huge deference</li>
            <li>and it was a huge improvement over the stock pad.  </li>
            <li>these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product is so comfortable I can use my crutches all day and not have any pain or discomfort in my pits.  </li>
            <li>The smooth and friction free material does not grab your skin or clothes or allow shaffing like everything else I tried.  </li>
            <li>This was so comfortable for my underarms.</li>
            <li>If this does happen within the warranty time period (1 year warranty) contact the company, as they are fantastic to deal with and</li>
            <li>The jell padding made it so it was comfortable to use crutches.</li>
            <li>These crutch pads are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This was a great product and my only regret was that I didn&#x27;t purchase the gel pad for my hand holds.</li>
            <li>I would expect to see this on a promotional free item not one I paid this amount of money for.</li>
            <li>It was beyond comfortable.</li>
            <li>They have a smooth finish to them, so they don&#x27;t catch on your clothes and hence your clothes don&#x27;t rub against your skin.</li>
            <li>They are so comfortable and save your hands and armpits from all the pressure of your body weight.  </li>
            <li>I had to take the pads that came with my crutches off to comfortably fit these on my crutches, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Installing was super easy with the velcro.</li>
            <li>They were super easy to install.  </li>
            <li>But, I did not remove the original crutch &amp;#34;cushion.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $24!</li>
            <li>It was a god send esp how my arms ached by using the original pads.</li>
            <li>I ended up taking off the original hand grip pad that came with the crutch and then put the gel hand grip pad on.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to have a lot more support from the Elasto-Gel, and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference!  </li>
            <li>The original pads would catch on my bra and clothing.  </li>
            <li>He told me that they were well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the original hand grips.  </li>
            <li>Really made my walking so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They really save your armpits and make crutching around much more bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found that to be true at all.</li>
            <li>Very well pleased</li>
            <li>instructions say they can be cooled or heated, however i found that without doing anything they have a somewhat cool feel to them.</li>
            <li>He says it makes it much softer and comfortable for him!</li>
            <li>I even wear a backpack full of weights and do laps around my neighborhood.</li>
            <li>and I want to keep myself in good physical condition for when I am returned to full weight bearing.</li>
            <li>These gel handles worked well and are a quick fix without having to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>then the gel underneath though the gel is super cushiony.</li>
            <li>But my arms got sore really quick.  </li>
            <li>The quality is top notch, so I would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were no installation instructions, so you had to guess they go on top of the normal pads.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it if you&#x27;re going to be on crutches for awhile.</li>
            <li>hoped.&lt;br /&gt;The Crutch-Mate underarm pads are well worth the price and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Definitely more comfortable than standard pads or wrapped cloth/etc.</li>
            <li>It was worth it.</li>
            <li>Although they were used for only a week, the pads held up nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be worth considering forearm crutches as an alternative to underarm crutches.  </li>
            <li>The pads are comfortable and fit well over the old shoulder pads.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>They were much more comfortable than the standard crutch pads.  </li>
            <li>They definitely make it much more comfortable on your underarms.</li>
            <li>They are well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It honestly feels the same as the cushion my crutches came with.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about these.</li>
            <li>its well worth the money</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>These are so much more comfortable than the regular pads.  </li>
            <li>They are well worth their cost</li>
            <li>But worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but they are well worth it</li>
            <li>When it is hot outside, the gel is much better!  </li>
            <li>First time on crutches at 55yrs old and what a difference these gel pads have made - Far more comfortable!</li>
            <li>I had bought a repair kit for my crutches right before this purchase.</li>
            <li>I put the pads on and they ripped right away.</li>
            <li>These worked well, though they fit nicely on one pair of crutches while they weren&#x27;t quite big enough to fit over the pads of another pair.  </li>
            <li>other issue is the price...might have rated it higher if it was an exceptional value, which it is not.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for about 2 months and they are a lot nicer than the traditional foam pads at the top of the crutch.  </li>
            <li>Though most weight should rest on the handles, it is a given that you will need to shift a lot of weight occasionally to your arms.</li>
            <li>They really work!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It might be more acceptable if it was only on one side of each pad.</li>
            <li>they stay on the crutches very well!</li>
            <li>These gave him relief and me too not as much complaining!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too hot under my arm.</li>
            <li>I could not get these to go over the pads that came with the crutches, so I didn&#x27;t use them at first.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to be on a scooter, because I&#x27;ve seen how funny people look on those things.</li>
            <li>you just have to be careful of what kind of shirt</li>
            <li>The only thing better is sheep&#x27;s fur.  </li>
            <li>Wool gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li>These gel pads were an absolute Godsend!</li>
            <li>If i&#x27;m ever non weight bearing again, this will be my first purchase.</li>
            <li>Really an armpit saver!  </li>
            <li>Much better than regular arm covers.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my 55+ years of life, I am faced with spending 8 weeks on crutches.  </li>
            <li>I am a fit 31 year old.</li>
            <li>I thought they was a bit pricy at first</li>
            <li>I have enough discomfort while I heal to worry about adding more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to replace my first set of tops until about 18 months of full-time use.  </li>
            <li>My only caution is that the fabric is very smooth and if you&#x27;re crutching too fast, it can slip out from underneath your arm.  </li>
            <li>After this disappointment, I ordered Crutch Remedy cushions which didn&#x27;t slip and provided great cushioning of armpit and hand grips (make sure you have aluminum crutches with wing nuts at the hand grips).</li>
            <li>They make the crutches so top heavy, they fall over much more frequently than without them.  </li>
            <li>They are not a big and bulky as some of the other ones that I was looking into getting her, so the adjustment to using these was great.</li>
            <li>These gel pads certainly are more comfortable than the ones that usually come with the crutches.</li>
            <li>; i installed the Crutch-Mates *on top* of new, standard crutch under-arm</li>
            <li>I have been non weight bearing in the past and have tried other products, this worked the best.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you are sleeveless material is comfortable on skin does not create much friction.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>Really helped my son&#x27;s arms when he was on crutches for 6 weeks....would recommend them...</li>
            <li>I really hurt myself yesterday when one fell on my injured foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will honor the warranty in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They really help cushion my underarms.</li>
            <li>A must have if you spend much time on crutches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt my underarms and ribs quite as much.</li>
            <li>The underarm gel pads worked really well.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>After about 2 1/2 months though they became encrusted with sweat and deodorant though and were ready to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>These gel pads really have prevented the problem.</li>
            <li>Additionally, they really help prevent injury to the brachial plexus (bundle of nerves that supply the forearm and hand)</li>
            <li>This really helped me get around after my ankle operation.  </li>
            <li>Made my life that much easier during recovery</li>
            <li>/&gt;These tops are very slippery, AND padded.</li>
            <li>Really made my daughters lengthy use of crutches tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I would&#x27;ve had these all along.</li>
            <li>It really saves your ribs.</li>
            <li>But even with some rubber padding on the shoulders of the crutches, I was still acutely sore in my armpits after just a few days.  </li>
            <li>Because my crutch use is nearly done, I didn&#x27;t bother to try any other versions, but I suspect more cushion-y versions would be better, perhaps the lambswool or extra foam.</li>
            <li>They are a bit more top heavy when propping up against the wall, but as long as they are relatively straight</li>
            <li>I have been on crutches different times and got calloused skin from the original latex covers.  </li>
            <li>I went back to the original hand grips.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive these after suffering through two weeks of underarm-torture with regular crutch pads.  </li>
            <li>We had tried many other types to relieve under the arm pressure.</li>
            <li>Mine have lasted just fine and show no signs of wear, but I can&#x27;t comment on longevity long term.</li>
            <li>Only negatives with these pads are it&#x27;s price, that it doesn&#x27;t include the hand-pads, and that they are heavy and add a bit of weight to the crutches; otherwise, these gel pads are much more comfortable and padded than with fabric ones.</li>
            <li>A little better than the stock one but not by much.</li>
            <li>I left my original crutch covers on and just put the new padded covers over them.</li>
            <li>These gel cushions made such a huge difference as far as comfort goes.  </li>
            <li>I rate these gel pads only 3 stars because they offer only slightly better cushioning than rubber</li>
            <li>They do not wear out as quickly as the regular rubber.  </li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone faced with having to use crutches for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li>I found these and thought that surely they will help a little.</li>
            <li>WOW !!</li>
            <li>Better than the pads that came with my crutches but still leaving my sides a little irritated.</li>
            <li>perfect for disney world or any other extra long walking and keeps you cool unlike the ordinary rubber ones</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable than the standard hard rubber underarm pad.  </li>
            <li>These really helped with my under-arm pain caused by the old crutch pads.</li>
            <li>The gel is much nicer than the old rubber.</li>
            <li>However, the heaviest of the gel makes my crutches really top heavy</li>
            <li>The Velcro bottom barely touched but it fit snugged enough not to move around.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to those who need to be on crutches for more than a few days.</li>
            <li>and they make crutches noticibly top heavy.</li>
            <li>and she never complained about pain after that.  </li>
            <li>I lost my right leg above the knee 24 years ago</li>
            <li>One cushion fit, the other did not.</li>
            <li>A summer on crutches was no fun, but I highly recommend these affordable and comfortable gel pads for your crutches.</li>
            <li>This new pad allowed slippage between it and my shirts.  </li>
            <li>and they look and act as they did when new.  </li>
            <li>I live on crutches.</li>
            <li>Not too vexed to spend thirty bucks on a new pair though.  </li>
            <li>I would not waste my money!</li>
            <li>We first bought these several years ago for my husband when he broke his leg and had to be on crutches for six weeks.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews I was really excited to get these.</li>
            <li>This was my first time on crutches and fromt he moment I left the doctors office</li>
            <li>For the first week after foot surgery I used the standard issue crutches with the gray rubber pads on the underarm part.</li>
            <li>No more bruising and able to &amp;#34;crutch&amp;#34; in comfort.</li>
            <li>I added the new gel pads directly over my stock pads.</li>
            <li>I prefer these over the regular crutch pad still in place underneath, but that leaves the entire crutch very top heavy.</li>
            <li>Would by them again and certainly recommend them to any one on standard crutches.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t give five stars only because I wish they had a little more padding or gel to them.</li>
            <li>Really, it is a great product and you wont be unhappy with it.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the Crutch-Mate(tm) underarm pads state, &amp;#34;May remove old arm cover&lt;</li>
            <li>I just installed these over the old ones.  </li>
            <li>I really think that these should be Standard Issue on ALL Crutches!!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I would have made it this far without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li>I read the reviews prior to purchase, I really thought that these would help.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 yr old father of two</li>
            <li>I am 39 years old and I am about 150lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As soon as I received these I put them on my 21yr old daughters crutches</li>
            <li>Old crutch pads would sort of grip to surfaces.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely made an instant difference for my underarms.</li>
            <li>Not only are they tiring but your ribs get very sore if you walk a lot.  </li>
            <li>Makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE in the world as far as comfort.</li>
            <li>The combination of the gel displacement with the soft and stretchy outer material makes these a must have.  </li>
            <li>They were completely healed in a month &amp; haven&#x27;t returned.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to be on crutches for more than a few days, I definitely recommend investing in some of these!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; was seriously injured on both knees and has been on crutches for almost 6 months and will most likely need to be on them for a few more months at least; these gel pads have made such a huge difference for him!</li>
            <li>These will last about 6 months with daily consistent use.</li>
            <li>The gel hand grip pads were not thick enough</li>
            <li>Helps some but with long term use I still have very sore arms/sides.</li>
            <li>They help at first but do not last long.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very comfy, however I do not like having such vivid advertising printed over the entire surface front and back.</li>
            <li>These little gel pads are worth their weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I would HIGHLY recommend getting this or another crutch cover no matter how long you have to be on them.</li>
            <li>My main objection is that they are black with large white lettering with company product name and company......</li>
            <li>wanted to replace the old armpit rubber; these are very nic and soft(maybe a little too soft)</li>
            <li>If going up and down stairs by yourself using the 2 crutches under one arm, they can be a bit wide for shorter people, but are quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>Shame, since they are comfortable, but using crutches is bad enough without becoming a walking billboard.</li>
            <li>They do make the top of the crutches a little heavy</li>
            <li>I took off the original pads and put these on and have had no more pain!  </li>
            <li>The hand pieces really don&#x27;t work well and not worth buying.  </li>
            <li>It is a good thing it is black as at least I can try to black it out with a felt tip pen</li>
            <li>I spent so long just trying to get them on my crutches only to find out that they really did not work well.  </li>

            <li> very very pleased I don&#x27;t have sore underarms anymore[[ASIN</li>
            <li> The gel crutch pads are very worthwhile.  </li>

            <li> Very comfortable!</li>
            <li> I broke my ankle and was facing two months on crutches and wanted to make them more comfortable - these were a perfect choice.  </li>
            <li> Another must have if you are on crutches more than a week!</li>
            <li> Glad I found this!  </li>
            <li> did find them &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; but it was better to have them on than not at all!</li>
            <li> pads work great and easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li> These gel Crutch-Mates are amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been on crutches for over 30 years now and these are absolutely the best arm pads ever made!!!</li>
            <li> They provide nice padding and I have had no problems with them.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel that cushy, but they really work!</li>
            <li> As others noted, it is best to slip them over your normal pads.  </li>
            <li> These were, however, very easy to stretch over the existing underarm pads and they made an immediate noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> The gel filled crutch covers are good.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best underarm crutch pad I have ever come across.  </li>
            <li> these were a dream come true !!</li>
            <li> When we first got them they felt great</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> They were very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product has provided him a lot more comfort</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a big deal at all since they are so wonderful.</li>
            <li> These worked great and not so much because of the gel</li>
            <li> You are better off getting a pair of gloves for the longer stretches that you have to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SOOOOO comfortable under your arms!</li>
            <li> made using crutches better.</li>
            <li> My orthopaedic surgeon looked at them on a recent visit and was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have been using these elasto-gel pads on my crutches for so many years I&#x27;ve lost count.  </li>
            <li> Works great really adds comfort</li>
            <li> Ok so I broke my leg and was on crutches for 6 weeks, and the crutches were hurting after the 1st week.</li>
            <li> It does give you more padding when you are using the crutches.</li>
            <li> The 2 covers give you more support under the arms.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 5th week of walking with the Crutch Mate Underarm Gel Pads and I have one more week to go.</li>
            <li> More an operator malfunction than a product deficiency.  </li>
            <li> have four more</li>
            <li> his physical therapist was impressed with them..</li>
            <li> I think some of those that have the fuzzy material would feel better under my arms.</li>
            <li> felt the price was okay for these two pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company logo ad is prominent</li>
            <li> awesom :-)</li>
            <li> Padding on the sides protects my ribs and the top protects the armpits.</li>
            <li> Way better than the rubber crutches come with</li>
            <li> I have recommended them to many people - including to my orthopedic surgeon.</li>
            <li> Love these Gel Pads.</li>
            <li> So, these were the next best solution I could find for underarm pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hand grip pads that cAme with the crutches work better.  </li>
            <li> Made the underarm crutch so much more comfortable!  </li>
            <li> Having used crutches many times before, I was dreading the underarm rubbing and chaffing .</li>
            <li> I covered it with magic marker, but it still shone through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on crutches for 5 months this time and am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these just to test it out when I recently broke my ankle and was so happy I did!  </li>
            <li> The gel pads are much better.</li>
            <li> Glad I came to amazon and found these.</li>
            <li> I know you are not supposed to put your body weight on the top of the crutches, in your armpits.  </li>
            <li> used it for almost a month or more after knee surgery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on crutches for 25 yrs &amp; haven&#x27;t found better yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found them.</li>
            <li> needed something to help with the pain of the crutches under his arms and these sure alleviated that</li>
            <li> Although I am not a fan of the logo on both sides of the tops either, it&#x27;s under my arms most of the time</li>
            <li> If you have no alternative - guess its better than no padding on crutches.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who will be on crutches for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> well worth the price ! !</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to the crutch top, nd to remove for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The fabric on top is some type of nylon that glides over your clothing and makes it even more comfortable</li>
            <li> Would recommend buying some kind of padding for extended use and these gel ones were nice and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> They work just fine and helped me get more corfortable as I walked.  </li>
            <li> These pads are the most comfortable that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These pads make using crutches much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard they may be more comfortable, but I don&#x27;t have experience with them.</li>
            <li> The gel made using my crutches a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wish they were more readily available</li>
            <li> It makes using the crutches more comfortable.</li>
            <li> My crutches were practically bruising my ribs/armpits, and these made them much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use a prosthesis,I use crutches so I&#x27;m always looking for products that may make using crutches easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> They are a lot more comfortable , I don&#x27;t get sores under my arms.</li>
            <li> The fit is slimmer and more</li>
            <li> More comfortable to rest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The under arm gel crutch supports were shipped very quickly and make it extremely more comfortable while walking with crutches.  </li>
            <li> These underarm crutch pads are very very comfortable and are far superior to the hand pads also produced by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it feels like &amp;#34;clouds&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;pillows&amp;#34; they are just better than the original padding.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> These were easy to install with Velcro to fasten them in place.  </li>
            <li> The material also doesn&#x27;t grab your clothes and they slide easily making them easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on and help with comfort.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on and the strong velcro closures ensures they will not slip off.  </li>
            <li> so I put them OVER the new rubber for a very nice comfortable fit</li>
            <li> The best product out there, hands down.</li>
            <li> The crutch-mates provide excellent protection and padding with less bulk so they are also a bit cooler than rubber crutch pads.</li>
            <li> but if you can overlook it, the gel pads made a huge difference on the crutches.</li>
            <li> Why the huge advert on the side?  </li>
            <li> Huge fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes a huge deference</li>
            <li> and it was a huge improvement over the stock pad.  </li>
            <li> these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product is so comfortable I can use my crutches all day and not have any pain or discomfort in my pits.  </li>
            <li> The smooth and friction free material does not grab your skin or clothes or allow shaffing like everything else I tried.  </li>
            <li> This was so comfortable for my underarms.</li>
            <li> If this does happen within the warranty time period (1 year warranty) contact the company, as they are fantastic to deal with and</li>
            <li> The jell padding made it so it was comfortable to use crutches.</li>
            <li> These crutch pads are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This was a great product and my only regret was that I didn&#x27;t purchase the gel pad for my hand holds.</li>
            <li> I would expect to see this on a promotional free item not one I paid this amount of money for.</li>
            <li> It was beyond comfortable.</li>
            <li> They have a smooth finish to them, so they don&#x27;t catch on your clothes and hence your clothes don&#x27;t rub against your skin.</li>
            <li> They are so comfortable and save your hands and armpits from all the pressure of your body weight.  </li>
            <li> I had to take the pads that came with my crutches off to comfortably fit these on my crutches, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Installing was super easy with the velcro.</li>
            <li> They were super easy to install.  </li>
            <li> But, I did not remove the original crutch &amp;#34;cushion.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Well worth the $24!</li>
            <li> It was a god send esp how my arms ached by using the original pads.</li>
            <li> I ended up taking off the original hand grip pad that came with the crutch and then put the gel hand grip pad on.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to have a lot more support from the Elasto-Gel, and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference!  </li>
            <li> The original pads would catch on my bra and clothing.  </li>
            <li> He told me that they were well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the original hand grips.  </li>
            <li> Really made my walking so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> They really save your armpits and make crutching around much more bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found that to be true at all.</li>
            <li> Very well pleased</li>
            <li> instructions say they can be cooled or heated, however i found that without doing anything they have a somewhat cool feel to them.</li>
            <li> He says it makes it much softer and comfortable for him!</li>
            <li> I even wear a backpack full of weights and do laps around my neighborhood.</li>
            <li> and I want to keep myself in good physical condition for when I am returned to full weight bearing.</li>
            <li> These gel handles worked well and are a quick fix without having to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> then the gel underneath though the gel is super cushiony.</li>
            <li> But my arms got sore really quick.  </li>
            <li> The quality is top notch, so I would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were no installation instructions, so you had to guess they go on top of the normal pads.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it if you&#x27;re going to be on crutches for awhile.</li>
            <li> hoped.&lt;br /&gt;The Crutch-Mate underarm pads are well worth the price and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Definitely more comfortable than standard pads or wrapped cloth/etc.</li>
            <li> It was worth it.</li>
            <li> Although they were used for only a week, the pads held up nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be worth considering forearm crutches as an alternative to underarm crutches.  </li>
            <li> The pads are comfortable and fit well over the old shoulder pads.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> They were much more comfortable than the standard crutch pads.  </li>
            <li> They definitely make it much more comfortable on your underarms.</li>
            <li> They are well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It honestly feels the same as the cushion my crutches came with.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about these.</li>
            <li> its well worth the money</li>
            <li> but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> These are so much more comfortable than the regular pads.  </li>
            <li> They are well worth their cost</li>
            <li> But worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but they are well worth it</li>
            <li> When it is hot outside, the gel is much better!  </li>
            <li> First time on crutches at 55yrs old and what a difference these gel pads have made - Far more comfortable!</li>
            <li> I had bought a repair kit for my crutches right before this purchase.</li>
            <li> I put the pads on and they ripped right away.</li>
            <li> These worked well, though they fit nicely on one pair of crutches while they weren&#x27;t quite big enough to fit over the pads of another pair.  </li>
            <li> other issue is the price...might have rated it higher if it was an exceptional value, which it is not.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for about 2 months and they are a lot nicer than the traditional foam pads at the top of the crutch.  </li>
            <li> Though most weight should rest on the handles, it is a given that you will need to shift a lot of weight occasionally to your arms.</li>
            <li> They really work!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It might be more acceptable if it was only on one side of each pad.</li>
            <li> they stay on the crutches very well!</li>
            <li> These gave him relief and me too not as much complaining!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too hot under my arm.</li>
            <li> I could not get these to go over the pads that came with the crutches, so I didn&#x27;t use them at first.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to be on a scooter, because I&#x27;ve seen how funny people look on those things.</li>
            <li> you just have to be careful of what kind of shirt</li>
            <li> The only thing better is sheep&#x27;s fur.  </li>
            <li> Wool gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li> These gel pads were an absolute Godsend!</li>
            <li> If i&#x27;m ever non weight bearing again, this will be my first purchase.</li>
            <li> Really an armpit saver!  </li>
            <li> Much better than regular arm covers.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my 55+ years of life, I am faced with spending 8 weeks on crutches.  </li>
            <li> I am a fit 31 year old.</li>
            <li> I thought they was a bit pricy at first</li>
            <li> I have enough discomfort while I heal to worry about adding more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to replace my first set of tops until about 18 months of full-time use.  </li>
            <li> My only caution is that the fabric is very smooth and if you&#x27;re crutching too fast, it can slip out from underneath your arm.  </li>
            <li> After this disappointment, I ordered Crutch Remedy cushions which didn&#x27;t slip and provided great cushioning of armpit and hand grips (make sure you have aluminum crutches with wing nuts at the hand grips).</li>
            <li> They make the crutches so top heavy, they fall over much more frequently than without them.  </li>
            <li> They are not a big and bulky as some of the other ones that I was looking into getting her, so the adjustment to using these was great.</li>
            <li> These gel pads certainly are more comfortable than the ones that usually come with the crutches.</li>
            <li> ; i installed the Crutch-Mates *on top* of new, standard crutch under-arm</li>
            <li> I have been non weight bearing in the past and have tried other products, this worked the best.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you are sleeveless material is comfortable on skin does not create much friction.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> Really helped my son&#x27;s arms when he was on crutches for 6 weeks....would recommend them...</li>
            <li> I really hurt myself yesterday when one fell on my injured foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will honor the warranty in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They really help cushion my underarms.</li>
            <li> A must have if you spend much time on crutches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my underarms and ribs quite as much.</li>
            <li> The underarm gel pads worked really well.</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> After about 2 1/2 months though they became encrusted with sweat and deodorant though and were ready to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> These gel pads really have prevented the problem.</li>
            <li> Additionally, they really help prevent injury to the brachial plexus (bundle of nerves that supply the forearm and hand)</li>
            <li> This really helped me get around after my ankle operation.  </li>
            <li> Made my life that much easier during recovery</li>
            <li> /&gt;These tops are very slippery, AND padded.</li>
            <li> Really made my daughters lengthy use of crutches tolerable.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I would&#x27;ve had these all along.</li>
            <li> It really saves your ribs.</li>
            <li> But even with some rubber padding on the shoulders of the crutches, I was still acutely sore in my armpits after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Because my crutch use is nearly done, I didn&#x27;t bother to try any other versions, but I suspect more cushion-y versions would be better, perhaps the lambswool or extra foam.</li>
            <li> They are a bit more top heavy when propping up against the wall, but as long as they are relatively straight</li>
            <li> I have been on crutches different times and got calloused skin from the original latex covers.  </li>
            <li> I went back to the original hand grips.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these after suffering through two weeks of underarm-torture with regular crutch pads.  </li>
            <li> We had tried many other types to relieve under the arm pressure.</li>
            <li> Mine have lasted just fine and show no signs of wear, but I can&#x27;t comment on longevity long term.</li>
            <li> Only negatives with these pads are it&#x27;s price, that it doesn&#x27;t include the hand-pads, and that they are heavy and add a bit of weight to the crutches; otherwise, these gel pads are much more comfortable and padded than with fabric ones.</li>
            <li> A little better than the stock one but not by much.</li>
            <li> I left my original crutch covers on and just put the new padded covers over them.</li>
            <li> These gel cushions made such a huge difference as far as comfort goes.  </li>
            <li> I rate these gel pads only 3 stars because they offer only slightly better cushioning than rubber</li>
            <li> They do not wear out as quickly as the regular rubber.  </li>
            <li> HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone faced with having to use crutches for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> I found these and thought that surely they will help a little.</li>
            <li> WOW !!</li>
            <li> Better than the pads that came with my crutches but still leaving my sides a little irritated.</li>
            <li> perfect for disney world or any other extra long walking and keeps you cool unlike the ordinary rubber ones</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than the standard hard rubber underarm pad.  </li>
            <li> These really helped with my under-arm pain caused by the old crutch pads.</li>
            <li> The gel is much nicer than the old rubber.</li>
            <li> However, the heaviest of the gel makes my crutches really top heavy</li>
            <li> The Velcro bottom barely touched but it fit snugged enough not to move around.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to those who need to be on crutches for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> and they make crutches noticibly top heavy.</li>
            <li> and she never complained about pain after that.  </li>
            <li> I lost my right leg above the knee 24 years ago</li>
            <li> One cushion fit, the other did not.</li>
            <li> A summer on crutches was no fun, but I highly recommend these affordable and comfortable gel pads for your crutches.</li>
            <li> This new pad allowed slippage between it and my shirts.  </li>
            <li> and they look and act as they did when new.  </li>
            <li> I live on crutches.</li>
            <li> Not too vexed to spend thirty bucks on a new pair though.  </li>
            <li> I would not waste my money!</li>
            <li> We first bought these several years ago for my husband when he broke his leg and had to be on crutches for six weeks.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was really excited to get these.</li>
            <li> This was my first time on crutches and fromt he moment I left the doctors office</li>
            <li> For the first week after foot surgery I used the standard issue crutches with the gray rubber pads on the underarm part.</li>
            <li> No more bruising and able to &amp;#34;crutch&amp;#34; in comfort.</li>
            <li> I added the new gel pads directly over my stock pads.</li>
            <li> I prefer these over the regular crutch pad still in place underneath, but that leaves the entire crutch very top heavy.</li>
            <li> Would by them again and certainly recommend them to any one on standard crutches.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give five stars only because I wish they had a little more padding or gel to them.</li>
            <li> Really, it is a great product and you wont be unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the Crutch-Mate(tm) underarm pads state, &amp;#34;May remove old arm cover&lt;</li>
            <li> I just installed these over the old ones.  </li>
            <li> I really think that these should be Standard Issue on ALL Crutches!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I would have made it this far without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to purchase, I really thought that these would help.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 yr old father of two</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old and I am about 150lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I received these I put them on my 21yr old daughters crutches</li>
            <li> Old crutch pads would sort of grip to surfaces.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely made an instant difference for my underarms.</li>
            <li> Not only are they tiring but your ribs get very sore if you walk a lot.  </li>
            <li> Makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE in the world as far as comfort.</li>
            <li> The combination of the gel displacement with the soft and stretchy outer material makes these a must have.  </li>
            <li> They were completely healed in a month &amp; haven&#x27;t returned.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be on crutches for more than a few days, I definitely recommend investing in some of these!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; was seriously injured on both knees and has been on crutches for almost 6 months and will most likely need to be on them for a few more months at least; these gel pads have made such a huge difference for him!</li>
            <li> These will last about 6 months with daily consistent use.</li>
            <li> The gel hand grip pads were not thick enough</li>
            <li> Helps some but with long term use I still have very sore arms/sides.</li>
            <li> They help at first but do not last long.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very comfy, however I do not like having such vivid advertising printed over the entire surface front and back.</li>
            <li> These little gel pads are worth their weight in gold.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I would HIGHLY recommend getting this or another crutch cover no matter how long you have to be on them.</li>
            <li> My main objection is that they are black with large white lettering with company product name and company......</li>
            <li> wanted to replace the old armpit rubber; these are very nic and soft(maybe a little too soft)</li>
            <li> If going up and down stairs by yourself using the 2 crutches under one arm, they can be a bit wide for shorter people, but are quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> Shame, since they are comfortable, but using crutches is bad enough without becoming a walking billboard.</li>
            <li> They do make the top of the crutches a little heavy</li>
            <li> I took off the original pads and put these on and have had no more pain!  </li>
            <li> The hand pieces really don&#x27;t work well and not worth buying.  </li>
            <li> It is a good thing it is black as at least I can try to black it out with a felt tip pen</li>
            <li> I spent so long just trying to get them on my crutches only to find out that they really did not work well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be on crutches for the next few months, and I definately didn&#x27;t want to stick with the armpit chaffing &#x27;cusions&#x27; that come with a new pair of crutches.  </li>
            <li> You find out quickly enough just how NOT soft cotton can be.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest these to anybody on crutches, especially if you&#x27;re in for a long period of time on them.</li>
            <li> These did not last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> The HUGE printed advertisements on the crutch pads are really tacky and a bad idea on the part of the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Extended crutch use will ultimately cause chaffing and an excema-like patch of dry skin on the side of your rib cage.  </li>
            <li> We ordered these pads and she made it through the 4 weeks on crutches with far less pain.</li>
            <li> Last time I was on crutches before I found these pads, I had rough spots on my ribs from using crutches and initially I bruised; with these pads, I haven&#x27;t had either.</li>
            <li> They completely eased the pain, and made my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> These gel pads really helped and she hasn&#x27;t complained about pain/ discomfort since.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d rather be comfortable than worry about some silly logo.</li>
            <li> (like with travelling long distances).  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is they are not washable (Don&#x27;t get them wet, the label reads) and eventually they do need washing.</li>
            <li> we knew he would be on crutches a long time.</li>
            <li> I will need to use crutches for several weeks before and after surgery and the standard pads are not very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The gel adds supreme comfort; typically, you are not supposed to rest your armpits on the crutch pad for movement anyhow, but with these, I find that I can get away with it comfortably when my hands/arms are too tired to support me</li>
            <li> I did push-ups every other day to strengthen my upper body.  </li>
            <li> Well, I am back to purchase a set for my other set of crutches.  </li>
            <li> first pair I bought were ok, but the 2nd pair were terrible.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the label just as long as I have the gel!</li>
            <li> Prior to my surgery, I heard so many horror stories about how painful crutches were.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;**They will break down after long usage for those that are on crutches long term.</li>
            <li> They are literally coming apart, the gel inside is falling out in these little tiny clumps.</li>
            <li> As an amputee, I have spent years on crutches.</li>
            <li> They are &#x27;slippery&#x27; and you do need to be careful that you don&#x27;t slip off the crutch when you gain some speed &amp; momemtum.  </li>
            <li> All irritation and soreness was gone, I did not use the crutches with them jammed up in my armpit as that would be incorrect usage.</li>
            <li> This year we bought a second set for my daughter after we realized one of the originals had gone missing.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re inexpensive enough to get you through a few weeks of hobbling around.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot if time on crutches and wish I had found this product sooner.  </li>
            <li> The pad that the crutches come with was becoming painful and giving her brush burns under her arms.</li>
            <li> He said he would recommend them to other patients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with other customers about the advertisement writing and logo on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to send back and find others</li>
            <li> Temporary crutches due to knee surgery.  </li>
            <li> Before he got them his sides were chaffed and sore, being on crutches is miserable enough without the crutches causing more discomfort!</li>
            <li> so I chose the Elasto-Gels over other options.  </li>
            <li> I reserve 5 stars due to longevity.  </li>
            <li> The problem with conventional crutch tops is not the padding.</li>
            <li> Still think that the hand pieces are not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Using crutches is also not fun.</li>
            <li> but after a week or so they just broke down.  </li>
            <li> I knew that upcoming surgery would mean several months on crutches.</li>
            <li> The gel will breakdown, split in half or slip to the side. -</li>
            <li> It stretched to cover the hard plastic armrests.</li>
            <li> Breaking your ankle in the dead of North Dakota winter is not fun.</li>
            <li> Average life span of Elasto-gel is approximately 8-10 months of daily usage.</li>
            <li> It makes the padding a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> The gel does provide a little relief.</li>
            <li> These helped a little, but still my armpits became sore.</li>
            <li> I would recommend something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> They are a little bulky, and tend to increase the functional length of the crutch.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days of using this my poor armpits went back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone else - don&#x27;t waste your money on the elasto-gel hand grips.  </li>
            <li> However, the pads are heavy.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use anything sherpa or pillow-y because it&#x27;s the dead of summer</li>
            <li> That is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the &amp;#34;gel hand grip pad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Provided an ample amount of cushioning, but somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> The last pair I ordered started coming apart at the stitch line approximately 6 weeks after my wife started using them.</li>
            <li> He had to walk quite a ways  to class on his crutches, with a heavy backpack.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on inexpensive pads....your armpits will thank you.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my $ on this.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with my plain wrap crutches was the material of the pad.  </li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s face it, if you are 200lb it is tough to hold your weight with just your arms for a long time.  </li>
            <li> No more raw under arms or blisters on my hands.</li>
            <li> And not too loose, which would yield a sloppy ill-perfoming</li>
            <li> It was way to small.</li>
            <li> It can be downright painful, especially if you&#x27;re a college student and you have to travel long distances across campus on foot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on crutches full-time for the past 5 yrs &amp;</li>
            <li> After several months of heavy use, they become dirty / no longer slippery.  </li>
            <li> Crutches are awkward enough, but the extra heavy jell makes them really awkward.  </li>
            <li> With this product, the crutches were no longer uncomfortable and the dry skin was gone within two days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly hard gel</li>
            <li> I hardly felt any underarm pain.</li>
            <li> Like the hand pads, these were not a sufficient all out replacement for the hard rubber underarm pad.  </li>
            <li> The gel sank to the bottom, leaving just the hard surface for &#x27;cushion&#x27;.</li>
            <li> std issue crutches have a pad but its a hard plastic.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint.  </li>
            <li> But, this leaves the crutch with a very thin gel pad -- not much there to cushion.  </li>
            <li> No more pain when walking with crutches!</li>
            <li> I thought they were a little expensive</li>
            <li> I got such bad rubbing of my rib cage from my clothes and the orginal pads that I cringed at the thought of picking up my crutches every time I had to move anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband was on crutches for several weeks after a bad break and surgery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a knee injury required me to use crutches, I was excruciatingly sore in my armpits after just a couple of days, and I was desperate for relief.  </li>
            <li> - The cushion is thin and provides marginal improvement in comfort.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The quality is poor.</li>
            <li> Elasto-Gel is rather thin and slippery.  </li>
            <li> softens the pain of crutches, but as others have said, the everpresent, dominant  and unnecessary advertising is obnoxious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use the gel pads, you remove the original (horrible, uncomfortable, painful) padding and put these on instead.</li>
            <li> I begrudgingly paid for these expensive pads because I had to be on crutches for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> He is 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; and found the crutches uncomfortable under his arms.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to be on crutches for three months.  </li>
            <li> When I use the crutches without the gel it is uncomfortable, and when I get downstairs I&#x27;m grateful for the crutches with the gel.  </li>
            <li> I give it one star because the slippery character makes using crutches somewhat dangerous.  </li>
            <li> I do not wear a prosthesis (artificial leg).</li>
            <li> It is impossible to put the gel hand grip pad over the hand grip pad that came with the crutch.</li>
            <li> The advertising on them is really bad taste, considering I don&#x27;t want to be a billboard for the company who makes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was bruised badly from the stock padding on the crutches.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> This just makes the user looks like an idiot and gives the company no discernible benefit.</li>
            <li> very ugly.</li>
            <li> Before finding the elasto-gel hand covers I had nasty callouses from using them, now ...none. :</li>
            <li> when I started using the hand grips, I had dreadful callouses on my palms.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Feels like a cloud under your arms if you&#x27;re used to the standard crutch cushions!  I was worried though because you can&#x27;t squeeze the elastogel over the crutch cushions, but after using them, my worries were quashed.  Totally worth it if you&#x27;re going to be on crutches for awhile.</li>
            <li> The crutch-mates provide excellent protection and padding with less bulk so they are also a bit cooler than rubber crutch pads. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> As an amputee, I have spent years on crutches.These pads are the most comfortable that I have ever used.However, after 2 weeks of use, one&lt;br /&gt;pad split longitudinally, so that the 2 sides of the pad drooped and no longer protected my under arm. If the manufacturer would correct this defect, I would have no reservations about buying the pads again.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my husband as he&#x27;s been using crutches for 6 weeks.  This product has provided him a lot more comfort then what he was using before.  The ability to cool or warm them makes them especially appealing.  We would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Would have never made it 2 months on crutches without these pads. I had seen reviews about these pads being slippery but for me they didn&#x27;t slip. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> very very pleased I don&#x27;t have sore underarms anymore[[ASIN:B000URKR2O Southwest Technologies Elasto-Gel Crutch-Mate I - \\&quot;Standard\\&quot; Underarm Gel Crutch Pad - Waterproof Cover - One Pair]]</li>
            <li> These crutch pads were awesome- I&#x27;ve recommended them to several people I&#x27;ve met on crutches. They really save your armpits and make crutching around much more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned because some reviews said they were slippery- but I haven&#x27;t found that to be true at all. They are a bit more top heavy when propping up against the wall, but as long as they are relatively straight it&#x27;s not a big deal at all since they are so wonderful. Also- they do have the company name on them in white lettering, but while your crutching around you can&#x27;t see it anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product and they definitely saved me!</li>
            <li> These worked great and not so much because of the gel but because of the sleeve material.  My biggest issue with my plain wrap crutches was the material of the pad.  It would grip my shirt and then my shirt would rub against my armpit like sand paper.  You find out quickly enough just how NOT soft cotton can be.  This new pad allowed slippage between it and my shirts.  After a couple days of using this my poor armpits went back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with others though, the over use of advertising is off-putting.</li>
            <li> The gel crutch pads are very worthwhile.  I have been using them for about 2 months and they are a lot nicer than the traditional foam pads at the top of the crutch.  They are &#x27;slippery&#x27; and you do need to be careful that you don&#x27;t slip off the crutch when you gain some speed &amp; momemtum.  The HUGE printed advertisements on the crutch pads are really tacky and a bad idea on the part of the manufacturer.  The hand pieces really don&#x27;t work well and not worth buying.  You are better off getting a pair of gloves for the longer stretches that you have to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Dec 2010.  Used Crutch pads for 6 months.  They were a life saver.  Still think that the hand pieces are not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Once I knew I would have to use crutches again I looked online to find some type of crutch pads to ease the discomfort under my arms. These pads make using crutches much more comfortable. I would definately buy them again if necessary. This time I have had no underarm bruising as I did the last 2 times I needed to use crutches after having foot surgery.</li>
            <li> - The cushion is thin and provides marginal improvement in comfort.&lt;br /&gt;- The quality is poor. One cushion fit, the other did not. Close inspection showed that the two cushions were constructed differently. Obviously, nobody at the plant checked these cushions before shipment.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO comfortable under your arms! Another must have if you are on crutches more than a week!</li>
            <li> doing as advertised. made using crutches better.</li>
            <li> These little gel pads are worth their weight in gold.  After a knee injury required me to use crutches, I was excruciatingly sore in my armpits after just a couple of days, and I was desperate for relief.  These pads did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the crutches (6 weeks and counting), and they look and act as they did when new.  My orthopaedic surgeon looked at them on a recent visit and was very impressed. He said he would recommend them to other patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not need the hand pads, as my crutches are well padded on the handles.  But even with some rubber padding on the shoulders of the crutches, I was still acutely sore in my armpits after just a few days.  Though most weight should rest on the handles, it is a given that you will need to shift a lot of weight occasionally to your arms. So, these pads were a life saver. They went over the existing rubber padding on the metal crutches with ease.  They have not slipped at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been on crutches different times and got calloused skin from the original latex covers.  These work great to reduce that.  If going up and down stairs by yourself using the 2 crutches under one arm, they can be a bit wide for shorter people, but are quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the Crutch-Mate(tm) underarm pads state, &amp;#34;May remove old arm cover&lt;br /&gt;from crutch.&amp;#34; i installed the Crutch-Mates *on top* of new, standard crutch under-arm&lt;br /&gt;cushions. The Crutch-Mates fit perfectly. Not too snug, which would require contortions&lt;br /&gt;to slip over the standard issue. And not too loose, which would yield a sloppy ill-perfoming fit.&lt;br /&gt;As Goldilocks said, &amp;#34;Ahhh, these Crutch-Mates are just right!&amp;#34;. In my experience,&lt;br /&gt;the Crutch-Mate underarm pads are a well-designed, sturdily-made, &amp; aesthetically-pleasing&lt;br /&gt;product that provides the high-level of comfort for which i had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;The Crutch-Mate underarm pads are well worth the price and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have been using these elasto-gel pads on my crutches for so many years I&#x27;ve lost count.  They really work!  But, I did not remove the original crutch &amp;#34;cushion.&amp;#34;  I just installed these over the old ones.  It makes the padding a little thicker.  I agree with everyone else - don&#x27;t waste your money on the elasto-gel hand grips.  Not worth the money.  I spent so long just trying to get them on my crutches only to find out that they really did not work well.  I went back to the original hand grips.</li>
            <li> These worked well, though they fit nicely on one pair of crutches while they weren&#x27;t quite big enough to fit over the pads of another pair.  Definitely more comfortable than standard pads or wrapped cloth/etc.</li>
            <li> Prompt service.  Exactly what I wanted.  Very well pleased</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these after suffering through two weeks of underarm-torture with regular crutch pads.  I thought after reading the reviews that these might be a miracle invention.  Not so much.  The instructions state to remove the regular crutch pads and to attach these in place.  But, this leaves the crutch with a very thin gel pad -- not much there to cushion.  I prefer these over the regular crutch pad still in place underneath, but that leaves the entire crutch very top heavy. Because my crutch use is nearly done, I didn&#x27;t bother to try any other versions, but I suspect more cushion-y versions would be better, perhaps the lambswool or extra foam.</li>
            <li> Works great really adds comfort</li>
            <li> I begrudgingly paid for these expensive pads because I had to be on crutches for 6 weeks. It was worth it. Definitely helped reduce soreness under arms. It just feels like a lot of money for gel pads.</li>
            <li> these are fantastic. I was on crutches for 6 months and these were a life saver</li>
            <li> These gel pads certainly are more comfortable than the ones that usually come with the crutches. Installing was super easy with the velcro. My main objection is that they are black with large white lettering with company product name and company......very ugly. It might be more acceptable if it was only on one side of each pad. Because of the advertising, I will not purchase them again. Shame, since they are comfortable, but using crutches is bad enough without becoming a walking billboard.</li>
            <li> These appear well-made and durable.  A family member needed to use crutches for a week after a leg injury, and these pads reduced the discomfort level of using crutches somewhat.  Although they were used for only a week, the pads held up nicely.  Using crutches is going to be uncomfortable even with these pads, but these pads make it more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be worth considering forearm crutches as an alternative to underarm crutches.  I&#x27;ve heard they may be more comfortable, but I don&#x27;t have experience with them.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect over without having to remove anything. The gel made using my crutches a lot more comfortable. Easy to put on and it stays on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be on crutches for the next few months, and I definately didn&#x27;t want to stick with the armpit chaffing &#x27;cusions&#x27; that come with a new pair of crutches.  This product is so comfortable I can use my crutches all day and not have any pain or discomfort in my pits.  Well worth the $24!</li>
            <li> Ok so I broke my leg and was on crutches for 6 weeks, and the crutches were hurting after the 1st week. I found these and thought that surely they will help a little. WOW !! these were a dream come true !! I slipped these on over the pads on the crutches with No problem. they stay on the crutches very well! instructions say they can be cooled or heated, however i found that without doing anything they have a somewhat cool feel to them. I had no issues with \\&quot;slipping\\&quot; at all! All irritation and soreness was gone, I did not use the crutches with them jammed up in my armpit as that would be incorrect usage. the only regret i have is that i did not order the hand pads. i ended up with calluses on the palms of my hands from the standard crutches hand pads. if you are on crutches or think there will ever be a possibility of being on them then get a set of these they are life savers !!! I really think that these should be Standard Issue on ALL Crutches!! I wish they were more readily available so more people could en joy the benefits, as i could ONLY find them online.</li>
            <li> The gel filled crutch covers are good. It does give you more padding when you are using the crutches. I left my original crutch covers on and just put the new padded covers over them. The 2 covers give you more support under the arms. I agree with other customers about the advertisement writing and logo on them. It makes the product look tacky. Otherwise, I am glad that I bought this product. It makes using the crutches more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The under arm gel crutch supports were shipped very quickly and make it extremely more comfortable while walking with crutches.  I would recommend this product to any one. Agreat value.</li>
            <li> I have been on crutches for over 30 years now and these are absolutely the best arm pads ever made!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 5th week of walking with the Crutch Mate Underarm Gel Pads and I have one more week to go. I must say they have been a life saver for me. The support and comfort has been awesome and I don&#x27;t think I would have made it this far without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> Instructions recommend removal of rubber cushion before installing the Elasto-Gel cushion. Elasto-Gel is rather thin and slippery.  I give it one star because the slippery character makes using crutches somewhat dangerous.  After this disappointment, I ordered Crutch Remedy cushions which didn&#x27;t slip and provided great cushioning of armpit and hand grips (make sure you have aluminum crutches with wing nuts at the hand grips).</li>
            <li> Great quality. Very comfortable. Have received several compliments.</li>
            <li> I broke my ankle and was facing two months on crutches and wanted to make them more comfortable - these were a perfect choice.  They provide nice padding and I have had no problems with them.  They do make the top of the crutches a little heavy so it seems like my crutches tend to fall over easier if I am propping them up.</li>
            <li> Truly awesome for crutches.  Padding takes away pressure from the crutches but the best part is the material that it is made out of.  The smooth and friction free material does not grab your skin or clothes or allow shaffing like everything else I tried.  As soon as I used it, I stopped looking for towels, pads....  Really, it is a great product and you wont be unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Bought for a set of crutches that I&#x27;ll need for about 5+ weeks for ankle-fracture surgery.  The gel adds supreme comfort; typically, you are not supposed to rest your armpits on the crutch pad for movement anyhow, but with these, I find that I can get away with it comfortably when my hands/arms are too tired to support me (like with travelling long distances).  Did not get the hand-pads, but wish I would have as my palms are bruised from having to depend on crutches all day.  Only negatives with these pads are it&#x27;s price, that it doesn&#x27;t include the hand-pads, and that they are heavy and add a bit of weight to the crutches; otherwise, these gel pads are much more comfortable and padded than with fabric ones.</li>
            <li> I had to use crutches for six weeks following foot surgery.  This product is WONDERFUL.  Extended crutch use will ultimately cause chaffing and an excema-like patch of dry skin on the side of your rib cage.  With this product, the crutches were no longer uncomfortable and the dry skin was gone within two days.  My only caution is that the fabric is very smooth and if you&#x27;re crutching too fast, it can slip out from underneath your arm.  More an operator malfunction than a product deficiency.  It took five days for this product to arrive even though I asked for 2-day shipping.</li>
            <li> On crutches for 3 months. This was so comfortable for my underarms. Easy to assemble. It was a god send esp how my arms ached by using the original pads.</li>
            <li> My husband broke his knee and needed crutches. He is 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; and found the crutches uncomfortable under his arms. I found these for him and he loves them. He says it makes it much softer and comfortable for him!</li>
            <li> if you are on them along time you will need this product i have been on mine for two weeks have four more</li>
            <li> Really helped my son&#x27;s arms when he was on crutches for 6 weeks....would recommend them...his physical therapist was impressed with them..they said they use this brand in their business..</li>
            <li> The gel does provide a little relief. It&#x27;s a fairly hard gel and I thought they&#x27;d be squishier.  That&#x27;s really not a big deal. However, the heaviest of the gel makes my crutches really top heavy so every time I lean them against something they always fall over. I&#x27;m too lazy to send back and find others but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again. I think some of those that have the fuzzy material would feel better under my arms.</li>
            <li> The pads are comfortable and fit well over the old shoulder pads.  These were easy to install with Velcro to fasten them in place.  However, the pads are heavy.  They make the crutches so top heavy, they fall over much more frequently than without them.  Crutches are awkward enough, but the extra heavy jell makes them really awkward.  I really hurt myself yesterday when one fell on my injured foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt the price was okay for these two pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no installation instructions, so you had to guess they go on top of the normal pads.  There are no cleaning instructions.  The advertising on them is really bad taste, considering I don&#x27;t want to be a billboard for the company who makes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would  buy them again.  These really helped with my under-arm pain caused by the old crutch pads.</li>
            <li> The company logo ad is prominent but if you can overlook it, the gel pads made a huge difference on the crutches. It stretched to cover the hard plastic armrests. The Velcro bottom barely touched but it fit snugged enough not to move around. No more pain when walking with crutches!</li>
            <li> awesom :-) perfect for disney world or any other extra long walking and keeps you cool unlike the ordinary rubber ones</li>
            <li> Best product out there for armpits everywhere for people on crutches. Need to remove the armpit crutch cover to apply, if not it will be rather big and bulky. They also have ones for the hands as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not imagine using crutches without them, or for my hands. - especially for my hands...Before finding the elasto-gel hand covers I had nasty callouses from using them, now ...none. :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**They will break down after long usage for those that are on crutches long term. Average life span of Elasto-gel is approximately 8-10 months of daily usage. The gel will breakdown, split in half or slip to the side. - To extend life of gel I flip it inside out at the &amp;#34;halfway point&amp;#34;. If this does happen within the warranty time period (1 year warranty) contact the company, as they are fantastic to deal with and will honor the warranty in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> These crutch pads are a lifesaver. The best product out there, hands down. Some people are complaining that there isn&#x27;t enough padding but I disagree. Padding on the sides protects my ribs and the top protects the armpits.</li>
            <li> The jell padding made it so it was comfortable to use crutches. So thankful for having them.they worked great! Thanks</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to purchase, I really thought that these would help. I had hip surgery and on crutches for 4 weeks plus. These helped a little, but still my armpits became sore. I would not waste my money!</li>
            <li> when using these Crutch Mates you get no irritation in your underarms,they make it so you can go all day without any problems..</li>
            <li> My son had to have knee surgery and had to be on crutches for about 3 months. These gave him relief and me too not as much complaining!</li>
            <li> My daughter said she loves them. Thank u</li>
            <li> No more raw under arms or blisters on my hands. So worth the money. Way better than the rubber crutches come with</li>
            <li> wanted to replace the old armpit rubber; these are very nic and soft(maybe a little too soft) so I put them OVER the new rubber for a very nice comfortable fit</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who will be on crutches for an extended period of time.  I was on crutches for 5 weeks, and these were great.  They help relieve the abrasiveness that occurs with the regular crutch covers.  I have recommended them to many people - including to my orthopedic surgeon.</li>
            <li> Lifesaver for crutches.  Have lent them to thers.  HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to be on crutches for three months.  The elasto-gel covering stopped the pilling and pulling of sweaters and jackets.  They were much more comfortable than the standard crutch pads.  A stanger stopped me one day because they were about to have knee surgery and he ordered them on his phone while he was talking to me!</li>
            <li> Love these Gel Pads. They really help cushion my underarms.</li>
            <li> Temporary crutches due to knee surgery.  These gel handles worked well and are a quick fix without having to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> A must have if you spend much time on crutches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten )</li>
            <li> bought for my son, kept him from getting bruises under his arms</li>
            <li> We first bought these several years ago for my husband when he broke his leg and had to be on crutches for six weeks. If you or anyone you know has to be on crutches these are a lifesaver. They definitely make it much more comfortable on your underarms. The fabric on top is some type of nylon that glides over your clothing and makes it even more comfortable then the gel underneath though the gel is super cushiony. This year we bought a second set for my daughter after we realized one of the originals had gone missing. They are well worth every penny. May I also recommend the hand gel grips that go along with them. They are invaluable for the crutches or for walkers.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was really excited to get these. I couldn&#x27;t use anything sherpa or pillow-y because it&#x27;s the dead of summer and it&#x27;s too hot under my arm. So, these were the next best solution I could find for underarm pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the gel pads, you remove the original (horrible, uncomfortable, painful) padding and put these on instead. It&#x27;s a definite improvement over the factory padding (but almost anything is!) I wouldn&#x27;t say it feels like &amp;#34;clouds&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;pillows&amp;#34; they are just better than the original padding. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my underarms and ribs quite as much. It&#x27;s an improvement. That being said, I would HIGHLY recommend getting this or another crutch cover no matter how long you have to be on them. Do NOT try and just go with the originals, you will be bruised and in pain, even crutching properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue is the price...might have rated it higher if it was an exceptional value, which it is not.</li>
            <li> I broke my femur and am to be off the leg for 4-6 mos. I am a 35 yr old father of two and I want to keep myself in good physical condition for when I am returned to full weight bearing. I attempted exercise with my crutches but experienced chaffing and soreness. I ordered these pads and have walked miles without an problems. I even wear a backpack full of weights and do laps around my neighborhood. No soreness or problems caused by my crutches.</li>
            <li> It was way to small. I send it back.</li>
            <li> I wa on crutches for two months with a stress fracture. The crutches hurt under my arms so I looked for something to ease the pain. These gel Crutch-Mates are amazing. They completely eased the pain, and made my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter (age 7) when she had to use crutches for a fractured ankle. The pad that the crutches come with was becoming painful and giving her brush burns under her arms. These gel pads really helped and she hasn&#x27;t complained about pain/ discomfort since. They are not a big and bulky as some of the other ones that I was looking into getting her, so the adjustment to using these was great.</li>
            <li> I had to use crutches for several weeks.  I could not get these to go over the pads that came with the crutches, so I didn&#x27;t use them at first.  But my arms got sore really quick.  I took off the original pads and put these on and have had no more pain!  They don&#x27;t feel that cushy, but they really work!</li>
            <li> My crutches were practically bruising my ribs/armpits, and these made them much more comfortable. I would recommend to those who need to be on crutches for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> About 2.5 months ago I had foot surgery - non-weight bearing for 6 weeks.  Prior to my surgery, I heard so many horror stories about how painful crutches were.  I had the option to rent/buy a scooter or use crutches.  I didn&#x27;t want to be on a scooter, because I&#x27;ve seen how funny people look on those things. For about 1 month prior to my surgery I did push-ups every other day to strengthen my upper body.  I also purchased these wonderful Elasto-Gel underarm gel pads for my crutches.  The underarm gel pads worked really well. They were super easy to install.  You basically place the gel pad over the underarm pad that comes with the crutches. I hardly felt any underarm pain. I am 39 years old and I am about 150lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another product I purchased along with the underarm gel pads are the Elasto-Gel &amp;#34;hand grip&amp;#34; pads. That is a waste of money.  It is impossible to put the gel hand grip pad over the hand grip pad that came with the crutch. I ended up taking off the original hand grip pad that came with the crutch and then put the gel hand grip pad on.  The gel hand grip pads were not thick enough so when I used the crutch, I could feel the metal through the gel hand grips.  The hand grip pads that cAme with the crutches work better.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the &amp;#34;gel hand grip pad&amp;#34; made by Elasto-Gel.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone faced with having to use crutches for an extended period of time.  (Anything longer than a week.)</li>
            <li> Saved my armpits!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have a lot more support from the Elasto-Gel, and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference!  It honestly feels the same as the cushion my crutches came with.  In my opinion, you can save your money by not investing in the Elasto-Gel.</li>
            <li> I live on crutches.I am an amputee.I lost my right leg above the knee 24 years ago and I don&#x27;t use a prosthesis,I use crutches so I&#x27;m always looking for products that may make using crutches easier and more comfortable.I rate these gel pads only 3 stars because they offer only slightly better cushioning than rubber and they make crutches noticibly top heavy.</li>
            <li> They are a lot more comfortable , I don&#x27;t get sores under my arms. They stay on really good and they don&#x27;t slide.</li>
            <li> I am an above the knee amputee and use crutches daily.  I do not wear a prosthesis (artificial leg). I have used crutches since 1993.  These are by far the best underarm crutch pad I have ever come across.  I could not function without these.  They do not wear out as quickly as the regular rubber.  I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about these.</li>
            <li> These underarm crutch pads are very very comfortable and are far superior to the hand pads also produced by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a definite improvement over the pads that come with the crutches.  The material also doesn&#x27;t grab your clothes and they slide easily making them easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> it works very well you just have to be careful of what kind of shirt you wair it will slip out from under your arm. its well worth the money</li>
            <li> Made the underarm crutch so much more comfortable!  The only thing better is sheep&#x27;s fur.  When it is hot outside, the gel is much better!  Wool gets way too hot.  Think they should put these on all crutches!</li>
            <li> Provided an ample amount of cushioning, but somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received these I put them on my 21yr old daughters crutches and she never complained about pain after that.  The best crutch pads out there.  Highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> These crutch pads are fantastic.  They make a lot of difference with my crutches.  The quality is top notch, so I would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> Breaking your ankle in the dead of North Dakota winter is not fun. Using crutches is also not fun. It can be downright painful, especially if you&#x27;re a college student and you have to travel long distances across campus on foot. These gel pads were an absolute Godsend! They made such a difference in comfort for me. If you&#x27;re going to be on crutches for more than a few days, I definitely recommend investing in some of these!</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than the standard hard rubber underarm pad.  I was on crutches for months after two surgeries within 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> HELPS KEEP AWAY THE BLISTERS</li>
            <li> They were very comfortable. We had tried many other types to relieve under the arm pressure. They are the perfect size.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; was seriously injured on both knees and has been on crutches for almost 6 months and will most likely need to be on them for a few more months at least; these gel pads have made such a huge difference for him! Before he got them his sides were chaffed and sore, being on crutches is miserable enough without the crutches causing more discomfort! Now he has no issues and he can focus on recovery, he says that these are a must for anyone on crutches!</li>
            <li> First time on crutches at 55yrs old and what a difference these gel pads have made - Far more comfortable!</li>
            <li> If you are going to be on crutches for any amount of time you must have these. They definitely help and stopped the chaffing that I was getting from the regular pads.</li>
            <li> After doing a bunch of research - these seem to be the best crutch pads available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this product could probably be made better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Why the huge advert on the side?  It isn&#x27;t like people are always on the look out for crutch pad ideas.  This just makes the user looks like an idiot and gives the company no discernible benefit. Huge fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) As others noted, it is best to slip them over your normal pads.  That said, I received zero instructions with my product so who knows how the company intends for you to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I think I need to get a smaller crutch now.  I was on the shortest setting for my crutches but the pads have made them taller and now they are too close to my arm pits.  Not too vexed to spend thirty bucks on a new pair though.  That said, something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Old crutch pads would sort of grip to surfaces.  These slide off anything so you have to lie them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) They make your crutches a fair bit heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) My biggest complaint.  These guys do their fulfillment themselves so the cost of shipping is a bit ludicrous.</li>
            <li> Absolutely made an instant difference for my underarms. Within 24 hours my sides and underarms had zero inflammation or soreness. They were killing me with the stock rubber pads. I added the new gel pads directly over my stock pads. Worth every penny spent. Would by them again and certainly recommend them to any one on standard crutches.</li>
            <li> These were for my son who is going to be on crutches for about 8 weeks and he loves them.</li>
            <li> This was my first time on crutches and fromt he moment I left the doctors office I knew I needed something else.  I thought they were a little expensive but it was well worth it.  I took the pads off that came with the crutches and used only these pads.  The gel helped eased the pain.  The fit is slimmer and more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry guys, but this comment is for woman.  The original pads would catch on my bra and clothing.  These were great because the velcro closer at the bottom made for a smoother line prevented that.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and my only regret was that I didn&#x27;t purchase the gel pad for my hand holds.</li>
            <li> These were a life saver.  I was non weight bearing for 3 months.  My pits were killing me.  These did the trick.  After about 2 1/2 months though they became encrusted with sweat and deodorant though and were ready to be replaced.  The reason why is because for me, beside the fact that they are wide and relatively soft, they were also slippery.  After several months of heavy use, they become dirty / no longer slippery.  once that happens they grab again and for me the benefit is over.  I have been non weight bearing in the past and have tried other products, this worked the best.  If i&#x27;m ever non weight bearing again, this will be my first purchase.</li>
            <li> they will save your under arms from sores would recommend to everyone on crutches. well worth the price ! !</li>
            <li> Like the hand pads, these were not a sufficient all out replacement for the hard rubber underarm pad.  These were, however, very easy to stretch over the existing underarm pads and they made an immediate noticeable difference.  I would suggest these to anybody on crutches, especially if you&#x27;re in for a long period of time on them.</li>
            <li> I knew that upcoming surgery would mean several months on crutches. Having used crutches many times before, I was dreading the underarm rubbing and chaffing . These gel pads really have prevented the problem. Additionally, they really help prevent injury to the brachial plexus (bundle of nerves that supply the forearm and hand)..Every time I go to the surgeon for a check up someone asks me where I found them !</li>
            <li> softens the pain of crutches, but as others have said, the everpresent, dominant  and unnecessary advertising is obnoxious. I covered it with magic marker, but it still shone through. Used for three months with no issues at all.</li>
            <li> crutch falls over if not leaned on something sturdy. I would recommend something a little lighter. Blah blah blah blah</li>
            <li> After about 2 hrs on crutches my daughter was already in tears. We ordered these pads and she made it through the 4 weeks on crutches with far less pain.</li>
            <li> This really helped me get around after my ankle operation.  Glad I found this!  Made my life that much easier during recovery</li>
            <li> Better than the pads that came with my crutches but still leaving my sides a little irritated.</li>
            <li> I bought these after wearing my arm pits out. The problem with conventional crutch tops is not the padding. It is the friction caused by your clothes on your crutches. It rubs your arm pits raw.&lt;br /&gt;These tops are very slippery, AND padded. They changed my crutches into a cadillac version. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> pads work great and easy to put on and remove. great replacement for the rubber ones.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several pairs of these underarm pads over the years. I have never had any issue with them until now. The last pair I ordered started coming apart at the stitch line approximately 6 weeks after my wife started using them. She has been on crutches now for 18 years and I have always felt good about this product until now. They are literally coming apart, the gel inside is falling out in these little tiny clumps. I am very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got great underarm relief by using the Gel Crutch Mate. Very necessary when using crutches. I highly recommend these to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> Lifesaver! I had to take the pads that came with my crutches off to comfortably fit these on my crutches, but definitely worth it! I&#x27;ve been on crutches for 5 months this time and am so glad I found this product. Last time I was on crutches before I found these pads, I had rough spots on my ribs from using crutches and initially I bruised; with these pads, I haven&#x27;t had either. Very good product and made in usa.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to the crutch top, nd to remove for cleaning.  They are a little bulky, and tend to increase the functional length of the crutch.  They tend to encourage weight-bearing through the under-arms, which can cause pinching of the nerves running to the hands.</li>
            <li> I have had crutches for prolonged periods before and it was a nightmare.  Not only are they tiring but your ribs get very sore if you walk a lot.  I bought these just to test it out when I recently broke my ankle and was so happy I did!  Really made my walking so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are so much more comfortable than the regular pads.  I will need to use crutches for several weeks before and after surgery and the standard pads are not very comfortable.  The gel pads are much better.</li>
            <li> Really made my daughters lengthy use of crutches tolerable.  Really an armpit saver!  Very happy I went to the added expense of buying these.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge deference this is what the crutches should come with to begin with. Slips over current padding. Provides a noticeable deferance</li>
            <li> I had bought a repair kit for my crutches right before this purchase. I put the pads on and they ripped right away. Glad I came to amazon and found these. The gel is much nicer than the old rubber.</li>
            <li> A summer on crutches was no fun, but I highly recommend these affordable and comfortable gel pads for your crutches. Makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE in the world as far as comfort. The only drawback is they are not washable (Don&#x27;t get them wet, the label reads) and eventually they do need washing. But they&#x27;re inexpensive enough to get you through a few weeks of hobbling around.</li>
            <li> When my husband broke his leg and found out he would need surgery we knew he would be on crutches a long time. So, we purchased these gelled cushions.  They are easy to put on and help with comfort.</li>
            <li> I know you are not supposed to put your body weight on the top of the crutches, in your armpits.  But let&#x27;s face it, if you are 200lb it is tough to hold your weight with just your arms for a long time.  So yes, there are times when I lean my body weight on these.  Plus there is rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on these gel pads and it was a huge improvement over the stock pad.  I had them on there about a month.  Mine have lasted just fine and show no signs of wear, but I can&#x27;t comment on longevity long term.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very comfy, however I do not like having such vivid advertising printed over the entire surface front and back. I would expect to see this on a promotional free item not one I paid this amount of money for. Come on ---it even has the phone number printed on it. It is a good thing it is black as at least I can try to black it out with a felt tip pen</li>
            <li> I am in leg cast for next 6 weeks. After 2 days my armpits were felling bruised.  That is until I found these nifty helpers.  Much better than regular arm covers.  Didn&#x27;t give five stars only because I wish they had a little more padding or gel to them.</li>
            <li> Definitely eased the pain on the armpits during 2 months on crutches. Would recommend buying some kind of padding for extended use and these gel ones were nice and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I ordered these crutch &amp;#34;cushions&amp;#34; for my son at college.  He had to walk quite a ways  to class on his crutches, with a heavy backpack.  These gel cushions made such a huge difference as far as comfort goes.  He told me that they were well worth the price!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my 55+ years of life, I am faced with spending 8 weeks on crutches.  My home is on two floors so I have a set of crutches for each floor.  I bought these crutch pads after a week on the crutches because I was desparate for some relief from the pain in my armpit areas.  The reviews were excellent so I chose the Elasto-Gels over other options.  Well, I am back to purchase a set for my other set of crutches.  They are well worth their cost and I cannot bear to use the crutches without them.  The comfort is incredible.  The combination of the gel displacement with the soft and stretchy outer material makes these a must have.  They are easy to put on and the strong velcro closures ensures they will not slip off.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on inexpensive pads....your armpits will thank you.</li>
            <li> Great replacement pads or add to existing ones. Prevents chafing and burn. More comfortable to rest.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for almost a month or more after knee surgery.  Torn acl. Loved the comfort.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product prior to my 6th foot surgery and they were the best things ever.  I have spent a lot if time on crutches and wish I had found this product sooner.  It was beyond comfortable.</li>
            <li> These have saved my armpits.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable! Especially if you are sleeveless material is comfortable on skin does not create much friction. I&#x27;ve been on crutches for 25 yrs &amp; haven&#x27;t found better yet. I reserve 5 stars due to longevity.  These will last about 6 months with daily consistent use. But worth every penny.</li>
            <li> For the first week after foot surgery I used the standard issue crutches with the gray rubber pads on the underarm part. I am a fit 31 year old. I got such bad rubbing of my rib cage from my clothes and the orginal pads that I cringed at the thought of picking up my crutches every time I had to move anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got these it was like heaven, no joke. They have a smooth finish to them, so they don&#x27;t catch on your clothes and hence your clothes don&#x27;t rub against your skin. I really wish I would&#x27;ve had these all along. In my opinion, they are a MUST for crutches.</li>
            <li> The product exceeded my expectations.  I have two pairs of crutches - one for upstairs (short distances) without the product and one downstairs (longer distances) with the product.  When I use the crutches without the gel it is uncomfortable, and when I get downstairs I&#x27;m grateful for the crutches with the gel.  I thought they was a bit pricy at first but they are well worth it - I have enough discomfort while I heal to worry about adding more.</li>
            <li> These did not last very long at all.  When we first got them they felt great but after a week or so they just broke down.  They help at first but do not last long.</li>
            <li> A little better than the stock one but not by much.</li>
            <li> Very good product! I was bruised badly from the stock padding on the crutches. No more bruising and able to &amp;#34;crutch&amp;#34; in comfort.</li>
            <li> worked great for my son&#x27;s crutches</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Elasto-Gel Crutch-Mate to everyone needing to use crutches over a week.  They have saved my life and my armpits.  After surgery on my Achilles tendon I am &amp;#34;non weight-bearing&amp;#34; for 6 weeks.  Even though I knew the proper crutch walking rules my armpits were sore after 4 days.  The Elasto-Gels saved my life.  They are so comfortable and save your hands and armpits from all the pressure of your body weight.  I&#x27;m so glad I found them.</li>
            <li> My husband was on crutches for several weeks after a bad break and surgery.&lt;br /&gt;He needed something to help with the pain of the crutches under his arms and these sure alleviated that discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;He did find them &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; but it was better to have them on than not at all!</li>
            <li> first pair I bought were ok, but the 2nd pair were terrible.  The gel sank to the bottom, leaving just the hard surface for &#x27;cushion&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone with crutches.  They work just fine and helped me get more corfortable as I walked.  The label will end up peeling off but they are still great.  I don&#x27;t care about the label just as long as I have the gel!</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads for about 3 yrs now.  I didn&#x27;t have to replace my first set of tops until about 18 months of full-time use.  I&#x27;m still using the original hand grips.  I&#x27;ve been on crutches full-time for the past 5 yrs &amp; when I started using the hand grips, I had dreadful callouses on my palms.  They were completely healed in a month &amp; haven&#x27;t returned.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Although I am not a fan of the logo on both sides of the tops either, it&#x27;s under my arms most of the time so I&#x27;d rather be comfortable than worry about some silly logo.</li>
            <li> This was great. It really saves your ribs. It pays to watch a video on you tube how to use crutches because if you do it correctly this item is a life saver</li>
            <li> Helps some but with long term use I still have very sore arms/sides.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make a big difference in comfort for std issued crutches.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste my $ on this. If you have no alternative - guess its better than no padding on crutches.  Note: std issue crutches have a pad but its a hard plastic.</li>
