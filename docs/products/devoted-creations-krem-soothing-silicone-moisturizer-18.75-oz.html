    <ol>
            <li> This smells like talc and flowers. The moisturized works great but the fragrance makes it hard to use. I wish they had this in an unscented variety. I&#x27;ve had it for a while but used it sparingly all because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This lotion not only smells good, but it keeps my skin hydrated all day. It makes my skin post tanning feel cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> this product makes the skin feel soft and smooth and the skin has a nice glow.  would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer minus the scent. It has a really strong soapy/old lady scent to it. It does work REALLY well and keeps my skin soft all day which says alot because I have VERY dry skin. If you need a good lotion and don&#x27;t mind strong smells, go for it!</li>
            <li> Love This Cream.  Best Silocone Based One Out There.</li>
            <li> I love Krem and will not use any other lotion since I began in 09&#x27;. I live in a dry climate with severaly dry skin and Krem is the only product I found that releaves all dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> I really like the light scent and the lotion makes your skin feel like silk.

            <li> I have dry skin which is worse in the wintertime. I&#x27;ve tried many lotions over the years and this Krem lotion is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to buy this from a tanning salon and it was double the price of buying thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion.  It&#x27;s very light and the smell is very light and I have an aversion to strong scents and get headaches.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel. I have dry skin especially after shaving my shins. It takes care or the aftershave roughness.</li>
            <li> I got this right on time, really liked how it was packaged. It ensured that it had never been opened, big plus! The smell is light, clean and not overpowering. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite moisturizer.  Makes my skin feel well nourished not dry and brittle. Have to keep an extra bottle on order, just so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I go tanning regularly year round and since my last silicone lotion was discontinued I have tried MANY and this is BY FAR THE BEST PRODUCT. your skin feels smooth but not oily . I love the soft clean smell it has (not like tanning lotions) you will not be disappointed!!</li>

            <li> I love this lotion! It has a light scent, so I can combine it with my favorite scented lotion and it adds the smooth silicons! It is more expensive than the others out there, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BOUGHT MANY OF THESE BOTTLES AND I CAN TELL YOU IT IS AMAZING! THE PRODUCT IS A NICE PEARLY WHITE COLOR AND GOES ON ULTRA SMOOTH AS THE NAME TELLS \\&quot;SOOTHING SILICONE\\&quot;. MAKES UR SKIN FEEL LIKE SILK AND KEEPS IT HYDRTAED! THE SMELL ISN&#x27;T BAD AT ALL (IF YOU LIKE POWDER SCENT) ALSO IT IS NOT GREASY AT ALL WHAT SO EVER SO I APPLY IT TO BODY AND FACE AFTER TANNING. PERFECT FOR DAY AND NIGHT APPLICATION</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great and has a terrific smell. I got it for my legs as a moisturizer and tan extender. Leaves my legs feeling so smooth and silky. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A GREAT SMELL AND LEAVES SKIN SMOOTH. I just love it. wouldn&#x27;t change it for any other cream.</li>
            <li> Reordering second bottle so there&#x27;s no chance of running out! Really long lasting, not greasy, and fragrance fades very quickly, so it is not an issue using it with other scented products.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion for every day.  I use it every day, not just for after tanning.  I like that it is not greasy, or oily.  Other lotions feel like Vaseline and never come off.  Not this one.. its perfect, and this is a really great price.  I also found it in the small travel size, which is great for your Tennis bag, or purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I like CUREL best. I&#x27;m trying others in search of quality and value CUREL is on top so far.</li>
