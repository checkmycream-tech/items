            <li>but it sure seems like it helps.  </li>

            <li>It reduces puffiness and makes eyes look more well rested.  </li>
            <li>I think it would feel even better -</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I don&#x27;t regret buying this, I do use it most nights, but I won&#x27;t buy it again when it&#x27;s finished.  </li>

            <li>and I LOVE Mary Kay products.  </li>

            <li>Love my Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li>Love the soothing fe.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more of this gel in the jar...</li>
            <li>I love this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay products</li>
            <li>much, much better and soothes and depuffs a lot better.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li>What more could a girl want?  </li>
            <li>This product in particular is great for those times when I wake up with the under-eye puffiness, it&#x27;s soothing &amp; helps reduce the swelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and have lived in Florida all my life so if it wasn&#x27;t for good genetics (thanks, Mom!)</li>
            <li>Works pretty good under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I use the gel each morning after washing my face and it feels nice and cool on my puffy morning under eyes.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly, was package nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy other people have better results with it, and YMVV.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cool and refreshing on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s better cool.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic eye gel.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s light - a gel, not a cream</li>
            <li>Not only does it appear to work immediately, it feels great.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lessen my wrinkles or bags, but it definitely feels great.</li>
            <li>It is a safe product of doing a good job in moisturizing the eyes without bringing extra load.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad that it didn&#x27;t cost too much.  </li>
            <li>I really tried to love thisâ€¦ but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Iv been using this on my face and love it very soothing under my eyes , along with prolonged use</li>
            <li>I love this sooooo much, when my eyes are puffy from whatever, I use this</li>
            <li>Keep it in the frige or lunch w/ cool pack to freshen up during day.</li>
            <li>You can keep this in the frig for super cooling around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have been hungover many times put this on go into work and have been told wow you look so awake today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not convinced it&#x27;s good enough for older skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put on right before mascara.</li>
            <li>It feels cool right away, and it really does take away a lot of the puffiness overnight.</li>
            <li>NO SO HOT.</li>
            <li>it will keep my skin hydrated &amp; facial elasticity better</li>
            <li>I only have occasional under eye puffiness and no dark circles, so I thought this would be ideal.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to have this around for those occasional times when you&#x27;re preparing for a big event or just need to sooth your eyes.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, and if I kept it in the refrigerator</li>
            <li>Really helps with the puffs under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is great for daily care if you only need a basic eye gel.</li>
            <li>It really is soothing.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>While I do like a lot of the Mary Kay skincare products, this one really doesn&#x27;t do the trick for reducing any puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li>But honestly it&#x27;s just a waste.</li>
            <li>Now, I hope my eyes return to normal.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY one that wasn&#x27;t worth ever getting.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed until it was gone and could honestly say that it was a big waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the eye that did not have the gel looked normal the next morning, while the eye that did have the gel looked extra puffy.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for years and was so excited to get it at amazon and not try to track down a representative.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s too far away from the bathroom</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim at a Mary Kay party, and after having it for several months I have to say it does feel really good to apply this to my tired eyes at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>So an older and perhaps borderline elderly woman who was in her 60s but actually looked 40 recommended this product to me</li>
            <li>The actual amount is not that much - but the product will last if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to do something extraordinary since it is only less than 15 bucks.</li>
            <li>More money wasted on a product that claims to reduce the under eye puffiness and dark cirles.  </li>
            <li>for wrinkles, puffiness, dark circles, or dry skin, I&#x27;m not at all convinced this eye gel does anything special.  </li>
            <li>Not expensive, easy to use, no reactions or ill effects, and IT WORKS!</li>

            <li> Not expensive, easy to use, no reactions or ill effects, and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> Waste of money but on a positive its the only Mary Kay product that has let me down</li>
            <li> Especially in the morning when your eyes are all puffy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but when I wake up the next morning I feel better rested because my eyes aren&#x27;t sore and baggy.</li>
            <li> But I am finally starting to see some slight wrinkling and generally dry skin, plus I&#x27;ve had dark circles since I was about 12, and this eye gel doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for any of that.  </li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, I thought my under eye puffiness actually looked worse afterward.  </li>
            <li> The third night, I decided to use it under one eye, but not the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry it didn&#x27;t work, but love the little jar.</li>
            <li> It does do some moisturizing and if I used it 3 or 4 times a day would probably help a bit with the wrinkles and dry skin, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to use a product that often to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use it several nights in a row, it also lightens up dark circles.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my little double chin flap and it seems to tighten it up.</li>
            <li> Also gentle for that under-eye area which is the thinnest skin on your body &amp; is very delicate.</li>
            <li> Nor have i ever had this issue with any other under eye gel.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I orders through Amazon because I hate dealing with in home sales</li>
            <li> I like getting it through Amazon instead of having to track down a Mary Kay lady.</li>
            <li> My eyes tend to need a little help quite often but even if you don&#x27;t have that problem</li>
            <li> My eyes are a little puffy underneath the eye</li>
            <li> and it helps a little.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money..</li>
            <li> I use this gel whenever my eyes feel heavy and puffy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It gives my under eye area a uncomfortable tingle, makes me tear up and cry-and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A little dab in the morning while drinking coffee or at night while watching a movie and the puff just goes away!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to decrease the wrinkles or not,</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past and forgotten how well it works.  </li>
            <li> I would have serious issues with the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Found less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my tired looking, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> but i was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Mary Kay products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people can give this a bad review.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is the best!  I have used it for years and was so excited to get it at amazon and not try to track down a representative.  You can keep this in the frig for super cooling around your eyes.  I use it most during allergy season.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  It&#x27;s so cool and refreshing on the eyes.  Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to decrease the wrinkles or not, but it sure seems like it helps.  Especially in the morning when your eyes are all puffy and dry.  Great Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me..Waste of my money..</li>
            <li> More money wasted on a product that claims to reduce the under eye puffiness and dark cirles.  Tried the product for over 3 months morning and night, it did not work.</li>
            <li> I use this gel whenever my eyes feel heavy and puffy. It feels cool right away, and it really does take away a lot of the puffiness overnight. If you use it several nights in a row, it also lightens up dark circles. I know it sounds crazy, but when I wake up the next morning I feel better rested because my eyes aren&#x27;t sore and baggy. And you only use a tiny bit at a time, so the jar lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my tired looking, puffy eyes. And I must say this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried refreshing eye gels. It makes my eyes look rested and it hydrates the fragile skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I am still amazed at the puffiness it removes around my eyes and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this regularly so when it is time for more she asks me to order a couple again. She likes the gel otherwise she would not have had me order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic eye gel.  It reduces puffiness and makes eyes look more well rested.  My eyes tend to need a little help quite often but even if you don&#x27;t have that problem it&#x27;s good to have this around for those occasional times when you&#x27;re preparing for a big event or just need to sooth your eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be somewhat like the La Brie Soothing Eye Gel.  It is not quite as good, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at a Mary Kay party, and after having it for several months I have to say it does feel really good to apply this to my tired eyes at the end of the day.  Very soothing, and if I kept it in the refrigerator I think it would feel even better - but that&#x27;s too far away from the bathroom and I&#x27;m never going to train myself to put on skin care products in the kitchen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for wrinkles, puffiness, dark circles, or dry skin, I&#x27;m not at all convinced this eye gel does anything special.  I&#x27;m 55 and have lived in Florida all my life so if it wasn&#x27;t for good genetics (thanks, Mom!) I would have serious issues with the skin around my eyes.  But I am finally starting to see some slight wrinkling and generally dry skin, plus I&#x27;ve had dark circles since I was about 12, and this eye gel doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for any of that.  It does do some moisturizing and if I used it 3 or 4 times a day would probably help a bit with the wrinkles and dry skin, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to use a product that often to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I don&#x27;t regret buying this, I do use it most nights, but I won&#x27;t buy it again when it&#x27;s finished.  I&#x27;m very happy other people have better results with it, and YMVV.  I&#x27;m just not convinced it&#x27;s good enough for older skin.</li>
            <li> I must be the exception to the rule with this product.  I only have occasional under eye puffiness and no dark circles, so I thought this would be ideal.  The first night I used it, I thought my under eye puffiness actually looked worse afterward.  I figured it was my imagination.  The 2nd time, I definitely noticed an increase.  The third night, I decided to use it under one eye, but not the other. Sure enough, the eye that did not have the gel looked normal the next morning, while the eye that did have the gel looked extra puffy.  I threw the gel away. I&#x27;m just glad that it didn&#x27;t cost too much.  Now, I hope my eyes return to normal.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I orders through Amazon because I hate dealing with in home sales, this makes it easy for me with no hassle!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Finding it on Amazon was wonderful, much easier to buy this way. Product came quickly, was package nicely. Really helps with the puffs under my eyes. If it&#x27;s kept in the fridge it feels even better once applied. Will keep using it !</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Provided a cooling feeling so you think it&#x27;s doing something but it doesn&#x27;t.  I didn&#x27;t even use it all and I LOVE Mary Kay products.  This is the ONLY one that wasn&#x27;t worth ever getting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people can give this a bad review. I have been hungover many times put this on go into work and have been told wow you look so awake today. Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I really tried to love thisâ€¦ but couldn&#x27;t. It gives my under eye area a uncomfortable tingle, makes me tear up and cry-and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Nor have i ever had this issue with any other under eye gel. I&#x27;m sorry it didn&#x27;t work, but love the little jar. I use it to make homemade eye cream in.</li>
            <li> Great price. Arrived earlier than expected. Will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> Love my Mary Kay.  Best products, sold,</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would soothe my eyes in the morning and reduce eye puffiness.  It did nothing.  My face was the same as before I applied the gel. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it makes any difference or has a \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; effect . Waste of money but on a positive its the only Mary Kay product that has let me down</li>
            <li> I happened to encounter this product when looking for some eye gel. I am a fan of eye gel which is much lighter and won&#x27;t bring extra trouble of fat granules. It is a safe product of doing a good job in moisturizing the eyes without bringing extra load. It is great for daily care if you only need a basic eye gel. Don&#x27;t expect it to do something extraordinary since it is only less than 15 bucks.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Soothing for puffy, itchy eyes. I put it on in the morning before makeup. It acts like a hemorrhoid cream - it shrinks the tissue swelling and gets rid of the puffiness. Plus it&#x27;s light - a gel, not a cream so it doesn&#x27;t ride up into the eye and irritate it. I also use it on my little double chin flap and it seems to tighten it up. I like getting it through Amazon instead of having to track down a Mary Kay lady.</li>
            <li> Not only does it appear to work immediately, it feels great.  It really is soothing.  I recommended my boyfriend to use it to.</li>
            <li> NO SO HOT. THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> So cooling and refreshing on  my tired eyes! Doesn&#x27;t lessen my wrinkles or bags, but it definitely feels great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> Very good!! Love the soothing fe.</li>
            <li> Great product. I wish there was more of this gel in the jar...I have sensitive eyes and this worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel.  Great deal with Amazon.  Bought two. One for me, one for my best friend.  I keep it in the frig. Feels great to put on at night and first thing in the morning.  Don&#x27;t put on right before mascara. Can make it smear.  Let it have time to soak in. I&#x27;d buy again. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good under my eyes.  My eyes are a little puffy underneath the eye so I use this and it helps a little.</li>
            <li> Avon quit selling their eye gel and I finally found a product that replaces it!  I have used this for years and it keeps the wrinkles from forming.</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products but i was not impressed with this product. I could not tell any difference in my eye area when I used this product. It was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I use the gel each morning after washing my face and it feels nice and cool on my puffy morning under eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a good product......</li>
            <li> So an older and perhaps borderline elderly woman who was in her 60s but actually looked 40 recommended this product to me and I have been using it for about 6 years now.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get her results, but I can definitely say I do not have those nagging aging lines around my eyes like friends in my age cohort (around 40).  The actual amount is not that much - but the product will last if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> great for under-eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> By all the reviews I would think this product is wonderful.  I found I like the Avon Total Radiance eye gel much, much better and soothes and depuffs a lot better.  It is cheaper and works better!!</li>
            <li> We buy jars of this and keep them in the fridge. A little dab in the morning while drinking coffee or at night while watching a movie and the puff just goes away! Not expensive, easy to use, no reactions or ill effects, and IT WORKS! I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the best thing ever created, just works for what I need. Puff reduction. :)</li>
            <li> Iv been using this on my face and love it very soothing under my eyes , along with prolonged use it will keep my skin hydrated &amp; facial elasticity better</li>
            <li> it cools for like 2 seconds and then it kind of stings  a bit. Does not get rid of morning puffiness</li>
            <li> I love this sooooo much, when my eyes are puffy from whatever, I use this and it&#x27;s like magic.  Side note: sometimes it takes awhile to work and may take multiple applications.</li>
            <li> For the price I was intrigued at the party. Bought it on a whim. But honestly it&#x27;s just a waste. The gel feels nice it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. There&#x27;s no point to putting it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay Indulge Soothing Eye Gel for a while now and it works great every time especial during allergy season.</li>
            <li> Used product prior with Marykay rep. who moved. Found less expensive on Amazon. Keep it in the frige or lunch w/ cool pack to freshen up during day. Work&#x27;s better cool.</li>
            <li> No noticable improvement yet (after only one use) , but I guess it needs some time.  The price was good.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past and forgotten how well it works.  Removes puffiness from under eyes and soothing as well.</li>
            <li> While I do like a lot of the Mary Kay skincare products, this one really doesn&#x27;t do the trick for reducing any puffiness under the eyes. I used it as directed until it was gone and could honestly say that it was a big waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Mary Kay products.  I&#x27;ve been using the skin care for 30 years &amp; I get compliments all the time.  And I get told I don&#x27;t look my age.  What more could a girl want?  This product in particular is great for those times when I wake up with the under-eye puffiness, it&#x27;s soothing &amp; helps reduce the swelling.  Also gentle for that under-eye area which is the thinnest skin on your body &amp; is very delicate.</li>
