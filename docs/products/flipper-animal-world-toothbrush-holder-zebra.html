            <li> Does not stay closed all the way, but very cute</li>
            <li> This toothbrush holder is so cute!  I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t fit my toothbrush, but it did.  It should fit most standard adult and children&#x27;s toothbrushes.  I would suggest leaving the stomach of the animal open, exposing the toothbrush to prevent the inside from smelling moldy.  I would say only close it when necessary, like when using cleaning products around the area your toothbrush holder is in.  It works well for it&#x27;s intended use and is pretty sturdy as it is suctioned to my bathroom mirror.  It is also very cute to look at; it puts a smile on my face every morning.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush holder is super cute. I take it when I travel and it always makes my hotel room more home-y.</li>
            <li> My son loves getting his toothbrush from this holder. Easy to get the toothbrush out and with just a push of the toothbrush in to click it close. Suction cup on the back of the holder holds it all in place with no problem.</li>
            <li> An adorable and very clean practical way to store your toothbrush! I have 2 different animals for my daughter and I and we just love them. Most important &#x3D; the suction holds extremely well. This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this little zebra. I have a giraffe and I bought this one for my sister in law. She loves it and the zebra and the giraffe look so cute next to each other!</li>
            <li> Bought it to match my gf&#x27;s toothbrush holder; she has a cow one. My bathroom sink is small so I don&#x27;t have space to buy those toothbrush stands ... this suction cup holder does the trick and save space! It also prevents dust or bugs getting onto the toothbrush. Got a lot of &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; compliments from my friends who saw me posting it on fb. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this but, after only a few short weeks of use, it started to grow mildew inside (right where the toothbrush sits -- ew!).  Completely grossed out, we went back to putting my daughter&#x27;s toothbrush in a cup in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have the giraffe and when I visited family it was hanging on the bathroom mirror, everyone loved it so had to buy a few and hand them out.  Also very practical, toothbrush dries out and has a nice spot of it&#x27;s own. Like to think housekeeping isn&#x27;t messing with my brush while on the road.</li>
            <li> Very helpfull for organizing toothbrushes. A bit closed in, not airy enough and got moho once. Still a good purchase</li>
            <li> Keeps the toothbrushes away from each other, preventing spread of infection if one child gets something (like strep). Cute and clean.</li>
            <li> i needed to get my toothbrush up off the shelf - for sanitation reasons, and this did the job with style and flare!</li>
            <li> After thinking about what goes on in the bathroom I wanted to find something to protect my daughters toothbrush so I got this. She loves zebras so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. It does everything you want it to, protects the toothbrush, looks cute and keeps the toothbrush off the counter. I do think it is a little pricey for a little piece of plastic the opens and shuts (not by its self). In the end I guess it&#x27;s worth it because it is my daughter I am protecting.</li>
            <li> We just got this toothbrush holder for our toddler and right away mounted it to the shower wall in his bathroom. He loves taking it out on his own and pretending to brush his own teeth. Very cute and functioning!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush holder is cute and did get my kid (4 years old) more interested in brushing.  BUT it I cannot get it to stick to the travertine tiles on my bathtub surround, even after thoroughly cleaning and wiping down with alcohol.  After a few hours, it would always fall off, even without a toothbrush in it.  If I hadn&#x27;t discarded the packaging, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> Our orthodontist hands these out to their patients (hmm... What do they know that the rest of us don&#x27;t?). So we bought three different ones for the rest of the family!  They suction cup really easily to a mirror, clean up easily, if they pop apart accidentally - they go back together very easily.  Very cute way to keep everyone&#x27;s brushes clean - and still allow them to dry properly.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and compact.  I was looking for toothbrush holders for my sons and wanted something that would be fun to put their toothbrush into with out breaking a proceline holder and that would vent the tooth brush.  These are great because they have fun taking them out and putting them in and they hold very well to the bathroom mirror.  I got a bunch of different ones and even one for me so I can brush my teeth with them.  They do need to be cleaned every onece in a while (as with all things), but do a great job of drying the toothbrush out yet keeping the brush enclosed and protected from other airborne germs.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and keep the tooth brush clean!</li>
            <li> My kids love this holders and I even use one for myself. Keeps the toothbrush from getting dust and very handy. We even took it on our vacation. The 2 suction cups work very well. I bought 4 of them.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush holder is perfect for kids, or anyone that is a kid at heart, who does not have drawers in the bathroom to keep their toothbrush in.  (I don&#x27;t like the ones that sit on the sink with toothbrush head out collecting germs and dust).  The suction on it is great and it is SO easy to grab the toothbrush out of there and put it back in.  Great design.  Would recommend any of the &amp;#34;flipper&amp;#34; toothbrush holders.  :)</li>
