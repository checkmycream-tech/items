            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>but it is my honest oppinion that it iz not genuine millennium &amp;#34;moms&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>only used for lines so far.</li>
            <li>Not sure what I think of that as the old lines are over five years old and the new ones are about two weeks old.</li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to the small round liners (3RL and 5RL) very well.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

            <li> ...heals dark and stays dark..</li>
