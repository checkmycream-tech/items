            <li> I had ringworm right below my hairline for a few years.</li>

            <li> It was highly recommended to me as being helpful in making nails harder and stop chipping so needless to say I was quite disappointed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I only used this product once as 1. When I took the lid off, it seemed there should have been a stem with a brush or something attached to be used for applying this to your fingernails, and it didn&#x27;t.  2.  I had to tip the bottle to get liquid on my finger and rub on each nail.  The odor was so offensive, I had to wash my hands several times to get rid of the smell and have not used it since.  It was highly recommended to me as being helpful in making nails harder and stop chipping so needless to say I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It helps deter foot odor and acne. It&#x27;s great from head to toe!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and it heals quickly.  Yes, it does have a funny odor but it works and thats all that matters.  I would definitely recommend this to all Mothers&#x27; because kids get all kinds of scrapes and scratches, might smell a little funny but at least its not &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;..!!</li>
            <li> Bought this same poduct at health store and paid a lot more.  Same brand.  I use it on my toenails.</li>
            <li> JASON brand is an outstanding brand that offers high quality. I found a lot of JASON products at my local Whole Foods store here in Houston and I trust what the suppliers at Whole Foods decides to put on their shelves. Thus, I&#x27;m glad that I can find this product on here. I would highly recommend this JASON tea tree oil becuase you can really tell of the high quality that you know and expect.</li>
            <li> It smells really strong, just like it should :) I can&#x27;t wait to use it for a homemade house cleaner!</li>
            <li> Our family uses it for dandruff and pimples. It works from the first time and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good and natural product</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for cuts, acne, and general skin stuff. Smells alright actually, not too wack. I use it for my dogs when they get fleas or hot spots and it seems to work nicely too.</li>
            <li> Good product! I use it for itchy scalp and it helps to soothe bug bites. For my scalp treatment I mix with jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Great tea tree oil, delivered prompt and is just what it says it is!</li>
            <li> This is pretty much a miracle in a bottle. I had ringworm right below my hairline for a few years. A half dollar size red mark that faded and came back from time to time. I read about tea tree and it&#x27;s uses, I put this on once in the morning and once in night and it went away in less than a few weeks. Hell, it works better than prescription $70 tubes I had to buy and apply to my ringworm. Great, and I put a few drops in my shampoo too :).</li>
            <li> Very effective for mild toe fungus if applied regularly.  Also good for minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I like the product but when I received it, it had leaked and looked like it had leaked even before it was shipped cause bottle has been taped up.</li>
            <li> I love this organic tea tree oil. It truly works wonders! It is good for skin irritations such as cuts and bruises. I have tried other brands, but Jason is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it - I use it for small scrapes, insect bites, acne, etc. and the size is perfect for travel. I only deducted one star because the photo of the picture shoes the USDA organic logo on it and the one I received does not have the USDA logo.  Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and would tell friends about it.  I will get some more later.  I have nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> If the product had a nicer smell I would have rated it higher but I find the smell to be very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I really love the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I really do like this tea tree oil, I use it on itch from mosquitoes, or other insects, and it works very well. I also use it sometimes for cleaning my body, and I like it.</li>
            <li> I love Jason products. I trust the brand  very much. I didn&#x27;t even read the reviews on this one and bought it. Never fail on Jason product. working well on my dogs&#x27; skin problem (it was sort of fungus allergy or something..). Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with an ounce or 2 of water and use it as a mouthwash, my oral health has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> Very potent stuff, you can tell the quality as soon as you get a whiff of it. It&#x27;s the first time that I&#x27;ve bought tea tree oil and from reading other reviews I&#x27;ve gathered that Jason is pretty high quality, they were right. Can&#x27;t beat the price either. I put it in my small humidifier and it fills the air with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husbands funky looking toenail. He has been using it daily for about a month and the nail look so much better; sandals are definitely a possibility this summer!! The smell is fine and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner without any breakage or leaks. It smells different than the tea tree oil by NOW that I got at Super Supplements. I haven&#x27;t yet used it (diluted) with my shampoo for dandruff, but I have used it for other purposes, and it seems to work the same.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had a skin tag on my neck and it does remove them.  It takes a little time but it does.</li>
            <li> This is the best Tea Tree oil to get, because it is ORGANICALLY grown.  You support this practice when you pay a little more for this over pesticide-sprayed Tea Tree oil.  People may not realize how important this is, but pesticide residue remains in everything that is sprayed with it!  We vote with our money spent, and my vote is for Organically-grown with sustainable methods!  I&#x27;m so glad to hear when farmers make a stand against Monsantozilla and the like, and know that the ONLY reason why it is cheaper is because it is HEAVILY government subsidized.  Let&#x27;s level the playing field and support Organically grown the same way!  Then we&#x27;ll see what people will naturally choose!  Products that are completely void of pesticide residue and GMO&#x27;s, of course!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne for years and have tried everything from medications to all sorts of treatments. This has been the only product that has worked for me. I found the best method is to first wash face, and then apply toner onto a cotton swab. Rub this around your face to remove excess dirt. Then apply this together with lotion over your face and the acne quickly disappears within a day. Great product</li>
            <li> I has an ingrown pimple in my eyebrow that left the area very red and swollen. A friend suggested I get this product because of its antiseptic qualities. Since this was also very painful, I sent my husband to Walgreens to buy this product. I applied this to the affected area and the pain, redness, and swelling began to dissipate. By Day 3 after using this, everything was gone and I felt fine. This also works on hang nails, sores, and skin infections.&lt;br /&gt;Great product but my husband paid about $12 plus tax for this. The price offered here even with shipping is a is far more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! I searched all over for the Tea Tree Oil with the best reviews on Amazon and this one was the best. I love the smell of this. I use it for many many things, including as a household cleaner, and for mold/mildew issues. I also use it in a healthy blend that I make with essential oils to aid in keeping sickness at bay in my home. It really works well for all of those things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order another bottle and I haven&#x27;t had this for a week yet.&lt;br /&gt;it cures everything from keloids to nasal polyps!</li>
