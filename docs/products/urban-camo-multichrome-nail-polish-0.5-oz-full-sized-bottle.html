            <li>Great color look just like what&#x27;s shown in the picture</li>
            <li>I got the shade shifter, and was so happy with it</li>
            <li>Another KBShimmer I love!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth what I paid for it!!!!</li>
            <li>Its beautiful and eye catching.</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I love this polish!</li>
            <li>This is one of the coolest colors I&#x27;ve ever seen, even better in person!</li>
            <li>love this polish!</li>
            <li>It is so unique and interesting as well as beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Love the holographic effects...</li>
            <li>Fantastic color and effect!</li>
            <li>love the color  </li>
            <li>I love it, and I am a 63 yr old great grandmother.  </li>
            <li>Fast service and amazing polishes.</li>
            <li>Lots of color shifts/flops depending on the ambient light.</li>
            <li>Truly, the KBShimmer polishes have become my favorites, because the quality is on par or above the store brands, and the great wear time.</li>
            <li>Just two coats of the Urban Camo created a dazzling effect.</li>
            <li>color is cool, changes with the light and movement.</li>
            <li>Super fun color but chips easily</li>
            <li>Takes three coats to get the true color to not be see-through.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a seriously fast drying top coat to put on it</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more intense color, just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>It was more holographic in natural light.</li>
            <li>Lucky nail polish..</li>
            <li>super pretty color!</li>
            <li>I seriously love this, too bad the camo is so perfect my nails become invisible.</li>
            <li>While the color is very pretty, it doesnt look exactly like the picture; it&#x27;s darker and there aren&#x27;t really any gold hues like in this pick.</li>
            <li>It arrived so fast and is exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>Will definitely try more colors...</li>
            <li>I put a solid color on first so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to used so much, worked out fine.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really pretty and shows differently in different light and angles.</li>
            <li>But those aren&#x27;t my real complaints.</li>
            <li>My real problem was spreading it on my nails and drying time.</li>
            <li>Spreads on really well.</li>
            <li>Compared to other holographs I found this to be almost more of a metallic gradient.</li>
            <li>It was transformative enough that I enjoyed wearing it, but I could still wear it at work because it was a gorgeous green in most artificial light.</li>
            <li>Better than the pictures, if you use a bass coat.</li>
            <li>Urban Camo is quickly making its way to the top of my favorites list, which currently houses three other KBShimmer poloshes in the Top Ten.</li>
            <li>It really brings out my inner child.</li>
            <li>The color shifts from a deep green to a bright purple, and in certain lighting it can appear steel gray, moss green, or even blue.</li>
            <li>While it takes forever to dry, it still dries just fast enough to make lumps.</li>
            <li>I put it over black to get it to really pop!</li>
            <li>Stays on and whole even when I&#x27;m dealing with sharp things, typing, and smashing my fingers at work.</li>
            <li>i used a blue base under this polish and it came out gorgeous!.</li>
            <li>She applied it over a matte black base coat and it looked awesome!</li>
            <li>...must use a good base and top coat polish, plus at least two coats of holographic polish to get a long lasting desirable effect...</li>

            <li> VERY pleased, even though it definitely takes at least 2 coats to reach full effect - or put on over black or white base coat.</li>
            <li> Because it sort of spread like old nail polish a little.</li>
            <li> The shift from soft to shocking to sweet to subtle is amazing, and I still catch myself staring at my nails all day, playing with lighting to find all the colors and shades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only has  the green color not two tone at all as the picture look like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see over a black coat.</li>
            <li> China Glaze, Essie, OPI, and Sally Hansen tend to chip, smudge, and/or wear down within a day or so no matter what I do to them.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;One coat over black or three coats by it</li>
            <li> In all reality its like thee coats over black and five to six coats by</li>
            <li> home, you&#x27;re in trouble.</li>
            <li> play with your base, mix your polishes, have fun with your nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for duo chromes.</li>
            <li> I can handle sitting still for 15 minutes, but seriously still smudges within even the slightest pressure after 1 hr?</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I tried this polish over a single coat of green base.</li>
            <li> Three coats over a base coat gives me total opacity and a kickass look that gets compliments from everyone.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the polish was just bad quality or if it got heat damage or something.</li>
            <li> Took about 3 coats over a base turquoise metallic coat for desired effect.</li>

            <li> I was very happy with this polish. I was looking to build my holograph collection when I came across this polish. Compared to other holographs I found this to be almost more of a metallic gradient. It was transformative enough that I enjoyed wearing it, but I could still wear it at work because it was a gorgeous green in most artificial light. It was more holographic in natural light. Took about 3 coats over a base turquoise metallic coat for desired effect. I&#x27;m curious to see over a black coat. I&#x27;m planning onbuying the purple/blue holographic polish from this brand. Also looking into the Color Club holographic line.</li>
            <li> Lucky nail polish..I have worn this 2 weeks in a row and the Packers have scored over 50 points in both games! Whoo-Hoo!</li>
            <li> While the color is very pretty, it doesnt look exactly like the picture; it&#x27;s darker and there aren&#x27;t really any gold hues like in this pick. Takes three coats to get the true color to not be see-through.  But those aren&#x27;t my real complaints. My real problem was spreading it on my nails and drying time. I can handle sitting still for 15 minutes, but seriously still smudges within even the slightest pressure after 1 hr? If you don&#x27;t have a seriously fast drying top coat to put on it and you have places to go and things to do, even just eating or going to the bathroom @ home, you&#x27;re in trouble. As for the spread/coating capabilities? Ridiculous. While it takes forever to dry, it still dries just fast enough to make lumps. I used to have problems once in a short while doing my nails in HS 12-16 years ago, but never have I messed up my nails 3 times. I wonder if the polish was just bad quality or if it got heat damage or something. Because it sort of spread like old nail polish a little.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this, too bad the camo is so perfect my nails become invisible.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;One coat over black or three coats by it&#x27;s self\\&quot;. In all reality its like thee coats over black and five to six coats by it&#x27;s self. I was looking for a more intense color, just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I tried this polish over a single coat of green base. Just two coats of the Urban Camo created a dazzling effect. The color shifts from a deep green to a bright purple, and in certain lighting it can appear steel gray, moss green, or even blue. I have yet to touch it up, and it&#x27;s lasted 48 hours with no chipping or wearing, even with all the typing I do. I love this color!</li>
            <li> Love the holographic effects...Great color look just like what&#x27;s shown in the picture...must use a good base and top coat polish, plus at least two coats of holographic polish to get a long lasting desirable effect...Will definitely try more colors...</li>
            <li> Another KBShimmer I love!!</li>
            <li> I got the shade shifter, and was so happy with it I got this urban camo. Better than the pictures, if you use a bass coat.</li>

            <li> This polish is to die for.  It is so unique and interesting as well as beautiful.  Spreads on really well.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! It arrived so fast and is exactly as pictured! I put it over black to get it to really pop! Its beautiful and eye catching. I&#x27;ve bought from KBShimmer before, and will continue to do so. Fast service and amazing polishes.</li>
            <li> Such a brautiful color. I&#x27;m a sucker for duo chromes. ❤️💅❤️💅❤️</li>
            <li> I love it, and I am a 63 yr old great grandmother.  It really brings out my inner child.</li>
            <li> I like this color, it&#x27;s really pretty and shows differently in different light and angles. However, it doesn&#x27;t last well. It was quite chipped by the third day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only has  the green color not two tone at all as the picture look like.</li>
            <li> This is one of the coolest colors I&#x27;ve ever seen, even better in person! This is officially one of my favorites!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this color for my wife. She applied it over a matte black base coat and it looked awesome! Lots of color shifts/flops depending on the ambient light. She got compliments everywhere she went.</li>
