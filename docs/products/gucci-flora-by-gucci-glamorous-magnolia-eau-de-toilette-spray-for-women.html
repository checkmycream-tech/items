            <li>Perfect product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>OMG best perfume everrr!!!</li>
            <li>Gucci Flora is the Best perfume i found in years.  </li>
            <li>Great pice for the size too!</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so wonderful that I bought a bottle for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is breathtaking!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and how great it smells!</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>very nice.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I found this perfume at Nordstrom&#x27;s for $100 and decided I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I must say that the packaging is lovely and of good quality</li>
            <li>This is one breakoff fragrance from the Gucci Flora line, all of which are popular.  </li>
            <li>Even after a 10 hour work day, and an hour work out each time, by the end of the day, the scent still lingered on me.&lt;br /&gt;Flora by Gucci has three scents and while all three scents, Gorgeous Gardenia, Glamorous Magnolia, and Gracious Tuberose were magnificent and up to part, my favorite, hands down, is Glamorous Magnolia.</li>
            <li>but it was not my favorite of the floral collection.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed getting to try out Flora by Gucci Campaign.  </li>
            <li>I received many compliments and questions about what I was wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the scent that lasted the longest of all three and received the most compliments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I already have the Gucci Flora Glamorous Gardenia and love it</li>
            <li>If you love floral and/or fruity scents, you will love this one.</li>
            <li>Been wanting this perfume for a while now, much better to buy it via Amazon than at Macy&#x27;s or Sephora.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more of this soon.</li>
            <li>For some reason the one in the store smells so much better.</li>
            <li>Bought this with tuberose together, I like tuberose scent better.</li>
            <li>Truly love this scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>Magnolia is a very sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Shipping and service were fast and in good shape when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>I received samples and coupons as a BzzAgent which allowed me to thoroughly and accurately review this</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think you should use a name that doesn&#x27;t fit the product.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and is way more affordable then Macy&#x27;s or other department stores.</li>
            <li>This one is also fabulous and it arrived quickly ...</li>
            <li>The cost varies quite a bit, but I felt this was a pretty good deal for a fairly new fragrance.</li>
            <li>the scent must be potent enough that when you walk by someone they can pleasantly enjoy the aroma, but not so overwhelming that it creates nausea or headaches.</li>
            <li>It was a great price for the size compared to other department stores.</li>
            <li>I liked it well enough</li>
            <li>The scent is soft, femine and sexy...</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to certain smells; I get nausea, dizziness and headaches very easily, so that is why I am picky in what I wear.</li>
            <li>Nice scent for day time activities, lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and was much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>I expected Magnolia to smell like my beautiful Southern Magnolia tree blossoms with a hint of lemon</li>
            <li>Gucci Flora does not let you down when you want to smell like a pretty lady!!!!</li>
            <li>I believe scent triggers certain memories and helps us retain those memories as well.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this line.</li>
            <li>This is a timeless and very feminine scent it will never go out of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>much alcohol (((</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>and I have been given this product by the company to review this product and give an honest  opinion based on my everyday experience.</li>
            <li>This way interested buyers can have a  detailed description of its long term use.</li>
            <li>Forget what all the negative comments says this product is worth the money the smell is soooo great and long lasting not like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>She had previously received a sample and enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>She likes this one in particular.  </li>
            <li>high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend the Flora by Gucci collection, to anyone that loves to feel feminine and serene, without overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>I had to give this only one star because I really don&#x27;t like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is old and does not smell like it should.  </li>
            <li>and they told me that places like Amazon buy there old products, one they won&#x27;t sell because they will not smell like they should.  </li>
            <li>the quality is such that you really don&#x27;t need a lot.  </li>
            <li>It was created in 2012 so the smell is fresh, the product is half the price</li>
            <li>Every time I moved, I could smell the delicateness of these perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The real test would be how long the scent would last.</li>
            <li>Maybe next time I will get directly from the store</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I saw that it was about half the price on here</li>
            <li> This one is a little bit stronger than tuberose.</li>
            <li> However, it can get heavy so a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have to FORCE myself not to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> also a lot less expensive than paying $100 at Macys.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Magnolia is a very sweet scent. Classic and somewhat plain. Perfect for springtime or day wear. However, it can get heavy so a little goes along way. I liked it well enough but it was not my favorite of the floral collection. This is a timeless and very feminine scent it will never go out of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I am a bzzagent and I have been given this product by the company to review this product and give an honest  opinion based on my everyday experience. This way interested buyers can have a  detailed description of its long term use. I do not receive any monetary compensation for my review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my  gf, she is 24 and she loved it. It was created in 2012 so the smell is fresh, the product is half the price so get one while you can.</li>
            <li> very nice. Perfect product. high quality. I recommand it.My girlfriend gave me a big kiss when she got this gift.thanks.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I received this product as part of the Flora by Gucci Bzz Campaign. I received samples and coupons as a BzzAgent which allowed me to thoroughly and accurately review this product.&lt;br /&gt; I am someone who loves scent. I believe scent triggers certain memories and helps us retain those memories as well. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to try out Flora by Gucci Campaign.  When choosing a scent I look for a few two key elements...the scent must be potent enough that when you walk by someone they can pleasantly enjoy the aroma, but not so overwhelming that it creates nausea or headaches. And lastly, a scent must be long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I found my requirements to be met with the Flora by Gucci collection. After my shower I would carefully put the perfume on, and then would proceed with my work day. I received many compliments and questions about what I was wearing. I am sensitive to certain smells; I get nausea, dizziness and headaches very easily, so that is why I am picky in what I wear. I had no issues with this collection. Every time I moved, I could smell the delicateness of these perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The real test would be how long the scent would last. I was pleasantly surprised at the results. Even after a 10 hour work day, and an hour work out each time, by the end of the day, the scent still lingered on me.&lt;br /&gt;Flora by Gucci has three scents and while all three scents, Gorgeous Gardenia, Glamorous Magnolia, and Gracious Tuberose were magnificent and up to part, my favorite, hands down, is Glamorous Magnolia. It&#x27;s the scent that lasted the longest of all three and received the most compliments.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d highly recommend the Flora by Gucci collection, to anyone that loves to feel feminine and serene, without overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> Forget what all the negative comments says this product is worth the money the smell is soooo great and long lasting not like the cheap stuff. I love it and will buy it again when I run out. If you have second thoughts don&#x27;t just buy it it&#x27;s awesome!!!! I promiseee. OMG best perfume everrr!!!</li>
            <li> I already have the Gucci Flora Glamorous Gardenia and love it so I wanted to try another scent.  This one is also fabulous and it arrived quickly ... also a lot less expensive than paying $100 at Macys.  If you love floral and/or fruity scents, you will love this one.</li>
            <li> Been wanting this perfume for a while now, much better to buy it via Amazon than at Macy&#x27;s or Sephora.  Love this perfume</li>
            <li> I had to give this only one star because I really don&#x27;t like this fragrance.  I expected Magnolia to smell like my beautiful Southern Magnolia tree blossoms with a hint of lemon but instead this smells like something my Grandmother may have worn 50 years ago!  Maybe it is just me, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like a magnolia at all!  I must say that the packaging is lovely and of good quality but I would never buy this if the smell I was going for was magnolia.  I just don&#x27;t think you should use a name that doesn&#x27;t fit the product.  I felt a bit tricked!</li>
            <li> I found this perfume at Nordstrom&#x27;s for $100 and decided I loved it.  I saw that it was about half the price on here and so I ordered it.  It is old and does not smell like it should.  I am very disappointed.  I had to repurchase it from Nordstrom&#x27;s and they told me that places like Amazon buy there old products, one they won&#x27;t sell because they will not smell like they should.  BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how is smell...&lt;br /&gt;To much alcohol (((</li>
            <li> Smells great and is way more affordable then Macy&#x27;s or other department stores. I plan on purchasing more of this soon.</li>
            <li> For some reason the one in the store smells so much better. I dont know if its the same potency. Maybe next time I will get directly from the store</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teenage daughter.  She had previously received a sample and enjoyed it.  This is one breakoff fragrance from the Gucci Flora line, all of which are popular.  She likes this one in particular.  Shipping and service were fast and in good shape when it arrived.  The cost varies quite a bit, but I felt this was a pretty good deal for a fairly new fragrance.</li>
            <li> Gucci Flora is the Best perfume i found in years.  I get compliments every time I wear it, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Nice scent for day time activities, lasts a very long time. Great pice for the size too!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It lasts all day and my husband compliments me every time I wear it. I would certainly recommend this line.</li>
            <li> Gucci Flora does not let you down when you want to smell like a pretty lady!!!! I am ordering another bottle to keep with me</li>
            <li> Great deal. one of the wifes&#x27; favs. Got this big bottle for about what she was paying at the retail store for a bottle half this size.</li>
            <li> Bought this with tuberose together, I like tuberose scent better. This one is a little bit stronger than tuberose. Just personal preference</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and was much cheaper than in the stores. Very pleased with this purchase and how great it smells!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  It was a great price for the size compared to other department stores.</li>
            <li> Truly love this scent.  the quality is such that you really don&#x27;t need a lot.  The scent is soft, femine and sexy... I get a lot of compliments on this - from men and women.  Would definitely recommend if you fancy the scent of Magnolia&#x27;s in spring</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this Gucci Flora Glamorous Magnolia Eau de Toilette is simply divine!  I have to FORCE myself not to use it everyday.  This fragrance is so wonderful that I bought a bottle for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She loves it too!</li>
            <li> This perfume is breathtaking! If I had the money I would collect all the Gucci flora collection collection. This is one of my favorite.</li>
