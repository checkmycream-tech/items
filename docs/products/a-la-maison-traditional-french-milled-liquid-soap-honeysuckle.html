            <li>This is by far the BEST hand soap that I have EVER used!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves hands soft and smelling wonderful</li>
            <li>the pump works great; dispenses just the right amount with one pump.  </li>
            <li>Now - they are perfectly fine within days of using this!  </li>
            <li>I love the way this soap makes my skin feel, but found the fragrance so lite that you almost can&#x27;t smell it at all.  </li>
            <li>I also use the rosemary mint and that has more smell, so I will stick with it.</li>
            <li>I love the soap -- its scent and feel.  </li>
            <li>It seems more moisturizing than softsoap too.  </li>
            <li>It makes the whole room smell great.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>Nice mild aroma and not drying at all.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible - and for the price, definitely worth it - even with shipping - though I found it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li>The other scents are great too!</li>
            <li>Perhaps they&#x27;ve changed their formula very recently because aside from the great lavender smell, this soap doesn&#x27;t cut it as a quality</li>
            <li>Every different smell is great.</li>
            <li>Great present too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I am the kind of guy who loves Trader Joe&#x27;s French Liquid Soap.</li>
            <li>Because I like it so much I am willing to pay more to have it.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s not filmy &amp; rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which is amazing!</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this at TJ Maxx for much cheaper</li>
            <li>It has no SLS, no parabens, no chemical poisonous stuff in it, the smell is great and a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li>The aroma is awesome and the hands do not dry out like other hand soaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but it smells great</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to drive out to Trader Joe&#x27;s and stock-up on their soap to make it worth my time &amp; money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SLS free, smells great &amp; natural (due to essential oils, not chemicals) and leaves your hands smooth.  </li>
            <li>Pretty fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is one I have with many pump systems.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely throwing out my softsoap bottles and getting more of these.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy any other kind of hand soap.</li>
            <li>I love A la Maison products and this one is no different, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it &amp;#34;lavender.&amp;#34; There seem to be some other smells blended in there that are just a tad too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand, and use it for hands and shower.</li>
            <li>I like this soap that it is gentle on hands.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty sensitive nose, so if I don&#x27;t smell it that&#x27;s saying something.  </li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find the sweet spot to get the pump to dispense.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it sell fantastic, but it has actually helped with my eczema!</li>
            <li>so I need something very natural.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s too cheap to refill their liquid soap; so they just add a little water to the almost-empty bottle and shake it around?</li>
            <li>Makes my hands feel soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps hands soft and not drying.</li>
            <li>At first, the soap felt like it left a residue - but this was just an adjustment (briefly) from my old soap.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low and found it on amazon.</li>

            <li> I love A la Maison products and this one is no different, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it &amp;#34;lavender.&amp;#34; There seem to be some other smells blended in there that are just a tad too strong for my taste. I think I will stick with the rosemary mint from now on.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy lather and wonderful lavender scent. I really like this brand, and use it for hands and shower. Big bottle, only need a drop. It will last forever.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this soap. Smells like pine not lavender..</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am the kind of guy who loves Trader Joe&#x27;s French Liquid Soap. Problem is I don&#x27;t have time to go all the way out to the store and the price is too expensive on Amazon. Other than the low price, the only reason I bought the A La Maison soap was because of all the glowing reviews. Perhaps they&#x27;ve changed their formula very recently because aside from the great lavender smell, this soap doesn&#x27;t cut it as a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite simply, it&#x27;s way too watered-down which may be why it is so affordable. You ever been to a bathroom in a bar that&#x27;s too cheap to refill their liquid soap; so they just add a little water to the almost-empty bottle and shake it around? That&#x27;s what this soap almost felt like to me. All French soaps have oils in them that should make the product viscous; the one I received was way too diluted. Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to drive out to Trader Joe&#x27;s and stock-up on their soap to make it worth my time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> I love the way this soap makes my skin feel, but found the fragrance so lite that you almost can&#x27;t smell it at all.  I have a pretty sensitive nose, so if I don&#x27;t smell it that&#x27;s saying something.  I also use the rosemary mint and that has more smell, so I will stick with it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. The aroma is awesome and the hands do not dry out like other hand soaps. All in all a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It smells great and has no bad ingredients. I used to be able to find this at TJ Maxx for much cheaper but I can&#x27;t find anymore. Because I like it so much I am willing to pay more to have it. The other scents are great too!</li>
            <li> This is great soap. It smells fantastic, lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this soap is a lifesaver for me. I use it as a body wash and this is the only soap I let even my kids use. It has no SLS, no parabens, no chemical poisonous stuff in it, the smell is great and a little goes a loooong way. Love and love it! Every different smell is great.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this soap, I want nothing else ever! I get compliments from every one who tries it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Trader Joe&#x27;s French Liquid hand soap for years.  When my local TJ&#x27;s ran out of stock I started shopping around for an alternative.  I found it in A La Maison&#x27;s French Liquid Soap Lavender Aloe.  This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> On time delivery! Makes washing hands at the kitchen sink a pleasure.</li>
            <li> Pretty fragrance.  Makes my hands feel soft. ty.</li>
            <li> This soap smells awesome!!  I received it for a Christmas gift &amp; bought some for myself.  It&#x27;s not cheap but it smells great &amp; it&#x27;s not filmy &amp; rinses clean.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Only negative is that I&#x27;ve never seen it sold in stores, not even Whole Foods.  I like the label design too &amp; the pump works great; dispenses just the right amount with one pump.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the soap -- its scent and feel.  My only issue is one I have with many pump systems.  It took me a long time to find the sweet spot to get the pump to dispense.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star purchase.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Would defenitely buy it again.. Great present too. The smell makes you feel great. B.H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not turn Blue-green when it pours out of a metal spout. (I pured it in a glas bottle with a meatal spout)</li>
            <li> I am definitely throwing out my softsoap bottles and getting more of these.  It&#x27;s SLS free, smells great &amp; natural (due to essential oils, not chemicals) and leaves your hands smooth.  It seems more moisturizing than softsoap too.  It has no parabens or other weird chemicals that are common in drugstore soaps.  The packaging is nice too.  I only used it for my hands, not body - but it says you can use it for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small update:  At first, the soap felt like it left a residue - but this was just an adjustment (briefly) from my old soap.  Then, that feeling went away.  And, my hands NEVER got dry again!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I was pouring on the moisturizer every day in the winter because of how dry / chapped my skin was from using softsoap.  Now - they are perfectly fine within days of using this!  It&#x27;s amazing.  This stuff is incredible - and for the price, definitely worth it - even with shipping - though I found it at Whole Foods so you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping obviously.  I&#x27;m not sure if all Whole Foods carry it.</li>
            <li> I like this soap that it is gentle on hands.  It has a very thin consistency so I guess they don&#x27;t put other artificial ingredients to thicken it.  Nice mild aroma and not drying at all. I do have skin allergy so I need something very natural. Keeps hands soft and not drying.</li>
            <li> So moisturizing and soothing for my hands.  A little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> This soap has the cleanest lavender small ever.  It makes the whole room smell great.  This product leaves your hands very soft and smelling just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our Paris Spa Party - Using as my Guest Bathroom Soap!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT NO ISSUES JUST WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I love the smell! A bit pricey but I like that this soap doesn&#x27;t have sulfates and feels great on my hands.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST hand soap that I have EVER used!!! Not only does it sell fantastic, but it has actually helped with my eczema! This soap leaves your hands feeling clean, smelling great, and moisturized!! I will never buy any other kind of hand soap.</li>
            <li> Leaves hands soft and smelling wonderful</li>
            <li> My cousins wife got this as a sample from her work, and the minute I used it I knew I had to have it. I searched high and low and found it on amazon. So glad I did.</li>
