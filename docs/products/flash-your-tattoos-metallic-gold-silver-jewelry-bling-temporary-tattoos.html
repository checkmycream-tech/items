            <li>we are enjoying these tattoos, my 10 year old twin girls and I.</li>
            <li>So fun.</li>
            <li>They are so much fun to wear.</li>
            <li>My kids are having a lot of fun playing &amp;#34;dress</li>
            <li>and it was so easily applied that the paper backing pretty much slid off.</li>
            <li>The designs were spectacular, it was super easy to put on, and to my surprise, they lasted much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Right on time for festival season, and I&#x27;m considering using these rather than henna for my wedding ceremony.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>They go on really easy, even my 6 year old was applying these tattoos without any assistance.</li>
            <li>They saved me all the grief of primping and I was able to have a lovely night out feeling beautiful-</li>
            <li>There were many different ones to choose from.</li>
            <li>just apply before the last top coat.</li>
            <li>The color and sheen of the foils are also of higher quality than I&#x27;ve seen before.</li>
            <li>I followed instructions exactly as stated and the tattoos still rubbed off within a day.</li>
            <li>They are elegant enough for me, and safe enough for my kids.</li>
            <li>While the designs are very pretty, the quality was far less superior.</li>
            <li>I completely lucked out because I got these at a discount in exchange for a review, however I would pay full price anytime.</li>
            <li>Some tattoos did not even last the full day and would rub off within hours!</li>
            <li>Even out in the middle of nowhere they were easy to use.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have any real tattoos so for me</li>
            <li>Fast shipping  too.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied by the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Having 2 daughters who absolutely adore temporary tattoos, I had to get these.</li>
            <li>Thier resiliance during application is notable, as other I&#x27;ve used fall apart, or dont adhere well to skin.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the temporary tattoos, I think they are a fun way to achieve the look of a tattoo without the permanency of one.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is how sweat-resistant these tatoos have proven to be (and I&#x27;m a pretty seriously sweaty lady when I dance).</li>
            <li>They also have several pages with such a huge variety of tattoos to choose from.  </li>
            <li>The girls love using the small sparkly ones for their nail art and the tattoos work quite well.</li>
            <li>My friend actually thought I had new bracelets on my wrists one day when she noticed them and was so surprised when I explained what they were.</li>
            <li>Other ones just looked plain ol cheap!</li>
            <li>I was also incredibly surprised that they lasted so long.</li>
            <li>As you can see in the video it took less than a minute to apply and has stayed on very well.</li>
            <li>They were very easy to apply and they stay on for quite a while, at least a few days, unless you are in the water a lot (during summer when you are in the pool they may only last a day or so.)</li>
            <li>I have previously ordered temporary body tattoos such as these, but they never applied right or would partially apply</li>

            <li> We had such a good time with these beautiful foil tatoos. They are easy to put on and look great. The quality was really good, I was surprised . There were many different ones to choose from. Will defiantly wear these for my next night out on the town.😍</li>
            <li> we are enjoying these tattoos, my 10 year old twin girls and I. The tattoos go on easily, the girls can apply themselves, and they stay on for a fair amount of time.  The girls love using the small sparkly ones for their nail art and the tattoos work quite well. just apply before the last top coat. They are the hit of the school. fast shipping and good customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited, my Tatoos arrived in the mail very quickly and they are BEAUTIFUL!! Super easy to put on and they look fantastic. Lots of people stopped to compliment me on them. I&#x27;m not a girl that&#x27;s huge on cosmetics but these took all the work out of looking beautiful. I completely lucked out because I got these at a discount in exchange for a review, however I would pay full price anytime. They saved me all the grief of primping and I was able to have a lovely night out feeling beautiful- stress free.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these beautiful flash tats! Excited to use them!</li>
            <li> Really great deal they come on really bold! And last a long time. I wore it to EDC and sweated alot and they were still good as new. Keep in mind they are a pain to get off though!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the temporary tattoos, I think they are a fun way to achieve the look of a tattoo without the permanency of one.  These are also great for young kids, and they enjoy putting them on as much as the tattoo itself.  The Silver &amp; Gold Foil tattoos from Satori Loka are simply beautiful.  They also have several pages with such a huge variety of tattoos to choose from.  They were very easy to apply and they stay on for quite a while, at least a few days, unless you are in the water a lot (during summer when you are in the pool they may only last a day or so.) I really like these and would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> Divine! So fun. These temp foil tatoos are the highest quality I&#x27;ve found, plus the designs are completely unique and captivating. Thier resiliance during application is notable, as other I&#x27;ve used fall apart, or dont adhere well to skin. The color and sheen of the foils are also of higher quality than I&#x27;ve seen before. My favorite is how sweat-resistant these tatoos have proven to be (and I&#x27;m a pretty seriously sweaty lady when I dance). Also very easy to remove, and are non-irritating ot my skin. Right on time for festival season, and I&#x27;m considering using these rather than henna for my wedding ceremony. Will be reordering!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved my tats! These flash tats are easy to use and look great! I wore them for a musical festival in Vegas, and then again for the 4th of July. I would strongly recommend this company to anyone who wants a quality flash tattoo!</li>
            <li> These are the best tattoos that I&#x27;ve tried!  I love all the designs but the turquoise ones are my favorite of all.  They are so much fun to wear. I don&#x27;t have any real tattoos so for me this is really fun trying these and then being able to remove them. I use baby oil on mine when I am ready to remove them and it takes them off with very little fuss. I get all kinds of compliments when I wear these. They look pretty realistic too. My friend actually thought I had new bracelets on my wrists one day when she noticed them and was so surprised when I explained what they were. I love the versatility of these tattoos as well. They sure are a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Having two little girls they are always wanting to look and be fashionable. These temporary tattoos can provide my girls with that sense without permanency! I have previously ordered temporary body tattoos such as these, but they never applied right or would partially apply and I would have to toss them. Other ones just looked plain ol cheap! Although my hopes weren&#x27;t too high because of my previous experience, I must say I am thoroughly impressed! These tattoos come with 5 sheets of various designs of gold and silver tattoos. My set even came with some that U.S. A turquoise color (those are mommys)! They are way too adorable...they included a small sheet of designs that had a diamond as well! Impressive! I cut out my girls chosen design and placed it on their arms. I literally just wet the tattoo with water and it was so easily applied that the paper backing pretty much slid off. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about trying to remove the paper while avoiding any breakage of the tattoos! Taking the tattoos off your skin is easy too!  These are high quality and super cute! It&#x27;s also a great value for the price! If my girls are happy...mommy is happy! These work well on kids and adults! I am obsessed with these! *i purchased these for review during a promotional period. These are my own honest and unbiased opinions*</li>
            <li> I LOVED these tattoos! The designs were spectacular, it was super easy to put on, and to my surprise, they lasted much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Super fun!  My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and long lasting. Fast shipping  too.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these tattoos. I&#x27;ve used similar ones in the past and liked them, but the variety included in this pack were great! I took them on a camping trip with friends and even the guys wanted in on them. Even out in the middle of nowhere they were easy to use. I liked how they were slightly adhesive so you could place your tattoo just how you wanted it. And it only took a little water to get it to transfer to your skin. We got really creative with how we used them and they looked great. I was also incredibly surprised that they lasted so long. One I placed on my inner forearm lasted close to two weeks! I received the product at a discount in exchange for an honest review and let me tell you - honestly, I would buy these again when I run out...but there are so many included I still have a generous stash to enjoy for a while. Great product and buy.</li>
            <li> Very cute and super easy to use metallic temporary tattoos offer a little style to your skin. This pack of designs include some very cool egyptian style with a really pretty cleopatra design. Also included are feathers and peacocks as well as a large variety or armband tattoos.  As you can see in the video it took less than a minute to apply and has stayed on very well. No peeling and no tattered edges here! Would be awesome for anyone who wants a little temporary shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~FULL DISCLOSURE~ I was offered this product at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> these are very cool gold temporary tattoos and they have a great design, also the packaging is very nice if you&#x27;re considering giving them as a gift</li>
            <li> I posted a review before but I guess it got deleted. I am very unsatisfied by the quality of this product. While the designs are very pretty, the quality was far less superior. I followed instructions exactly as stated and the tattoos still rubbed off within a day. Some tattoos did not even last the full day and would rub off within hours! I would not buy these again. Very unhappy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Having 2 daughters who absolutely adore temporary tattoos, I had to get these. These are really great! They go on really easy, even my 6 year old was applying these tattoos without any assistance. There are 5 sheets of really beautiful tattoos, including feathers, necklaces, even a dream catcher! My kids are having a lot of fun playing &amp;#34;dress up&amp;#34; with these, and I am happy that they are non toxic. I even set a few aside for myself, I plan to wear them to the next work party my husband drags me to. They are elegant enough for me, and safe enough for my kids. What could be better?&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: I received this product  at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
