            <li>Even if you are not diabetic this is a good thing to do.</li>
            <li>this emjoi micro pedi nano will be a good friend.</li>
            <li>the idea is good bu</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>feel like this product is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Then I remembered all the good amazon reviews &amp; said this must work somehow, I must be using it incorrectly..</li>
            <li>I also am extremely happy with the prompt, efficient and courteous service from SHAVENOW, the company I purchased</li>
            <li>to get them in in good condition again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was counting on the good reviews and thought it would do the job.</li>

            <li>But it was good and did the job.</li>
            <li>a product does not have good ratings on amazon</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this product has good reviews.</li>
            <li>It was a good choice.</li>
            <li>Follow up with a good moisturizing foot lotion.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Safe!</li>

            <li>So easy to use and it greatly reduced my calluses......</li>
            <li>It is amazing, I am in love with it!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, I purchased the electric one and it has good power and is very easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>The shape of the Emjoi fits the hand very nicely and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is great for travel and light foot up keep.</li>
            <li>This thing is really amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really amazing</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful I found this amazing device and my feet feel healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My feet feel amazing.</li>
            <li>but there has been an amazing difference and feel in rubbing my feet together at night in bed.</li>
            <li>which is amazing considering the condition I&#x27;ve got my feet in).</li>
            <li>Great way to remove a callus and keep your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>it is absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li>The cord is a not too secure when attached but this works great.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My feet are smooth after, but still \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on the sheets - I think polishing them somehow would be great - just have to figure out</li>
            <li>was using Dr Scholl&#x27;s callus pads and liked them a lot.</li>
            <li>With this you can do your own pedicures.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they offered a combination pkg replacement cylinders.</li>
            <li>The person to whom I gave it was thrilled and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  </li>
            <li>My friend really liked it too</li>
            <li>The device never even got warm during use.</li>
            <li>your spouse/roommate/partner can use it too and they can have their own roll.</li>
            <li>this micro- pedi , nano callus remove work nice</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t own shares in the company or know anyone that works there.</li>
            <li>I own both models.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Works wonderful and gently</li>
            <li>It has two speeds which is nice.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned and used the battery Emjoi which I really like but the plug in version is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is exceptional, nothing has ever worked better for me, easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll make my own.</li>
            <li>My daughter tried it also and really liked the results.  </li>
            <li>Nice variety of emery files.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a plug in rather than batteries.</li>
            <li>Its best not to do it immediately after getting out of the shower or after taking off the shoes you&#x27;ve been wearing all day as your feet will have been basting in sweat that whole time.</li>
            <li>Nice idea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the battery operated and loved them, but when I bought this one I realized it is much better.  </li>
            <li>podiatrist recommended that I try this kind of product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, after reading horror stories about the tools used in some salons for getting a pedicure, we decided that we needed a tool to help us perform pedicures at home.</li>
            <li>absolutely the BEST!  </li>
            <li>So effective.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I love it and how a good job it does on your feet.</li>
            <li>I bought a refill roller for every person in the house so that everyone can have their own.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of pumice and lotion on the market.  </li>
            <li>so it seems it should be used every 2 weeks to keep your feet looking and feeling nice.</li>
            <li>this is absolutely the best pedicure kit.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!!  </li>
            <li>Does just what I hoped -- easy to use and quite effective!</li>
            <li>Very nice light weight tool with two speed settings,\.</li>
            <li>They look and feel beautiful, for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend the Emjoi AND this great company!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this item is the best!  </li>
            <li>this unit is my new best friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying this i bought the &amp;#34;Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp Brown&amp;#34; - It&#x27;s amazing and takes seconds to see great results, plus you don&#x27;t need electricity or batteries.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t think that I will need to use this anymore than once a week to keep my be looking great, healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>where and is easy to handle (good ergonomics).  </li>
            <li>It would be very easy to do.</li>
            <li>It is effortless to use and gets rid of the calluses within minutes and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does work and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It has two speeds, and the rollers are very, very easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>I got great results the very first time I used the Micro Pedi.</li>
            <li>This is the product I have been looking for, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoothing action is awesome however it doesn&#x27;t work for me as a stand alone tool for the cracks on my heels.</li>
            <li>Very happy so far with the results from the Emjoi corded Micro-Pedi Callus Remover</li>
            <li>I tried 3 others of this type and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>This product is the most amazing thing in the world</li>
            <li>This is by far the best callus remover I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>But I think I&#x27;d do better with a power sander honestly.</li>
            <li>I have a professional pedicure once a month, and even they can&#x27;t get all the callouses off, so this is perfect for smoothing my heels in between visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the battery operated kind.  </li>
            <li>It is a great tool for maintaining your feet and a bonus is that your feet shine so nice and pretty when you&#x27;re done with your treatment.</li>
            <li>So easy a cave (wo)man can do it!</li>
            <li>very nice and powerful.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft now.. Love it!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great little gadget , works great !!!</li>
            <li>It was battery operated, this is a much better product for me and more cost effective.</li>
            <li>It is more like an electric razor and very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It feels so great to &#x27;feel my heels&#x27; for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve seen my feet look this great in years...</li>
            <li>Leaves your feet very smooth.</li>
            <li>Reviews are very important to me.  </li>
            <li>And it is nice to know how easily I can keep them looking and feeling that way.</li>
            <li>Really nice and easy on the feet.</li>
            <li>its ok but not as strong and effective was advertised</li>
            <li>Best of all super fast..</li>
            <li>More importantly, my heels love this!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item</li>
            <li>Love that it is corded</li>
            <li>plus I love going barefoot most of the time</li>
            <li>My feet look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>Make sure your moisturize after each use.</li>
            <li>I love that&#x27;s its a plug in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>because when she does her feet with a stone - or I do her feet with a stone - she uses alot more force.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I got this.</li>
            <li>I look forward to having smooth feet from now on!</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk!  </li>
            <li>i love this one with the cord, batteries operated ones are not the way to go.</li>
            <li>Glad I got the corded one.  </li>
            <li>Probably has more power and no batteries to buy.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, and was impressed immediately.</li>
            <li>I can now wear cute ballet slipper shoes without pain.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>More power.</li>
            <li>Love this Emjoi callus remover.</li>
            <li>Really works great, I love it.</li>
            <li>this callus remover works really great an takes callus off fast love</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>So glad i got this model that you plug into the wall.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to use this more than once a week.</li>
            <li>I expect I&#x27;ll be using it more</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It  am going to give these as gifts, anyone ( guy or girl) would love this.</li>
            <li>Better than a hand held file, or pumis stone.</li>
            <li>I hesitated because of the price, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to use it as directed.</li>
            <li>not anymore :)&lt;</li>
            <li>and I must say that this is a better buy.  </li>
            <li>but this is definitely a better buy.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the emjoi.  </li>
            <li>And I love is so much better</li>
            <li>Soo much better than buffing by hand.</li>
            <li>Needs a bit more power..</li>
            <li>Now what do I do with it:)</li>
            <li>pleased with my purchase and</li>
            <li>glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I just love this product as much as I love my husband.</li>
            <li>Love this device.</li>
            <li>My heals have been cracked and calloused for so many years</li>
            <li>So I am hoping that with continued use and more lotion these lines will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>you have no idea how many pedicure machines, files, grinders, creams, foot rubs and</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love that it is electric</li>
            <li>This callus remover sure does the job.</li>
            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>I purchased the battery-operated version at Costco more than a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I love this callus remover.</li>
            <li>and I do like the way they keep my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also feel like I have to maneuver more</li>
            <li>I love the job it does and how it works.</li>
            <li>which is why I think many people think it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>If you brush the powder off you get more use out of a roll.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel better about my feet</li>
            <li>love it......</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>and it works so much better and faster....</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought this for me knowing how many products I&#x27;ve tried to resolve the issue of cracking skin and dense callouses on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with it; would I recommend it to a friend?</li>
            <li>I love the Micro Pedi.</li>
            <li>Baby smooth feet in minutes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the cordless/rechargeable model for about 2 years now and rave about it as well as recommended it many relatives and friends.  </li>
            <li>I imagine my feet are exposed and take more of a beating that people who mostly wear shoes and socks.</li>
            <li>Thank Amazon for carry so many quality things and be always a trusted site.</li>
            <li>This callus remover does a better job than the person who gives me my pedicures.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I chose to get the one with the cord instead of batteries.  </li>
            <li>Wife &amp; I have been pleased w/feet having been able to get constancy (without batteries).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose the corded model.  </li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>I am glad I went with the corded one</li>
            <li>I also used it to file my finger nails and the course skin on the top part of my fingers</li>
            <li>I LOVE his product, have tried almost everything on market to reduce heel cracks on my feet.</li>
            <li>I have been embarrassed by my feet for so many years.  </li>
            <li>Excellent with just the coarse roller.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re 10x better.</li>
            <li>but it probably would if I used it more often.</li>
            <li>so I knew I needed more time to work on them.</li>
            <li>It does the job better than any pedicure and any slicing equipment or brushes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy ladies !</li>
            <li>feet feel soooo much better now.  </li>
            <li>I should use it more often.</li>
            <li>This has made my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, it really does work great.</li>
            <li>course, now seeing what it does, just pull out your orbital sander. :)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a weekend at the beach...</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I love this Emjoi product, I immediately took it out the package and started working on my feet</li>
            <li>I have better things to do than spend my time primping and this gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It really does work great.</li>
            <li>Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>Glad my search is over for a pedi device.</li>
            <li>It was gone in about 30 seconds at the most.</li>
            <li>It works ok but the roughness returns in a day or two</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product since Costco was selling the battery operated version - and we all know that Costco sells only the best!  </li>
            <li>This item is just ok - let me put it this way -</li>
            <li>I never would have given more than 20 bucks for it.</li>
            <li>This has more power since it is electric and not battery operated.</li>
            <li>, I think it would be more convenient.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews for callus removers, I decided to give this one</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li>The finer grade (the one that is included) worked well, but I feel like it is more appropriate for finishing/</li>
            <li>I also have a battery powered Emjoi, which I love, but this one works even better.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I got the rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li>Works better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I am veery pleased with the performance and ease of handling this product.  </li>
            <li>I will try the more course rollers and see if that does the job faster.  </li>
            <li>and she said it was her favorite gift.</li>
            <li>Now, they&#x27;re so smooth!  </li>
            <li>LOVE â¤</li>
            <li>This does a better job than the salon does when it comes to callus removal.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this callus remover.  </li>
            <li>Thought it was better then it look.</li>
            <li>I had another brand battery powered which was still better than using a manual foot scrubber.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased...</li>
            <li>love it works as advertised</li>
            <li>I also use foot cream every night and put socks on to make things better.</li>
            <li>Then I saw the Emjoi on TV and was impressed enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still continue pedicures because I love the way they do my toes</li>
            <li>So glad, I bought this brand.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth this makes my heels and feet!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Since I love Emjoi</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about buying this even though I read the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>you will got through many of the &amp;#34;sanders&amp;#34; which will be costly.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>This Micro-Pedi is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll order some replacement rollers that are even more abrasive to get the toughest areas, and a smoothing roller as well.</li>
            <li>Love this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love their hair removal product and was hoping to love this product as well.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful -- 10 times better than various &amp;#34;battery operated&amp;#34; versions.  </li>
            <li>Works better than anything I have ever use.</li>
            <li>more power and don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries all the time</li>
            <li>Works so much better than the battery operated model.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li>Love this device...</li>
            <li>your feet will be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s foot!</li>
            <li>Much better than a salon pedicure and easier than any over the counter callus file I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s by far the best available.</li>
            <li>The motor could have more power.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing to going to the podiatrist.  </li>
            <li>I purchase the more corse sander cylinders for another $18.</li>
            <li>OK, it has been a 5 weeks since I bought this</li>
            <li>One more thing, put a towel on the floor under where you are doing this to catch the excess skin dust.</li>
            <li>It meets my expectations and more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My feet have never been so smooth!</li>
            <li>I just wish I could use it more than 2-3 seconds as recommended.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done. :)</li>
            <li>so just bear in mind to keep it fresh with good quality batteries</li>
            <li>However, that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using and enjoying the results.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I did find that I sanded the heel of one of my feet probably a bit more than I should have</li>
            <li>I love it, thinking about adding this to my gift giving list.</li>
            <li>JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I owned the battery operated Emjoi Micro-Pedi and love it.</li>
            <li>My feet are so nice and smooth now.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things from pumice stones to files to battery powered callus removers.  </li>
            <li>What a luxurious feel to slip into socks or sheets and get the smooth sensation of pampered feet!</li>
            <li>Not a fan of people touching my feet, so I opted for this as opposed to a couple pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably save that for more &#x27;upkeep&#x27; jobs.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got the plug in version.</li>
            <li>This tool is FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>My heals are now nice a smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many.</li>
            <li>but i like the cordless one better.</li>
            <li>If you want to save on batteries, than you will love this one too.</li>
            <li>I love this corded Nano version even more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>just love this</li>
            <li>The pumice stone that I have does a much better job than the Emjoi Callus Remover.  </li>
            <li>I love how my feet feel afterward.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I got the corded model instead of the battery operated one, this has a lot of power.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Frankly, this does a better job than any pedicure that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use a towel.....</li>
            <li>Works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried including sanding pads.</li>
            <li>I also bought the elbow file that fits this enjoy and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So much better than using a pumice stone or the Egg.  </li>
            <li>It is better than expected,finally  I don&#x27;t tear my stockings.</li>
            <li>Glad I read the reviews and bought the model with the cord.</li>
            <li>I love that it is electric and doesn&#x27;t require batteries</li>
            <li>While the manual apparatus is okay</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it serves the purpose for getting most of the callus off of my feet</li>
            <li>I THINK THIS ONE IS BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE POWER  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it has a cord</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to have plug in.</li>
            <li>Love this product works so much better than the battery operated one.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY EMJOI Micro-Pedi ...get one</li>
            <li>, you will, too! :-)</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>Needs more grit and power.  </li>
            <li>so glad it is NOT battery operated,  also works on hand palm callus</li>
            <li>So much better than battery powered one.</li>
            <li>My feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li>After comparing many products like this , I decided on the Micro-pedi.</li>
            <li>I love to use this - summer or winter</li>
            <li>I love to see the results.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>Really wanted this product to be great.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I use to love to go to the mall and get pedicures--no more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>Who has the money to keep buying the latest and \\&quot;greatest?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>We all love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li>1000x better than battery one</li>
            <li>They temporarily made it look better, but nothing touched the years of abuse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product. :)</li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>After one use I need to change out the roller for more grit.  </li>
            <li>After using it I can attest that the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li>It sure beats using the grater-like foot smoother</li>
            <li>Not anymore, I absolutely love this product and would recommend to everyone to try.</li>
            <li>If you think you still need more &#x27;power&#x27;, purchase a more course bar to replace the one that comes with the unit.</li>
            <li>She never had anything like it before, but she saw a similar product on TV, so I researched it &amp; decided this was the best option since it was corded and had 2 speed settings.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I bought it without batteries and it can be used also when travelling in Europe.</li>
            <li>it get the job done safely, without cuts.</li>
            <li>have ordered plenty of the rougher type for my heels, the one it comes with being better for the front of the feet or hands.</li>
            <li>The fact is that my Emjoi (and make SURE you get a cordless model) works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love, this product.  </li>
            <li>but I got one that I love.</li>
            <li>(I am not some kind of rep for that cream, btw,and it is super cheap and available at all sorts of drug stores in the US, but I thought I would mention it because anyone who is reading this review probably needs a great cheap foot cream too...)</li>
            <li>Very easy to go over your feet once a day or whenever need, then smooth on some of your favorite foot cream or lotion.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, outstanding results and best of all my flip-flop wearing husband now has feet as soft and callus free...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first with it until I really put some time in with it.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful, run it over your dry areas , its fast and works great.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s handy to have the wastebasket there to periodically tap the unit it to clean, as well as keeping the dust from settling on the floor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll come to rely on this comfortable,  easy to handle tool for years to come !</li>
            <li>Works great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am super glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>I have problems with dry skin on my feet and this has worked perfectly without damaging the healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I use this often &amp; it makes my feet look better much more quickly &amp; easily than using a file or anything else.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, my feet are in pretty good shape</li>
            <li>The A/C power supply on this unit eliminates that problem - run it as long as you need to, there&#x27;s no loss in power and the unit does an excellent job of removing even hardened calluses.  </li>
            <li>I had to spend a fair amount of time this first use</li>
            <li>Excellent item.... should have bought this long ago.  </li>
            <li>Just soft, beautiful feet.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite nice not breaking into a sweat while pedicure-ing!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for beautiful feet and smooth soles.</li>
            <li>I love this device, it smooths out everything very nicely, my feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in many years.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t replace the batteries with great quality new ones every fifth time</li>
            <li>It is amazing how great my feet look after only one use.  </li>
            <li>Love this callus remover, easy to use/clean up,</li>
            <li>Does a nice job quickly.</li>
            <li>I wanted a corded version because I wanted to be sure of strong power any time I needed to use it.  </li>
            <li>Works best on dry feet not soaked.</li>
            <li>For anyone with dry, cracked, calloused, and/or peeling feet, this product is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Removes dry skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>Like with my heels, these spots will now be more easily helped by the lotion.</li>
            <li>Excellent to remove warts and dry skin.</li>
            <li>love using this, works fast and does a good job</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I brought more as gifts for friends.  </li>
            <li>The electric unit is perfect, compact, quiet, will fit in any bag if I&#x27;m traveling</li>
            <li>It is powerful and so far has worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and better than the callus remover gel at the salon!</li>
            <li>The best thing ever for polishing my dry, crusty heels!  </li>
            <li>I have the original shape which is more conducive for a better result.</li>
            <li>Works great on foot work without burning like my old battery dremmel tool.</li>
            <li>But as far as performance is concerned it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>So far this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product to take off the rough edges.  </li>
            <li>My feet are lovely which is saying something for a person who primarily wears flip flops and clogs.</li>
            <li>Walking barefoot is much more comfortable....</li>
            <li>Try using it in the tub before running water, then have your favorite emollient/moisturizer/foot care product available for after wash/rinse.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy and would recommend the Micro-Pedi to anyone with rough, callused feet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine.</li>

            <li>Even the nail salon can&#x27;t get my feet as smooth as this.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and the recipient said it works Fantastic. .</li>
            <li>I started with Baby Foot procedure and then have used this every week to maintain my smooth feet.</li>
            <li>It works, but light on the &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>In just minutes it sloughs off all those callouses and makes my feet smooth again.</li>
            <li>This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  </li>
            <li>It requires a light touch.</li>
            <li>It felt like a light massage.</li>
            <li>I have smooth feet again  </li>
            <li>Cream up and repeat occasionally and soon your feet will be in great condition.</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade to the corded version as it is described as being more powerful.  </li>
            <li>therefore it isn&#x27;t any more powerful than the battery operated one.  </li>
            <li>I also imagine this corded version would be more powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>but boy your feet will be smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda of like using finishing sandpaper on wood - it makes the surface smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>after my pedi its smooth so</li>
            <li>I used it for my husband and he was amazed to see and feel how smooth his feet were.</li>
            <li>PLease note when you purchase the rollers to buy the GENUINE one.</li>
            <li>This is much more powerful than battery powered callus removers.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and you will get smooth heels.  </li>
            <li>In a couple of minutes using this Emjoi a couple days in a row (did not want to overdo), the calluses were gone and the skin was smooth.  </li>
            <li>Much more powerful than the battery one I already had.  </li>
            <li>This is now my primary tool for eliminating calluses.  </li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of smoothing out a callus, too.</li>
            <li>Went lightly over the soles of my feet and then applied a foot night cream.</li>
            <li>I have bunions and it would take up to 15 minutes sometimes to rub my bunions smooth.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 2 minutes to rub the bunions smooth with the Micor Pedi Callus Remover.  </li>
            <li>In just 10 minutes my feet were as smooth as they had been in all the years of going to the nail salon for pedicures.</li>
            <li>I purchase refill heads, I will buy a coarser grain to get them REALLY smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Micro Pedi is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Hold it lightly and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Just received my enjoy callous remover</li>
            <li>and it definitely lives up to the anticipation and all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My feet are that smooth.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and this works so much better than a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth it makes my feet feel.</li>
            <li>I brought this Corded Micro-pedi Callus Remover by Emjoi for my wife last year and she is still happy with it.</li>
            <li>I recommend the corded over the battery one, which is more powerful.</li>
            <li>Just spread a towel on your lap, turn your heel up so you can see it and press the device lightly to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my heels for about 2 minutes and they are so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>the Emjoi is now dead which is probably for the best.  </li>
            <li>Light to handle.</li>
            <li>Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;It has two settings, but it could be a bit more powerful.  </li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, but I also recommend the manufacturer to upgrade the motor to one more powerful.</li>
            <li>It just takes a light touch to get smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>If feels like an electric razor and it takes about 1 or 2 minutes to make your foot smooth.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this and buy one for everyone.</li>
            <li>Finally found this one at a great price.</li>
            <li>my feet have not felt this smooth for years.  </li>
            <li>It has taken 2 of the 3 to get my calluses smooth.  </li>
            <li>You always have plenty of power, paired with the green rollers, the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li>and it really did a nice job.  </li>
            <li>Each time I use it my heels feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Just lightly touch.  </li>

            <li>It is important to me that I don&#x27;t need to soak my feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped going to salons because I seem to get a fungus every time but wanted to have smooth feet again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes my feet were almost totally smooth, I waited a couple of days to do it again so that i didn&#x27;t irritate the skin</li>
            <li>this thing got my skin incredibly smooth in five minutes (and it didn&#x27;t hurt-</li>

            <li>The corded Emjoi unit works very well, and I love how smooth it makes my feet!  </li>
            <li>Keeping rollers clear with a tooth brush was a good tip of another reviewer BTW.</li>
            <li>However, I will probably have to go at them again at least two more times to get them to be &#x27;perfect&#x27; and get rid of a couple stubborn calluses.  </li>
            <li>, this is far superior in terms of it&#x27;s power and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Top Ten List of Needed Necessities in Order to Feel Good About Yourself\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I used the Emojoi once, and my feet are soooo smooth, it feels funny to walk on them!!  </li>
            <li>This is great but dont expect miracles after 1 use especially with the original rollers it comes with.</li>
            <li>I real money saver..!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than a single pedicure, fast, efficient, easy to use, and does an excellent job, so I don&#x27;t need to use it as often as I was having salon/spa pedicures.</li>
            <li>The AC version is very powerful.</li>
            <li>He used a toothbrush to clean the roller which easily ejects to clean or change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t make it as easy to use quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy way to get smooth feet.</li>
            <li>Priced right as well - better than battery operated model - so worth it!</li>
            <li>Stronger power &amp; so quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>Each roller lasts about 6 full feets&#x27; worth, more if you just use this on your heels.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and gentle.</li>
            <li>Good to have if you have major calluses.</li>
            <li>The newer super coarse replacement rollers are great.</li>
            <li>Both work great, but the plug in model is slightly stronger and the battery model fits in the suitcase better.  </li>
            <li>Now I just use it for touch ups every other week or so, and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li>Love this product - feet are pretty and smoother.  </li>
            <li>my feet haven&#x27;t felt this great in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>

            <li>This is not my first Emjoi product and I&#x27;ve been satisfied each time.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on Amazon for $29.95 and it is well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>I love it soooo much!</li>
            <li>The original product and replacement rollers should be accompanied with finishing emery pads (like the Pedi-egg) for premium after-treatment, or to use between treatments.  </li>
            <li>and with the original rollers.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having this to use in addition to my mani, pedi&#x27;s I purchased my first Emjoi from QVC years ago.</li>

            <li>It has a nice long cord and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; is worth every penny~</li>
            <li>When finished with each foot, take a moist rag and wipe the roller clean.</li>
            <li>Super smooth feet..</li>
            <li>Even with clean feet</li>

            <li>Great product for dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Rather than using the supplied brush to clean skin dust off the roller, I&#x27;ve found that low pressure compressed air does the best job, by far.  </li>
            <li>Heels are super smooth in no time with no effort.  </li>
            <li>After trying to buy different foot products, this by far, has been the greatest invention.</li>
            <li>Pumice roller, and a breeze to clean up.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on my cracked dry heels.</li>

            <li>I can tell you right now that the battery will not work as well!</li>
            <li>The truth of the matter is that this electric one works way better and is more powerful than the other popular brand.  </li>
            <li>This is the best little thing I&#x27;ve ever found!!  </li>
            <li>Great for those rough heels.</li>
            <li>This works great on removing rough spots and cracks.</li>
            <li>In just a couple of minutes the rough skin on my heel and toes was greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>yourself a huge favoure buy the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp</li>
            <li>It seems pretty powerful to me, the cord is much better than batteries.  </li>
            <li>I bought this not really believing all the great reviews, but had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job on rough feet, elbows, hands, and knees.  </li>
            <li>My horse hoofs are now smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love it works real well</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this productâ¦.</li>
            <li>it probably took me about a good 20-30 seconds total on each one.  </li>
            <li>works good but did not receive extra media pad as described in brochure.</li>
            <li>and I really would have paid more for the results I now have.</li>
            <li>and I thought nothing can make these feet nice looking except a professional.  </li>
            <li>They work much better and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>It took me forever and even then it wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>I still have the white crack lines that I hope moisturizer will take care of but this is something that will make your feet feel good to the touch.</li>
            <li>She loved it but use caution with the coarse rollers.</li>
            <li>I was sure it would work, but it really worked.  </li>
            <li>Of course, he says I buy him gifts that I want, and that may have been a bit true in this case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will still get my monthly pedi for the professional touch and polish, but in between this does the trick nicely.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t true for me...</li>
            <li>Overall good experience.</li>
            <li>, I am nothing short of delighted by the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>thank you for make this sweet</li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>This model has two speeds, but I find that the lower speed, with the blue roller, is good for my needs.  </li>
            <li>This battery operated one literally takes seconds to do each foot with a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li>but this is much quicker and it leaves them in better shape than a file.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>and my feet are not bad at all.</li>
            <li>not bad, works well.</li>
            <li>Great at getting those rough spots gone quick.</li>
            <li>The pores can get clogged pretty easily from the skin</li>
            <li>Easy to use and results after the first time.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time and was amazed at how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>but after the first session the maintenance is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Take your time in the application,  and enjoy this great little machine.</li>
            <li>Works great, no more batteries and much more powerful than a battery operated one.</li>
            <li>The other great thing is the price.</li>
            <li>I quickly get callouses on my feet from wearing sandals all the time.  </li>
            <li>Tremendous help in keeping the calluses off my feet.</li>
            <li>this makes quick work of softening feet.</li>
            <li>The one can wear batteries out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I use the super course rollers rather than the ones that come with the unit.  </li>
            <li>Got the corded one for more, steady power.</li>
            <li>the calluses off your feet quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used the pumice stone and the grater on my feet for years and was always seeking a better way to get amazingly soft and smooth heels.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a fast response initially, but things did get resolved and I am happy with their response.</li>
            <li>quick and ez.  </li>
            <li>But if you have a light touch and time it&#x27;ll clear away most any callus.</li>
            <li>which is mainly what made me seek out a better solution than the Pedi egg I had been using.</li>
            <li>Left my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>My heels are smoother after just one quick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power of the plug-in model is adequate, but I would not risk trying the battery operated or rechargeable models.  </li>
            <li>Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it quickly.</li>
            <li>They wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>This product does remove calluses, but not as fast or effectively as a good old foot file.  </li>
            <li>They should&#x27;ve made the best possible model they could before bringing this item to market initially.  </li>
            <li>And yes, the rollers do wear out relatively quickly, so there is the added expense of buying replacements.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This took care of it quickly.</li>
            <li>Works quickly</li>
            <li>my feet look super after one time using it.</li>
            <li>The batteries die quickly.</li>
            <li>I used the high speed most of the time.</li>
            <li>I love this item and highly recommend purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty underpowered, so you need to use a light touch.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than other methods I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Your feet will still be smooth after the first try.</li>
            <li>After buffing my heel the first time, it felt soooooooo smooth.  </li>
            <li>this item is good for minor skin removal but it stops when pressure is applied&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, very worth the money!</li>
            <li>It could be a little more powerful, but it&#x27;s much better than most.  </li>
            <li>This thing works great at grinding the callouses down and keeping my feet from bleeding.</li>
            <li>OK, so these last two weeks I have been using it only 2-3x a week just to maintain my beautifully smooth and wonderfully gorgeous feet.</li>
            <li>The price is wonderful &amp; I also ordered the extra rollers a few days later because I knew I was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying my new Emjoi Micro-pedi Callus Remover.  </li>
            <li>Consistent power along with the right rollers gets the job done painlessly and quickly!  </li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s easy to adjust just how much you take off and</li>
            <li>but now I have this super powerful callus remover</li>
            <li>easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and fast.</li>
            <li>using a callus blade sometimes makes callus return thicker and can leave feet tender ,  this is so easy, don&#x27;t need to really see area you are treating.  </li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to, is easy to use, and is gentle to your feet.</li>
            <li>it is fast, easy to change the.</li>
            <li>pretty good machine could use a little more power though</li>
            <li>The &#x27;sanding/buffing&#x27; cartridge is very gentle (it almost tickles your feet) and is a breeze to remove, clean and replace.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li>This works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>and they wore out after the first use !&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>shipped sooner then first stated!  </li>
            <li>it does exactly as it says it will!</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and decided to order it - was not disappointed I literally took it out of the box, plugged it up and used it straight away!</li>
            <li>I watched a video of a girl explaining it and saying how great it is and how the skin just comes off.. not true.</li>
            <li>The first roller lasted me about 3 weeks, but I was using it a TON!</li>
            <li>This does exactly what they say!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and left her feet feeling much better.</li>
            <li>Very good for hard skin.</li>
            <li>I clean it with some hot water and some antiseptic alcohol solution.</li>
            <li>She was done with both of her feet in a little under 10 minutes and she was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool for you feet.</li>
            <li>i think this little machine is great for maintaining pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This little machine is great for the in between or even without a pedi.  </li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>This is a great little workhorse when it comes to removing Calluses.  </li>
            <li>I think the best way to handle it is to go slow and certainly, you don&#x27;t need to apply pressure.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing little device that has helped my feet become smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li>I live in the south and wear sandals most of the time; therefore, it is important to have decent looking feet when they are exposed all of the time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve also noted today that walking around in my heels are so much easier and comfortable - no discomfort whatsoever on my pressure</li>
            <li>Works very well, just a light touch does it.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend purchasing this for amazing soft, smooth skin!</li>
            <li>This is a great invention to shave the dead skin off the bottom of the feet.</li>
            <li>Wow, it is pretty amazing how much dust it makes while filing your feet!  </li>
            <li>The device works great, been using it for weeks and the grinding pad still has the grit to remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>Baby smooth and sandal ready.</li>
            <li>I found that using a hand held, finer grain scraper afterwards really helped smooth things out.</li>
            <li>This was worth the money.</li>
            <li>As you age, your feet just take more work to keep them soft than they do when you&#x27;re in your twenties</li>
            <li>This thing is powerful.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>This thing IS powerful.</li>
            <li>, I think I got my money&#x27;s worth and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use this periodically and have nice heels at last.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I tried the ped-egg without much success.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>i now have baby soft heels and it doesnt take forever and its better than shaving my heels with</li>
            <li>, you need to put on a good layer of lotion after that, otherwise, your skin will become rough again soon.</li>
            <li>(Usually if something doesn&#x27;t last long, I don&#x27;t care how great it was, I wouldn&#x27;t rate it well, but this product just works so perfectly for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful just like it says</li>
            <li>My feet have never been completely callus free and so smooth until now</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it, and with the plug in capability</li>
            <li>The cord is a generous 6-feet, rare today when skimpy ones are often the norm.</li>
            <li>so I wrote Shave Now to see if I had any kind of warranty left.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>well, not really, but it makes your feet look that good.</li>
            <li>Not that powerful; perhaps I&#x27;m used to power tools.  </li>
            <li>It takes mantainance, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I think they will find them as useful as I do.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$$</li>
            <li>I have rough feet and was hoping to make them look good</li>
            <li>It works and it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this product leave your feet as smooth as silk, once you&#x27;ve lotioned your feet after the treatment you&#x27;ll be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the expense.</li>
            <li>Now I can go all day and unless I step in something or rub up against something, my feet are not dirty on the bottoms.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.    </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love to be barefoot, even on non-grass surfaces, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time my feet looked smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>My 70 year old feet never looked better.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think its worth the price i paid</li>
            <li>it near the trash or someplace easy to clean up)</li>
            <li>My feet look human again and are really nice to touch.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi Pedi does a much better job than a professional pedi.</li>
            <li>So far it is working ok, and is saving some trips to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li>Does the job, would recommend highly, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is quite powerful; I saved a patch of skin when I was using the ped-egg so that I could test this emjoi</li>
            <li>It is powerful but the roller needs to be tougher.  </li>
            <li>THIS EMJOI POWERFUL FOOT BUFFER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>That option is far too pricey for the same great job that the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano does.</li>
            <li>No pain, no cutting by blades.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the week, I apply a bit of Jergens after showering in the morning and this easy plan keeps my feet in good shape and takes very little time out of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li>Never looking back at my battery one or my Ped Egg which was my first love!</li>
            <li>Wish this didnt have to be connected to the wall other then that its a good product</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I got the gray one right off the bat</li>
            <li>just right for it to work.  </li>
            <li>This product should work for anyone you just have to choose the right refills for your machine and of course for the condition of your calluses.</li>
            <li>This has the power you need to take care of your feet the right way.</li>
            <li>And the price was right also.</li>
            <li>I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li>It files your feet just about right amount.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my new Emjoi!  </li>
            <li>We are letting my feet rest a Full week before doing more the bigger thicker callouses using the coarser rollers which are here.</li>
            <li>Clever design, easy to use, effective dry skin removal.</li>
            <li>I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came</li>
            <li>This little gadget is amazing!</li>
            <li>and I know that if I repeat that a few more times, I can see that I will have nice, soft, smooth feet that will be easier to maintain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This removes the dry skin and makes my skin look so much better!</li>
            <li>, my dry feet have never looked better, and I have tried everything!</li>
            <li>Scrubbers can&#x27;t get the job done anywhere near what this thing can do, and I can do it totally dry on the fly.</li>
            <li>was thrilled that it made my feet baby smooth in less than 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>but most importantly, my feet have enjoyed the relief from hard, calloused skin.</li>
            <li>Cool Product and it really works.</li>
            <li>I have great hope that my calluses are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long, and it does shave off a lot if skin, instead of using a towel,  </li>
            <li>He just kind of looked at me strangely when he opened it</li>
            <li>An old fashioned pumice stone and the PedEgg did a fair job of removing the top layer of dead skin, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>Also, new rollers can be easily ordered at reasonable prices!</li>
            <li>, what&#x27;s a little more :)</li>
            <li>Has a nice little bag that the machine and cord fit into</li>
            <li>It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2),</li>
            <li>I have tried other battery-operated products to remove feet callouses, and this one seems the most effective so far.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of the damage I was doing to my right foot.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned- make sure to work over a towel or wastebasket to catch the dead skin, and make sure to stop the unit it and tap it</li>
            <li>This sounds bizarre, but I liked seeing all the dead skin just flake away as I was using it.</li>
            <li>I was not that impressed with it until I installed the green rollers (extra course).</li>
            <li>works very well and quickly</li>
            <li>It does a great job in such a short amount of time!  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and leaves my feet so soft.</li>
            <li>Have applied the roller gently but firmly and experienced no problems with stalling or stopping.  </li>
            <li>the electrical cord is pretty long so that was a nice plus.</li>
            <li>While I read many complaints about it not being powerful enough, it is unreasonable to have a tool more powerful that could actually harm your skin.</li>
            <li>my feet are very soft and callous free</li>
            <li>Amazing how much dry skin is removed, but the product is very gentle.</li>
            <li>When I finished, I massaged body lotion into my feet and they felt so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s no fun getting old and having to deal with cracked heels, but with this little device and some good lotion, my feet look nice again :)</li>
            <li>~The company sells replacements as so does amazon very reasonable for me</li>
            <li>It works very, very, well.  </li>
            <li>The company was very reasonable when I had an issue with one of the Micro Pedi removers.  </li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s even fun to pretty up my feet, if that is even possible on old feet that have worn too many high heels and flip flops - and the finished product is a lot better.  </li>
            <li>however i think that the replacments could become costly just my opinion but in terms of performance found it easy enough to use and pretty fast made a huge difference</li>
            <li>In just a short amount of time the are very smooth with first try.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the higher speed is better suited to some of the other available rollers.</li>
            <li>Now, my feet look good, and with little effort and time involved.  </li>
            <li>Be careful because you could clean away more skin than you intended to.</li>
            <li>One thing, be sure not to breathe in any of the dead skin dust as you&#x27;re using it - keep a dry cloth handy to wipe the dust away as the gentle sanding effect works it magic on your feet.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>NOW I CAN HAVE SMOOTH AND SOFT FEET</li>
            <li>Have really enjoyed getting my feet back in shape!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday and I am amazed at the results.  </li>
            <li>Problem solved thanks to emjoi!</li>
            <li>Thanks Emjoi!</li>
            <li>I sat on the floor marveling at my feet for quite some time afterwards; they were gone for the first time in YEARS.  </li>
            <li>So glad I finally got one of these.  </li>
            <li>Makes you feet a soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I checked with doctor first as i am diabetic type 2.</li>
            <li>This really saves time and energy from using a pumice stone!</li>
            <li>I have only used it one time, and it does appear that most of the exfoliating power is gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a bit of time to get through tougher spots, my first session took over 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft feet fast!</li>
            <li>I bought this onr for my daughter and it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It does work if you are willing to put time into using it.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS buy the MOST coarse.</li>
            <li>When I did my first sanding</li>
            <li>It really works well and no batteries needed!</li>
            <li>I use it on my heels to remove callus and it makes them so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>per foot every 2-3 days to keep my feet (and elbows) soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Took 1/2 hour each first time.</li>
            <li>I wish the top were completely open and you had more than a side open to use 2 -</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products including regular pedicures.  </li>
            <li>At first I considered the battery operated model but after research and further thought, the electric one made more sense because it would have continuous and even power and not need to have batteries replaced.</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to wear open sandals.  </li>
            <li>I opted for this corded version because I wanted consistent power and also didn&#x27;t want to keep buying batteries.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>well I am willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>The first day I tried it when I got out of the shower and there was some improvement</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I have some smooth, soft feet.  </li>
            <li>I used the machine on his hands and he is also amazed how smooth and soft his hands have become.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so soft and smooth all the time.  </li>
            <li>This corded product works great and the sanding discs last a really long time.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was hoping for to remove callouses on my hands from doing Crossfit.  </li>
            <li>This corded one is more environment friendly than the other battery operated model.</li>
            <li>but wow, almost baby butt smooth.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use so much pressure!</li>
            <li>Needs MUCH COARSER sandpaper!  </li>
            <li>It took me about an hour to use the first time.</li>
            <li>make it work better especially on the thickest callouses &amp; heels</li>
            <li>ok Definitely  I need something stronger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this Emjoi Micro-Pedi and as a female user</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for summer sandals!</li>
            <li>Even better than when I get a pedicure at the local nail salon!  </li>
            <li>really like my husband&#x27;s Valentine Day gift!  </li>
            <li>I believe this is my first review although I buy almost everything thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend ordering extra rollers, I wish I had ordered more than 2..  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It has been very helpful!</li>
            <li>I threw out my Pedi-Egg after I used this the first time.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>makes it so much easier!</li>
            <li>But I got the first couple of layers off</li>
            <li>I did buy some of the \\&quot;extra course\\&quot; rollers and they work better for me than the one it came with.</li>
            <li>My advice is to stay on top of regular sessions.</li>
            <li>My device also was turning off periodically during the first use.</li>
            <li>My husband first bought the battery version.  </li>
            <li>I like it but thought it came with more blue disks.</li>
            <li>I did it when first ordering, so</li>
            <li>FIRST CALLUS REMOVER I HAVE HAD THAT</li>
            <li>its ok, not sure if there is anything better on the market.</li>
            <li>This really works so well that I&#x27;m already planning on buying them for my friends and family as gifts!</li>
            <li>I run it on low to make sure I don&#x27;t over do.  </li>
            <li>when I started it for the first time the roller wouldn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this tool !</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and bought this Emjoi, which did more in one session than the Clairsonic did in four weeks.</li>
            <li>but I have to say it really does work!</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>What can I say, this thing really works!  </li>
            <li>After using the Emjoi for more time I finally have achieved consist smoothness with once or twice a week maintenance.</li>
            <li>The powered nano does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing the dead and calloused skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to rough, dry cracked skin-especially on the toes and heels, although I take very good care of my feet through moisturization.</li>
            <li>I wear sandals most of the time so my feet get dried out easily.</li>
            <li>This is much better than using a pumice stone or a pedi-egg (less work and easier to get precise results).  </li>
            <li>I will probably continue to use my Ansr Sole on my heels, but this little tool is fantastic for the built-up calluses on the balls of my feet that the Ansr didn&#x27;t really help, for a great price.</li>
            <li>Pretty powerful for the price--I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing much, as I couldn&#x27;t really feel it--but it made a big difference in just one use.  </li>
            <li>I get small calluses on my little toes and this is the perfect tool to smooth those calluses.  </li>
            <li>I love how well my original Emjoi took down my callused skin, and was in the market for a corded version.  </li>
            <li>little gadget is amazing and absolutely worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;like other reviewers said, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love this little guy work fantastic</li>
            <li>My podiatrist was thrilled the other day at my appt.</li>
            <li>It is a neat idea, but needs more power and rougher surface to truly be effective on tough skin.</li>
            <li>feet are super soft and smooth for the first time in my adult life.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had a hard time using the Emjoi but trying to tape non-stick gauze pads with antibiotic ointment on the bottom of my foot was even more challenging.</li>
            <li>I clean mine afterwards with an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Price wise,  I paid what I would of at a local drug store, but they only had battery powered ones.</li>
            <li>and I can wait to order the more coarse stones, my feet get really ruff and</li>
            <li>I got tired of sanding them by hand all the time and the results were no where near wthis&#x27;lltles wonderful machine can do without all the labor of the hand sander.</li>
            <li>my wife likes it very well make sure to buy extra stones</li>
            <li>Took her a little practice to make sure it was removing callus in the right area, but she adjusted quickly and loves it.  </li>
            <li>This unit works pretty well due to its corded feature which I believe makes it more powerful than battery-operated competitors.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything to get smooth heels including seeing a podiatrist and for the first time in years I have soft smooth heels again and am actually looking forward to sandal weather.</li>
            <li>I have had very dry calloused feet for many many years and have tried lots of different products.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and decided to purchase the Emjoi because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Agree with all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>gets rid of dry skin and makes heels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as described and is so much easier to use than a file or rasp.</li>
            <li>Well, I bought this for him because of the reviews saying it was more powerful than the other leading brand, which I bought also.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much quicker session now as well at about 5 mins per foot whereas the first time it was about 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done and is far far better than a battery powered or rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to do too much the first day for fear</li>
            <li>It really does the job very well!</li>
            <li>I love this product its something I should have had long ago.</li>
            <li>The first thing  I noticed while abrading my toe, with the Emjoi, was how fast the abrasive wheel was removing the callous with no frictional heat occurring.</li>
            <li>It sure beats manually filing your heels for a long time.</li>
            <li>Far superior to a battery operated version (I have a battery operated full sized one) and the small size makes it much easier to use with consistent power and rotations.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the mens gray replacement pumice wheel as the blue one is pretty fine.  </li>
            <li>It cost a little more, but the trade off is not having to replace batteries EVER!  </li>
            <li>Next few uses I got more brave, applied more pressure, it will stop if you push too hard</li>
            <li>the Emjoi is amazing small powerful and does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Amazing product - small but powerful.</li>
            <li>With the first use, I actually had touchable, smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my feet are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have super sensitive princess feet it will work for you.  </li>
            <li>Is is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For the first time (outside of the salon) I have smooth feet.</li>
            <li>this product is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been lucky so far.  </li>
            <li>The battery powered PediSpin was even less effective.  </li>
            <li>Quiet and easy to operate</li>
            <li>~Its strong comes with a pouch a plastic cover on the one blue roller that comes with it</li>
            <li>I have not purchased the extra rollers these are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and certainly brings the softness back to my feet.</li>
            <li>like that it is corded because I think it is more powerful and it won&#x27;t run down the battery.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much that I ordered one for my mother&#x27;s birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that say it slows down and has no power...</li>
            <li>This thing is PURE HEAVEN</li>
            <li>I take regular care of my feet and they&#x27;re normally in pretty good shape, but I can never make a dent on the rough, cracked skin on my heels.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure your feet are absolutely dry or it won&#x27;t work very well, so do not use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>ordering two more for my family members with icky feet...wanted to try  it on mine first to see if it really worked and it does!!!</li>
            <li>and this does help keep my feet smoother for longer using it 2 times a week - but will it take someone who has neglected feet with layers and layers of dead skin and calluses and get them soft and smooth like the picture - absolutely not - at least not without going through tons of rollers which would not be cost effective.  </li>
            <li>The basic sandpaper roll is fine but is a consumable item that doesn&#x27;t need to be there.</li>
            <li>This is the only device that has worked to remove calluses quickly the way they said it would!</li>
            <li>Having to order a large number of each grit can be very costly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like the roller is going to last as long as I thought it would based on other reviews, but the machine itself is great!</li>
            <li>You have none of that with this handy little gadget.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>The best results come from using this once in a while, augments by a rasp or file, and then putting a little oil on the heels and wearing heel sleeves a few nights a week.</li>
            <li>The replaceable drums provide a more sanitary and consistant level of performance - and give you a choice of  &#x27;rough&#x27; or &#x27;fine&#x27; surfaces to meet your specific needs.</li>
            <li>It is the first non-intrusive, easy to work-it-out into my dry skin, and, really affordable.</li>
            <li>I used many products and there was very very limited help or not at all.</li>
            <li>It is a great little machine, like the most delicate of belt sanders for my feet.</li>
            <li>Simple, fast, smooth.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t notice any difference between the two.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Cost too much money to keep on changing them.</li>
            <li>~I recommend the one w/a power cord jus to have it ready &amp; not going thru batteries</li>
            <li>and you can see how much progress is being made!&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>and It works very well.  </li>
            <li>This item really works well, finding the replacement parts at a reasonable price can be a bit of an issue.</li>
            <li>and she started to really like this.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>how much discomfort my calluses (they didn&#x27;t happen overnight after all) were causing me until I felt the difference of not having them at all.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>She loves it and thanks me everyone she uses it.  </li>
            <li>I had the battery one before and the plug in is so much nicer</li>
            <li>But then a salon pedicure takes longer and costs as much as this product.  </li>
            <li>but it has left my heels feeling relatively smooth.</li>
            <li>If this doesn&#x27;t remove your callus, you have some really, really messed up feet; and should see a foot doctor.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of foot files and nothing seemed to do the job very well.</li>
            <li>If you have tried everything else without much results then you have got to try this.</li>
            <li>It does take a while, but it is much, MUCH easier than using a pumice stone.</li>
            <li>go have them done much simpler</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt my foot as smooth in my entire life!</li>
            <li>Again it works very well for me</li>
            <li>Thanks again Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, it really does work.</li>
            <li>&amp; i can see that the real money is poured into the replacement rollers</li>
            <li>I thought twice about spending that much money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with this corded version of the Emjoi Nano Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li>This really helps keep the calluses to a minimum.  </li>
            <li>a more corse roller, the one it comes with is not very corse.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone!  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend for anyone looking to finally smooth their feet.</li>
            <li>This one really doesn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>But really like the results you get with this.</li>
            <li>I worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>have the corded version, and it works really, really well.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for smoothing my feet and heels.</li>
            <li>Very please I got this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice much difference between the 30 and 47 speed in terms of callus removal.  </li>
            <li>The abrasive was worn smooth after spending 20 minutes on just one foot, even keeping the dust brushed off of it.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had purchased it sooner, however, there is so much hype with things, you never can quite believe their claims.</li>
            <li>Used it last night and it was fantastic....</li>
            <li>Powerful and feet feel  soft when done.</li>
            <li>Much easier than manual method.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so much so that I bought one for my mother.</li>
            <li>It really works wonders.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>without much luck.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and adds another dimension to my pedi regimen.</li>
            <li>Really works on even the driest of feet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>My feet are so smooth now, they don&#x27;t even try to sell me the extra callous remover</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, NEEDS REPLACING ROLLER OFTEN.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on Friday and it arrived on Wed, so fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Now I have sandal ready feet</li>
            <li>I have tried the manual handheld files but they&#x27;re just too much work.  </li>
            <li>This buffer worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li>This works very welll</li>
            <li>, I have spent most of my life out of shoes.</li>
            <li>This product works and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the harder you press, the better it will work.  </li>
            <li>but it really helps to avoid cracking.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and it works</li>
            <li>It worked very well</li>
            <li>This has really smoothed them.</li>
            <li>This fits the hand very well and has made a difference in our feet.</li>
            <li>This gadget really, really works.  </li>
            <li>So much quicker than a foot file.  </li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;d really go through a lot of batteries</li>
            <li>A light touch is needed, but if you are patient and work the machine properly, it will do all the work.  </li>
            <li>Works much faster</li>
            <li>I clean the roller with an old toothbrush under a light stream of water and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>This Callus Remover works and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really ?  </li>
            <li>So fast.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for reducing calluses on my feet.  </li>
            <li>Did a much better job than expected.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t been a particularly fast process.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken about 5 sessions of 10 minutes each to accomplish this much.  </li>
            <li>and if you put to much presser it stops.......</li>
            <li>This is one product that really works like it says it will.  </li>
            <li>I would really recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I readily recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare</li>
            <li>This battery operated buffer works really well.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so much smoother and don&#x27;t snag my socks.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use this on clean, dry skin only.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was almost ready to order the pedicure device that is made by Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Face it, rough feet are the bane of many teachers......</li>
            <li>if you have soft granny feet, buy the most coarse!</li>
            <li>I do use this regularly and my feet are soft and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper any more.  </li>
            <li>When I used my Micro Pedi the dead skin would kind of pile up on the bottom of the roller rather than flaking away</li>
            <li>In fact,  I now cut my own nails and spend just $10 a month to have my nails professionally painted, giving an overall &#x27;professional&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li>My last few pumice stone/feet smoothers  have been fine, but I walk a lot and my feet are not fabulous...nor do I like to spend the time or money on pedicures except on very special occasions!</li>
            <li>A certain warehouse sells the big version for a little less, but I bought the Nano &amp; am SUPER happy!  </li>
            <li>Because of the size and shape, it&#x27;s really great at getting into that area right where the big toe joins the foot, and it really does polish away thick deadened skin (</li>
            <li>Changed batteries and new batteries got really hot fast and emjoi wouldn&#x27;t start.  </li>
            <li>I broke my ankle and have been walking messed up for 7 years, I get callus&#x27;s on my feet from walking crooked, this little thing took care of them in no time at all, they are nice and smooth and can&#x27;t wait too use again, highly recommend</li>
            <li>it is a smooth filer that gives you consistent smoothing and removing of dry skin cells.  </li>
            <li>No tough callused feet, no cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>I have used a few other products like this and so far this has done the best job.</li>
            <li>After each use my heels and tootsies are smooth, but due to the nature of my skin it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I turned it on low and used an old soft bristled toothbrush and lightly ran across the head to clean</li>
            <li>But the micro-pedi grinds right through it, leaving them soft.</li>
            <li>This little tool works fast and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it over the next few days to complete a full exfoliation, as I didn&#x27;t think it would be wise to do it all at once.</li>
            <li>feet (mostly the heels) aren&#x27;t severely dry or cracked, but I live in Hawaii and wear sandals majority of the time, so</li>
            <li>I use it about 2 times per week to keep the calluses and dry skin at bay, apply some lotion and my feet are very soft and feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where the real action happened!</li>
            <li>I have the other model with the longer handle and like it a lot better than this model.  </li>
            <li>This seems be the better option from reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>For me, this product works much better than the ped-egg, pumice stones, or any other manual devices that I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth the money!</li>
            <li>As advised on other reviews, I was sure to put a towel under my feet to capture the dust it causes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other tools to get rid of my callouses on my feet</li>
            <li>Only feature i like is that it is electric, but i could have got the original shaped unit that now has electric, cheaper too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a foot polisher than a true hard callus remover.  </li>
            <li>I had cracks in my heels that would get very sore, but this device really does smooth the dry skin away.  </li>
            <li>Even though I get pedicures on a monthly basis, my heels have always been dry and crack easily.</li>
            <li>All work really well for whatever my particular needs are on the day of use.</li>
            <li>You have to constantly clean the bar while using this tool for the first time on dry skin; get a toothbrush and while the machine is on, take the toothbrush and hold it against the bar to get the flakes off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that this product was invented as I would often use my Dremel Tool with a fine sanding pad on low speed to electrically sand calluses on my feet (and I use the Dremel Tool and sanding pad for cleaning grills and heavy baked on grease from pans, etc.).  </li>
            <li>So I am trying to wear sox and my diabetic shoes with special inserts as much as possible.</li>
            <li>It was taken right in the middle of my first use of the Micro Pedi.</li>
            <li>you use foot files it takes a long time to smooth out your feet . . .</li>
            <li>I usually use it weekly just to keep my feet nice</li>
            <li>I use it about every 7-10 days, and so far, I am still using the first roller it came with; I have had it for about 2 to 2-1/2 months.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any woman who loves soft and pretty feet and to any man who likes the comfort of callus-free feet.</li>
            <li>I had to go back and purchase the refills -- they last a while but want to have them ready to make sure my feet stay</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>My feet are sooo soft and a drastic improvement;).</li>
            <li>As a nurse, I would be very careful using the super coarse rollers as I can see that it would be very easy to sand until you are sanding on soft skin rather than calluses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better to have the electric one than the battery because those would just run down.  </li>
            <li>Using great lotions and oils after each session gives a little longer smoothness but not much.  </li>
            <li>I love this little heel scraper - it really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>You can was them off, but I sorta wish I had new ones too!</li>
            <li>My feet are like new!</li>
            <li>I just went out and bought 2 new pair of sandals!</li>
            <li>It is very handy and just right for a female had to get those tough parts.</li>
            <li>The second day I tried it again right out of the shower (dried my feet first) and used U-Lactin lotion after then even more improvement.  </li>
            <li>so you can get more done with less effort.  </li>
            <li>I did the little spots on my toes and the big giant callouses on my heels, and I was able to maneuver it and it worked just fine!</li>
            <li>I walk barefoot most of the summer, half of the spring and fall.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband to replace the battery operated one that didn&#x27;t have enough umph for his super callused feet.</li>
            <li>He loves it, especially with the super course roller.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that the roller itself seems to wear off quickly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this about a month ago and have used it every day since getting it and after using I put an ointment on whose main ingredient is emu oil.</li>
            <li>Powerful for those stubborn areas, yet gentle enough to get the job done!</li>
            <li>Using their most coarse roller (Xtreme Coarse)</li>
            <li>Next day, my feet are as smooth as when I was a young girl.  </li>
            <li>They both work on the same principle, only the top speed on the Tornado is 47 rather than 30.  </li>
            <li>No batteries so keeps to a steady speed.</li>
            <li>I had to buy the super coarse rollers for this.</li>
            <li>The best ..... it doesn&#x27;t get tired and I now have pink heals.</li>
            <li>maybe as I got older...</li>
            <li>This worked really well to remove several years worth of \\&quot;foot stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a decent product for the price</li>
            <li>I guess t was decent.</li>
            <li>I have the worst feet ever since I love t6o go without shoes, so I was looking for a product that I felt would do an awesome job.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t apply any pressure when using, just gently glide over the area and watch the dead skin disappear (be sure to do it over a trash can or over the tub/shower.)</li>
            <li>This Micro-Pedi is something that can be used on a regular basis to keep ones feet looking smooth &amp; soft at all times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a pedicure, mainly because my feet were so embarrassing.</li>
            <li>I used it daily ( a couple times 2x a day) for the first 2 weeks to try to get rid of a huge crack I had on my left foot.</li>
            <li>light weight, long cord, dual electricity, powerful enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has been able to repair my feet back to normal within one treatment.  </li>
            <li>No pain, works fast and leaves my feel silky soft!</li>

            <li>HIGHLY RECCOMMEND..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the corded over the battery veery rsion which I was using - it burns through batteries every 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be buying another as a beautifying gift for my friend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would definitely try the more coarse rollers when its time to purchase new rollers.</li>
            <li>I love this little callus remover.</li>
            <li>I love this little tool.</li>
            <li>My feet look and feel so soft!!</li>
            <li>I would give it five stars if it had a little more power.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll spread it out a little more.</li>
            <li>But so far this is a miracle for me!!    </li>
            <li>and I thought my feet were in pretty good shape except for that one crack (due to a limp I have),</li>
            <li>Love this little remover.</li>
            <li>After a little thought and more insisting, I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I love this little nano.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need much pressure to quickly remove layers of dry skin.</li>
            <li>this item would be a decent value at 20 bucks especially considering the cost of the rollers - is it worth 50?</li>
            <li>As an older adult, this makes it so much easier to use than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>She has used it once so far and rates it very highly.  </li>
            <li>The Nano was large enough for my needs, but I can see it would be a problem if I had larger areas to smooth, since the roller is recessed below the plastic on the device.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week on the rough spots for maintenance and it keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>You get about 5 light uses out of one roller, not very cost affective.</li>
            <li>and wow it really does the job.</li>
            <li>Wow this product really works.</li>
            <li>If I felt an area that was still rough, I went over it until it was smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical before it arrived even though it has great reviews.</li>
            <li>It removes my rough heels and leaves them smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a brush to clean the dry skin off the roller.  </li>
            <li>It really IS powerful, so you do have to be careful not to do too much, too fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and I can use it for a few minutes of touch up or for a more thorough pedicure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially she didnt think that it was powerful enough...</li>
            <li>Normal feet</li>
            <li>The same sanding roller on low speed buffed off the tags of skin on the soles, smoothed the ends of my toes near the nails, and the top and sides of my feet.</li>
            <li>I like it not that powerful same as the battery operated one, I bought both.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but felt I had to for this product.</li>
            <li>Like the corded version because it never loses power.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I would have hoped for, especially for a plug in device.</li>
            <li>I normally have ridges on my feet and they are all gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The Dead Sea Scrolls are in better shape AND softer than my feet...)</li>
            <li>I think the fact that it has a cord is what makes it powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It does not hurt and safely takes off the dead skin and callous a bit at a time.</li>
            <li>The amount of calloused skin that comes off is deliciously gross (smile).</li>
            <li>This plug in is far better then the basttery one - it does not die down and the cord is well</li>
            <li>My feet went from dry and cracked to soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>- gross, right?  </li>
            <li>The power is just right and the rollers are replaceable so this will last for years.</li>
            <li>I am left handed so this was a problem for me until I held/used it with my right hand.  </li>
            <li>was that my big right toe</li>
            <li>a dance injury stemming indirectly from my calluses landed me at the podiatrist&#x27;s office, I was finally convinced to invest and do right by my feet.</li>
            <li>but you must follow few simply steps- use it only on a very dry skin- works perfect</li>
            <li>This little unit is powerful!!</li>
            <li>It is more powerful than you&#x27;d think from it&#x27;s small size - even with the lesser strength rollers it went to town on my heels.  </li>
            <li>I saw the new Clarisonic one at a department store and thought I HAD to have it.</li>
            <li>At $200, I decided I could definitely live without it.</li>
            <li>Even though the glitch was with Amazon and not them, they shipped a new model to me at no cost and let me keep the one that was sent in error.  </li>
            <li>We live in arizona</li>
            <li>but regardless something that I can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li>and it has made my feet feel brand new.</li>
            <li>After I placed in new batteries though, it worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Then Baby Oiled them with the new Shea Butter Scent.</li>
            <li>If they only last a couple of uses, it&#x27;s just as cheap to go to the spa and have a pedicure.  </li>
            <li>I opted for the corded one because I&#x27;m tired of using batteries all the time, and i had seen where the corded one was more powerful, which made sense.  </li>
            <li>Also I purchased at the same time extra Genuine Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers.</li>
            <li>I have found the blue coarse rollers supplied with my unit to be more than adequate for the purpose with less danger of sanding below calluses.  </li>
            <li>The green rollers will save you a lot more time and your feet will come out baby soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have such a problem with rough, calloused feet, we&#x27;ll not any more.</li>
            <li>Frequent pedicures don&#x27;t work and I&#x27;ve picked so much that I can&#x27;t even get near my feet with a rasp or corn shaver without drawing blood.</li>
            <li>I bought this as I always have calluses on my heels and have tried other devices and they weren&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li>If this tool doesn&#x27;t save you money by not having to go to the nail and sanding salon, I&#x27;d be very surprised.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take away all the thickened skin, such as on the heels, but it does make what&#x27;s left very smooth to the touch, a vast improvement from before.</li>
            <li>After neglecting my feet over the winter and with spring (and cute sandals) right around the corner, I knew I had to up my game.  </li>
            <li>and it was even better than I expected!!!!  </li>
            <li>Follow the advice, don&#x27;t use it too long in one spot, it is easy to go too deep.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty calloused areas will use a roller up pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li>Maybe I won&#x27;t wear down the rollers maintaining my new smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>I frequently pay for pedicures and I feel that I will never have to pay for a pedicure again!  </li>
            <li>I had purchased this Emjoi because of the higher ratings than a similar product I saw on tv.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>He said ok but use extreme care and daily foot inspections.</li>
            <li>and my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>This product actually works, if you are willing to take the time to do it.</li>
            <li>It removed lots of gross stuff! ;)</li>
            <li>So, the slightly higher price of the electric model was offset by the cost of future batteries.</li>
            <li>I used it for about ten minutes the first time.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I was a pretty devoted Ped Egg user for several years.  </li>
            <li>I have calluses, this only took off the superficial first layer.</li>
            <li>World much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time, and can only say suberb.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at its  effectiveness!</li>
            <li>Do keep in mind that  the roller will only grind/sand in one direction, so if it does not seem to work at first change up the way you hold the item.  </li>
            <li>My son and even my daughter are willing to rub my feet for me daily.</li>
            <li>I did not do that the first time and it&#x27;s kinda gross if you think about it!    </li>
            <li>but I have only used the first speed.</li>
            <li>The first session is the longest; regular follow-ups are shorter.</li>
            <li>My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li>This is the first device I&#x27;ve tried that actually works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since Christmas and my heels look like Pretty Lady Heels.</li>
            <li>This thing fixed my feet in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li>times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mostly used to the CVS brand callous scrapers that I&#x27;ve used over the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li>but WOW, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>This is the best pedicure item out there, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I am not one to spend money on pedicures, and envied other women whose feet looked so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the extreme course one for the last three days. :)</li>
            <li>I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST THING</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, when I first received it..</li>
            <li>it will be the first time in forever that i will expose my feet in public this summer.</li>
            <li>Great product although small and a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This product worked really good the first time I used it, but after a couple of uses it already needs a new blue roller thing and they are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li>I now have smooth, pretty feet instead of rough, dry calloused embarrassments!</li>
            <li>I usually put on heavy lotion followed by socks and my feet feel great.</li>
            <li>the dead skin comes off quickly and easily, with minimal fuss.</li>
            <li>I find it so easy to use that each day I take a few minutes and buff my heels whether they need it now or not.  </li>
            <li>It made quick work on all the rough spots on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I used the super coarse on my feet first and then smoothed with the extra coarse.  </li>
            <li>the roller is kind of small, i thought it would be a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>Pretty unbelievable, but true.  </li>
            <li>These make callus removal not only possible (which I never found using a pumice stone to be unless I was willing to sand for hours at a time), but fast and painless (if the unit is used according to the directions).  </li>
            <li>And the price is pretty much the same, so I would definitely recommend this model.</li>
            <li>Good powerful little unit to sand down rough callus.  </li>
            <li>My feet are almost always dry and cracked so treating them well is important, especially as a dancer.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy the super extra coarse rollers -</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and worked really well a few times.  </li>
            <li>it truly gets the old skin off so fast that you will need to pay attention to not go too low into new skin.</li>
            <li>It removes the bunions easily without cutting, as much at a time as I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought replacement rollers at the same time, but the original one seems to have a long lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I used high speed because my slightly arthritic hand can&#x27;t slide the switch into low easily.  </li>
            <li>Because of this little device, I now have smooth feet.</li>
            <li>This little unit is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I got a little over zealous my first time using it and ended up hurting myself by taking too much off (even though the package did give me a warning not to do that!).  </li>
            <li>The cord is long enough but not extremely long, easily reaches from the outlet to the sink.</li>
            <li>Very powerful little sander.</li>
            <li>husband suffers greatly with calloused and chapped hands this time of year.  </li>
            <li>It is simple to use and buffers rough spots on the feet smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it take forever to use, but your feet have a scratchy feel to them even after all of the time you&#x27;ve spent trying to make them smooth.  </li>
            <li>However, it seems to me that a clearly stated disclaimer could resolve this fear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched around for a place that I could get a pedicure that actually removed the dry/dead skin but never felt like they really got it.</li>
            <li>In the morning, my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li>~I jus got it &amp; after 20 minutes my feet felt as soft as a babys</li>
            <li>My feet haven&#x27;t felt this soft since ....</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li>but you really have to work at using it, especially since the roller isn&#x27;t exposed all the way around.  </li>
            <li>so I have to use the old faithful rasp to remove 80% of the problem then finish with the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I like baby soft feet</li>
            <li>The real surprise was when I finally got up and started to walk around.  </li>
            <li>Well I was pleasantly surprised when I used this on my feet.</li>
            <li>You just have to be soft touch to baby just skin and not dig a hole that can cause a scar or infected skin.</li>
            <li>The Micro-ped removes dead skin and calluses, leaving your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of electric and manual foot filers, emory boards, etc., and none of them worked near as well as this.  </li>
            <li>It has a wide enough head to cover larger areas than most pedicure tools, and works continuously and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of them completely</li>
            <li>I really like how it works and only wish I&#x27;d gotten some spare inserts.  </li>
            <li>I bought a  coarse roller, but really didn&#x27;t it need it.</li>
            <li>So soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>But as of now my wife has not needed to replace the old one.</li>
            <li>All in all, I was surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>(he doesn&#x27;t need it because his feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My feet are considerably smoother and prettier than they are after a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li>It made my Alligator feet as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>But they will be baby soft if you do them a couple of times ..</li>
            <li>but DO NOT waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had the buffer for about ten weeks now and still really like it.</li>
            <li>The cracks in my heels are still visible, and I&#x27;ll continue to work on those and update later, but they feel very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is, really, a glorified dremel tool, but it definitely does the job, eventually.  </li>
            <li>I have an old injury to my hand so this electric powered  smoother</li>
            <li>wow.....</li>
            <li>Rescue an old toothbrush with soft bristles, and the job is done in a jiffy while extending the life of the roller.  </li>
            <li>Maybe too early to write a review but here goes.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if I would say I have baby soft feet</li>
            <li>They have not felt this soft since when?</li>
            <li>Got the heavy duty roller and have been using it lightly every three days or so over about two weeks</li>
            <li>I stand up and use it near the plug so there&#x27;s no issues with the length of the cord.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>corded Emjoi has removed my calluses almost completely; at this point, they are reduced by about 90%.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this for all you feet abusers that would rather die than get a professional pedicure....</li>
            <li>As frequently as I use it, I recommend purchasing the electric vs. the battery operated otherwise you&#x27;ll spend a fortune on batteries.</li>
            <li>and my feet are still soft.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I expected.</li>
            <li>I have callouses from writing, gardening and working with my hands , my college age son has thick callouses on his feet from going bear foot most of the time, this has worked well for him.</li>
            <li>Strong little motor!</li>
            <li>It works fine for final smoothing if you&#x27;ve removed the callouses with other methods.  </li>
            <li>To wipe the area down to cool the callus and underlying tissues before proceeding again.</li>
            <li>It comes with a carrying white bag and simple white brush to clean the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Replaces:&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is time consuming and my hands get very tired, which isn&#x27;t good for arthritis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to minimize the cracking I was starting to get along the sides, with little effort!</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other models it is not so powerful that it will hurt you.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m a willing victim and she keeps my heals in check.  </li>
            <li>With this disease, the skin just starts to harden on my toes but with a light use of this Micro-Pedi, I can bring it back down to the soft skin.  </li>
            <li>No questions asked and 5 days later I have a brand new replacement!  </li>
            <li>They cannot last as long as this one and not as powerful</li>
            <li>service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered refills of extra coarse and super coarse for the Emjoi</li>
            <li>Waiting to see how long before I have to change the roller, but so far I am really liking this.  </li>
            <li>I have used a ped egg in the past, but many times I actually hurt myself by overfiling an area.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my feet smooth with little effort!</li>
            <li>BTW sorry it was so long, but wanted to make sure you all know this is worth the price!</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it - used it right away and got noticeable results with very little effort just as the instructions read.</li>
            <li>A must have for anyone who don&#x27;t liked dry hard skin on hands and feet.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have the worry of using up batteries plus this has a high &amp; low speed.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I have is to have several different callus rollers for the product in a finer one and a coarser one for harder more callus skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this - and may even cut back on pedicures - except that I like the massages and nail clipping!</li>
            <li>Used the low setting on each foot and then the high setting.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it with the extra course rollers</li>
            <li>It has a low and high setting.  </li>
            <li>The roller head seems to be very durable and has lasted a long time</li>
            <li>Small size of the unit fits comfortable in my hands.  </li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time on my feet and before I got it I became pretty resigned to having rough callused</li>
            <li>I used this the first day I received it and within seconds had cleared up the rough skin on my feet.</li>
            <li>I returned this one and ordered the more expensive corded model which is totally worth the extra cash.</li>
            <li>I spent a bit of time the first go, but the results were immediately noticable.</li>
            <li>Will definitely save you time and money over going to a salon or using normal pedicure tools...</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Now, some of the cracks go too deep for the Emjoi&#x27;s reach, but now the edges are smoothed enough that the lotion won&#x27;t be wasted on surface toughness and will now be able to reach deeper.</li>
            <li>other one is battery operated and may be more convenient but as batteries wear down the power will diminish&lt;br /&gt;the electric model has even power.  </li>
            <li>did order a couple of other grades of the tubes, and although the regular ones did a fine job, the extra abrasive ones help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love emjoi but have found I have to work with their most expensive product to get it to work, and I just  can&#x27;t see that for the bottoms of my feet !!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and supplier emailed me right away informing me that this  edition was out of stock but, not wanting me to have to wait for back orders, they upgraded my order to a more expensive model at no additional charge.</li>
            <li>used the green rollers and got amazing results and went a little overboard.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Better than any other product I have previously used.  </li>
            <li>I have used several other products that say they will remove callous skin but nothing does it as quickly and throughly as this one...</li>
            <li>I get regular pedicures,  but this item removed more hard heel skin then any  manicurist ever did.  </li>
            <li>It required new batteries after only three uses.</li>
            <li>I ordered the above version, but received &amp;#34;a new and improved&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>love this little machine!!!</li>
            <li>really does take off dry skin</li>
            <li>all with minimal success -- especially in dealing with my calluses.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last, but it worked well this first time.</li>
            <li>If you are like me then it take about 3-4 tries before you are able to fully remove all of the dead skin.</li>
            <li>My feet are soft and not dry and/or callous at all.  </li>
            <li>It would be wrong for me not to give a glowing review for a product I immediately love so much.</li>
            <li>Takes much less time than the battery powered one which just sort of chugged along even with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li>and it works tremendous removing all of my dead skin ..  </li>
            <li>Under no circumstances get the battery powered one, the batteries would not last long and it would not be powerful enough.</li>
            <li>I cut my toenails regularly (as Jerry Seinfeld once said, &amp;#34;Ever two to six weeks.&amp;#34;), but that was about the only care I ever paid to my feet on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely order one of the other models for the other bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It really saved my dry feet!</li>
            <li>but if you need more there is an extreme green &amp; another one for a mans foot as well as a lavender one for ruff elbows~</li>
            <li>I had the battery-powered one previously and it gave out after a few months, but I liked it well enough while it lasted to buy another - this time with the wall plug</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip - I try and soak my feet for a few minutes in warm water first, then dry them off, use the micro-pedi (not for too long though, or it gets a little sore), then apply lotion and socks.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well after I &amp;#34;prepped &amp;#34; my very dry feet.</li>
            <li>Thank God for this little powerful callus remover.</li>
            <li>This is a sturdy, powerful little tool.</li>
            <li>It works wonders; removing rough dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li>This items quickly and efficiently removes the rough, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I still have the original buffer on it, and will look into ordering that same type for future uses when this one wears down.</li>
            <li>Works well on hard calluses and makes your feet smooth.  </li>
            <li>The extra coarse sanding roller on high speed  was sufficient to eradicate the built up skin on the heels, the ridge atop the ball of the foot, and the side of the ball.</li>
            <li>This easy device removes all that dry skin 1-2-3 by simply passing the roller up and down the affected area.</li>
            <li>From the first use I felt a huge difference, and my feet were getting pretty bad with cracked heels</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last without needing to be changed, but I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t much care with results like this.  </li>
            <li>The only reason for a professional pedicure is the pamper.</li>
            <li>I bought the corded version and have no regrets, but it does limit portability.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far though</li>
            <li>I have only use the corded Emjoi two times so far</li>
            <li>Never thought I would have such soft feet.</li>
            <li>Really smooths out rough and cracking feet.</li>
            <li>My bare feet felt like Velcro on the carpet.  </li>
            <li>Be careful tho as it goes fast.</li>
            <li>daily and just about have the calluses completely removed.  </li>
            <li>It barely shaves off any callous&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It rubs off the callouses gradually, a layer at a time, creating soft dust that falls to the floor (occasionally, I had to stop and blow the dust off the remover).  </li>
            <li>Immediately, I am walking differently, not just without the usual discomfort to which I&#x27;d grown accustomed, but my feet are actually hitting the floor more properly.</li>
            <li>My feet have only felt this soft after leaving the podiatrist office.  </li>
            <li>My feet were a disaster after my last pregnancy - so many gross, thick calluses.  </li>
            <li>We recommend it to anyone with thick calluses on their feet who would like to have smooth feet again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best way to get rid of cruddy callouses</li>
            <li>I own a battery operated one and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li>It says, just a few sessions, I hope it&#x27;s longer than that, but it&#x27;s worth to me buying replacement rollers.</li>
            <li>They were very surprised how fast this little machine takes off the callouses.</li>
            <li>All the other units like this that I researched were battery powered, and most of the reviews of those other brands complained that the batteries ran low rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I took down about 2/3 of my calluses on my first treatment.</li>
            <li>(PS - In the instructions it says not to use it outside, but with all the dust it produces - especially on your first use - I would not use it in the house unless you&#x27;re doing it over a dry bathtub....)</li>
            <li>Some have complained that there is only one side of the roller accessible for use, but I found that it keeps a lot of the dust from flying everywhere and also protects the soft underside of my toes while I tackle the ball-of-my-foot calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Peels dead skin right off.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi does a great job in very little time, is tough on the callouses but gentle enough that I&#x27;ve used it every other day since receiving it.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t had a pedicure or really spent any time buffing off the dead skin on my feet in almost 2 years (and I live in a place where flip flops are worn pretty much all year long)</li>
            <li>Without a brand in mind, I did research on battery-vs.-corded and decided that batteries would be less powerful and more annoying than the convenience of complete mobility was worth.</li>
            <li>The whole process took at least an hour, but I figured it was my first time and when my feet have regular treatments it wont take any longer than 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how little effort it really took.</li>
            <li>The problem with the Dremel bits was that they would begin to heat up due to friction if to much pressure was applied.</li>
            <li>does ok job wish it was a little stronger for I have heavy callous&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I did have the same issue after I stole double A&#x27;s from my remote to get it going the first night.  </li>
            <li>The only down side I can foresee is that the rollers really do get sanded down easily if you have rough patches and callouses.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, if you sit back down to redo your feet and make them soft it only last a few days and they feel like sandpaper when you walk on carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I convinced myself that it was a matter of time before things would turn around</li>
            <li>I put new, high quality batteries in prior to the first use, and it seemed to operate rather weakly.  </li>
            <li>It had been close to a year since my last pedi, and it took much of the rough, yucky skin off.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, she went back to using an old fashioned, hand held callus remover.</li>
            <li>I am able with several passes to get extremely thick dry skin off the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li>I had to be careful not to use it in an area for to long since it produced no uncomfortable friction.</li>
            <li>I took off thick callus with the extra course and then used the blue one to fine tune.</li>
            <li>Be carefully with loose skin will pitch it a little bit but, more a scare than an actual harm.</li>
            <li>My feet are now really soft and feel REALLY STRANGE now after being completely yuck for so long.</li>
            <li>After only 4-5 uses the callouses that I developed on each of my big toes (since my hammertoe surgery) are noticeably smaller and smoother.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t scared of going to far with it because as long as there is roughness the area was protected.  </li>
            <li>In a few minutes I was ready for my sandals!</li>
            <li>I used it for 5 minutes each foot for a few says in a row at first.</li>
            <li>Air out your feet for a few hours first.</li>
            <li>A small but powerful tool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not too late to return it for a full refund</li>
            <li>It did what it said it is small but powerful.  </li>
            <li>I live in CO &amp; have very dry skin to begin with.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t apply too much pressure or it will bogg down.  </li>
            <li>but I do not recommend the battery operated because of power issues and bogging down with too much pressure.</li>
            <li>Motor slows down quite a bit with too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Even before I got psoriasis this year, I still think it is multitudes better than the steel file I used to use that irritated my skin &amp; left it course only to grow back worse.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful so you can carefully bear down on it without the roller slowing down too much or locking up.</li>
            <li>I tried the product,  I was expecting it to be more powerful, and I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take off a lot of skin which surprised me because like I said - my feet weren&#x27;t that dry.  </li>
            <li>I think emoji has spent more effort on marketing and branding themselves than they have on making quality products and I feel that this brand in particular has tons of fake reviews.</li>
            <li>But, even then, it removes even thick callus quickly.</li>
            <li>Yeah, I know it is not the most romantic gift in the world, but you don&#x27;t know how hard it is to buy for my hubby!!  </li>
            <li>I live in Colorado where it is very dry and even after regular pedicures my feet need to be buffed often as they get ragged, especially the heels.  </li>
            <li>It did take a few uses to get really smooth, probably because I went slow and gingerly at first careful not to burn the skin or wear the motor.</li>
            <li>THE LITTLE DEVICE REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I really like this little gadget.  </li>
            <li>Not sore really, just a little tender for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had been using a pumice stone which took so much work just to make even  a little difference.  </li>
            <li>I tried two other new batteries and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>The only minor downside is that the roller is a bit difficult to get really clean looking, but really to me that&#x27;s not a particularly big deal.</li>
            <li>My bunions are totally smooth for several days and before the Micro Pedi the next day the bunions were hard and rough again.&lt;br /&gt;chh</li>
            <li>Some were good and some were bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> AND DID I MENTION THAT I LOVE THIS FOOT BUFFER!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like the emoji but it just isn&#x27;t very effective for the amount of money it costs.</li>
            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This works amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing !</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, I don&#x27;t even need a pedicure anymore!</li>
            <li> Look good, feel great.</li>
            <li> I got the electric for more power &amp; am so happy with it!</li>
            <li> Works perfect, allows me more time between pedicures.</li>
            <li> a wonderful gift for anyone who cares about their feet, and they will love it.  </li>
            <li> This may not be the perfect solution, but it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be good, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be great.  </li>
            <li> The calus remover is perfectly formed for easy handling.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a great job!</li>
            <li> If you press it just stops spinning but that is probably a good safety feature.  </li>
            <li> works good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased at how effective this product is!</li>
            <li> Works great, nice power...</li>
            <li> Has good power.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Even if you are not diabetic this is a good thing to do.</li>
            <li> this emjoi micro pedi nano will be a good friend.</li>
            <li> the idea is good bu</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> feel like this product is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Then I remembered all the good amazon reviews &amp; said this must work somehow, I must be using it incorrectly..</li>
            <li> I also am extremely happy with the prompt, efficient and courteous service from SHAVENOW, the company I purchased</li>
            <li> to get them in in good condition again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was counting on the good reviews and thought it would do the job.</li>
            <li> it works really good</li>
            <li> But it was good and did the job.</li>
            <li> a product does not have good ratings on amazon</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has good reviews.</li>
            <li> It was a good choice.</li>
            <li> Follow up with a good moisturizing foot lotion.</li>
            <li> This works really good on my feet.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a good cream to extend the treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works good</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing roughness of heels.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful my feet are callous free now</li>
            <li> Yup, still good.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> The battery operated may be well and good</li>
            <li> Corded has good power throughout.</li>
            <li> Do the job perfect, is for a light + callus problems.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Good that it is electric and no batteries.</li>
            <li> However..my husbands are and he achieved great results as well (using his own rollers).</li>
            <li> Works good, no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Superior to everything</li>

            <li> I am in love with my feet now!</li>
            <li> : it was a beautiful, smooth, healthy-red (as opposed to scary-red) patch buffed below the surrounding calluses.</li>
            <li> is the best ;)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Safe!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type to go spend money on pedicures, but I sure do need them!  </li>

            <li> Still need a stronger one but better than battery operated!</li>
            <li> works great and easy to use</li>
            <li> So easy to use and it greatly reduced my calluses......</li>
            <li> It is amazing, I am in love with it!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, I purchased the electric one and it has good power and is very easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> The shape of the Emjoi fits the hand very nicely and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is great for travel and light foot up keep.</li>
            <li> This thing is really amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful I found this amazing device and my feet feel healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My feet feel amazing.</li>
            <li> but there has been an amazing difference and feel in rubbing my feet together at night in bed.</li>
            <li> which is amazing considering the condition I&#x27;ve got my feet in).</li>
            <li> Great way to remove a callus and keep your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> it is absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li> The cord is a not too secure when attached but this works great.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My feet are smooth after, but still \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on the sheets - I think polishing them somehow would be great - just have to figure out</li>
            <li> was using Dr Scholl&#x27;s callus pads and liked them a lot.</li>
            <li> With this you can do your own pedicures.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if they offered a combination pkg replacement cylinders.</li>
            <li> The person to whom I gave it was thrilled and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  </li>
            <li> My friend really liked it too</li>
            <li> The device never even got warm during use.</li>
            <li> your spouse/roommate/partner can use it too and they can have their own roll.</li>
            <li> this micro- pedi , nano callus remove work nice</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t own shares in the company or know anyone that works there.</li>
            <li> I own both models.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and gently</li>
            <li> It has two speeds which is nice.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used the battery Emjoi which I really like but the plug in version is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is exceptional, nothing has ever worked better for me, easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll make my own.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried it also and really liked the results.  </li>
            <li> Nice variety of emery files.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a plug in rather than batteries.</li>
            <li> Its best not to do it immediately after getting out of the shower or after taking off the shoes you&#x27;ve been wearing all day as your feet will have been basting in sweat that whole time.</li>
            <li> Nice idea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the battery operated and loved them, but when I bought this one I realized it is much better.  </li>
            <li> podiatrist recommended that I try this kind of product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after reading horror stories about the tools used in some salons for getting a pedicure, we decided that we needed a tool to help us perform pedicures at home.</li>
            <li> absolutely the BEST!  </li>
            <li> So effective.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> I love it and how a good job it does on your feet.</li>
            <li> I bought a refill roller for every person in the house so that everyone can have their own.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of pumice and lotion on the market.  </li>
            <li> so it seems it should be used every 2 weeks to keep your feet looking and feeling nice.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely the best pedicure kit.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!  </li>
            <li> Does just what I hoped -- easy to use and quite effective!</li>
            <li> Very nice light weight tool with two speed settings,\.</li>
            <li> They look and feel beautiful, for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend the Emjoi AND this great company!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this item is the best!  </li>
            <li> this unit is my new best friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this i bought the &amp;#34;Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp Brown&amp;#34; - It&#x27;s amazing and takes seconds to see great results, plus you don&#x27;t need electricity or batteries.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t think that I will need to use this anymore than once a week to keep my be looking great, healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> where and is easy to handle (good ergonomics).  </li>
            <li> It would be very easy to do.</li>
            <li> It is effortless to use and gets rid of the calluses within minutes and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does work and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It has two speeds, and the rollers are very, very easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> I got great results the very first time I used the Micro Pedi.</li>
            <li> This is the product I have been looking for, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoothing action is awesome however it doesn&#x27;t work for me as a stand alone tool for the cracks on my heels.</li>
            <li> Very happy so far with the results from the Emjoi corded Micro-Pedi Callus Remover</li>
            <li> I tried 3 others of this type and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> This product is the most amazing thing in the world</li>
            <li> This is by far the best callus remover I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> But I think I&#x27;d do better with a power sander honestly.</li>
            <li> I have a professional pedicure once a month, and even they can&#x27;t get all the callouses off, so this is perfect for smoothing my heels in between visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the battery operated kind.  </li>
            <li> It is a great tool for maintaining your feet and a bonus is that your feet shine so nice and pretty when you&#x27;re done with your treatment.</li>
            <li> So easy a cave (wo)man can do it!</li>
            <li> very nice and powerful.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft now.. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget , works great !!!</li>
            <li> It was battery operated, this is a much better product for me and more cost effective.</li>
            <li> It is more like an electric razor and very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> It feels so great to &#x27;feel my heels&#x27; for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve seen my feet look this great in years...</li>
            <li> Leaves your feet very smooth.</li>
            <li> Reviews are very important to me.  </li>
            <li> And it is nice to know how easily I can keep them looking and feeling that way.</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy on the feet.</li>
            <li> its ok but not as strong and effective was advertised</li>
            <li> Best of all super fast..</li>
            <li> More importantly, my heels love this!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item</li>
            <li> Love that it is corded</li>
            <li> plus I love going barefoot most of the time</li>
            <li> My feet look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> Make sure your moisturize after each use.</li>
            <li> I love that&#x27;s its a plug in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad to have found this product.  </li>
            <li> I love having this at home that I can do myself whenever I need to.  </li>
            <li> That are all most groan</li>
            <li> Love the product and that its electric.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> because when she does her feet with a stone - or I do her feet with a stone - she uses alot more force.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I got this.</li>
            <li> I look forward to having smooth feet from now on!</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk!  </li>
            <li> i love this one with the cord, batteries operated ones are not the way to go.</li>
            <li> Glad I got the corded one.  </li>
            <li> Probably has more power and no batteries to buy.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, and was impressed immediately.</li>
            <li> I can now wear cute ballet slipper shoes without pain.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> More power.</li>
            <li> Love this Emjoi callus remover.</li>
            <li> Really works great, I love it.</li>
            <li> this callus remover works really great an takes callus off fast love</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> So glad i got this model that you plug into the wall.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to use this more than once a week.</li>
            <li> I expect I&#x27;ll be using it more</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It  am going to give these as gifts, anyone ( guy or girl) would love this.</li>
            <li> Better than a hand held file, or pumis stone.</li>
            <li> I hesitated because of the price, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to use it as directed.</li>
            <li> not anymore :)&lt;</li>
            <li> and I must say that this is a better buy.  </li>
            <li> but this is definitely a better buy.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the emjoi.  </li>
            <li> And I love is so much better</li>
            <li> Soo much better than buffing by hand.</li>
            <li> Needs a bit more power..</li>
            <li> Now what do I do with it:)</li>
            <li> pleased with my purchase and</li>
            <li> glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product as much as I love my husband.</li>
            <li> Love this device.</li>
            <li> My heals have been cracked and calloused for so many years</li>
            <li> So I am hoping that with continued use and more lotion these lines will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> you have no idea how many pedicure machines, files, grinders, creams, foot rubs and</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love that it is electric</li>
            <li> This callus remover sure does the job.</li>
            <li> I love it -</li>
            <li> I purchased the battery-operated version at Costco more than a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I love this callus remover.</li>
            <li> and I do like the way they keep my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also feel like I have to maneuver more</li>
            <li> I love the job it does and how it works.</li>
            <li> which is why I think many people think it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> If you brush the powder off you get more use out of a roll.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel better about my feet</li>
            <li> love it......</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> and it works so much better and faster....</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me knowing how many products I&#x27;ve tried to resolve the issue of cracking skin and dense callouses on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with it; would I recommend it to a friend?</li>
            <li> I love the Micro Pedi.</li>
            <li> Baby smooth feet in minutes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the cordless/rechargeable model for about 2 years now and rave about it as well as recommended it many relatives and friends.  </li>
            <li> I imagine my feet are exposed and take more of a beating that people who mostly wear shoes and socks.</li>
            <li> Thank Amazon for carry so many quality things and be always a trusted site.</li>
            <li> This callus remover does a better job than the person who gives me my pedicures.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I chose to get the one with the cord instead of batteries.  </li>
            <li> Wife &amp; I have been pleased w/feet having been able to get constancy (without batteries).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose the corded model.  </li>
            <li> I love this...</li>
            <li> I am glad I went with the corded one</li>
            <li> I also used it to file my finger nails and the course skin on the top part of my fingers</li>
            <li> I LOVE his product, have tried almost everything on market to reduce heel cracks on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have been embarrassed by my feet for so many years.  </li>
            <li> Excellent with just the coarse roller.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re 10x better.</li>
            <li> but it probably would if I used it more often.</li>
            <li> so I knew I needed more time to work on them.</li>
            <li> It does the job better than any pedicure and any slicing equipment or brushes.</li>
            <li> Enjoy ladies !</li>
            <li> feet feel soooo much better now.  </li>
            <li> I should use it more often.</li>
            <li> This has made my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, it really does work great.</li>
            <li> course, now seeing what it does, just pull out your orbital sander. :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a weekend at the beach...</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> I love this Emjoi product, I immediately took it out the package and started working on my feet</li>
            <li> I have better things to do than spend my time primping and this gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It really does work great.</li>
            <li> Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Glad my search is over for a pedi device.</li>
            <li> It was gone in about 30 seconds at the most.</li>
            <li> It works ok but the roughness returns in a day or two</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product since Costco was selling the battery operated version - and we all know that Costco sells only the best!  </li>
            <li> This item is just ok - let me put it this way -</li>
            <li> I never would have given more than 20 bucks for it.</li>
            <li> This has more power since it is electric and not battery operated.</li>
            <li> , I think it would be more convenient.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews for callus removers, I decided to give this one</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li> The finer grade (the one that is included) worked well, but I feel like it is more appropriate for finishing/</li>
            <li> I also have a battery powered Emjoi, which I love, but this one works even better.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I got the rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li> Works better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> I am veery pleased with the performance and ease of handling this product.  </li>
            <li> I will try the more course rollers and see if that does the job faster.  </li>
            <li> and she said it was her favorite gift.</li>
            <li> Now, they&#x27;re so smooth!  </li>
            <li> LOVE â¤</li>
            <li> This does a better job than the salon does when it comes to callus removal.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this callus remover.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was better then it look.</li>
            <li> I had another brand battery powered which was still better than using a manual foot scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased...</li>
            <li> love it works as advertised</li>
            <li> I also use foot cream every night and put socks on to make things better.</li>
            <li> Then I saw the Emjoi on TV and was impressed enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still continue pedicures because I love the way they do my toes</li>
            <li> So glad, I bought this brand.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth this makes my heels and feet!</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Since I love Emjoi</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about buying this even though I read the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> you will got through many of the &amp;#34;sanders&amp;#34; which will be costly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> This Micro-Pedi is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll order some replacement rollers that are even more abrasive to get the toughest areas, and a smoothing roller as well.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love their hair removal product and was hoping to love this product as well.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful -- 10 times better than various &amp;#34;battery operated&amp;#34; versions.  </li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have ever use.</li>
            <li> more power and don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries all the time</li>
            <li> Works so much better than the battery operated model.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> Love this device...</li>
            <li> your feet will be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s foot!</li>
            <li> Much better than a salon pedicure and easier than any over the counter callus file I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s by far the best available.</li>
            <li> The motor could have more power.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing to going to the podiatrist.  </li>
            <li> I purchase the more corse sander cylinders for another $18.</li>
            <li> OK, it has been a 5 weeks since I bought this</li>
            <li> One more thing, put a towel on the floor under where you are doing this to catch the excess skin dust.</li>
            <li> It meets my expectations and more.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My feet have never been so smooth!</li>
            <li> I just wish I could use it more than 2-3 seconds as recommended.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. :)</li>
            <li> so just bear in mind to keep it fresh with good quality batteries</li>
            <li> However, that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using and enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I did find that I sanded the heel of one of my feet probably a bit more than I should have</li>
            <li> I love it, thinking about adding this to my gift giving list.</li>
            <li> JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I owned the battery operated Emjoi Micro-Pedi and love it.</li>
            <li> My feet are so nice and smooth now.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things from pumice stones to files to battery powered callus removers.  </li>
            <li> What a luxurious feel to slip into socks or sheets and get the smooth sensation of pampered feet!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of people touching my feet, so I opted for this as opposed to a couple pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably save that for more &#x27;upkeep&#x27; jobs.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got the plug in version.</li>
            <li> This tool is FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li> My heals are now nice a smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many.</li>
            <li> but i like the cordless one better.</li>
            <li> If you want to save on batteries, than you will love this one too.</li>
            <li> I love this corded Nano version even more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> just love this</li>
            <li> The pumice stone that I have does a much better job than the Emjoi Callus Remover.  </li>
            <li> I love how my feet feel afterward.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I got the corded model instead of the battery operated one, this has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Frankly, this does a better job than any pedicure that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use a towel.....</li>
            <li> Works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried including sanding pads.</li>
            <li> I also bought the elbow file that fits this enjoy and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> So much better than using a pumice stone or the Egg.  </li>
            <li> It is better than expected,finally  I don&#x27;t tear my stockings.</li>
            <li> Glad I read the reviews and bought the model with the cord.</li>
            <li> I love that it is electric and doesn&#x27;t require batteries</li>
            <li> While the manual apparatus is okay</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it serves the purpose for getting most of the callus off of my feet</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS ONE IS BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE POWER  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it has a cord</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to have plug in.</li>
            <li> Love this product works so much better than the battery operated one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY EMJOI Micro-Pedi ...get one</li>
            <li> , you will, too! :-)</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> Needs more grit and power.  </li>
            <li> so glad it is NOT battery operated,  also works on hand palm callus</li>
            <li> So much better than battery powered one.</li>
            <li> My feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li> After comparing many products like this , I decided on the Micro-pedi.</li>
            <li> I love to use this - summer or winter</li>
            <li> I love to see the results.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> Really wanted this product to be great.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I use to love to go to the mall and get pedicures--no more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> Who has the money to keep buying the latest and \\&quot;greatest?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> We all love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li> 1000x better than battery one</li>
            <li> They temporarily made it look better, but nothing touched the years of abuse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product. :)</li>
            <li> I Love it.</li>
            <li> After one use I need to change out the roller for more grit.  </li>
            <li> After using it I can attest that the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> It sure beats using the grater-like foot smoother</li>
            <li> Not anymore, I absolutely love this product and would recommend to everyone to try.</li>
            <li> If you think you still need more &#x27;power&#x27;, purchase a more course bar to replace the one that comes with the unit.</li>
            <li> She never had anything like it before, but she saw a similar product on TV, so I researched it &amp; decided this was the best option since it was corded and had 2 speed settings.  </li>
            <li> Glad that I bought it without batteries and it can be used also when travelling in Europe.</li>
            <li> it get the job done safely, without cuts.</li>
            <li> have ordered plenty of the rougher type for my heels, the one it comes with being better for the front of the feet or hands.</li>
            <li> The fact is that my Emjoi (and make SURE you get a cordless model) works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this product.  </li>
            <li> but I got one that I love.</li>
            <li> (I am not some kind of rep for that cream, btw,and it is super cheap and available at all sorts of drug stores in the US, but I thought I would mention it because anyone who is reading this review probably needs a great cheap foot cream too...)</li>
            <li> Very easy to go over your feet once a day or whenever need, then smooth on some of your favorite foot cream or lotion.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, outstanding results and best of all my flip-flop wearing husband now has feet as soft and callus free...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first with it until I really put some time in with it.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, run it over your dry areas , its fast and works great.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s handy to have the wastebasket there to periodically tap the unit it to clean, as well as keeping the dust from settling on the floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll come to rely on this comfortable,  easy to handle tool for years to come !</li>
            <li> Works great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am super glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin on my feet and this has worked perfectly without damaging the healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I use this often &amp; it makes my feet look better much more quickly &amp; easily than using a file or anything else.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, my feet are in pretty good shape</li>
            <li> The A/C power supply on this unit eliminates that problem - run it as long as you need to, there&#x27;s no loss in power and the unit does an excellent job of removing even hardened calluses.  </li>
            <li> I had to spend a fair amount of time this first use</li>
            <li> Excellent item.... should have bought this long ago.  </li>
            <li> Just soft, beautiful feet.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite nice not breaking into a sweat while pedicure-ing!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone looking for beautiful feet and smooth soles.</li>
            <li> I love this device, it smooths out everything very nicely, my feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in many years.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t replace the batteries with great quality new ones every fifth time</li>
            <li> It is amazing how great my feet look after only one use.  </li>
            <li> Love this callus remover, easy to use/clean up,</li>
            <li> Does a nice job quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted a corded version because I wanted to be sure of strong power any time I needed to use it.  </li>
            <li> Works best on dry feet not soaked.</li>
            <li> For anyone with dry, cracked, calloused, and/or peeling feet, this product is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Removes dry skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> Like with my heels, these spots will now be more easily helped by the lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent to remove warts and dry skin.</li>
            <li> love using this, works fast and does a good job</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I brought more as gifts for friends.  </li>
            <li> The electric unit is perfect, compact, quiet, will fit in any bag if I&#x27;m traveling</li>
            <li> It is powerful and so far has worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and better than the callus remover gel at the salon!</li>
            <li> The best thing ever for polishing my dry, crusty heels!  </li>
            <li> I have the original shape which is more conducive for a better result.</li>
            <li> Works great on foot work without burning like my old battery dremmel tool.</li>
            <li> But as far as performance is concerned it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> So far this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome product to take off the rough edges.  </li>
            <li> My feet are lovely which is saying something for a person who primarily wears flip flops and clogs.</li>
            <li> Walking barefoot is much more comfortable....</li>
            <li> Try using it in the tub before running water, then have your favorite emollient/moisturizer/foot care product available for after wash/rinse.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy and would recommend the Micro-Pedi to anyone with rough, callused feet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine.</li>
            <li> In combination with the regular use of the CORDLESS Emjoi you will see incredible results.  </li>
            <li> The Micro-pedi Callus Remover by Emjoi really works when nothing else did a good job.</li>
            <li> The shaver works quite well; it is powerful, very fine sanding, and safe.</li>
            <li> photo-- amazing, right?</li>
            <li> Not only does this do a great job of smoothing out foot calluses, but itâs also very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, other than the fact this thing is great!</li>
            <li> Maybe it is effective for persons who routinely receive professional pedicures and their feet are in pretty great shape to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Electric products are always more powerful, and I don&#x27;t have to keep replacing batteries!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li> You do need to be very careful when using the Emjoi that you keep the machine moving and at 2-3second intervals for the best result.  </li>
            <li> more powerful than amope for sure.</li>
            <li> Go easy with it.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was just a tad more powerful but still works like magic...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t yet needed to replace the sander it is an easy process.</li>
            <li> Easy and painless.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works easily</li>
            <li> It is really an easy way to get rid of calluses.  </li>
            <li> Very quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and does not hurt.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of callouses easily.</li>
            <li> The device is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it can be easily stored in a drawer.</li>

            <li> Had no problems with it working fine.</li>
            <li> but it is fine with the rollers it comes with.</li>

            <li> So much more powerful than the battery operated unit.  </li>

            <li> I chose to get the corded model, believing it would be more powerful than one with batteries.</li>
            <li> Works great - wish I had ordered extra rollers because I want to use it often!</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my personal mani/pedi kit.  </li>
            <li> where it&#x27;s easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Even the nail salon can&#x27;t get my feet as smooth as this.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient said it works Fantastic. .</li>
            <li> I started with Baby Foot procedure and then have used this every week to maintain my smooth feet.</li>
            <li> It works, but light on the &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> In just minutes it sloughs off all those callouses and makes my feet smooth again.</li>
            <li> This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  </li>
            <li> It requires a light touch.</li>
            <li> It felt like a light massage.</li>
            <li> I have smooth feet again  </li>
            <li> Cream up and repeat occasionally and soon your feet will be in great condition.</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade to the corded version as it is described as being more powerful.  </li>
            <li> therefore it isn&#x27;t any more powerful than the battery operated one.  </li>
            <li> I also imagine this corded version would be more powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> but boy your feet will be smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda of like using finishing sandpaper on wood - it makes the surface smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> after my pedi its smooth so</li>
            <li> I used it for my husband and he was amazed to see and feel how smooth his feet were.</li>
            <li> PLease note when you purchase the rollers to buy the GENUINE one.</li>
            <li> This is much more powerful than battery powered callus removers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will get smooth heels.  </li>
            <li> In a couple of minutes using this Emjoi a couple days in a row (did not want to overdo), the calluses were gone and the skin was smooth.  </li>
            <li> Much more powerful than the battery one I already had.  </li>
            <li> This is now my primary tool for eliminating calluses.  </li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of smoothing out a callus, too.</li>
            <li> Went lightly over the soles of my feet and then applied a foot night cream.</li>
            <li> I have bunions and it would take up to 15 minutes sometimes to rub my bunions smooth.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 2 minutes to rub the bunions smooth with the Micor Pedi Callus Remover.  </li>
            <li> In just 10 minutes my feet were as smooth as they had been in all the years of going to the nail salon for pedicures.</li>
            <li> I purchase refill heads, I will buy a coarser grain to get them REALLY smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Micro Pedi is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Hold it lightly and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Just received my enjoy callous remover</li>
            <li> and it definitely lives up to the anticipation and all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My feet are that smooth.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and this works so much better than a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth it makes my feet feel.</li>
            <li> I brought this Corded Micro-pedi Callus Remover by Emjoi for my wife last year and she is still happy with it.</li>
            <li> I recommend the corded over the battery one, which is more powerful.</li>
            <li> Just spread a towel on your lap, turn your heel up so you can see it and press the device lightly to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my heels for about 2 minutes and they are so smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> the Emjoi is now dead which is probably for the best.  </li>
            <li> Light to handle.</li>
            <li> Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;It has two settings, but it could be a bit more powerful.  </li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, but I also recommend the manufacturer to upgrade the motor to one more powerful.</li>
            <li> It just takes a light touch to get smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> If feels like an electric razor and it takes about 1 or 2 minutes to make your foot smooth.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this and buy one for everyone.</li>
            <li> Finally found this one at a great price.</li>
            <li> my feet have not felt this smooth for years.  </li>
            <li> It has taken 2 of the 3 to get my calluses smooth.  </li>
            <li> You always have plenty of power, paired with the green rollers, the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li> and it really did a nice job.  </li>
            <li> Each time I use it my heels feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Just lightly touch.  </li>
            <li> This is actually one callus remover that I am truly happy with.  </li>

            <li> Feet are smooth is a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> It is important to me that I don&#x27;t need to soak my feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped going to salons because I seem to get a fungus every time but wanted to have smooth feet again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Within 10 minutes my feet were almost totally smooth, I waited a couple of days to do it again so that i didn&#x27;t irritate the skin</li>
            <li> this thing got my skin incredibly smooth in five minutes (and it didn&#x27;t hurt-</li>

            <li> Fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> AND IT WORKS FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since they were this smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I can keep my feet silky smooth.</li>
            <li> this does smooth out the feet as well as a pedicure....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light years ahead of doing it manually.</li>

            <li> So easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> This really got my feet feeling better and of course looking better.</li>
            <li> The corded Emjoi unit works very well, and I love how smooth it makes my feet!  </li>
            <li> Keeping rollers clear with a tooth brush was a good tip of another reviewer BTW.</li>
            <li> However, I will probably have to go at them again at least two more times to get them to be &#x27;perfect&#x27; and get rid of a couple stubborn calluses.  </li>
            <li> , this is far superior in terms of it&#x27;s power and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Top Ten List of Needed Necessities in Order to Feel Good About Yourself\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used the Emojoi once, and my feet are soooo smooth, it feels funny to walk on them!!  </li>
            <li> This is great but dont expect miracles after 1 use especially with the original rollers it comes with.</li>
            <li> I real money saver..!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than a single pedicure, fast, efficient, easy to use, and does an excellent job, so I don&#x27;t need to use it as often as I was having salon/spa pedicures.</li>
            <li> The AC version is very powerful.</li>
            <li> He used a toothbrush to clean the roller which easily ejects to clean or change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t make it as easy to use quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy way to get smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Priced right as well - better than battery operated model - so worth it!</li>
            <li> Stronger power &amp; so quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Each roller lasts about 6 full feets&#x27; worth, more if you just use this on your heels.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and gentle.</li>
            <li> Good to have if you have major calluses.</li>
            <li> The newer super coarse replacement rollers are great.</li>
            <li> Both work great, but the plug in model is slightly stronger and the battery model fits in the suitcase better.  </li>
            <li> Now I just use it for touch ups every other week or so, and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li> Love this product - feet are pretty and smoother.  </li>
            <li> my feet haven&#x27;t felt this great in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is not my first Emjoi product and I&#x27;ve been satisfied each time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon for $29.95 and it is well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> I love it soooo much!</li>
            <li> The original product and replacement rollers should be accompanied with finishing emery pads (like the Pedi-egg) for premium after-treatment, or to use between treatments.  </li>
            <li> and with the original rollers.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having this to use in addition to my mani, pedi&#x27;s I purchased my first Emjoi from QVC years ago.</li>
            <li> actually feel, nice!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice long cord and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; is worth every penny~</li>
            <li> When finished with each foot, take a moist rag and wipe the roller clean.</li>
            <li> Super smooth feet..</li>
            <li> Even with clean feet</li>
            <li> I remove the drum and clean it under water.</li>

            <li> I awoke to super smooth heals.  </li>
            <li> Great product for dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Rather than using the supplied brush to clean skin dust off the roller, I&#x27;ve found that low pressure compressed air does the best job, by far.  </li>
            <li> Heels are super smooth in no time with no effort.  </li>
            <li> After trying to buy different foot products, this by far, has been the greatest invention.</li>
            <li> Pumice roller, and a breeze to clean up.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my cracked dry heels.</li>
            <li> It will be nice to have soft, feminine hands again!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  Unbelievably effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very easy to use and not messy at all!!</li>

            <li> This Callus remover is gentle and it&#x27;s super easy to use, it&#x27;s just a breeze!</li>
            <li> I can tell you right now that the battery will not work as well!</li>
            <li> The truth of the matter is that this electric one works way better and is more powerful than the other popular brand.  </li>
            <li> This is the best little thing I&#x27;ve ever found!!  </li>
            <li> Great for those rough heels.</li>
            <li> This works great on removing rough spots and cracks.</li>
            <li> In just a couple of minutes the rough skin on my heel and toes was greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> yourself a huge favoure buy the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp</li>
            <li> It seems pretty powerful to me, the cord is much better than batteries.  </li>
            <li> I bought this not really believing all the great reviews, but had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job on rough feet, elbows, hands, and knees.  </li>
            <li> My horse hoofs are now smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love it works real well</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about this productâ¦.</li>
            <li> it probably took me about a good 20-30 seconds total on each one.  </li>
            <li> works good but did not receive extra media pad as described in brochure.</li>
            <li> and I really would have paid more for the results I now have.</li>
            <li> and I thought nothing can make these feet nice looking except a professional.  </li>
            <li> They work much better and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> It took me forever and even then it wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> I still have the white crack lines that I hope moisturizer will take care of but this is something that will make your feet feel good to the touch.</li>
            <li> She loved it but use caution with the coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> I was sure it would work, but it really worked.  </li>
            <li> Of course, he says I buy him gifts that I want, and that may have been a bit true in this case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will still get my monthly pedi for the professional touch and polish, but in between this does the trick nicely.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t true for me...</li>
            <li> Overall good experience.</li>
            <li> , I am nothing short of delighted by the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> thank you for make this sweet</li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> This model has two speeds, but I find that the lower speed, with the blue roller, is good for my needs.  </li>
            <li> This battery operated one literally takes seconds to do each foot with a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li> but this is much quicker and it leaves them in better shape than a file.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> and my feet are not bad at all.</li>
            <li> not bad, works well.</li>
            <li> Great at getting those rough spots gone quick.</li>
            <li> The pores can get clogged pretty easily from the skin</li>
            <li> Easy to use and results after the first time.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and was amazed at how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> but after the first session the maintenance is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Take your time in the application,  and enjoy this great little machine.</li>
            <li> Works great, no more batteries and much more powerful than a battery operated one.</li>
            <li> The other great thing is the price.</li>
            <li> I quickly get callouses on my feet from wearing sandals all the time.  </li>
            <li> Tremendous help in keeping the calluses off my feet.</li>
            <li> this makes quick work of softening feet.</li>
            <li> The one can wear batteries out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I use the super course rollers rather than the ones that come with the unit.  </li>
            <li> Got the corded one for more, steady power.</li>
            <li> the calluses off your feet quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used the pumice stone and the grater on my feet for years and was always seeking a better way to get amazingly soft and smooth heels.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a fast response initially, but things did get resolved and I am happy with their response.</li>
            <li> quick and ez.  </li>
            <li> But if you have a light touch and time it&#x27;ll clear away most any callus.</li>
            <li> which is mainly what made me seek out a better solution than the Pedi egg I had been using.</li>
            <li> Left my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> My heels are smoother after just one quick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power of the plug-in model is adequate, but I would not risk trying the battery operated or rechargeable models.  </li>
            <li> Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it quickly.</li>
            <li> They wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> This product does remove calluses, but not as fast or effectively as a good old foot file.  </li>
            <li> They should&#x27;ve made the best possible model they could before bringing this item to market initially.  </li>
            <li> And yes, the rollers do wear out relatively quickly, so there is the added expense of buying replacements.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This took care of it quickly.</li>
            <li> Works quickly</li>
            <li> my feet look super after one time using it.</li>
            <li> The batteries die quickly.</li>
            <li> I used the high speed most of the time.</li>
            <li> I love this item and highly recommend purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty underpowered, so you need to use a light touch.</li>
            <li> Much more effective than other methods I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Your feet will still be smooth after the first try.</li>
            <li> After buffing my heel the first time, it felt soooooooo smooth.  </li>
            <li> this item is good for minor skin removal but it stops when pressure is applied&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, very worth the money!</li>
            <li> It could be a little more powerful, but it&#x27;s much better than most.  </li>
            <li> This thing works great at grinding the callouses down and keeping my feet from bleeding.</li>
            <li> OK, so these last two weeks I have been using it only 2-3x a week just to maintain my beautifully smooth and wonderfully gorgeous feet.</li>
            <li> The price is wonderful &amp; I also ordered the extra rollers a few days later because I knew I was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new Emjoi Micro-pedi Callus Remover.  </li>
            <li> Consistent power along with the right rollers gets the job done painlessly and quickly!  </li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s easy to adjust just how much you take off and</li>
            <li> but now I have this super powerful callus remover</li>
            <li> easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and fast.</li>
            <li> using a callus blade sometimes makes callus return thicker and can leave feet tender ,  this is so easy, don&#x27;t need to really see area you are treating.  </li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to, is easy to use, and is gentle to your feet.</li>
            <li> it is fast, easy to change the.</li>
            <li> pretty good machine could use a little more power though</li>
            <li> The &#x27;sanding/buffing&#x27; cartridge is very gentle (it almost tickles your feet) and is a breeze to remove, clean and replace.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li> This works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> and they wore out after the first use !&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> shipped sooner then first stated!  </li>
            <li> it does exactly as it says it will!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to order it - was not disappointed I literally took it out of the box, plugged it up and used it straight away!</li>
            <li> I watched a video of a girl explaining it and saying how great it is and how the skin just comes off.. not true.</li>
            <li> The first roller lasted me about 3 weeks, but I was using it a TON!</li>
            <li> This does exactly what they say!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and left her feet feeling much better.</li>
            <li> Very good for hard skin.</li>
            <li> I clean it with some hot water and some antiseptic alcohol solution.</li>
            <li> She was done with both of her feet in a little under 10 minutes and she was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for you feet.</li>
            <li> i think this little machine is great for maintaining pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This little machine is great for the in between or even without a pedi.  </li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> This is a great little workhorse when it comes to removing Calluses.  </li>
            <li> I think the best way to handle it is to go slow and certainly, you don&#x27;t need to apply pressure.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little device that has helped my feet become smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li> I live in the south and wear sandals most of the time; therefore, it is important to have decent looking feet when they are exposed all of the time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve also noted today that walking around in my heels are so much easier and comfortable - no discomfort whatsoever on my pressure</li>
            <li> Works very well, just a light touch does it.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend purchasing this for amazing soft, smooth skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great invention to shave the dead skin off the bottom of the feet.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is pretty amazing how much dust it makes while filing your feet!  </li>
            <li> The device works great, been using it for weeks and the grinding pad still has the grit to remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Baby smooth and sandal ready.</li>
            <li> I found that using a hand held, finer grain scraper afterwards really helped smooth things out.</li>
            <li> This was worth the money.</li>
            <li> As you age, your feet just take more work to keep them soft than they do when you&#x27;re in your twenties</li>
            <li> This thing is powerful.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> This thing IS powerful.</li>
            <li> , I think I got my money&#x27;s worth and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this periodically and have nice heels at last.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny</li>
            <li> I tried the ped-egg without much success.</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> i now have baby soft heels and it doesnt take forever and its better than shaving my heels with</li>
            <li> , you need to put on a good layer of lotion after that, otherwise, your skin will become rough again soon.</li>
            <li> (Usually if something doesn&#x27;t last long, I don&#x27;t care how great it was, I wouldn&#x27;t rate it well, but this product just works so perfectly for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful just like it says</li>
            <li> My feet have never been completely callus free and so smooth until now</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth it, and with the plug in capability</li>
            <li> The cord is a generous 6-feet, rare today when skimpy ones are often the norm.</li>
            <li> so I wrote Shave Now to see if I had any kind of warranty left.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> well, not really, but it makes your feet look that good.</li>
            <li> Not that powerful; perhaps I&#x27;m used to power tools.  </li>
            <li> It takes mantainance, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I think they will find them as useful as I do.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$$</li>
            <li> I have rough feet and was hoping to make them look good</li>
            <li> It works and it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product leave your feet as smooth as silk, once you&#x27;ve lotioned your feet after the treatment you&#x27;ll be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Now I can go all day and unless I step in something or rub up against something, my feet are not dirty on the bottoms.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.    </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love to be barefoot, even on non-grass surfaces, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time my feet looked smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> My 70 year old feet never looked better.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think its worth the price i paid</li>
            <li> it near the trash or someplace easy to clean up)</li>
            <li> My feet look human again and are really nice to touch.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi Pedi does a much better job than a professional pedi.</li>
            <li> So far it is working ok, and is saving some trips to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li> Does the job, would recommend highly, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is quite powerful; I saved a patch of skin when I was using the ped-egg so that I could test this emjoi</li>
            <li> It is powerful but the roller needs to be tougher.  </li>
            <li> THIS EMJOI POWERFUL FOOT BUFFER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> That option is far too pricey for the same great job that the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano does.</li>
            <li> No pain, no cutting by blades.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the week, I apply a bit of Jergens after showering in the morning and this easy plan keeps my feet in good shape and takes very little time out of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> Never looking back at my battery one or my Ped Egg which was my first love!</li>
            <li> Wish this didnt have to be connected to the wall other then that its a good product</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I got the gray one right off the bat</li>
            <li> just right for it to work.  </li>
            <li> This product should work for anyone you just have to choose the right refills for your machine and of course for the condition of your calluses.</li>
            <li> This has the power you need to take care of your feet the right way.</li>
            <li> And the price was right also.</li>
            <li> I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li> It files your feet just about right amount.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my new Emjoi!  </li>
            <li> We are letting my feet rest a Full week before doing more the bigger thicker callouses using the coarser rollers which are here.</li>
            <li> Clever design, easy to use, effective dry skin removal.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came</li>
            <li> This little gadget is amazing!</li>
            <li> and I know that if I repeat that a few more times, I can see that I will have nice, soft, smooth feet that will be easier to maintain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This removes the dry skin and makes my skin look so much better!</li>
            <li> , my dry feet have never looked better, and I have tried everything!</li>
            <li> Scrubbers can&#x27;t get the job done anywhere near what this thing can do, and I can do it totally dry on the fly.</li>
            <li> was thrilled that it made my feet baby smooth in less than 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> but most importantly, my feet have enjoyed the relief from hard, calloused skin.</li>
            <li> Cool Product and it really works.</li>
            <li> I have great hope that my calluses are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long, and it does shave off a lot if skin, instead of using a towel,  </li>
            <li> He just kind of looked at me strangely when he opened it</li>
            <li> An old fashioned pumice stone and the PedEgg did a fair job of removing the top layer of dead skin, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> Also, new rollers can be easily ordered at reasonable prices!</li>
            <li> , what&#x27;s a little more :)</li>
            <li> Has a nice little bag that the machine and cord fit into</li>
            <li> It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2),</li>
            <li> I have tried other battery-operated products to remove feet callouses, and this one seems the most effective so far.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of the damage I was doing to my right foot.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned- make sure to work over a towel or wastebasket to catch the dead skin, and make sure to stop the unit it and tap it</li>
            <li> This sounds bizarre, but I liked seeing all the dead skin just flake away as I was using it.</li>
            <li> I was not that impressed with it until I installed the green rollers (extra course).</li>
            <li> works very well and quickly</li>
            <li> It does a great job in such a short amount of time!  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and leaves my feet so soft.</li>
            <li> Have applied the roller gently but firmly and experienced no problems with stalling or stopping.  </li>
            <li> the electrical cord is pretty long so that was a nice plus.</li>
            <li> While I read many complaints about it not being powerful enough, it is unreasonable to have a tool more powerful that could actually harm your skin.</li>
            <li> my feet are very soft and callous free</li>
            <li> Amazing how much dry skin is removed, but the product is very gentle.</li>
            <li> When I finished, I massaged body lotion into my feet and they felt so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s no fun getting old and having to deal with cracked heels, but with this little device and some good lotion, my feet look nice again :)</li>
            <li> ~The company sells replacements as so does amazon very reasonable for me</li>
            <li> It works very, very, well.  </li>
            <li> The company was very reasonable when I had an issue with one of the Micro Pedi removers.  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s even fun to pretty up my feet, if that is even possible on old feet that have worn too many high heels and flip flops - and the finished product is a lot better.  </li>
            <li> however i think that the replacments could become costly just my opinion but in terms of performance found it easy enough to use and pretty fast made a huge difference</li>
            <li> In just a short amount of time the are very smooth with first try.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the higher speed is better suited to some of the other available rollers.</li>
            <li> Now, my feet look good, and with little effort and time involved.  </li>
            <li> Be careful because you could clean away more skin than you intended to.</li>
            <li> One thing, be sure not to breathe in any of the dead skin dust as you&#x27;re using it - keep a dry cloth handy to wipe the dust away as the gentle sanding effect works it magic on your feet.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> NOW I CAN HAVE SMOOTH AND SOFT FEET</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed getting my feet back in shape!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday and I am amazed at the results.  </li>
            <li> Problem solved thanks to emjoi!</li>
            <li> Thanks Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I sat on the floor marveling at my feet for quite some time afterwards; they were gone for the first time in YEARS.  </li>
            <li> So glad I finally got one of these.  </li>
            <li> Makes you feet a soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I checked with doctor first as i am diabetic type 2.</li>
            <li> This really saves time and energy from using a pumice stone!</li>
            <li> I have only used it one time, and it does appear that most of the exfoliating power is gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a bit of time to get through tougher spots, my first session took over 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft feet fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this onr for my daughter and it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It does work if you are willing to put time into using it.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS buy the MOST coarse.</li>
            <li> When I did my first sanding</li>
            <li> It really works well and no batteries needed!</li>
            <li> I use it on my heels to remove callus and it makes them so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> per foot every 2-3 days to keep my feet (and elbows) soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Took 1/2 hour each first time.</li>
            <li> I wish the top were completely open and you had more than a side open to use 2 -</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products including regular pedicures.  </li>
            <li> At first I considered the battery operated model but after research and further thought, the electric one made more sense because it would have continuous and even power and not need to have batteries replaced.</li>
            <li> and I have never been able to wear open sandals.  </li>
            <li> I opted for this corded version because I wanted consistent power and also didn&#x27;t want to keep buying batteries.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> well I am willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li> The first day I tried it when I got out of the shower and there was some improvement</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I have some smooth, soft feet.  </li>
            <li> I used the machine on his hands and he is also amazed how smooth and soft his hands have become.  </li>
            <li> My feet are so soft and smooth all the time.  </li>
            <li> This corded product works great and the sanding discs last a really long time.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for to remove callouses on my hands from doing Crossfit.  </li>
            <li> This corded one is more environment friendly than the other battery operated model.</li>
            <li> but wow, almost baby butt smooth.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use so much pressure!</li>
            <li> Needs MUCH COARSER sandpaper!  </li>
            <li> It took me about an hour to use the first time.</li>
            <li> make it work better especially on the thickest callouses &amp; heels</li>
            <li> ok Definitely  I need something stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Emjoi Micro-Pedi and as a female user</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for summer sandals!</li>
            <li> Even better than when I get a pedicure at the local nail salon!  </li>
            <li> really like my husband&#x27;s Valentine Day gift!  </li>
            <li> I believe this is my first review although I buy almost everything thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend ordering extra rollers, I wish I had ordered more than 2..  </li>
            <li> I love this product and would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It has been very helpful!</li>
            <li> I threw out my Pedi-Egg after I used this the first time.  </li>
            <li> This thing really works!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> makes it so much easier!</li>
            <li> But I got the first couple of layers off</li>
            <li> I did buy some of the \\&quot;extra course\\&quot; rollers and they work better for me than the one it came with.</li>
            <li> My advice is to stay on top of regular sessions.</li>
            <li> My device also was turning off periodically during the first use.</li>
            <li> My husband first bought the battery version.  </li>
            <li> I like it but thought it came with more blue disks.</li>
            <li> I did it when first ordering, so</li>
            <li> FIRST CALLUS REMOVER I HAVE HAD THAT</li>
            <li> its ok, not sure if there is anything better on the market.</li>
            <li> This really works so well that I&#x27;m already planning on buying them for my friends and family as gifts!</li>
            <li> I run it on low to make sure I don&#x27;t over do.  </li>
            <li> when I started it for the first time the roller wouldn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this tool !</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and bought this Emjoi, which did more in one session than the Clairsonic did in four weeks.</li>
            <li> but I have to say it really does work!</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> What can I say, this thing really works!  </li>
            <li> After using the Emjoi for more time I finally have achieved consist smoothness with once or twice a week maintenance.</li>
            <li> The powered nano does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of removing the dead and calloused skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to rough, dry cracked skin-especially on the toes and heels, although I take very good care of my feet through moisturization.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals most of the time so my feet get dried out easily.</li>
            <li> This is much better than using a pumice stone or a pedi-egg (less work and easier to get precise results).  </li>
            <li> I will probably continue to use my Ansr Sole on my heels, but this little tool is fantastic for the built-up calluses on the balls of my feet that the Ansr didn&#x27;t really help, for a great price.</li>
            <li> Pretty powerful for the price--I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing much, as I couldn&#x27;t really feel it--but it made a big difference in just one use.  </li>
            <li> I get small calluses on my little toes and this is the perfect tool to smooth those calluses.  </li>
            <li> I love how well my original Emjoi took down my callused skin, and was in the market for a corded version.  </li>
            <li> little gadget is amazing and absolutely worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;like other reviewers said, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy work fantastic</li>
            <li> My podiatrist was thrilled the other day at my appt.</li>
            <li> It is a neat idea, but needs more power and rougher surface to truly be effective on tough skin.</li>
            <li> feet are super soft and smooth for the first time in my adult life.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had a hard time using the Emjoi but trying to tape non-stick gauze pads with antibiotic ointment on the bottom of my foot was even more challenging.</li>
            <li> I clean mine afterwards with an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Price wise,  I paid what I would of at a local drug store, but they only had battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> and I can wait to order the more coarse stones, my feet get really ruff and</li>
            <li> I got tired of sanding them by hand all the time and the results were no where near wthis&#x27;lltles wonderful machine can do without all the labor of the hand sander.</li>
            <li> my wife likes it very well make sure to buy extra stones</li>
            <li> Took her a little practice to make sure it was removing callus in the right area, but she adjusted quickly and loves it.  </li>
            <li> This unit works pretty well due to its corded feature which I believe makes it more powerful than battery-operated competitors.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get smooth heels including seeing a podiatrist and for the first time in years I have soft smooth heels again and am actually looking forward to sandal weather.</li>
            <li> I have had very dry calloused feet for many many years and have tried lots of different products.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and decided to purchase the Emjoi because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Agree with all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> gets rid of dry skin and makes heels very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as described and is so much easier to use than a file or rasp.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this for him because of the reviews saying it was more powerful than the other leading brand, which I bought also.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much quicker session now as well at about 5 mins per foot whereas the first time it was about 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done and is far far better than a battery powered or rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to do too much the first day for fear</li>
            <li> It really does the job very well!</li>
            <li> I love this product its something I should have had long ago.</li>
            <li> The first thing  I noticed while abrading my toe, with the Emjoi, was how fast the abrasive wheel was removing the callous with no frictional heat occurring.</li>
            <li> It sure beats manually filing your heels for a long time.</li>
            <li> Far superior to a battery operated version (I have a battery operated full sized one) and the small size makes it much easier to use with consistent power and rotations.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the mens gray replacement pumice wheel as the blue one is pretty fine.  </li>
            <li> It cost a little more, but the trade off is not having to replace batteries EVER!  </li>
            <li> Next few uses I got more brave, applied more pressure, it will stop if you push too hard</li>
            <li> the Emjoi is amazing small powerful and does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Amazing product - small but powerful.</li>
            <li> With the first use, I actually had touchable, smooth feet.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my feet are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have super sensitive princess feet it will work for you.  </li>
            <li> Is is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> For the first time (outside of the salon) I have smooth feet.</li>
            <li> this product is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky so far.  </li>
            <li> The battery powered PediSpin was even less effective.  </li>
            <li> Quiet and easy to operate</li>
            <li> ~Its strong comes with a pouch a plastic cover on the one blue roller that comes with it</li>
            <li> I have not purchased the extra rollers these are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and certainly brings the softness back to my feet.</li>
            <li> like that it is corded because I think it is more powerful and it won&#x27;t run down the battery.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much that I ordered one for my mother&#x27;s birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that say it slows down and has no power...</li>
            <li> This thing is PURE HEAVEN</li>
            <li> I take regular care of my feet and they&#x27;re normally in pretty good shape, but I can never make a dent on the rough, cracked skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure your feet are absolutely dry or it won&#x27;t work very well, so do not use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ordering two more for my family members with icky feet...wanted to try  it on mine first to see if it really worked and it does!!!</li>
            <li> and this does help keep my feet smoother for longer using it 2 times a week - but will it take someone who has neglected feet with layers and layers of dead skin and calluses and get them soft and smooth like the picture - absolutely not - at least not without going through tons of rollers which would not be cost effective.  </li>
            <li> The basic sandpaper roll is fine but is a consumable item that doesn&#x27;t need to be there.</li>
            <li> This is the only device that has worked to remove calluses quickly the way they said it would!</li>
            <li> Having to order a large number of each grit can be very costly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the roller is going to last as long as I thought it would based on other reviews, but the machine itself is great!</li>
            <li> You have none of that with this handy little gadget.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> The best results come from using this once in a while, augments by a rasp or file, and then putting a little oil on the heels and wearing heel sleeves a few nights a week.</li>
            <li> The replaceable drums provide a more sanitary and consistant level of performance - and give you a choice of  &#x27;rough&#x27; or &#x27;fine&#x27; surfaces to meet your specific needs.</li>
            <li> It is the first non-intrusive, easy to work-it-out into my dry skin, and, really affordable.</li>
            <li> I used many products and there was very very limited help or not at all.</li>
            <li> It is a great little machine, like the most delicate of belt sanders for my feet.</li>
            <li> Simple, fast, smooth.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t notice any difference between the two.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Cost too much money to keep on changing them.</li>
            <li> ~I recommend the one w/a power cord jus to have it ready &amp; not going thru batteries</li>
            <li> and you can see how much progress is being made!&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> and It works very well.  </li>
            <li> This item really works well, finding the replacement parts at a reasonable price can be a bit of an issue.</li>
            <li> and she started to really like this.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> how much discomfort my calluses (they didn&#x27;t happen overnight after all) were causing me until I felt the difference of not having them at all.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> She loves it and thanks me everyone she uses it.  </li>
            <li> I had the battery one before and the plug in is so much nicer</li>
            <li> But then a salon pedicure takes longer and costs as much as this product.  </li>
            <li> but it has left my heels feeling relatively smooth.</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t remove your callus, you have some really, really messed up feet; and should see a foot doctor.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of foot files and nothing seemed to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> If you have tried everything else without much results then you have got to try this.</li>
            <li> It does take a while, but it is much, MUCH easier than using a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> go have them done much simpler</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt my foot as smooth in my entire life!</li>
            <li> Again it works very well for me</li>
            <li> Thanks again Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, it really does work.</li>
            <li> &amp; i can see that the real money is poured into the replacement rollers</li>
            <li> I thought twice about spending that much money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with this corded version of the Emjoi Nano Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep the calluses to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> a more corse roller, the one it comes with is not very corse.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone!  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend for anyone looking to finally smooth their feet.</li>
            <li> This one really doesn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> But really like the results you get with this.</li>
            <li> I worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> have the corded version, and it works really, really well.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for smoothing my feet and heels.</li>
            <li> Very please I got this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice much difference between the 30 and 47 speed in terms of callus removal.  </li>
            <li> The abrasive was worn smooth after spending 20 minutes on just one foot, even keeping the dust brushed off of it.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased it sooner, however, there is so much hype with things, you never can quite believe their claims.</li>
            <li> Used it last night and it was fantastic....</li>
            <li> Powerful and feet feel  soft when done.</li>
            <li> Much easier than manual method.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so much so that I bought one for my mother.</li>
            <li> It really works wonders.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> without much luck.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and adds another dimension to my pedi regimen.</li>
            <li> Really works on even the driest of feet.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> My feet are so smooth now, they don&#x27;t even try to sell me the extra callous remover</li>
            <li> VERY WELL, NEEDS REPLACING ROLLER OFTEN.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday and it arrived on Wed, so fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Now I have sandal ready feet</li>
            <li> I have tried the manual handheld files but they&#x27;re just too much work.  </li>
            <li> This buffer worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li> This works very welll</li>
            <li> , I have spent most of my life out of shoes.</li>
            <li> This product works and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the harder you press, the better it will work.  </li>
            <li> but it really helps to avoid cracking.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it works</li>
            <li> It worked very well</li>
            <li> This has really smoothed them.</li>
            <li> This fits the hand very well and has made a difference in our feet.</li>
            <li> This gadget really, really works.  </li>
            <li> So much quicker than a foot file.  </li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;d really go through a lot of batteries</li>
            <li> A light touch is needed, but if you are patient and work the machine properly, it will do all the work.  </li>
            <li> Works much faster</li>
            <li> I clean the roller with an old toothbrush under a light stream of water and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> This Callus Remover works and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Really ?  </li>
            <li> So fast.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for reducing calluses on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Did a much better job than expected.  </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t been a particularly fast process.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken about 5 sessions of 10 minutes each to accomplish this much.  </li>
            <li> and if you put to much presser it stops.......</li>
            <li> This is one product that really works like it says it will.  </li>
            <li> I would really recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I readily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare</li>
            <li> This battery operated buffer works really well.  </li>
            <li> My feet are so much smoother and don&#x27;t snag my socks.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use this on clean, dry skin only.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was almost ready to order the pedicure device that is made by Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Face it, rough feet are the bane of many teachers......</li>
            <li> if you have soft granny feet, buy the most coarse!</li>
            <li> I do use this regularly and my feet are soft and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper any more.  </li>
            <li> When I used my Micro Pedi the dead skin would kind of pile up on the bottom of the roller rather than flaking away</li>
            <li> In fact,  I now cut my own nails and spend just $10 a month to have my nails professionally painted, giving an overall &#x27;professional&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li> My last few pumice stone/feet smoothers  have been fine, but I walk a lot and my feet are not fabulous...nor do I like to spend the time or money on pedicures except on very special occasions!</li>
            <li> A certain warehouse sells the big version for a little less, but I bought the Nano &amp; am SUPER happy!  </li>
            <li> Because of the size and shape, it&#x27;s really great at getting into that area right where the big toe joins the foot, and it really does polish away thick deadened skin (</li>
            <li> Changed batteries and new batteries got really hot fast and emjoi wouldn&#x27;t start.  </li>
            <li> I broke my ankle and have been walking messed up for 7 years, I get callus&#x27;s on my feet from walking crooked, this little thing took care of them in no time at all, they are nice and smooth and can&#x27;t wait too use again, highly recommend</li>
            <li> it is a smooth filer that gives you consistent smoothing and removing of dry skin cells.  </li>
            <li> No tough callused feet, no cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few other products like this and so far this has done the best job.</li>
            <li> After each use my heels and tootsies are smooth, but due to the nature of my skin it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I turned it on low and used an old soft bristled toothbrush and lightly ran across the head to clean</li>
            <li> But the micro-pedi grinds right through it, leaving them soft.</li>
            <li> This little tool works fast and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it over the next few days to complete a full exfoliation, as I didn&#x27;t think it would be wise to do it all at once.</li>
            <li> feet (mostly the heels) aren&#x27;t severely dry or cracked, but I live in Hawaii and wear sandals majority of the time, so</li>
            <li> I use it about 2 times per week to keep the calluses and dry skin at bay, apply some lotion and my feet are very soft and feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where the real action happened!</li>
            <li> I have the other model with the longer handle and like it a lot better than this model.  </li>
            <li> This seems be the better option from reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> For me, this product works much better than the ped-egg, pumice stones, or any other manual devices that I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li> Definitely well worth the money!</li>
            <li> As advised on other reviews, I was sure to put a towel under my feet to capture the dust it causes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other tools to get rid of my callouses on my feet</li>
            <li> Only feature i like is that it is electric, but i could have got the original shaped unit that now has electric, cheaper too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a foot polisher than a true hard callus remover.  </li>
            <li> I had cracks in my heels that would get very sore, but this device really does smooth the dry skin away.  </li>
            <li> Even though I get pedicures on a monthly basis, my heels have always been dry and crack easily.</li>
            <li> All work really well for whatever my particular needs are on the day of use.</li>
            <li> You have to constantly clean the bar while using this tool for the first time on dry skin; get a toothbrush and while the machine is on, take the toothbrush and hold it against the bar to get the flakes off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this product was invented as I would often use my Dremel Tool with a fine sanding pad on low speed to electrically sand calluses on my feet (and I use the Dremel Tool and sanding pad for cleaning grills and heavy baked on grease from pans, etc.).  </li>
            <li> So I am trying to wear sox and my diabetic shoes with special inserts as much as possible.</li>
            <li> It was taken right in the middle of my first use of the Micro Pedi.</li>
            <li> you use foot files it takes a long time to smooth out your feet . . .</li>
            <li> I usually use it weekly just to keep my feet nice</li>
            <li> I use it about every 7-10 days, and so far, I am still using the first roller it came with; I have had it for about 2 to 2-1/2 months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any woman who loves soft and pretty feet and to any man who likes the comfort of callus-free feet.</li>
            <li> I had to go back and purchase the refills -- they last a while but want to have them ready to make sure my feet stay</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> My feet are sooo soft and a drastic improvement;).</li>
            <li> As a nurse, I would be very careful using the super coarse rollers as I can see that it would be very easy to sand until you are sanding on soft skin rather than calluses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better to have the electric one than the battery because those would just run down.  </li>
            <li> Using great lotions and oils after each session gives a little longer smoothness but not much.  </li>
            <li> I love this little heel scraper - it really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> You can was them off, but I sorta wish I had new ones too!</li>
            <li> My feet are like new!</li>
            <li> I just went out and bought 2 new pair of sandals!</li>
            <li> It is very handy and just right for a female had to get those tough parts.</li>
            <li> The second day I tried it again right out of the shower (dried my feet first) and used U-Lactin lotion after then even more improvement.  </li>
            <li> so you can get more done with less effort.  </li>
            <li> I did the little spots on my toes and the big giant callouses on my heels, and I was able to maneuver it and it worked just fine!</li>
            <li> I walk barefoot most of the summer, half of the spring and fall.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace the battery operated one that didn&#x27;t have enough umph for his super callused feet.</li>
            <li> He loves it, especially with the super course roller.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that the roller itself seems to wear off quickly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this about a month ago and have used it every day since getting it and after using I put an ointment on whose main ingredient is emu oil.</li>
            <li> Powerful for those stubborn areas, yet gentle enough to get the job done!</li>
            <li> Using their most coarse roller (Xtreme Coarse)</li>
            <li> Next day, my feet are as smooth as when I was a young girl.  </li>
            <li> They both work on the same principle, only the top speed on the Tornado is 47 rather than 30.  </li>
            <li> No batteries so keeps to a steady speed.</li>
            <li> I had to buy the super coarse rollers for this.</li>
            <li> The best ..... it doesn&#x27;t get tired and I now have pink heals.</li>
            <li> maybe as I got older...</li>
            <li> This worked really well to remove several years worth of \\&quot;foot stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s a decent product for the price</li>
            <li> I guess t was decent.</li>
            <li> I have the worst feet ever since I love t6o go without shoes, so I was looking for a product that I felt would do an awesome job.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t apply any pressure when using, just gently glide over the area and watch the dead skin disappear (be sure to do it over a trash can or over the tub/shower.)</li>
            <li> This Micro-Pedi is something that can be used on a regular basis to keep ones feet looking smooth &amp; soft at all times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a pedicure, mainly because my feet were so embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I used it daily ( a couple times 2x a day) for the first 2 weeks to try to get rid of a huge crack I had on my left foot.</li>
            <li> light weight, long cord, dual electricity, powerful enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has been able to repair my feet back to normal within one treatment.  </li>
            <li> No pain, works fast and leaves my feel silky soft!</li>

            <li> HIGHLY RECCOMMEND..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the corded over the battery veery rsion which I was using - it burns through batteries every 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I recomment it highly..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will be buying another as a beautifying gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would definitely try the more coarse rollers when its time to purchase new rollers.</li>
            <li> I love this little callus remover.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool.</li>
            <li> My feet look and feel so soft!!</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars if it had a little more power.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll spread it out a little more.</li>
            <li> But so far this is a miracle for me!!    </li>
            <li> and I thought my feet were in pretty good shape except for that one crack (due to a limp I have),</li>
            <li> Love this little remover.</li>
            <li> After a little thought and more insisting, I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I love this little nano.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need much pressure to quickly remove layers of dry skin.</li>
            <li> this item would be a decent value at 20 bucks especially considering the cost of the rollers - is it worth 50?</li>
            <li> As an older adult, this makes it so much easier to use than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> She has used it once so far and rates it very highly.  </li>
            <li> The Nano was large enough for my needs, but I can see it would be a problem if I had larger areas to smooth, since the roller is recessed below the plastic on the device.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week on the rough spots for maintenance and it keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> You get about 5 light uses out of one roller, not very cost affective.</li>
            <li> and wow it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Wow this product really works.</li>
            <li> If I felt an area that was still rough, I went over it until it was smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical before it arrived even though it has great reviews.</li>
            <li> It removes my rough heels and leaves them smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a brush to clean the dry skin off the roller.  </li>
            <li> It really IS powerful, so you do have to be careful not to do too much, too fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and I can use it for a few minutes of touch up or for a more thorough pedicure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially she didnt think that it was powerful enough...</li>
            <li> Normal feet</li>
            <li> The same sanding roller on low speed buffed off the tags of skin on the soles, smoothed the ends of my toes near the nails, and the top and sides of my feet.</li>
            <li> I like it not that powerful same as the battery operated one, I bought both.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but felt I had to for this product.</li>
            <li> Like the corded version because it never loses power.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would have hoped for, especially for a plug in device.</li>
            <li> I normally have ridges on my feet and they are all gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The Dead Sea Scrolls are in better shape AND softer than my feet...)</li>
            <li> I think the fact that it has a cord is what makes it powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It does not hurt and safely takes off the dead skin and callous a bit at a time.</li>
            <li> The amount of calloused skin that comes off is deliciously gross (smile).</li>
            <li> This plug in is far better then the basttery one - it does not die down and the cord is well</li>
            <li> My feet went from dry and cracked to soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> - gross, right?  </li>
            <li> The power is just right and the rollers are replaceable so this will last for years.</li>
            <li> I am left handed so this was a problem for me until I held/used it with my right hand.  </li>
            <li> was that my big right toe</li>
            <li> a dance injury stemming indirectly from my calluses landed me at the podiatrist&#x27;s office, I was finally convinced to invest and do right by my feet.</li>
            <li> but you must follow few simply steps- use it only on a very dry skin- works perfect</li>
            <li> This little unit is powerful!!</li>
            <li> It is more powerful than you&#x27;d think from it&#x27;s small size - even with the lesser strength rollers it went to town on my heels.  </li>
            <li> I saw the new Clarisonic one at a department store and thought I HAD to have it.</li>
            <li> At $200, I decided I could definitely live without it.</li>
            <li> Even though the glitch was with Amazon and not them, they shipped a new model to me at no cost and let me keep the one that was sent in error.  </li>
            <li> We live in arizona</li>
            <li> but regardless something that I can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> and it has made my feet feel brand new.</li>
            <li> After I placed in new batteries though, it worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Then Baby Oiled them with the new Shea Butter Scent.</li>
            <li> If they only last a couple of uses, it&#x27;s just as cheap to go to the spa and have a pedicure.  </li>
            <li> I opted for the corded one because I&#x27;m tired of using batteries all the time, and i had seen where the corded one was more powerful, which made sense.  </li>
            <li> Also I purchased at the same time extra Genuine Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers.</li>
            <li> I have found the blue coarse rollers supplied with my unit to be more than adequate for the purpose with less danger of sanding below calluses.  </li>
            <li> The green rollers will save you a lot more time and your feet will come out baby soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have such a problem with rough, calloused feet, we&#x27;ll not any more.</li>
            <li> Frequent pedicures don&#x27;t work and I&#x27;ve picked so much that I can&#x27;t even get near my feet with a rasp or corn shaver without drawing blood.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I always have calluses on my heels and have tried other devices and they weren&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li> If this tool doesn&#x27;t save you money by not having to go to the nail and sanding salon, I&#x27;d be very surprised.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take away all the thickened skin, such as on the heels, but it does make what&#x27;s left very smooth to the touch, a vast improvement from before.</li>
            <li> After neglecting my feet over the winter and with spring (and cute sandals) right around the corner, I knew I had to up my game.  </li>
            <li> and it was even better than I expected!!!!  </li>
            <li> Follow the advice, don&#x27;t use it too long in one spot, it is easy to go too deep.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty calloused areas will use a roller up pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li> Maybe I won&#x27;t wear down the rollers maintaining my new smooth feet.  </li>
            <li> I frequently pay for pedicures and I feel that I will never have to pay for a pedicure again!  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this Emjoi because of the higher ratings than a similar product I saw on tv.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> He said ok but use extreme care and daily foot inspections.</li>
            <li> and my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow !</li>
            <li> This product actually works, if you are willing to take the time to do it.</li>
            <li> It removed lots of gross stuff! ;)</li>
            <li> So, the slightly higher price of the electric model was offset by the cost of future batteries.</li>
            <li> I used it for about ten minutes the first time.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I was a pretty devoted Ped Egg user for several years.  </li>
            <li> I have calluses, this only took off the superficial first layer.</li>
            <li> World much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time, and can only say suberb.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at its  effectiveness!</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind that  the roller will only grind/sand in one direction, so if it does not seem to work at first change up the way you hold the item.  </li>
            <li> My son and even my daughter are willing to rub my feet for me daily.</li>
            <li> I did not do that the first time and it&#x27;s kinda gross if you think about it!    </li>
            <li> but I have only used the first speed.</li>
            <li> The first session is the longest; regular follow-ups are shorter.</li>
            <li> My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li> This is the first device I&#x27;ve tried that actually works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since Christmas and my heels look like Pretty Lady Heels.</li>
            <li> This thing fixed my feet in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li> times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mostly used to the CVS brand callous scrapers that I&#x27;ve used over the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> but WOW, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> This is the best pedicure item out there, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend money on pedicures, and envied other women whose feet looked so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the extreme course one for the last three days. :)</li>
            <li> I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST THING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, when I first received it..</li>
            <li> it will be the first time in forever that i will expose my feet in public this summer.</li>
            <li> Great product although small and a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This product worked really good the first time I used it, but after a couple of uses it already needs a new blue roller thing and they are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I now have smooth, pretty feet instead of rough, dry calloused embarrassments!</li>
            <li> I usually put on heavy lotion followed by socks and my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> the dead skin comes off quickly and easily, with minimal fuss.</li>
            <li> I find it so easy to use that each day I take a few minutes and buff my heels whether they need it now or not.  </li>
            <li> It made quick work on all the rough spots on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I used the super coarse on my feet first and then smoothed with the extra coarse.  </li>
            <li> the roller is kind of small, i thought it would be a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Pretty unbelievable, but true.  </li>
            <li> These make callus removal not only possible (which I never found using a pumice stone to be unless I was willing to sand for hours at a time), but fast and painless (if the unit is used according to the directions).  </li>
            <li> And the price is pretty much the same, so I would definitely recommend this model.</li>
            <li> Good powerful little unit to sand down rough callus.  </li>
            <li> My feet are almost always dry and cracked so treating them well is important, especially as a dancer.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy the super extra coarse rollers -</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and worked really well a few times.  </li>
            <li> it truly gets the old skin off so fast that you will need to pay attention to not go too low into new skin.</li>
            <li> It removes the bunions easily without cutting, as much at a time as I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought replacement rollers at the same time, but the original one seems to have a long lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I used high speed because my slightly arthritic hand can&#x27;t slide the switch into low easily.  </li>
            <li> Because of this little device, I now have smooth feet.</li>
            <li> This little unit is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got a little over zealous my first time using it and ended up hurting myself by taking too much off (even though the package did give me a warning not to do that!).  </li>
            <li> The cord is long enough but not extremely long, easily reaches from the outlet to the sink.</li>
            <li> Very powerful little sander.</li>
            <li> husband suffers greatly with calloused and chapped hands this time of year.  </li>
            <li> It is simple to use and buffers rough spots on the feet smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it take forever to use, but your feet have a scratchy feel to them even after all of the time you&#x27;ve spent trying to make them smooth.  </li>
            <li> However, it seems to me that a clearly stated disclaimer could resolve this fear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched around for a place that I could get a pedicure that actually removed the dry/dead skin but never felt like they really got it.</li>
            <li> In the morning, my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li> ~I jus got it &amp; after 20 minutes my feet felt as soft as a babys</li>
            <li> My feet haven&#x27;t felt this soft since ....</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li> but you really have to work at using it, especially since the roller isn&#x27;t exposed all the way around.  </li>
            <li> so I have to use the old faithful rasp to remove 80% of the problem then finish with the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I like baby soft feet</li>
            <li> The real surprise was when I finally got up and started to walk around.  </li>
            <li> Well I was pleasantly surprised when I used this on my feet.</li>
            <li> You just have to be soft touch to baby just skin and not dig a hole that can cause a scar or infected skin.</li>
            <li> The Micro-ped removes dead skin and calluses, leaving your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of electric and manual foot filers, emory boards, etc., and none of them worked near as well as this.  </li>
            <li> It has a wide enough head to cover larger areas than most pedicure tools, and works continuously and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of them completely</li>
            <li> I really like how it works and only wish I&#x27;d gotten some spare inserts.  </li>
            <li> I bought a  coarse roller, but really didn&#x27;t it need it.</li>
            <li> So soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> But as of now my wife has not needed to replace the old one.</li>
            <li> All in all, I was surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> (he doesn&#x27;t need it because his feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My feet are considerably smoother and prettier than they are after a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> It made my Alligator feet as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> But they will be baby soft if you do them a couple of times ..</li>
            <li> but DO NOT waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had the buffer for about ten weeks now and still really like it.</li>
            <li> The cracks in my heels are still visible, and I&#x27;ll continue to work on those and update later, but they feel very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is, really, a glorified dremel tool, but it definitely does the job, eventually.  </li>
            <li> I have an old injury to my hand so this electric powered  smoother</li>
            <li> wow.....</li>
            <li> Rescue an old toothbrush with soft bristles, and the job is done in a jiffy while extending the life of the roller.  </li>
            <li> Maybe too early to write a review but here goes.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if I would say I have baby soft feet</li>
            <li> They have not felt this soft since when?</li>
            <li> Got the heavy duty roller and have been using it lightly every three days or so over about two weeks</li>
            <li> I stand up and use it near the plug so there&#x27;s no issues with the length of the cord.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> corded Emjoi has removed my calluses almost completely; at this point, they are reduced by about 90%.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this for all you feet abusers that would rather die than get a professional pedicure....</li>
            <li> As frequently as I use it, I recommend purchasing the electric vs. the battery operated otherwise you&#x27;ll spend a fortune on batteries.</li>
            <li> and my feet are still soft.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have callouses from writing, gardening and working with my hands , my college age son has thick callouses on his feet from going bear foot most of the time, this has worked well for him.</li>
            <li> Strong little motor!</li>
            <li> It works fine for final smoothing if you&#x27;ve removed the callouses with other methods.  </li>
            <li> To wipe the area down to cool the callus and underlying tissues before proceeding again.</li>
            <li> It comes with a carrying white bag and simple white brush to clean the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Replaces:&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is time consuming and my hands get very tired, which isn&#x27;t good for arthritis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been able to minimize the cracking I was starting to get along the sides, with little effort!</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other models it is not so powerful that it will hurt you.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m a willing victim and she keeps my heals in check.  </li>
            <li> With this disease, the skin just starts to harden on my toes but with a light use of this Micro-Pedi, I can bring it back down to the soft skin.  </li>
            <li> No questions asked and 5 days later I have a brand new replacement!  </li>
            <li> They cannot last as long as this one and not as powerful</li>
            <li> service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered refills of extra coarse and super coarse for the Emjoi</li>
            <li> Waiting to see how long before I have to change the roller, but so far I am really liking this.  </li>
            <li> I have used a ped egg in the past, but many times I actually hurt myself by overfiling an area.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my feet smooth with little effort!</li>
            <li> BTW sorry it was so long, but wanted to make sure you all know this is worth the price!</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it - used it right away and got noticeable results with very little effort just as the instructions read.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who don&#x27;t liked dry hard skin on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have the worry of using up batteries plus this has a high &amp; low speed.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I have is to have several different callus rollers for the product in a finer one and a coarser one for harder more callus skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this - and may even cut back on pedicures - except that I like the massages and nail clipping!</li>
            <li> Used the low setting on each foot and then the high setting.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it with the extra course rollers</li>
            <li> It has a low and high setting.  </li>
            <li> The roller head seems to be very durable and has lasted a long time</li>
            <li> Small size of the unit fits comfortable in my hands.  </li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time on my feet and before I got it I became pretty resigned to having rough callused</li>
            <li> I used this the first day I received it and within seconds had cleared up the rough skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> I returned this one and ordered the more expensive corded model which is totally worth the extra cash.</li>
            <li> I spent a bit of time the first go, but the results were immediately noticable.</li>
            <li> Will definitely save you time and money over going to a salon or using normal pedicure tools...</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Now, some of the cracks go too deep for the Emjoi&#x27;s reach, but now the edges are smoothed enough that the lotion won&#x27;t be wasted on surface toughness and will now be able to reach deeper.</li>
            <li> other one is battery operated and may be more convenient but as batteries wear down the power will diminish&lt;br /&gt;the electric model has even power.  </li>
            <li> did order a couple of other grades of the tubes, and although the regular ones did a fine job, the extra abrasive ones help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love emjoi but have found I have to work with their most expensive product to get it to work, and I just  can&#x27;t see that for the bottoms of my feet !!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and supplier emailed me right away informing me that this  edition was out of stock but, not wanting me to have to wait for back orders, they upgraded my order to a more expensive model at no additional charge.</li>
            <li> used the green rollers and got amazing results and went a little overboard.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Better than any other product I have previously used.  </li>
            <li> I have used several other products that say they will remove callous skin but nothing does it as quickly and throughly as this one...</li>
            <li> I get regular pedicures,  but this item removed more hard heel skin then any  manicurist ever did.  </li>
            <li> It required new batteries after only three uses.</li>
            <li> I ordered the above version, but received &amp;#34;a new and improved&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> love this little machine!!!</li>
            <li> really does take off dry skin</li>
            <li> all with minimal success -- especially in dealing with my calluses.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last, but it worked well this first time.</li>
            <li> If you are like me then it take about 3-4 tries before you are able to fully remove all of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> My feet are soft and not dry and/or callous at all.  </li>
            <li> It would be wrong for me not to give a glowing review for a product I immediately love so much.</li>
            <li> Takes much less time than the battery powered one which just sort of chugged along even with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li> and it works tremendous removing all of my dead skin ..  </li>
            <li> Under no circumstances get the battery powered one, the batteries would not last long and it would not be powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I cut my toenails regularly (as Jerry Seinfeld once said, &amp;#34;Ever two to six weeks.&amp;#34;), but that was about the only care I ever paid to my feet on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely order one of the other models for the other bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It really saved my dry feet!</li>
            <li> but if you need more there is an extreme green &amp; another one for a mans foot as well as a lavender one for ruff elbows~</li>
            <li> I had the battery-powered one previously and it gave out after a few months, but I liked it well enough while it lasted to buy another - this time with the wall plug</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip - I try and soak my feet for a few minutes in warm water first, then dry them off, use the micro-pedi (not for too long though, or it gets a little sore), then apply lotion and socks.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well after I &amp;#34;prepped &amp;#34; my very dry feet.</li>
            <li> Thank God for this little powerful callus remover.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, powerful little tool.</li>
            <li> It works wonders; removing rough dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This items quickly and efficiently removes the rough, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I still have the original buffer on it, and will look into ordering that same type for future uses when this one wears down.</li>
            <li> Works well on hard calluses and makes your feet smooth.  </li>
            <li> The extra coarse sanding roller on high speed  was sufficient to eradicate the built up skin on the heels, the ridge atop the ball of the foot, and the side of the ball.</li>
            <li> This easy device removes all that dry skin 1-2-3 by simply passing the roller up and down the affected area.</li>
            <li> From the first use I felt a huge difference, and my feet were getting pretty bad with cracked heels</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last without needing to be changed, but I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t much care with results like this.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for a professional pedicure is the pamper.</li>
            <li> I bought the corded version and have no regrets, but it does limit portability.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far though</li>
            <li> I have only use the corded Emjoi two times so far</li>
            <li> Never thought I would have such soft feet.</li>
            <li> Really smooths out rough and cracking feet.</li>
            <li> My bare feet felt like Velcro on the carpet.  </li>
            <li> Be careful tho as it goes fast.</li>
            <li> daily and just about have the calluses completely removed.  </li>
            <li> It barely shaves off any callous&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It rubs off the callouses gradually, a layer at a time, creating soft dust that falls to the floor (occasionally, I had to stop and blow the dust off the remover).  </li>
            <li> Immediately, I am walking differently, not just without the usual discomfort to which I&#x27;d grown accustomed, but my feet are actually hitting the floor more properly.</li>
            <li> My feet have only felt this soft after leaving the podiatrist office.  </li>
            <li> My feet were a disaster after my last pregnancy - so many gross, thick calluses.  </li>
            <li> We recommend it to anyone with thick calluses on their feet who would like to have smooth feet again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best way to get rid of cruddy callouses</li>
            <li> I own a battery operated one and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It says, just a few sessions, I hope it&#x27;s longer than that, but it&#x27;s worth to me buying replacement rollers.</li>
            <li> They were very surprised how fast this little machine takes off the callouses.</li>
            <li> All the other units like this that I researched were battery powered, and most of the reviews of those other brands complained that the batteries ran low rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I took down about 2/3 of my calluses on my first treatment.</li>
            <li> (PS - In the instructions it says not to use it outside, but with all the dust it produces - especially on your first use - I would not use it in the house unless you&#x27;re doing it over a dry bathtub....)</li>
            <li> Some have complained that there is only one side of the roller accessible for use, but I found that it keeps a lot of the dust from flying everywhere and also protects the soft underside of my toes while I tackle the ball-of-my-foot calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Peels dead skin right off.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi does a great job in very little time, is tough on the callouses but gentle enough that I&#x27;ve used it every other day since receiving it.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t had a pedicure or really spent any time buffing off the dead skin on my feet in almost 2 years (and I live in a place where flip flops are worn pretty much all year long)</li>
            <li> Without a brand in mind, I did research on battery-vs.-corded and decided that batteries would be less powerful and more annoying than the convenience of complete mobility was worth.</li>
            <li> The whole process took at least an hour, but I figured it was my first time and when my feet have regular treatments it wont take any longer than 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how little effort it really took.</li>
            <li> The problem with the Dremel bits was that they would begin to heat up due to friction if to much pressure was applied.</li>
            <li> does ok job wish it was a little stronger for I have heavy callous&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I did have the same issue after I stole double A&#x27;s from my remote to get it going the first night.  </li>
            <li> The only down side I can foresee is that the rollers really do get sanded down easily if you have rough patches and callouses.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, if you sit back down to redo your feet and make them soft it only last a few days and they feel like sandpaper when you walk on carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I convinced myself that it was a matter of time before things would turn around</li>
            <li> I put new, high quality batteries in prior to the first use, and it seemed to operate rather weakly.  </li>
            <li> It had been close to a year since my last pedi, and it took much of the rough, yucky skin off.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, she went back to using an old fashioned, hand held callus remover.</li>
            <li> I am able with several passes to get extremely thick dry skin off the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> I had to be careful not to use it in an area for to long since it produced no uncomfortable friction.</li>
            <li> I took off thick callus with the extra course and then used the blue one to fine tune.</li>
            <li> Be carefully with loose skin will pitch it a little bit but, more a scare than an actual harm.</li>
            <li> My feet are now really soft and feel REALLY STRANGE now after being completely yuck for so long.</li>
            <li> After only 4-5 uses the callouses that I developed on each of my big toes (since my hammertoe surgery) are noticeably smaller and smoother.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t scared of going to far with it because as long as there is roughness the area was protected.  </li>
            <li> In a few minutes I was ready for my sandals!</li>
            <li> I used it for 5 minutes each foot for a few says in a row at first.</li>
            <li> Air out your feet for a few hours first.</li>
            <li> A small but powerful tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not too late to return it for a full refund</li>
            <li> It did what it said it is small but powerful.  </li>
            <li> I live in CO &amp; have very dry skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t apply too much pressure or it will bogg down.  </li>
            <li> but I do not recommend the battery operated because of power issues and bogging down with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Motor slows down quite a bit with too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Even before I got psoriasis this year, I still think it is multitudes better than the steel file I used to use that irritated my skin &amp; left it course only to grow back worse.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful so you can carefully bear down on it without the roller slowing down too much or locking up.</li>
            <li> I tried the product,  I was expecting it to be more powerful, and I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take off a lot of skin which surprised me because like I said - my feet weren&#x27;t that dry.  </li>
            <li> I think emoji has spent more effort on marketing and branding themselves than they have on making quality products and I feel that this brand in particular has tons of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> But, even then, it removes even thick callus quickly.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I know it is not the most romantic gift in the world, but you don&#x27;t know how hard it is to buy for my hubby!!  </li>
            <li> I live in Colorado where it is very dry and even after regular pedicures my feet need to be buffed often as they get ragged, especially the heels.  </li>
            <li> It did take a few uses to get really smooth, probably because I went slow and gingerly at first careful not to burn the skin or wear the motor.</li>
            <li> THE LITTLE DEVICE REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I really like this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> Not sore really, just a little tender for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been using a pumice stone which took so much work just to make even  a little difference.  </li>
            <li> I tried two other new batteries and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> The only minor downside is that the roller is a bit difficult to get really clean looking, but really to me that&#x27;s not a particularly big deal.</li>
            <li> My bunions are totally smooth for several days and before the Micro Pedi the next day the bunions were hard and rough again.&lt;br /&gt;chh</li>
            <li> Some were good and some were bad.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for everyone with rough dry or cracked heels.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and it takes years of dry, dead skin off your heals in minutes.</li>
            <li> Press a button down and the sanding roller pops out for disposal; insert new roller.</li>
            <li> Though the instructions specifically state &amp;#34;for use on feet only&amp;#34; I did VERY CAREFULLY and on LOW speed use it on my fingers near the nail edges where I have callous build-up and the skin splits as the nails grow out.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews about it taking a long time and to buy the green rollers, but I have found it to work really quickly</li>
            <li> , I tried a couple of techniques: back and forth, random, from top to bottom in one long pass, etc.</li>
            <li> I guess my expectations were a  little too high.  </li>
            <li> The replacement rollers are about half the price of a new buffer.  </li>
            <li> but my calluses had become so hardened over the past several years that I didn&#x27;t think this would do much for them</li>
            <li> but if I use it too long in one spot it is red and sore the next day</li>
            <li> And the actual callus removers last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I spent about 1/2 an hour, now a few minutes every week</li>
            <li> Using this unit takes some time, if your feet are as hard and dry as mine were, but in the end, you&#x27;re left with baby smooth pink soles, rather than chalk white dry looking zombie feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did sand away the hard, dried skin on my feet very quickly.</li>
            <li> It might be because my only problem is simple dry skin</li>
            <li> I do think $50 is over-priced, but if this lasts me for at least one year I would be willing to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Soooooo much easier than any pedi foot product I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last</li>
            <li> so hopefully it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The rollers last a long time.  </li>
            <li> cord was long enough for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I will say they do not last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> My feet are so flat that my footprints look like those of a duck.</li>
            <li> Just got it, wondering how long the pad will last</li>
            <li> wondering how long it will last, use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I ran too slow</li>
            <li> But...batteries only last so long!!  </li>
            <li> Either that or my feet are super tough.  </li>
            <li> Only regret that I waited so long to buy this!</li>
            <li> but the batteries didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed to be used on dry skin only</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coming from someone who always have dry, coarse callus, I have tried just about anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on dry feet and will do testing w/ damp feet as well.</li>
            <li> Finally a solution for dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> My feet are crazy soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li> I take a lot of medications that dry my skin out especially my feet!  </li>
            <li> i was too embarassed to get a professional pedicure and always keep my feet well hidden in water shoes.</li>
            <li> My toes were very calloused &amp; my heels were rough &amp; unevenly thickened.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last but as long as it works now</li>
            <li> Money spent is wasted, there&#x27;s really nothing else it can be used for.</li>
            <li> My feet are very dry and had rough dry skin, which this product has nearly eliminated.</li>
            <li> These calluses had become large and extremely hard.  </li>
            <li> Trying to keep my feet decalloused, smooth, and soft  has been an almost impossible task especially as I reached the age of 40!  </li>
            <li> I only give this 4 stars because it can be bogged down easily if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, calloused feet with multiple cracks on the heels.  </li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t go to far and hit raw meat,then it can hurt like hell the next day or so</li>
            <li> With a little caution, you can have silky soft feet.</li>
            <li> This little baby makes my feet baby soft again in no time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, and I was fearful it would create hotspots or over-remove the callouses, or hurt if I accidentally ran it on uncalloused skin, but none of that was true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for us guys who really work hard on our feet.</li>
            <li> We had a little trouble getting a replacement when the first one got lost in the mail, but eventually got it worked out.</li>
            <li> , I do have hard callus but this product doesn&#x27;t really do anything except buffing.</li>
            <li> This product is a slow and steady foot smoothing machine!  </li>
            <li> When using the first time one tough skin, callous and especially cracks</li>
            <li> I used the blue roller and it did a nice job albeit a little awkward to use between my palm and finger area-</li>
            <li> I have gotten pedicures and even then had a hard time completely removing all of the callous, so when I found this it was such a bargain because I am getting the same results.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong, but I am guessing I would go through a lot of batteries before I achieved smooth and callus-free feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the extra rollers: regular (blue), coarse (dark blue), and the green rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wished to sand my man feet for a long time, but never knew something like this existed.</li>
            <li> Oh how I wished I had had this callus remover long ago.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this for a long time and did notmdisappoint me.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday to keep my feet soft.</li>
            <li> It works but takes a long time.</li>
            <li> The pedi egg comes in a distant second place.  </li>
            <li> It took a few times, but i think it is far easier than trying to do it manually.</li>
            <li> I have been a life long runner</li>
            <li> My feet were snagging the covers and they were long overdue for some TLC.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for how long one roller lasts.</li>
            <li> This thing effortlessly pulverizes layers and layers of old, dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I will update this review when I have an idea of how long the roller lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time for this.  </li>
            <li> Totally not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I had to contact customer service to find the distinction between the corded long handle and the corded Nano.  </li>
            <li> The corded long handle runs at 47x</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered a long time ago.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it does work but take long time if you have a lot to buff</li>
            <li> The cord is long and removable for storage.  </li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually shaves down calluses without hurting.  </li>
            <li> Without even having to push down, I applied the Emjoi maybe 10-15 seconds on a tiny target area, only until there began to be a sensation of heat.</li>
            <li> You should definitely give it a try if you have dry, cracked heals or calluses or rough patches that need attention.</li>
            <li> It actually makes me sad that it does the job so quickly.  </li>
            <li> If it helps anyone else I have 3 other family members male &amp; female who use this and will agree it works but is just time consuming &amp; the rolls wear out faster than you would want if you have rough feet.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed switch, slightly weak motor, but looks nice.</li>
            <li> loud&lt;br /&gt;Roller doesn&#x27;t last that long (a little over a month with regular use)&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> And the fact that I have to keep restocking the &#x27;X-treme Coarse Rollers&#x27; for my very dry rough feet, but maybe after I get things under control, those issues will subside.</li>
            <li> You can only use that one side as the other side is blocked.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am well pleased with the results of this little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the extreme coarse rollers on it.  </li>
            <li> My feet weren&#x27;t in terrible shape and yet it made a good amount of dust!  </li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> The only other difference is the shape.  </li>
            <li> Used with extreme coarse rollers, my feet are now the way I&#x27;ve always wanted them to look and no longer am embarrassed by the condition of my feet.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the extra rollers in extreme course , FYI.</li>
            <li> The first use takes a bit long because it has to break through all that tough and hardened skin.</li>
            <li> Use lotion or some other hydration the following days as well, or your feet will quickly dry up again.</li>
            <li> I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be strong enough to keep those tough calluses from getting so thick</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it very long</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to swap out the blue buffing pad with the green (extreme coarse) pads.  </li>
            <li> Although Works fast,still take me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I started to struggle with dry heels and calluses forming on the ball of my feet.  </li>
            <li> Removes dry skin that a pumice stone couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> removes dry skin from heels anf smooths calouses</li>
            <li> My recommendation for owners is to use a nail brush to dry brush the rollers in between use.</li>
            <li> my feet have scales and dry patches but no cracks in the heal.</li>
            <li> But I decided to try it because I have tried everything else for my dry skin heels.</li>
            <li> My feet were dry and not just out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The dry callous skin has almost all disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I have runner&#x27;s feet and they are always dry, blistered, and calloused.</li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t overly dry, but my boyfriends are so</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone that struggle with dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I handle  lots of paper at work and that causes dry, scaly patches on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin</li>
            <li> My feet are extremely dry</li>
            <li> i had dry daed skin on the bottom of my feet and try creams power to get rid of it</li>
            <li> so our feet get really dry</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s clogged up with dry skin, it&#x27;ll never do anything.  </li>
            <li> I like that you use it on dry feet so you can control the amount of skin removed.</li>
            <li> I also use the extra extra course rollers (the green ones) because I let my heals go to almost crusty.</li>
            <li> My big toes had callouses, and I spent a lot of time trying to remove the rough skin.  </li>
            <li> Customer service was efficient by e-mail; however, there is no live âchatâ or phone number for immediate assistance.  </li>
            <li> have used my Emjoi unit no more frequently than every other day in order to prevent possible skin irritation.</li>
            <li> so my feet are pretty tough.  </li>
            <li> Two bits of advice - first, buy the green heavy duty rollers and get extra if you have heavy calluses.  </li>
            <li> My main objection is that the sanding cylinders are pretty expensive for what they are, and they don&#x27;t last long if you&#x27;re going through thick stuff.</li>
            <li> this is not powerful and only lightl buffs....</li>
            <li> You will save money on batteries, but not worth the double price.</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I usually do a self pedicure weekly in between professional pedicures every month or so.  </li>
            <li> My feet have never, ever, ever been this soft since I was a small child.</li>
            <li> I think I will be buying the extreme coarse rollers next as I still have a little of callous.</li>
            <li> Good idea to buy the green extreme rollers if your skin is really bad...</li>
            <li> Dry brush!</li>
            <li> So the cost to operate it is low -- definetely less than the cost of a pedecure in a salon.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and have spent years of my life trying to find something that would grind off my cracked, dry and flaky feet.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who has rough, dry and calloused feet.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks the crack was still there, but was about 3/4 as deep as it use to be and no longer had a black line in it.</li>
            <li> If you buy this, the blue roller that comes with it is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and my doctor said I need to take care of my feet by trying to get rid of the rough, dry areas....</li>
            <li> having to vacuum afterwards is a small price to pay to finally have my calluses removed.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from very dry cracked heels for years.  </li>
            <li> You have to press down really hard to get the sanding action going &amp; you have to repeat the same area over &amp; over</li>
            <li> Plus, when you compare the cost to the price of a pedicure, you&#x27;re saving some cash in the long run, even if you just use this as a fill-in every other time.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> At least this is a product that offers something in the way of a solution for removing extremely dry skin that doesn&#x27;t involve blades.</li>
            <li> For those who are unhappy about the speed in which calluses are removed, Emjoi also has super coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li> I have a few dry skin areas back on my feet but not like it was before...</li>
            <li> He is now walking on less painful feet with smooth soft bottoms....</li>
            <li> I plugged this little guy in this morning using a simple wall adapter for Europe.</li>
            <li> but they last a little while.  </li>
            <li> Had a little callus on the outside of my foot from flip flops.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you buy the  GENUINE Micro Pedi Xtreme Coarse Rollers for tough skin and tough callouses.</li>
            <li> I have bad calluses on my feet, very hard to maintain a nice, soft heel.</li>
            <li> During my pedicures, the tech would try to file down the dry skin on my heels, but it never worked for very long.  </li>
            <li> The result is large, thick calluses on the balls of my feet, outer sides of my big toes and the joints below, and splitting heels-- much worse than the condition of the &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; foot in the photo above.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very rough, dry feet.</li>
            <li> Also it does not hurt soft or delicate surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that they offer extra cartridges with the machine.</li>
            <li> It also takes the rough spots off your toes and hands as well.</li>
            <li> My feet used to be so rough, they&#x27;d catch on everything - carpet, blankets, etc.  </li>
            <li> It also creates a &amp;#34;dust cloud&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s minimal compared to the stuff that catches below.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the bottoms of his heels would get so rough, it would rip our sheets.  </li>
            <li> ONLY USED A FEW TIMES SINCE CHRISTMAS</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful using it.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not over do it...</li>
            <li> My feet are no longer rough....</li>
            <li> I got the green rollers at the same time and they do a faster job.</li>
            <li> I never really do reviews</li>
            <li> Like having a few different options for rollers too.  </li>
            <li> In my case it&#x27;s currently from Dead Sea Essentials but use any hydrating cream to comfort and soften your feet afterwards.</li>
            <li> I never would have expected that after just one use.  </li>
            <li> but it leaves my heels rough and doesn&#x27;t resolve my problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as though I was too rough with it for it to have died.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the blue one for my feet, and the green roll for my husband.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no power.</li>
            <li> Four uses in with one of the Xtreme rollers and it&#x27;s still usable (though not as course as it was, which is expected).  </li>
            <li> I doubt it would do justice to rough callouses tho.</li>
            <li> Removes all the rough calluses with ease.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with rough feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered regular ones and the green ones(coarse) also.  </li>
            <li> This machine is trimming off all the rough edges on my feet that were literally pulling threads out of the bedsheets.  </li>
            <li> Item works but be careful not to get charged for two when you buy one</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> My heels are normally so rough between pedicures that they wear holes in my socks and damage the insoles of my shoes.</li>
            <li> it is stronger than expected.</li>
            <li> I have the PedEgg which takes forever to sand the rough spots on your feet</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve problems with rough heels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely rough on my feet.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> The only trouble is I can&#x27;t find a way to \\&quot;polish\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband who complains of rough feet.</li>
            <li> that way you catch all the rough patch &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; as it rolls it off.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it is corded is also a plus because the power is constant unlike battery products that tend to die after a few uses and be replaced.  </li>
            <li> So I took my time slowly going over each callous in different directions, applying different amounts of pressure, &amp; I would begin to see the foot powder fall off (eww, I know!)</li>
            <li> OMGosh, who knew that it was because my feet were so dry and need some TLC!?!</li>
            <li> It smoothed a horrible callus in no time flat, but i made sure to check often so as not to go to far.</li>
            <li> Wow, no more scrubbing!  </li>
            <li> Just not strong enough.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re a normal person with rough heels, it&#x27;s just too weak.  </li>
            <li> Buying the extra rough replacements is probably recommended if your feet are in really bad shape, especially for the first time use.  </li>
            <li> Very effective at removing nasty callouses.  </li>
            <li> The machine worked exactly as described, my only negative was the surprise I got to be sent a further bill for import duty, VAT and quite expensive handling fees.</li>
            <li> Also they are very small and therefore it would take some time to complete the task.</li>
            <li> Wearing boots all day and getting a pedicure every other month makes for some rough spots on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> After one use I have noticed a difference immediately and to keep them soft, I rub my feet down with coconut oil then put on thick socks.</li>
            <li> That only left uneven layers &amp; that would grow back worse too.  </li>
            <li> Using this a few times a week for at least 10 minutes per foot each time, with no worries about checking after a few seconds for too much filing.</li>
            <li> No more scraping and extra callus remover.  </li>
            <li> If you want one, look at the other model.</li>
            <li> I like the option of plugging it in versus batteries, which two other family members have.  </li>
            <li> My husband went over my feet this past sat and again on sun using the blue roller.</li>
            <li> Do not take my doctors word as permission for you or any other diabetic.</li>
            <li> I suspect that used with extreme cautioon</li>
            <li> and it only took a few minutes!</li>
            <li> If you have rough, calluses feet...buy this!</li>
            <li> Said he was going to tell his other patients about it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other items like this</li>
            <li> I use it on my heels and it immediately took care of my rough skin!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well and does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I did order replacement rollers for extreme callus removal.</li>
            <li> Other pedi products that rotate &amp; use a sanding method always stop rotating when you press on your callous &amp; don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I am just gonna use it as a finishing buff after callus shaver like the other user does.</li>
            <li> No more batteries and works just the same.</li>
            <li> It says use 3 seconds, well i need like 20 seconds, but other than that, it does what it says.  </li>
            <li> where has this been when i was sharp blades to get the callus removed</li>
            <li> Have used others that just don&#x27;t due the job.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I do not have to change batteries every other time I use it, and it has sufficient power to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the other emjoi devices.</li>
            <li> My calluses were extreme</li>
            <li> one unit takes the place of the pumice stone, ped egg and all that other stuff.  </li>
            <li> I think for me the other version with the handle would be easier to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the tips from other reviewers, I put a towel on the floor to catch the dust, and I am thankful that I did.</li>
            <li> After receiving the product and using it twice, I&#x27;ve moved all of the other foot care products (</li>
            <li> No more sawing back and forth over stubborn hardened callus.</li>
            <li> DUE</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this other contraption for $199  at ulta</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I ordered this, but it turned out to be a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I also used to use the sharp razor pedi cure that pulled layers of the skin away.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable bending over trying to reach each foot.</li>
            <li> Various attempts at removing them in the past were unsuccessful.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a couple other times this week and put moisturizer on afterwards.</li>
            <li> started with really bad feet -- I live in bare feet and flip flops and, recently...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews on this little device.  </li>
            <li> time i&#x27;ll use the green rollers a little and then finish with the blue (included) ones.</li>
            <li> have to be very careful with my fingers</li>
            <li> I will have to use it several times over several weeks to remove my very thick calluses.  </li>
            <li> This has resulted in big, hard, rough callouses on both</li>
            <li> I have a really gross habit of picking and pealing at any skin on my feet that is not perfectly smooth (a habit that of course leads to not smooth skin and all sorts of other problems).</li>
            <li> The design of this one is much harder to work with though than the previous version.</li>
            <li> All the dead dry skin on the bottom of my foot is gone and thats what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I started to get cracks, which hurt like crazy and are super unattractive.  </li>
            <li> Finally something that really works...the only bad thing attachment  Buffet wears down really fast and replacement expensive...</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not strong enough for heavily calloused feet.  </li>
            <li> all worked a little bit, but never really smoothed that skin.</li>
            <li> my heels are still a little rough.</li>
            <li> I use it several times a week to keep the hard skin at bay from my feet.  </li>
            <li> but I had a hard time maneuvering the Emjoi over the entire surfaces of my feet.</li>
            <li> The key thing is not to press too hard when using it.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a little scary</li>
            <li> Depending on how bad your feet are you may need to use it a couple of times before you notice a huge difference</li>
            <li> The condition in the &#x27;before&#x27; shot is only a fraction as bad as the condition I described in my first post, but I wanted to provide at least a basic example of the work this product can do.</li>
            <li> Use a dark trash can</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about yet another product promising to remove calluses, but, hey, this  one works.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would be afraid to repeat the same area over &amp; over</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is not powerful....</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item even after some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> The product needs to come with at least one extra set of rollers for the price.  </li>
            <li> It did soften a few rough places.  </li>
            <li> Now my husband doesn&#x27;t hate to give me a foot massage because now my feet are so smooth!</li>
            <li> I use Shea butter on my heels every night, but within a few days my heels are rough again.</li>
            <li> Just go over the necessary areas slowly.</li>
            <li> Doc also advised there is a point where you stop taking the callus down because it formed for a reason...to protect your feet.</li>
            <li> If you put any pressure on it, it slows down.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery running down.</li>
            <li> purchase the Micor-pedi callus remover hoping that it would cut down the work.</li>
            <li> I kept it just on the surface layer of skin and it truly does work, You don&#x27;t need to press down with it.</li>
            <li> do not push down--</li>
            <li> Because it is corded, there is no &#x27;bogging down&#x27; like battery operated models do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could bog it down without shaving off a part of my heel.  </li>
            <li> Not really excited about this product...wished I had bought the other one which looks like a &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; as you can probably flip that one around.  </li>
            <li> try these in due &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> and you can see the dead skin ( not a pretty site)..would recommend this to all..</li>
            <li> but as I explained to him, he has very rough heels!</li>
            <li> Also, when you work on your heels put the foot you&#x27;re working on over your other knee and then hold it over a waste basket while you remove callus.</li>
            <li> No need to press hard, the spinning will take off the dead skin without extra</li>
            <li> I spend five minutes or less using this twice a week</li>
            <li> since half the roller is covered.</li>
            <li> I have the typical exerciser feet.</li>
            <li> But this time, with less effort.  </li>
            <li> Wish refill rollers cost a bit less.</li>
            <li> With the Tornado, you run less risk of skin damage.</li>
            <li> My toes and heels get slightly callused in summer from sandals it using this was a breeze..</li>
            <li> and it was slightly tender.  </li>
            <li> Cuts callus removal time in half.</li>
            <li> I previously had the battery powered version and believe me</li>
            <li> Was not impressed, and was high in price.</li>
            <li> It may bog down a little bit</li>
            <li> All of these removed very little and required quite a lot of elbow greece (minus the lotion).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already spent a small fortune over the years on my feet</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to mess with batteries.</li>
            <li> no batteries to mess with</li>
            <li> rough skin and small callouses</li>
            <li> My feet were a mess</li>
            <li> issues I have with it is the price and the mess.  </li>
            <li> the mess...</li>
            <li> No more rough heels.</li>
            <li> this and other companies make a weak unit is that diabetics who have neuropathy (or neuropathy from some other condition) may not feel how much dead skin they are removing and hence sustain a minor injury.  </li>
            <li> This little gem has saved me lots of money already, way less pedicures, manicures etc.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the motor bogging down at any point.  </li>
            <li> but they just couldn&#x27;t cut it motors bogged down</li>
            <li> This sands down the dead skin gradually without applying pressure.</li>
            <li> and it takes care of removing dry hard skin</li>
            <li> if you have hard, scaley, peeling, dry, cracked skin on your heels and feet, order this product today...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone who has rough, cracked heels that drive them crazy.</li>
            <li> Hard to get into the smaller spots, but it a small little machine</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I always read the negative reviews first-</li>
            <li> This little machine compliments my foot care..</li>
            <li> &#x27;s some advice: 1) Put your foot over a trash can when using the Pedi, as little flecks of skin continually fall off.</li>
            <li> This little gadget worked wonders on my feet.  </li>
            <li> HOW IT WORKS WITH LITTLE EFFORT.  </li>
            <li> This little item seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase, but thought the plug in version might be a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a little online shopping so he could bring things with him</li>
            <li> I brought a little container with that in it and used it after using the machine.</li>
            <li> but you have to work this little device to get results.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo works quite well.  </li>
            <li> removes a little of the callus</li>
            <li> It is little and works  just like it states.</li>
            <li> the second is that I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work as well when the batteries started to get weak.  </li>
            <li> A small crack had started to form on the back of my left heel &amp; it made walking uncomfortable</li>
            <li> This is a little powerhouse of a callus remover.  </li>
            <li> I purchased all the little accessories to do my nails and also some additional refill rollers.</li>
            <li> All this for the cost of maybe 2 pedicures and these will last me for at least a year!</li>
            <li> i use it every now and then, I wish it was a little stronger&lt;</li>
            <li> can move this little machine</li>
            <li> Little unhandy to hold and angle on heel because of design.</li>
            <li> the sanding roller does not fit tightly</li>
            <li> Tough  skin on my heels and big toes.</li>
            <li> Finally found something to take care of the tough calluses on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have found that when the roughness is very thick, this tool isn&#x27;t enough to get through all the layers</li>
            <li> If your feet have very very thick callus, buy extra green rolls.</li>
            <li> I have several calluses on my feet that I could not deal with or reduce because the build up in that area was thick and hard.</li>
            <li> ALL YEAR ROUND.</li>
            <li> It does take off the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> It does remove the dead skin easly.</li>
            <li> Also creaming my feet everyday.</li>
            <li> I use the green roller and do not find it to be too harsh.  </li>
            <li> After just a few times of using it, my feet and I are ecstatic over the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to waste time with this one -</li>
            <li> It works well at removing dead skin from heels.  </li>
            <li> Mine works on batteries which are not cheap</li>
            <li> Wearing sandals was out of the question and winter only made my feet worse.  </li>
            <li> But after just one use that dead skin came off without any pressure.  </li>
            <li> Put a towel underneath it to catch all the dead skin it will take off.</li>
            <li> The corded option keeps it from going dead or even loosing power.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy calluses on my feet and get spa pedicures every three weeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on a Battery operated.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days when needed.</li>
            <li> This callus remover takes off all of that dead stuff.</li>
            <li> care,,, if your going to heavy use this not recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> It would be a must if you have heavy callous.</li>
            <li> This is not for heavy callouses.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Xtreme green refill rollers &amp; those</li>
            <li> Also, I am using the Xtreme (green) rollers instead.  </li>
            <li> and I never have to worry about dead batteries.</li>
            <li> I use it over the waste basket because there&#x27;s lots of ... crud..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working (have rinsed and dried it between uses).  </li>
            <li> I have been trying for the longest to remove the dead, cracked skin from the bottom of my feet and heels.  </li>
            <li> This got rid of so much dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the battery ones they&#x27;re a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been filing everyday for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> do wish the Emjoi had some method to capture the dead skin like the PedEgg, but</li>
            <li> then green ones called &amp;#34;Xtreme Coarse&amp;#34; (#3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have really really ugly callouses on the bottom/side of my big toes, which I&#x27;ve spent long amounts of time filing down, even using a razor.  </li>
            <li> No more dry crack left heel, no more dirty feet after wearing sandals, no more big toe hard dry skin, no more dryness at all.</li>
            <li> no more week turning when the battery start to wear down.</li>
            <li> I was previously disappointed by its weakness, but I am updating this review to reflect my new opinion of this device: it blows through batteries like nobody&#x27;s business if you use regular, run of the mill batteries.</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviews are poor and they mention that the power is not strong enough and keeps stopping if any pressure is applied.  </li>
            <li> for seriously thick callouses you will need the extreme course rollers.</li>
            <li> A little experimentation with a small screwdriver and some sandpaper sheets, presto, infinite life from one cylinder.</li>
            <li> Bought a small makeup bag to put the cord and the pedi gadget in (little bag</li>
            <li> It takes way too long to remove tough callouses with this.  </li>
            <li> You have to use this on dry feet as it is completely useless on wet feet or even moist feet.</li>
            <li> stop rolling if you press down too hard (to prevent you from hurting yourself)&lt;br /&gt;removes</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t push down, if sounds like it is dragging let up on pressure as hard pressure it will not work.  </li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t even that bad and the first roller is already worn out and I still have ragged areas.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quite well, i need to purchase the courser roller because my husbands feet are pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Tried the battery operated ones and they have a tendency to slow down.  </li>
            <li> It works well for me and think, in time, it would wear down my rather thick callouses.  </li>
            <li> Not very effective.  </li>
            <li> The raw section was infected and I was prescribed antibiotics.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have troubled feet - it works!</li>
            <li> In the \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; of a few minutes, I was able to grind off those nasty calluses myself!  </li>
            <li> With them being a bit worse for wear, regarding dry skin and callouses, I wanted to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> Not this little gem!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time, and don&#x27;t snag your non calloused skin!</li>
            <li> Of course I used my boyfirend as the guinea pig and it smoothed his calluses down to nothing and their gone!!</li>
            <li> If I had any complaint at all, I wish it was a little bit stronger.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is this product is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I actually was looking at the Clarisonic foot product, but felt it was a bit too expensive.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t compare to anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> My mother has diabetes and I wished I found this sooner, it works wonders for her, no more cracked and bleeding soles.</li>
            <li> He also cautioned that callus form because of foot issues usually caused by genetics.</li>
            <li> no more battery</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shape, thought it was too small</li>
            <li> It does not magically sand your callouses in 5 seconds like one would hope.</li>
            <li> No more blades, files,pumice stones.</li>
            <li> My grandchildren would constantly ask me what was wrong with my feet</li>
            <li> gross, sorry).  </li>
            <li> I would go overboard and be in pain if went too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has NO more power than something battery operated.</li>
            <li> Just got, not sure how would work.  </li>
            <li> I had been wanting the emjoi, and decided on the Nano because of its small size.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s no better than a $2 foot file from the beauty store.</li>
            <li> Do this over a disposable surface otherwise you will have dead skin EVERYWHERE!  </li>
            <li> no more pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve included a picture that shows one foot done, one not done yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, especially when you factor in replacement/extra rollers.  </li>
            <li> My feet have improved well enough to wear sandals and not have to pay for expensive pedicures.</li>
            <li> My heels didn&#x27;t hurt so horribly and my feet were smooth!  </li>
            <li> The small sanding drums worked well.</li>
            <li> Buy the green ones!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually give reviews, but I think I will start.  </li>
            <li> This callus remover is small, lightweight, and travels well.  </li>
            <li> No more ped-egg scraping.  </li>
            <li> If you are expecting miracles the first time you use it, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weak and just stops when you press down on it.  </li>
            <li> They were so bad that I needed a prescription cream to hydrate them, and while that took some of the edge off the discomfort, the difference was minimal, especially in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then again, maybe I&#x27;m totally wrong and the manufacturer is just too stupid to design this thing better.</li>
            <li> Those awful calluses are not quite completely gone but nearly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to ugly rough heels again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry I waited so long to buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to over-do-it as you have complete control over where you&#x27;re trimming</li>
            <li> the button is SO hard to turn off</li>
            <li> and it was a bit hard to hold, so</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a hard wire device</li>
            <li> Just remember when using the Emjoi, don&#x27;t press too hard and keep it in motion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been whittling away at my hard cracked heels since I got this.  </li>
            <li> No litttle pieces of hard skin sticking out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard.  </li>
            <li> It was too hard for me to maintain my feet with pumice...</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m left-handed) and I didn&#x27;t have the problem of pressing it too hard and making it get stuck.  </li>
            <li> I hardly recognize my feet, whether by sight or self</li>
            <li> They also required a lot of hard work to accomplish even that.  </li>
            <li> They saved me lots of money because I no longer had to go to my podiatrist for the hard, painful calluses I&#x27;d get on the outside of my feet, about and inch under my little toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it runs slowly or sounds like it&#x27;s laboring, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> Since I waited awhile I buy it, my heels were worse than usual now, so I&#x27;ll probably need a few sessions (and lots of lotion!)</li>
            <li> the cord should be at least 2+ feet longer..</li>
            <li> this one only has one side to it and it&#x27;s awkward to me.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, however I wish it would have come with at least one replacement roller.</li>
            <li> I use it once every two weeks now and it keeps my feet smoother than they&#x27;ve been in at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> There were some negative reviews</li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes, my feet had lost the moisture from the shower and it seemed harder to sand the callouses off, plus I was bored, so I stopped.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I went against the directions by quintupling the recommended time of continuous buffing, but my feet aren&#x27;t the least bit sore.</li>
            <li> I try to get a pedi at least once every month to two months.  </li>
            <li> I heard something about my nasty heals, rubbing against her legs in bed and then a ringing sound.  </li>
            <li> I find this shape of unit quite clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> However, again, my biggest complaint is that this thing is just too wimpy.  </li>
            <li> Using it several times a week is part of my routine, and my feet (which were in horrible shape before) are soft as a child&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Well, my four calluses (which were about dime sized) were so thick and hardened</li>
            <li> If you won the genetic lottery like I did; you have really thick callus formation.</li>
            <li> I have really thick callouses on my feet from years of abuse and work boots</li>
            <li> It takes 10-15 minutes on each foot to slowly sand away the callouses.</li>
            <li> If your feet are thick with calluses you need this now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a miracle watching the thick skin melt away.</li>
            <li> I suffer from pronated feet making the inside bottom surfaces of my feet prone to development of thick calluses.  </li>
            <li> A collecting unit for the dead skin wouldn&#x27;t have been the worse idea either.  </li>
            <li> I had a thick ring around the heels of my feet and still got the smoothness.</li>
            <li> slow, but works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow, but it helps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful and it&#x27;s rather expensive</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get grossed out, but also I wear flat sandals daily during the summer and one thing I hated</li>
            <li> When it start to get weak, I&#x27;m never sure if it is the batteries or the roller</li>
            <li> But expensive to operate due to replaceable abrasive cylinders</li>
            <li> In comparison to those other expensive removers this one was tops on my list.  </li>
            <li> I am elated to say that after trying those awful things that are scary to run across your skin which do little, that this is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not concerned about cutting myself with this, as long as you stay away from your toenails, it&#x27;s not for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he was always using the Ped Egg to grind down his very tough calluses.  </li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t remember when they&#x27;ve felt this</li>
            <li> His feet were so calloused and painful to him - and they were starting to look like they were going to start splitting and were really thick in callouses.  </li>
            <li> This product does work, but it is seriously lacking in power.  </li>
            <li> People have commented that if you push too hard it stops the rotation, but you don&#x27;t need to push very hard to make it work.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly expensive little item considering what it does.</li>
            <li> Refill rollers are a little expensive but can be used over and over.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is a little difficult.</li>
            <li> My heels weren&#x27;t terribly bad (they&#x27;re easier to manage overall)</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it will not help if your feet are too bad.</li>
            <li> I get bad callus&#x27;, especially over the winter months.  </li>
            <li> not a good result.</li>
            <li> I have VERY bad callouses, to the point where the pedicure people say &amp;#34;we can&#x27;t do too much with them&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of using a pumice stone daily to try to sand months of callus development.  </li>
            <li> The pedi spin was pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought the corded because I read some reviews that said the battery-operated models could be weak.</li>
            <li> or so you use it, it will appear weak and shut off with any pressure...</li>
            <li> But they are not so thick now as two weeks ago!</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked on my very hard calluses and feet.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the one with the cord as I had tough skin and callouses</li>
            <li> I bought the Xtreme Coasre rollers additional for tough skin.</li>
            <li> It would take forever to remove tough heel callouses with this.  </li>
            <li> I had callous&#x27; and tough skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have always had very thick calluses on my feet and decided to give this device a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dremel grinder on my callouses, which are very thick.  </li>
            <li> therefore I have very thick callous on my feet.</li>
            <li> works but very slow</li>
            <li> but I got tired of replacing the batteries, so I got the corded version because I use it so often.</li>
            <li> He is also addicted, he calls it a belt sander.</li>
            <li> this beauty tool leave my skin like baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> Seller does not stand behind return policy and charges you even for defective items.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of crusty feet that would snag on the sheets and anything that was knit.  </li>
            <li> While not mentioned in the instructions, I have also used the roller for removing calluses on the elbows for removing the thin calluses on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Before this she used some manual tools which were slow and tedious.</li>
            <li> I chose the electric model because I am tired of feeding landfills and this product is something I will always use in the privacy of my home.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s not great.  </li>
            <li> Because itâs described as a Nano, I was afraid it would be overly small</li>
            <li> This fits in hand but is sometimes hard to reach very back of heels where my callouses are worst.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather disgusting that this company seems to make a \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; model quite often.  </li>
            <li> NO GOOD!  </li>
            <li> I found it to be very disappointing with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she sometimes suffers from hard skin on the heels.</li>
            <li> , I developed some awful calluses, long and hard won but awful to see.</li>
            <li> In fact in the last couple of years my heels have started cracking, very painful.  </li>
            <li> This one was a waste, so disappointed....</li>
            <li> Very weak.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but when I read the reviews then tried it</li>
            <li> The item is difficult to hold onto while you work on your feet.  </li>
            <li> -- I was seriously wrong.  </li>
            <li> (unfortunately, ordered her the battery-operated one).  </li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy it</li>
            <li> The replacements are a bit expensive, which is why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Trust me you will not go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This gadget does what others have promised to do and failed.  </li>
            <li> the on/off switch is difficult to use, dont buy if u are arthritic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I unfortunately don&#x27;t have the corded one.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the Ped Egg, but I needed something stronger that could whip my feet into shape.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Forget expensive pedicures...</li>
            <li> There is a cylindrical file that needs to be replaced and others have said it can get expensive -  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> You Can&#x27;t Go wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Wish the rollers weren&#x27;t quite so expensive</li>
            <li> My feet were terrible; they were actually snagging on the sheet in bed.</li>
            <li> It was quite difficult to maneuver and use this unit.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong on this purchase.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG BUYING</li>
            <li> I have very tough heels</li>
            <li> Holy crap -- this little thing works!</li>
            <li> Seriously - if you&#x27;re even thinking about ordering this - do it!!  </li>
            <li> If you order this, I can promise you--you will not be disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with my heels in the winter months being cracked and dry.  </li>
            <li> I had horrible cracks on my heels and dry flaky skin on my toes.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t  - it went from bad to worse -</li>
            <li> Some extremely calloused feet, nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> all her life - thick, callused, ugly and they crack - painfully</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy and you have painful calluses on your feet from work that are stubborn and hard to remove, this is your solution!!</li>
            <li> Too bad and an expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> That method is awkward, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li> The life of the roller was disappointing though.  </li>
            <li> No chance of cutting yourself using this.</li>
            <li> and my heals would be so dirty at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Plus, if my feet got dirty, I couldn&#x27;t scrub the dirt off - I guess because it was stuck in the cracks?  </li>
            <li> Everyone seems to be afraid of a dreaded lawsuit.  </li>
            <li> Since a cutting accident when a pedicurist used a scraping tool on me</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t tape the end to the base it rattles like crazy and is very irritating 3 -</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li> The roller part no longer turns making it useless! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spare you the details on how bad my feet are...</li>
            <li> my heels are so bad</li>
            <li> If this one ever goes bad, I&#x27;ll just order another one.</li>
            <li> My feet didn&#x27;t look or feel bad at all before I used this</li>
            <li> ....my feet were so bad that I didn&#x27;t even want to go to a salon because I was embarrassed for the nail tech to see how bad they were.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i wont ever have to have ugly feet again...</li>
            <li> it is a godsend for helping my poor bunion afflicted feet not feel and look as awful as they are...worth every penny and thensome!  </li>
            <li> but I am just so disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed .</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my college student and she was crazy about it!  </li>
            <li> Pedicurists must absolutely hate this tool.  </li>
            <li> I hate dealing with batteries.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthless.  </li>
            <li> ~I always hated using industrial grade sandpapers dremels razors and those so called cheesegrader pedi eggs</li>
            <li> i hated my feet (and they hated me) .</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> very disappointed...</li>
            <li> very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My feet weren&#x27;t too horrible, but having diabetes, I wanted to keep them softened.  </li>
            <li> I tried a rechargeable callus remover and it was horrible!</li>
            <li> I have terrible feet, and have tried everything, including the Ped Egg and lots of files and creams.  </li>
            <li> but OMGosh, they were disgusting compared to now.    </li>
            <li> This is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I still hesitated that there was hope for my feet, but even the Emjoi&#x27;s worst reviews gave me an idea of</li>
            <li> My socks slide on without getting caught up on nasty skin.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d get rid of the horrible calluses I&#x27;ve lived with for years - until I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> The Calluses on my feet were awful and nothing was working on them.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome.  So much more powerful than the battery operated unit.  I will definitely be giving this as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> works great and easy to use</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great on foot work without burning like my old battery dremmel tool. The corded has plenty of power, and of course never runs low of battery.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item and I have no idea why anyone wouldn&#x27;t. It does exactly what it says and it takes years of dry, dead skin off your heals in minutes. It also takes the rough spots off your toes and hands as well. I do a lot of gardening so I used it on my thumbs and index fingers. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but when I read the reviews then tried it I could not believe how smooth my feet got after 1 try in 20 minutes on both feet.  I work out daily so my feet take a beating.  This really got my feet feeling better and of course looking better.</li>
            <li> would not recommend.  if the product s not plugged in, it does not work.  the blades are not as course to remove callus from your feet.</li>
            <li> Works, Made my heels look like a human owns them.</li>
            <li> Love this callus remover, easy to use/clean up, light weight, long cord, dual electricity, powerful enough to get the job done. Everyone should add this to their personal grooming.</li>
            <li> Love that it is corded and I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries. The cord is long enough but not extremely long, easily reaches from the outlet to the sink. There are two speeds but I really don&#x27;t notice any difference between the two. The cartridge is easy to remove and clean. Depending on how bad your feet are you may need to use it a couple of times before you notice a huge difference but it works great!!! I&#x27;ve searched around for a place that I could get a pedicure that actually removed the dry/dead skin but never felt like they really got it. Use this and then use a good lotion and your feet will feel wonderful!  Would purchase again if something happened to mine.</li>
            <li> It works!!!!!!!!!! My horse hoofs are now smooth and fresh. My pedicurist is so happy. No more scraping and extra callus remover.  I use it once or twice a week for 5 minutes on each foot, then slather with lotion and cotton socks. Fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and certainly brings the softness back to my feet. Great for those rough heels.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace the battery operated one that didn&#x27;t have enough umph for his super callused feet. He loves it, especially with the super course roller.</li>
            <li> I love it works real well</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.  I would recommend buying the mens gray replacement pumice wheel as the blue one is pretty fine.  I got the gray one right off the bat and it works really well.  If I had any complaint at all, I wish it was a little bit stronger.  If you press it just stops spinning but that is probably a good safety feature.  I bought one for a friend and she loves hers too.</li>
            <li> This little machine compliments my foot care.. Excellent product..  Recommend the corded model.  ð</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described and is so much easier to use than a file or rasp. A pedecure costs $35 w/ tip. This has given me two pedecures on one set of batteries -- I might get a third. The rolling file will likely last another 3 pedecures. So the cost to operate it is low -- definetely less than the cost of a pedecure in a salon.</li>
            <li> This is the best little thing I&#x27;ve ever found!!  My feet used to be so rough, they&#x27;d catch on everything - carpet, blankets, etc.  I know - gross, right?  I tried every cream, scrubber, loofa - whatever I could find and nothing helped.  I used the Emojoi once, and my feet are soooo smooth, it feels funny to walk on them!!  Now I just use it for touch ups every other week or so, and I&#x27;m good to go!  Seriously - if you&#x27;re even thinking about ordering this - do it!!  (PS - In the instructions it says not to use it outside, but with all the dust it produces - especially on your first use - I would not use it in the house unless you&#x27;re doing it over a dry bathtub....)</li>
            <li> This was worth the money. It help me immensely. I have several calluses on my feet that I could not deal with or reduce because the build up in that area was thick and hard. I used many products and there was very very limited help or not at all. This worked!! it removed the calluses . I was in pain. Thank God for this little powerful callus remover. In fact, I just used it today!!</li>
            <li> You have to change the roll too often.  Cost too much money to keep on changing them.</li>
            <li> works good. more powerful than amope for sure.</li>
            <li> As you age, your feet just take more work to keep them soft than they do when you&#x27;re in your twenties plus I love going barefoot most of the time and I don&#x27;t like socks so my feet show the wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Dr Scholl&#x27;s callus pads and liked them a lot. They saved me lots of money because I no longer had to go to my podiatrist for the hard, painful calluses I&#x27;d get on the outside of my feet, about and inch under my little toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope for this machine. I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be strong enough to keep those tough calluses from getting so thick but I was WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this little machine!!! It&#x27;s quick, painless and it works GREAT! Now this is the only thing I use. I use it about once a week on the rough spots for maintenance and it keeps my feet smooth. After using, I put Eucerin Aquaphor healing ointment on my feet and socks and leave overnight. In the morning, my feet are baby soft. The rest of the week, I apply a bit of Jergens after showering in the morning and this easy plan keeps my feet in good shape and takes very little time out of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine seems like it&#x27;s going to last but I&#x27;m tempted to buy another anyway because I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> its ok but not as strong and effective was advertised</li>
            <li> does ok job wish it was a little stronger for I have heavy callous&#x27;s and it takes a while but does job!!!</li>
            <li> Does the job, has become a weekly go to for me in between pedicures.  My feet look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and decided to purchase the Emjoi because of the positive reviews. I am so pleased. The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano has enough power to get the job done. Unlike some of the other models it is not so powerful that it will hurt you. It has a nice long cord and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this productâ¦.</li>
            <li> Excellent~I jus got it &amp; after 20 minutes my feet felt as soft as a babys~I always hated using industrial grade sandpapers dremels razors and those so called cheesegrader pedi eggs~I recommend the one w/a power cord jus to have it ready &amp; not going thru batteries~Its strong comes with a pouch a plastic cover on the one blue roller that comes with it~The company sells replacements as so does amazon very reasonable for me it was an end of medievil tools &amp; bleeding~The blue roller smoothed mine out but if you need more there is an extreme green &amp; another one for a mans foot as well as a lavender one for ruff elbows~Im no longer embarrased of my feet &amp; looking forward to wearing sandles again~And now my husband can have his power tools back &amp; i wont ever have to have ugly feet again...Easy to use &amp; is worth every penny~</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. NOW I CAN HAVE SMOOTH AND SOFT FEET ALL YEAR ROUND. THE LITTLE DEVICE REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Have really enjoyed getting my feet back in shape!</li>
            <li> Finally a fix. I havecrough cracked feet no matter what I do. I have tried every supposedly  miracle solution out there to no avail. This tool works great. I now have beautifully  smooth heels and soles. I took the advice from one of the reviews here and use a toothbrush  for cleaning the roller. Have had excellent  length of use. Best ever!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product. It does a good job of removing the dead and calloused skin. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everyone has said it already ... this thing is GREAT!!! My feet haven&#x27;t felt this soft since .... I seriously don&#x27;t remember when they&#x27;ve felt this soft.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some advice: 1) Put your foot over a trash can when using the Pedi, as little flecks of skin continually fall off. It also creates a &amp;#34;dust cloud&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s minimal compared to the stuff that catches below. Use a dark trash can and you can see how much progress is being made!&lt;br /&gt;2) When finished with each foot, take a moist rag and wipe the roller clean. The pores can get clogged pretty easily from the skin dust.&lt;br /&gt;3) Make sure your moisturize after each use. I rinse my foot, then use Aquaphor and put on socks overnight. Use lotion or some other hydration the following days as well, or your feet will quickly dry up again.</li>
            <li> I love that&#x27;s its a plug in. I&#x27;ve used it many times.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t somebody think of this sooner??  The best thing ever for polishing my dry, crusty heels!  This would make a great gift forÂ bff&#x27;s &amp; mom&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased at how effective this product is! Its performance fully meets my expectations. It&#x27;s convenient and I can use it for a few minutes of touch up or for a more thorough pedicure.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised!  Very glad I made this purchase. I have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> This thing is powerful. Go easy with it. great result</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday and I am amazed at the results.  It works very easily and does an awesome job.  My feet are as smooth as silk.  I frequently pay for pedicures and I feel that I will never have to pay for a pedicure again!  Love love love this.</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughters.  They were very surprised how fast this little machine takes off the callouses.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  It make me feet feel so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and plenty of power.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and I am so glad to have found this product.  I actually was looking at the Clarisonic foot product, but felt it was a bit too expensive.  I do not get pedicures because my feet are so ticklish, it is not relaxing and comfortable for me at all.  I love having this at home that I can do myself whenever I need to.  You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping was 10 days  or prime and I payed.for shipping.  But great product it works GREAT on my calluses. That are all most groan</li>
            <li> works perfectly! Will save me $25 a month!</li>
            <li> really does take off dry skin</li>
            <li> great customer service, item as described</li>
            <li> Perfect for exfoliating. Love the product and that its electric. Super smooth feet..</li>
            <li> I had purchased this Emjoi because of the higher ratings than a similar product I saw on tv. This works great on removing rough spots and cracks. After one use I have noticed a difference immediately and to keep them soft, I rub my feet down with coconut oil then put on thick socks. I&#x27;m going to be purchasing the next model up for my husband. Will definiately purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I use it daily.  With this you can do your own pedicures. The only reason for a professional pedicure is the pamper. I love it my feet are so beautiful. Look good, feel great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he was always using the Ped Egg to grind down his very tough calluses.  Sometimes the bottoms of his heels would get so rough, it would rip our sheets.  Well, I bought this for him because of the reviews saying it was more powerful than the other leading brand, which I bought also.  The truth of the matter is that this electric one works way better and is more powerful than the other popular brand.  His feet are smooth now.  He&#x27;s amazed and I am.  It&#x27;s very, very easy to use and not messy at all!!</li>
            <li> I love my Emjoi Micro-Pedi. Have given several away as gifts. Much gentler than the hand callus removers and more effective, too. Amazing how much dry skin is removed, but the product is very gentle. My feet look great when I&#x27;m done--just like the picture</li>
            <li> My feet weren&#x27;t too horrible, but having diabetes, I wanted to keep them softened.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works.  It did soften a few rough places.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and It works very well.  I use it several times a week to keep the hard skin at bay from my feet.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Does a nice job quickly.</li>
            <li> The best tool for foot care. And, I especially like that it is not battery operated and has two speeds. Also, new rollers can be easily ordered at reasonable prices!</li>
            <li> This product worked really good the first time I used it, but after a couple of uses it already needs a new blue roller thing and they are quite expensive.  The replacement rollers are about half the price of a new buffer.  If they only last a couple of uses, it&#x27;s just as cheap to go to the spa and have a pedicure.  It does work as advertised I just wish the refills were cheaper.</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVER, LOVE IT IS WONDERFUL!! THANK YOU!! GREAT ITEM!! GREAT SELLER!!</li>
            <li> Not over impressed with this.  I even ordered a courser roller for it and it still isn&#x27;t what it is suppose to be.  It&#x27;s okay but you really have to work at using it, especially since the roller isn&#x27;t exposed all the way around.  I have to maneuver it to use it.</li>
            <li> did not perform as I had hoped.  Have to hold it just right for it to work.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have the other model with the longer handle and like it a lot better than this model.  The cord placement is cumbersome.  The item is difficult to hold onto while you work on your feet.  Also, it&#x27;s not strong enough for heavily calloused feet.  I would not purchase it again.  If you want one, look at the other model.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Great product.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice power... Just wished it was a rechargeable unit instead.</li>
            <li> Works  very good, prefer the one over the battery operated. Has good power.</li>
            <li> This item really works well, finding the replacement parts at a reasonable price can be a bit of an issue. Having to order a large number of each grit can be very costly. But as far as performance is concerned it&#x27;s great.  Would be nice if they offered a combination pkg replacement cylinders.</li>
            <li> I love this little callus remover. I saw the new Clarisonic one at a department store and thought I HAD to have it. At $200, I decided I could definitely live without it. So, I ordered this one and it does everything it says it will. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Got it as a Christmas GIft for my wife. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Initially she didnt think that it was powerful enough...because when she does her feet with a stone - or I do her feet with a stone - she uses alot more force. After a minute or two, she realized her feet were alot smoother and she started to really like this. She was done with both of her feet in a little under 10 minutes and she was happy with the results. The only thing that she didnt like was the fact that you had to buy replacement rollers...and the package didnt come with one extra included.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  The person to whom I gave it was thrilled and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  She raved about the results so that I&#x27;m now planning to get one for myself.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I got this. I chose to get the corded model, believing it would be more powerful than one with batteries. This thing IS powerful. I think the best way to handle it is to go slow and certainly, you don&#x27;t need to apply pressure. It smoothed a horrible callus in no time flat, but i made sure to check often so as not to go to far. It would be very easy to do. This is the perfect answer for those if us who wear sandals in the summer. With a little caution, you can have silky soft feet. As another reviewer mentioned- make sure to work over a towel or wastebasket to catch the dead skin, and make sure to stop the unit it and tap it so there isn&#x27;t any buildup along the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think I got my money&#x27;s worth and I look forward to having smooth feet from now on!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for  an electric device to take the place of my pumice stone.  This is amazing!  I can soften the bottoms of my feet and my knees in no time.  Smooth as silk!  It is a product that delivers!</li>
            <li> it was excellent i would recomend this to all</li>
            <li> Great product.  My feet a happy again.  And it is nice to know how easily I can keep them looking and feeling that way.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work quite well.  Didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the motor bogging down at any point.  The only minor downside is that the roller is a bit difficult to get really clean looking, but really to me that&#x27;s not a particularly big deal.</li>
            <li> i love this one with the cord, batteries operated ones are not the way to go. Spend the extra money and buy the corded one. It really saved my dry feet!</li>
            <li> Works great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This little gadget worked wonders on my feet.  Glad I got the corded one.  Probably has more power and no batteries to buy. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish this didnt have to be connected to the wall other then that its a good product</li>
            <li> I bought this for callouses on my toes from walking daily. This little unit is powerful!! I have only used it once, and was impressed immediately. The cord is nice and long, and it does shave off a lot if skin, instead of using a towel,  I just hung my foot over the sink.  This product works! After years of pumice stones, lotion and socks overnight...this unit is my new best friend. I can now wear cute ballet slipper shoes without pain.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Love it. So glad I got the corded version!</li>
            <li> I love this little tool. I quickly get callouses on my feet from wearing sandals all the time.  I spend five minutes or less using this twice a week and the results are amazing. It doesn&#x27;t compare to anything I&#x27;ve used in the past. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I wish I would have known about this year&#x27;s ago. A must have for anyone who don&#x27;t liked dry hard skin on hands and feet. Problem solved thanks to emjoi!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST! Works great - wish I had ordered extra rollers because I want to use it often! Excellent way to have lovely feet every day!</li>
            <li> ONLY USED A FEW TIMES SINCE CHRISTMAS BUT I LIKE IT.  IT IS AMAZING HOW IT WORKS WITH LITTLE EFFORT.  VERY GLAD I MADE THIS PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for you feet. I like that it&#x27;s corded and has a wonderful, consistent amount of power. It&#x27;s smoothing action is awesome however it doesn&#x27;t work for me as a stand alone tool for the cracks on my heels. I have found that when the roughness is very thick, this tool isn&#x27;t enough to get through all the layers so I have to use the old faithful rasp to remove 80% of the problem then finish with the Emjoi. To me, it&#x27;s not a bad deal. I like baby soft feet and it def does that for me. I usually use it weekly just to keep my feet nice and since I have started the weekly routine, I haven&#x27;t had any issue. It&#x27;s a much quicker session now as well at about 5 mins per foot whereas the first time it was about 10-15 mins. I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times and I already need to replace the roller head but I&#x27;m OK with that because it&#x27;s a quick fix. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Finally something that really works...the only bad thing attachment  Buffet wears down really fast and replacement expensive...it definitely golf you over until next pedÃ­ appt</li>
            <li> I have only had to use it twice. My feet are so soft now.. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> So far this is a great product.  I like the electric type instead of the battery operated.  More power.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this years ago. It does a great job removing calluses from my feet. The corded one has unlimited power so you have to be careful using it. I would recommend the Emjoi corded callus remover to anyone. Thanks Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with my Emjoi!  Ever since I hit my 30&#x27;s I started to struggle with dry heels and calluses forming on the ball of my feet.  I&#x27;ve tried regular pedicures, moisturizing products, socks and Vaseline, files, shavers, etc... etc... all with minimal success -- especially in dealing with my calluses.  I ran across this while browsing Amazon and thought, why not?  I&#x27;ve already spent a small fortune over the years on my feet, what&#x27;s a little more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this callus remover ONCE and I am impressed!  My heels weren&#x27;t terribly bad (they&#x27;re easier to manage overall) but my calluses had become so hardened over the past several years that I didn&#x27;t think this would do much for them -- I was seriously wrong.  The instructions say to use for 2-3 seconds at a time, then to check before going over the same area again.  Well, my four calluses (which were about dime sized) were so thick and hardened it probably took me about a good 20-30 seconds total on each one.  I sat on the floor marveling at my feet for quite some time afterwards; they were gone for the first time in YEARS.  The real surprise was when I finally got up and started to walk around.  I had no idea how much discomfort my calluses (they didn&#x27;t happen overnight after all) were causing me until I felt the difference of not having them at all.  It felt like I was walking on air and I&#x27;ve also noted today that walking around in my heels are so much easier and comfortable - no discomfort whatsoever on my pressure points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gadget is amazing and absolutely worth the $$$.  I highly recommend this if you have troubled feet - it works!</li>
            <li> Cool Product and it really works.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my personal mani/pedi kit.  it is a smooth filer that gives you consistent smoothing and removing of dry skin cells.  Makes my home pedi&#x27;s quick and effortless !</li>
            <li> works good but did not receive extra media pad as described in brochure.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about yet another product promising to remove calluses, but, hey, this  one works. Simple, fast, smooth. Highly recommend this gadget.</li>
            <li> This little item seems to work well.  I like the option of plugging it in versus batteries, which two other family members have.  It does take off the dead skin.  You need to be working over a towel or somewhere where it&#x27;s easy to clean up.  I bought replacement rollers at the same time, but the original one seems to have a long lifetime.  Price wise,  I paid what I would of at a local drug store, but they only had battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally got one of these.  Tremendous help in keeping the calluses off my feet.</li>
            <li> My mother has diabetes and I wished I found this sooner, it works wonders for her, no more cracked and bleeding soles.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well! I got the electric for more power &amp; am so happy with it! My feet have never been smoother! Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Compact enough to take on vacation.  My friend really liked it too so I bought her one for Christmas (unfortunately, ordered her the battery-operated one).  The newer super coarse replacement rollers are great.</li>
            <li> Love this Emjoi callus remover. Makes you feet a soft and smooth. Bought the plug in so I didn&#x27;t have to mess with batteries. My husband also loves it because I always catch him in the bathroom going over his feet with it.</li>
            <li> Really works great, I love it.</li>
            <li> this callus remover works really great an takes callus off fast love it no batteries to mess with</li>
            <li> Great product, I do not use it.  I bought it for my wife.  She loves it and thanks me everyone she uses it.  The power is great.  It does remove the dead skin easly.</li>
            <li> I had the battery one before and the plug in is so much nicer&lt;br /&gt;and no batteries to buy.&lt;br /&gt;A lot easier than doing it by hand with a puma stone.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be but, it&#x27;s okay. I will continue using it at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I saw my podiatrist and he approves of this device for me but handed me a box of alcohol wipes. Said heat transfers from the pumice stone to the foot. To wipe the area down to cool the callus and underlying tissues before proceeding again. Even if you are not diabetic this is a good thing to do. You do not want to injure or cause problems with the tissues under the callus. He also cautioned that callus form because of foot issues usually caused by genetics. If you won the genetic lottery like I did; you have really thick callus formation. But they are not so thick now as two weeks ago! Just doing it on the weekends. Moisturize your feet every day. Although going barefoot for some people will not cause callus formation, for me it does. So I am trying to wear sox and my diabetic shoes with special inserts as much as possible. Doc also advised there is a point where you stop taking the callus down because it formed for a reason...to protect your feet. I have not hit that point and will not his that point for quite some time. LOL  ORIGONAL REVIEW I checked with doctor first as i am diabetic type 2. He said ok but use extreme care and daily foot inspections. My husband went over my feet this past sat and again on sun using the blue roller. He used a toothbrush to clean the roller which easily ejects to clean or change. Do not take my doctors word as permission for you or any other diabetic. We are letting my feet rest a Full week before doing more the bigger thicker callouses using the coarser rollers which are here. Also creaming my feet everyday. I suspect that used with extreme cautioon this emjoi micro pedi nano will be a good friend. The instructions say 2 to 3 seconds at a time....follow the instructions. The device never even got warm during use. So glad i got this model that you plug into the wall. Shall be checking with my podiatrist next week and will post what he says</li>
            <li> This really saves time and energy from using a pumice stone! Thankfully, my feet are in pretty good shape so I don&#x27;t need to use this more than once a week. I expect I&#x27;ll be using it more come summertime. I haven&#x27;t had it very long so I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last......wish an extra roller had been included.</li>
            <li> The calus remover is perfectly formed for easy handling. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, powerful little tool. It works wonders; removing rough dry skin quickly. I highly recommend this buffer. It  am going to give these as gifts, anyone ( guy or girl) would love this. Be careful to not over do it...it truly gets the old skin off so fast that you will need to pay attention to not go too low into new skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> This works great. Better than a hand held file, or pumis stone. I would highly recommend this for everyone with rough dry or cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Holy crap -- this little thing works!</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Very effective!</li>
            <li> We chose this because the cord will deliver no decrease in strength as batteries wear.  I have wood floors and they do a number on my feet.  I used this once and my feet are softer than they have been since I moved to the house with wood floors.  I can&#x27;t wait to use this periodically and have nice heels at last.  Quite powerful, comfortable in the hand, and effective.</li>
            <li> I received a dud. Just opened and plugged in, it rotates once per second, versus the 30 times per second it&#x27;s supposed to. Should I get a working replacement and actually get to use this product, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> I hesitated because of the price, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. It just arrived and I gave it a try. My feet are no longer rough....and it only took a few minutes! If you have rough, calluses feet...buy this!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this worked  but it worked incredibly well!  It&#x27;s much better to have the electric one than the battery because those would just run down.  I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy it - oh yeah, get the refills too so your spouse/roommate/partner can use it too and they can have their own roll.</li>
            <li> i think this little machine is great for maintaining pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The foot buffer worked great.  It had been close to a year since my last pedi, and it took much of the rough, yucky skin off.  My only concern is that the roller itself seems to wear off quickly.  I have only used it one time, and it does appear that most of the exfoliating power is gone.  The replacements are a bit expensive, which is why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product known to man to get rid of my callouses. Nothing worked until now!!. I purchased this about a month ago and have used it every day since getting it and after using I put an ointment on whose main ingredient is emu oil. My feet are like baby feet. My podiatrist was thrilled the other day at my appt. Said he was going to tell his other patients about it. You have to make sure to use it as directed. You can&#x27;t apply too much pressure or it will bogg down.  FINALLY!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this little gadget.  I spend a lot of time on my feet and before I got it I became pretty resigned to having rough callused feet.&lt;br /&gt;But not anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit of time to get through tougher spots, my first session took over 20 minutes. But then a salon pedicure takes longer and costs as much as this product.  No need to press hard, the spinning will take off the dead skin without extra pressure.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are super soft and smooth for the first time in my adult life.  Buying one for my mom after this review.</li>
            <li> I have the battery operated one with the longer handle and I must say that this is a better buy.  The battery operated one doesn&#x27;t have the same power and the ones that plug in the wall, not to mention when the batteries run low the remover does also.  I will use the battery operated one for travel but this is definitely a better buy.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I have really thick callouses on my feet from years of abuse and work boots I have tried other items like this but they just couldn&#x27;t cut it motors bogged down or they didn&#x27;t grind enough the Emjoi is amazing small powerful and does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Nano does a wonderful job.  I use the green roller and do not find it to be too harsh.  I wanted a corded version because I wanted to be sure of strong power any time I needed to use it.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Because of this little device, I now have smooth feet. IT&#x27;s no fun getting old and having to deal with cracked heels, but with this little device and some good lotion, my feet look nice again :)</li>
            <li> Works great! So much better than pumice stones and files! Smooth, soft feet fast!</li>
            <li> this is not powerful and only lightl buffs....the idea is good bu this thing will not last..the button is SO hard to turn off</li>
            <li> this micro- pedi , nano callus remove work nice</li>
            <li> This works amazing!  Removes dry skin that a pumice stone couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> I received my Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remove (corded model) just over 1 week ago and I love it. My husband has a rechargeable shaver and you can sometimes hear it straining during prolonged/heavy use. So, I have no doubt the corded model is the best choice for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used my Emjoi unit no more frequently than every other day in order to prevent possible skin irritation. That being said, it has performed admirably. After only 4-5 uses the callouses that I developed on each of my big toes (since my hammertoe surgery) are noticeably smaller and smoother. And the rough patches on the bottom of my feet are now near non-existent. Then, to aid in the smoothing process I treat my feet to lotion after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Love the emjoi.  I have problems with dry skin on my feet and this has worked perfectly without damaging the healthy skin.</li>
            <li> happy battery operated version of this. And I love is so much better no more battery no more week turning when the battery start to wear down. This thing rocks!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I use it on my heels and it immediately took care of my rough skin!</li>
            <li> Soo much better than buffing by hand. Needs a bit more power.. maybe wider, say an XL version.. for us guys who really work hard on our feet. Normal feet this makes quick work of softening feet. Solid 4/5.</li>
            <li> Great product. It arrived as the seller described it</li>
            <li> removes dry skin from heels anf smooths calouses</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Even the nail salon can&#x27;t get my feet as smooth as this.</li>
            <li> My wife says that this works great for her.  Took her a little practice to make sure it was removing callus in the right area, but she adjusted quickly and loves it.  She says it&#x27;s easy to adjust just how much you take off and where and is easy to handle (good ergonomics).  We had a little trouble getting a replacement when the first one got lost in the mail, but eventually got it worked out.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient said it works Fantastic. .</li>
            <li> You get about 5 light uses out of one roller, not very cost affective.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.  All the other units like this that I researched were battery powered, and most of the reviews of those other brands complained that the batteries ran low rather quickly.  The A/C power supply on this unit eliminates that problem - run it as long as you need to, there&#x27;s no loss in power and the unit does an excellent job of removing even hardened calluses.  The replaceable drums provide a more sanitary and consistant level of performance - and give you a choice of  &#x27;rough&#x27; or &#x27;fine&#x27; surfaces to meet your specific needs.</li>
            <li> This little unit is fantastic. The AC version is very powerful.</li>
            <li> I used this the first day I received it and within seconds had cleared up the rough skin on my feet. Now what do I do with it:) I bought the corded version and have no regrets, but it does limit portability. The Nano was large enough for my needs, but I can see it would be a problem if I had larger areas to smooth, since the roller is recessed below the plastic on the device. I recommend reviewing all the models against your needs before deciding. Don&#x27;t let price be the only factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to clean and it&#x27;s also easy to replace rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my purchase and glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I can die happy now. This thing is PURE HEAVEN and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before I got it. Goodbye to cracked heels that catch on everything. The trick is to get the one that is corded. It is strong enough to do the job quickly and beautifully. It is worth every penny and I really would have paid more for the results I now have. No, I don&#x27;t work in the back room (as my husband always says about raving reviews about anything) and I don&#x27;t own shares in the company or know anyone that works there. I just love this product as much as I love my husband. And that&#x27;s a lot. I highly recommend it to everyone who has rough, cracked heels that drive them crazy. You&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> I am a guy that has had calluses on my feet for years. This is super easy to use and works excellent with minimal effort! I have only used it once so far though so hopefully it will last for a long time. I am no longer embarrassed to have my feet touched after just ONE USE! I don&#x27;t understand why the cordless version is only $20 while this corded version is $50, but I don&#x27;t like having to buy batteries all the time so I bought the one with the cord. I do think $50 is over-priced, but if this lasts me for at least one year I would be willing to buy it again. I&#x27;ve wished to sand my man feet for a long time, but never knew something like this existed. I am very happy I found this!</li>
            <li> Love this device. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have a battery operated unit and this corded unit.  The one can wear batteries out rather quickly.  I start with a corn/callous trimmer and then use the Emjoi unit.  The corded Emjoi unit works very well, and I love how smooth it makes my feet!  I ordered an extra pack of rollers (2).  I use it about every 7-10 days, and so far, I am still using the first roller it came with; I have had it for about 2 to 2-1/2 months.</li>
            <li> If this tool doesn&#x27;t save you money by not having to go to the nail and sanding salon, I&#x27;d be very surprised.  Pedicurists must absolutely hate this tool.  Works extremely well and does what it says it will do.  Ron</li>
            <li> I have only use the corded Emjoi two times so far but it has left my heels feeling relatively smooth. I used the xtreme coarse rollers. This seems be the better option from reading other reviews. I tried the ped-egg without much success. Very happy so far with the results from the Emjoi corded Micro-Pedi Callus Remover</li>
            <li> This is a good product. If this doesn&#x27;t remove your callus, you have some really, really messed up feet; and should see a foot doctor.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as advertised! My heals have been cracked and calloused for so many years and I have tried everything under the sun to repair them. I was ashamed of the way they looked and would not wear any open heeled shoes.&lt;br /&gt;When I would used callus stone on my feet the skin was ragged and prickly even when I put lotion on them.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this twice and my feet are so soft! The skin is baby soft and pink. I still have deep inbedded white lines but cannot feel any texture from them. So I am hoping that with continued use and more lotion these lines will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I encourage anyone with callouses on their feet and toes to buy this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the trick.  Pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. My feet were a disaster after my last pregnancy - so many gross, thick calluses.  This thing got rid of all of them in one use. It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I use it every Saturday after my shower.  I started with Baby Foot procedure and then have used this every week to maintain my smooth feet. I have not had to have a pedicure all summer.  Awesome.  Highly recommend to corded verses battery.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!! It is a miracle worker!!! I will recommend this to ANYONE and EVERYONE</li>
            <li> Wow ! Finally .... you have no idea how many pedicure machines, files, grinders, creams, foot rubs and so on I&#x27;ve tried in the last 4 years......Nothing works as well as this thing. I wish it was just a tad more powerful but still works like magic... I am so happy i found it i wanna cry lol</li>
            <li> Does just what I hoped -- easy to use and quite effective!</li>
            <li> This is the best callus remover ever. I read the reviews and bought the electric one and I am glad I did. It works great. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this callus remover hoping that something would help the calluses that build up on my heels.  This product is fantastic!  I used it on my husbands&#x27; heels also and is worked great!  I am so glad to have found something that works! I love that it is electric so I don&#x27;t have to use batteries.  I would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> It works, but light on the &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Oh My Goodness this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my feet that works 100% perfectly. I have tried a lot of foot files and nothing seemed to do the job very well. Then I happened to see this product and all the great reviews it got, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I am so happy I did. This callus remover sure does the job. After just a few times of using it, my feet and I are ecstatic over the results. In just minutes it sloughs off all those callouses and makes my feet smooth again. If you have tried everything else without much results then you have got to try this.</li>
            <li> Powerful for those stubborn areas, yet gentle enough to get the job done! In a few minutes I was ready for my sandals!</li>
            <li> It came with medium drum on the device it works well. You need to take your time. Looking forward to trying a course drum.</li>
            <li> I work in a warehouse and do a LOT of working / standing for 10 hrs a day, so my feet look horrendous weekly. This product does a great job on smoothing my feet and removing callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;will stop rolling if you press down too hard (to prevent you from hurting yourself)&lt;br /&gt;removes rough skin and small callouses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very loud&lt;br /&gt;Roller doesn&#x27;t last that long (a little over a month with regular use)&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t work on any &#x27;cracks&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this product is good for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this onr for my daughter and it works exactly as advertised.  I would buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It does take a while, but it is much, MUCH easier than using a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Could be bigger. Works best on dry feet not soaked.</li>
            <li> I love it - I don&#x27;t have to waste time with this one - the dead skin comes off quickly and easily, with minimal fuss. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys &#x27;spa&#x27; days at home like I do.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this micro pedi  model.  I own both models.  Both work great, but the plug in model is slightly stronger and the battery model fits in the suitcase better.  Never thought I would have such soft feet.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I purchased the battery-operated version at Costco more than a year ago.  It works great but I got tired of replacing the batteries, so I got the corded version because I use it so often. This is the best thing for removing calluses on my heels, and I have tried everything else.  I purchased two of these as gifts for friends also.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase, but thought the plug in version might be a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been really pleased with what it has done for my feet!  A+</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this item.  My feet were a mess and I thought nothing can make these feet nice looking except a professional.  Well I was pleasantly surprised when I used this on my feet. I did order replacement rollers for extreme callus removal. I love this callus remover. I also like the fact that it has a cord you plug in for power, not battery operated. If you have a lot of work to do on your feet it&#x27;s nice you don&#x27;t have to worry about it running out of power. Trust me you will not go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my second Emjoi and I do like the way they keep my feet nice and smooth. The design of this one is much harder to work with though than the previous version. It&#x27;s not quite as comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t make it as easy to use quickly. I also feel like I have to maneuver more since half the roller is covered.</li>
            <li> This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I have and will continue to recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an American living in Australia, and when I knew I was meeting an American friend in Rome I did a little online shopping so he could bring things with him (most products  are stupidly expensive in Australia). My last few pumice stone/feet smoothers  have been fine, but I walk a lot and my feet are not fabulous...nor do I like to spend the time or money on pedicures except on very special occasions! I plugged this little guy in this morning using a simple wall adapter for Europe. (The voltage is fine for here). It is a great little machine, like the most delicate of belt sanders for my feet. It requires a light touch. In just a couple of minutes the rough skin on my heel and toes was greatly diminished. It felt like a light massage. I will continue to use it over the next few days to complete a full exfoliation, as I didn&#x27;t think it would be wise to do it all at once. I do use a foot cream called Miracle Foot Repair and as a result I don&#x27;t have a LOT to take off. I have used that stuff for about ten years since my dad told me about it. I brought a little container with that in it and used it after using the machine. My feet are so perfect right now! (I am not some kind of rep for that cream, btw,and it is super cheap and available at all sorts of drug stores in the US, but I thought I would mention it because anyone who is reading this review probably needs a great cheap foot cream too...) Well anyway no complaints here!</li>
            <li> I love the job it does and how it works. I didn&#x27;t like the shape, thought it was too small and it was a bit hard to hold, so I returned this one and ordered the more expensive corded model which is totally worth the extra cash.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it - used it right away and got noticeable results with very little effort just as the instructions read.</li>
            <li> My mom &amp; I both have this and we are on the fence about it. It does work if you are willing to put time into using it. I have the rolls it came with and the xtreme rolls. ALWAYS buy the MOST coarse. I don&#x27;t care if you have soft granny feet, buy the most coarse! It takes 10-15 minutes on each foot to slowly sand away the callouses. You have to press down really hard to get the sanding action going &amp; you have to repeat the same area over &amp; over which is why I think many people think it doesn&#x27;t work. Normally, I would be afraid to repeat the same area over &amp; over but you have to work this little device to get results. When I did my first sanding I thought this thing sucked... Then I remembered all the good amazon reviews &amp; said this must work somehow, I must be using it incorrectly.. So I took my time slowly going over each callous in different directions, applying different amounts of pressure, &amp; I would begin to see the foot powder fall off (eww, I know!) Even with clean feet you smell the corn chip foot smell as this thing sands them off,you also see powder type smoke. My recommendation for owners is to use a nail brush to dry brush the rollers in between use. The powder from your callouses being shaved build up on the roller &amp; prevent it from being coarse feeling. If you brush the powder off you get more use out of a roll. For me, after using the roller on both feet for 2 treatments a week apart- my rolls look &amp; feel like they have had it. Realistically, I am never going to use this. It has already been in my drawer since Christmas. The upside is that it does work. Other pedi products that rotate &amp; use a sanding method always stop rotating when you press on your callous &amp; don&#x27;t work at all. This product actually works, if you are willing to take the time to do it. It does not magically sand your callouses in 5 seconds like one would hope. You will have to buy replacement blades &amp; spend time doing each foot over &amp; over as opposed to buffing them in 10 seconds witha pumice stone in your hand. I chose this over the footlogix, I will be trying them next. If it helps anyone else I have 3 other family members male &amp; female who use this and will agree it works but is just time consuming &amp; the rolls wear out faster than you would want if you have rough feet. Dry brush!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.  I plan on buying another for a friend as a gift for her birthday.</li>
            <li> The Micro-pedi Callus Remover by Emjoi really works when nothing else did a good job. We recommend it to anyone with thick calluses on their feet who would like to have smooth feet again.</li>
            <li> This is the only device that has worked to remove calluses quickly the way they said it would! I have smooth feet again  that I haven&#x27;t had in years! I wear sandals most of the time so my feet get dried out easily. This sands down the dead skin gradually without applying pressure. I got the green rollers at the same time and they do a faster job. Definitely worth the money and better than the callus remover gel at the salon!</li>
            <li> it works so so, !! go have them done much simpler</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product to take off the rough edges.  Makes me feel better about my feet cause I wear sandals all summer.  I still get pedicures and nothing takes the place of those but in between, this does wonders.  I tried 3 others of this type and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> love it...... i now have baby soft heels and it doesnt take forever and its better than shaving my heels with&lt;br /&gt;the razor they use in the salon. love it!</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to use and does the job!!! My feet look and feel so soft!!</li>
            <li> It removes the bunions easily without cutting, as much at a time as I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> This works great!  I&#x27;m always barefoot and this keeps my feet looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> I use this thing all the time. I was in an accident as a child which left me with lost of car tissue on the bottom of one of my feet. Before I go tthis, I don&#x27;t know how I was able to walk! I haven&#x27;t felt my foot as smooth in my entire life! I use it on myself and my boyfriend when he gets callouses around his heels from his work boots. He is also addicted, he calls it a belt sander.</li>
            <li> Oh how I wished I had had this callus remover long ago.  Clever design, easy to use, effective dry skin removal.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Does a great job.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It really works well and no batteries needed!</li>
            <li> This is awesome since it is electric and it works so much better and faster....love it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me knowing how many products I&#x27;ve tried to resolve the issue of cracking skin and dense callouses on my feet.  With the first use, I actually had touchable, smooth feet.  Use it gingerly until you get used to the affect of the sanding.  The extra coarse sanding roller on high speed  was sufficient to eradicate the built up skin on the heels, the ridge atop the ball of the foot, and the side of the ball. The same sanding roller on low speed buffed off the tags of skin on the soles, smoothed the ends of my toes near the nails, and the top and sides of my feet. The shape of the unit is comfortable to hold and easily maneuvered. Though I haven&#x27;t yet needed to replace the sander it is an easy process. Press a button down and the sanding roller pops out for disposal; insert new roller. His research on similar items led him away from the battery operated units and to this corded unit because of the lessor RPMs of the battery powered units. The Emjoi does a great job in very little time, is tough on the callouses but gentle enough that I&#x27;ve used it every other day since receiving it. Though the instructions specifically state &amp;#34;for use on feet only&amp;#34; I did VERY CAREFULLY and on LOW speed use it on my fingers near the nail edges where I have callous build-up and the skin splits as the nails grow out. Worked like a charm! I am extremely pleased with it; would I recommend it to a friend? I already have! In fact, I even recommended it to my physician as she was impressed with the condition of my feet.</li>
            <li> it works so well! It removed lots of gross stuff! ;)&lt;br /&gt;However, you need to put on a good layer of lotion after that, otherwise, your skin will become rough again soon.</li>
            <li> It works very, very, well.  I had another brand which has worn out.  This product is so much more effective! So happy to have electric instead of battery operated. I also am extremely happy with the prompt, efficient and courteous service from SHAVENOW, the company I purchased from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for about 3-4 weeks now, and still feel the same.  My rollers are holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> I love the Micro Pedi. I use it on my heels to remove callus and it makes them so soft and smooth. .&lt;br /&gt;I feel so confident wearing sandals because my feet look great. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very powerful little sander. I&#x27;m very happy I opted for the corded version. It works great. Replacement tubes are kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> This is Awsome. No more blades, files,pumice stones. Takes me 5 min. per foot every 2-3 days to keep my feet (and elbows) soft &amp; smooth. Took 1/2 hour each first time. Used to take daily workout to approach results I get now. Blue coarse &amp; purple for me. Lasts about a month per roller.</li>
            <li> We love our Emjoi!! Baby smooth feet in minutes! Easy and painless. So very happy with this purchase, and will save money on pedicures!</li>
            <li> Not aggresive, take your time and wow it really does the job.Cream up and repeat occasionally and soon your feet will be in great condition.</li>
            <li> Husband needed something to help with calluses and this is GREAT! He used my smaller version but felt the power was lacking for his needs...this one did the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the cordless/rechargeable model for about 2 years now and rave about it as well as recommended it many relatives and friends.  But...batteries only last so long!!  The corded model is perfect!  Consistent power along with the right rollers gets the job done painlessly and quickly!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
            <li> For anyone with dry, cracked, calloused, and/or peeling feet, this product is AWESOME! I had the battery-powered one previously and it gave out after a few months, but I liked it well enough while it lasted to buy another - this time with the wall plug so hopefully it&#x27;ll be around longer! (Usually if something doesn&#x27;t last long, I don&#x27;t care how great it was, I wouldn&#x27;t rate it well, but this product just works so perfectly for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet (mostly the heels) aren&#x27;t severely dry or cracked, but I live in Hawaii and wear sandals majority of the time, so I imagine my feet are exposed and take more of a beating that people who mostly wear shoes and socks. Since my heels are usually showing, I want them to look pretty. This little tool works fast and is very easy to use. Since I waited awhile I buy it, my heels were worse than usual now, so I&#x27;ll probably need a few sessions (and lots of lotion!) to get them in in good condition again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip - I try and soak my feet for a few minutes in warm water first, then dry them off, use the micro-pedi (not for too long though, or it gets a little sore), then apply lotion and socks. In the morning my feet are SUPER soft. For me, this product works much better than the ped-egg, pumice stones, or any other manual devices that I&#x27;ve tried over the years. It&#x27;s not cheap, but I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I never really do reviews but I am just so disappointed with this product, I do have hard callus but this product doesn&#x27;t really do anything except buffing. it doesn&#x27;t remove callus, only makes the surface a bit smoother but the thickness of the callus is not eliminated. very disappointed... I wish I could just return it otherwise I am just gonna use it as a finishing buff after callus shaver like the other user does.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this for a long time and did notmdisappoint me. You just have to be soft touch to baby just skin and not dig a hole that can cause a scar or infected skin. Be carefully with loose skin will pitch it a little bit but, more a scare than an actual harm. Again it works very well for me and I can wait to order the more coarse stones, my feet get really ruff and this beauty tool leave my skin like baby&#x27;s behind. Thank Amazon for carry so many quality things and be always a trusted site.</li>
            <li> I tried a rechargeable callus remover and it was horrible! It lasted only 2 charges then died. I debated and read reviews for several months before buying this one. I love it! You must not think your crusty heels will look beautiful with one use. It took months or years to get crusty and it will take several uses to get un-crusty. I use it longer than the directions say with no problem but if I use it too long in one spot it is red and sore the next day so you must pay mind to this. I also use the extra extra course rollers (the green ones) because I let my heals go to almost crusty. Use it a couple of times a week to get into shape then weekly or 2 weeks for maintenance. It really gets the job done and is far far better than a battery powered or rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualms with this sander are: 1 - I wish the top were completely open and you had more than a side open to use 2 - the sanding roller does not fit tightly and if I don&#x27;t tape the end to the base it rattles like crazy and is very irritating 3 - the cord should be at least 2+ feet longer..</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME!!! Wish the cord was longer but I love this thing!</li>
            <li> This is great for travel and light foot up keep.</li>
            <li> This one is awesome!!  Tried the battery operated ones and they have a tendency to slow down.  Not this little gem!  Like having a few different options for rollers too.  Highly recommend this corded one over the battery operated callous removers.</li>
            <li> works great just don&#x27;t go to far and hit raw meat,then it can hurt like hell the next day or so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spare you the details on how bad my feet are...but now I have this super powerful callus remover my feet are not so hideous anymore.</li>
            <li> The product performs as manufacturer and reviews have stated.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and very effective. I ordered this product and supplier emailed me right away informing me that this  edition was out of stock but, not wanting me to have to wait for back orders, they upgraded my order to a more expensive model at no additional charge. Product arrived quickly. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works easily</li>
            <li> Same power as battery operated. I have the battery version of this.  I decided to upgrade to the corded version as it is described as being more powerful.  It isn&#x27;t.  Just more expensive.  I feel the description is misleading because this has an internal battery source powered by the cord.  It isn&#x27;t a hard wire device therefore it isn&#x27;t any more powerful than the battery operated one.  You will save money on batteries, but not worth the double price.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo works quite well.  It is really an easy way to get rid of calluses.  Sure beats using a pumice stone!</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS THE SHIZZLE!  Corded is the way to go!  Skanky heels be gone!</li>
            <li> It is the fourth different type of sole and heals care machine. It is the first non-intrusive, easy to work-it-out into my dry skin, and, really affordable. I bought the battery opperated version, as well, based on this experience.</li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;like other reviewers said, this product is amazing. it made my feet feel like new.&lt;br /&gt;Just be cautious and don&#x27;t over do it like i did. I tried to get rid of all my calluses in one session and my feet hurt a little.&lt;br /&gt;I used the green rollers and got amazing results and went a little overboard.&lt;br /&gt;Next time i&#x27;ll use the green rollers a little and then finish with the blue (included) ones. Greens should also be included i think.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very impressed after one session.</li>
            <li> I get small calluses on my little toes and this is the perfect tool to smooth those calluses.  It also works wonders on heels.  This callus remover does a better job than the person who gives me my pedicures.  It is hands down the best way to remove calluses.  I will never use callus remover with a razor again! I use the super course rollers rather than the ones that come with the unit.  The rollers last a long time.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is much better than using a pumice stone or a pedi-egg (less work and easier to get precise results).  It&#x27;s nearly impossible to over-do-it as you have complete control over where you&#x27;re trimming and you can feel when the calluses are gone (not always so with a pedi-egg or a pumice stone).  The power is just right and the rollers are replaceable so this will last for years.</li>
            <li> This gadget does what others have promised to do and failed.  The Micro-ped removes dead skin and calluses, leaving your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday to keep my feet soft.</li>
            <li> Happy that I got this machine rather than the battery operated option.  It cost a little more, but the trade off is not having to replace batteries EVER!  I also imagine this corded version would be more powerful.  My only suggestion would be to swap out the blue buffing pad with the green (extreme coarse) pads.  They work much better and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and gently</li>
            <li> Wow, no more scrubbing!  It&#x27;s powerful just like it says and I&#x27;m really glad I chose to get the one with the cord instead of batteries.  My feet are the smoothest they&#x27;ve ever been.  Scrubbers can&#x27;t get the job done anywhere near what this thing can do, and I can do it totally dry on the fly.</li>
            <li> I have. Some extremely calloused feet, nasty stuff. Was scraping with fingernails, using scissors, and pumice stone to try and keep my feet from breaking open. Callous would cause skin to stretch and split. This thing works great at grinding the callouses down and keeping my feet from bleeding. Got the corded one for more, steady power. I&#x27;ve already gone through four cylinders.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I wish I had found it earlier. I would suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Emjoi 2 speed electric is highly recommended. Wife &amp; I have been pleased w/feet having been able to get constancy (without batteries). I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll come to rely on this comfortable,  easy to handle tool for years to come ! Keeping rollers clear with a tooth brush was a good tip of another reviewer BTW. Guys &amp; Gals all need happy feet ! Thanks again Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Not really excited about this product...wished I had bought the other one which looks like a &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; as you can probably flip that one around.  this one only has one side to it and it&#x27;s awkward to me.  You can only use that one side as the other side is blocked.  It gets the job done but don&#x27;t feel that the 1 or 2 speed gauge has any noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> Really impressed how well this works.  Very quick and easy to use.  Used it for both myself and my husband.  He has never done anything to his feet, so you can imagine the buildup of calluses.  Easy to use, and does not hurt.</li>
            <li> Worked well however i think that the replacments could become costly just my opinion but in terms of performance found it easy enough to use and pretty fast made a huge difference</li>
            <li> I was counting on the good reviews and thought it would do the job. It took me forever and even then it wasn&#x27;t good enough. not to mention that you need to keep buying the rolls when they wear out. and they wore out after the first use !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this i bought the &amp;#34;Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp Brown&amp;#34; - It&#x27;s amazing and takes seconds to see great results, plus you don&#x27;t need electricity or batteries. I wish i&#x27;d seen it before buying the micro-pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a huge favoure buy the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp instead - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The machine worked exactly as described, my only negative was the surprise I got to be sent a further bill for import duty, VAT and quite expensive handling fees. Would not order again from an American supplier</li>
            <li> What can I say, other than the fact this thing is great! It&#x27;s no going to make your feet perfect but boy your feet will be smooth. I still have the white crack lines that I hope moisturizer will take care of but this is something that will make your feet feel good to the touch.</li>
            <li> My feet have never been completely callus free and so smooth until now and I have tried many products including regular pedicures.  I am thrilled with this product!!</li>
            <li> I have always had very thick calluses on my feet and decided to give this device a try. I am amazed at the results!  It is effortless to use and gets rid of the calluses within minutes and is very easy to use. I use it about 2 times per week to keep the calluses and dry skin at bay, apply some lotion and my feet are very soft and feel so much better.  I highly recommend this product. I got one for my daughter and she loves it too. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, it really does work.</li>
            <li> this item is good for minor skin removal but it stops when pressure is applied&lt;br /&gt;but it looks the same as in the picture</li>
            <li> I was completely happy with this product.  It made quick work on all the rough spots on my feet.  Just remember when using the Emjoi, don&#x27;t press too hard and keep it in motion.  I&#x27;m glad I chose the corded model.  No sense in eating up batteries when you don&#x27;t have to.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This baby spins. It&#x27;s kinda of like using finishing sandpaper on wood - it makes the surface smooth and silky.  At first I considered the battery operated model but after research and further thought, the electric one made more sense because it would have continuous and even power and not need to have batteries replaced. So, the slightly higher price of the electric model was offset by the cost of future batteries. Now, it&#x27;s even fun to pretty up my feet, if that is even possible on old feet that have worn too many high heels and flip flops - and the finished product is a lot better.  Update a couple of years later:  still using this baby and it&#x27;s going strong. My feet are lovely which is saying something for a person who primarily wears flip flops and clogs.</li>
            <li> the on/off switch is difficult to use, dont buy if u are arthritic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; i can see that the real money is poured into the replacement rollers</li>
            <li> I love this...it plugs into the wall and keeps the same speed without loosing power...it works really good and you can see the dead skin ( not a pretty site)..would recommend this to all..my feet have scales and dry patches but no cracks in the heal. Some of my toes are scaley too...the proof is my couch...I can feel the pulls and tugs on my feet when I rub my foot on a cushion...after my pedi its smooth so this works great..wish the handle was longer but that&#x27;s it.. Luv it</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this micro pedi when I ordered it, even after all the great reviews. But I decided to try it because I have tried everything else for my dry skin heels. I was blown away at how well this tool worked. I have used it 2 times now and see a huge difference in both feet. It doesn&#x27;t need much pressure to quickly remove layers of dry skin. I am glad I went with the corded one so I don&#x27;t have the worry of using up batteries plus this has a high &amp; low speed. I may get daughter in law one for Christmas gift. Love it !!!</li>
            <li> I really like this little gadget.  It works well at removing dead skin from heels.  I will have to use it several times over several weeks to remove my very thick calluses.  I have deep cracks that are sore.  I&#x27;m a work in progress.  I&#x27;m a diabetic and I&#x27;m not concerned about cutting myself with this, as long as you stay away from your toenails, it&#x27;s not for that.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars if it had a little more power. But it was good and did the job. I also used it to file my finger nails and the course skin on the top part of my fingers and it worked well. I used it for about ten minutes the first time. Under no circumstances get the battery powered one, the batteries would not last long and it would not be powerful enough. It has two speeds which is nice. I used the high speed most of the time. The device is smaller than it looks in the picture, but I do recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Power cord is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I LOVE his product, have tried almost everything on market to reduce heel cracks on my feet. This is AWESOME and heels feel like baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Holy Cramoli!!  I have been embarrassed by my feet for so many years.  My grandchildren would constantly ask me what was wrong with my feet and I have never been able to wear open sandals.  This thing is really amazing.  I thought twice about spending that much money but it is definitely worth it, and with the plug in capability I know the power is never going to run out.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new Emjoi Micro-pedi Callus Remover.  Excellent with just the coarse roller.  I will enroll in the micro-pedi club to get my replacement rollers.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this do a great job of smoothing out foot calluses, but itâs also very comfortable to hold.  Because itâs described as a Nano, I was afraid it would be overly small but it isnât.  I opted for this corded version because I wanted consistent power and also didn&#x27;t want to keep buying batteries. The cord is a generous 6-feet, rare today when skimpy ones are often the norm. The two speeds are a plus, and it even comes with a storage bag.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like the emoji but it just isn&#x27;t very effective for the amount of money it costs. Maybe if you have super sensitive princess feet it will work for you.  But if you&#x27;re a normal person with rough heels, it&#x27;s just too weak.  Save your money and buy one of those foot shaped emery boards at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for about $2. They&#x27;re 10x better.</li>
            <li> Five-star product ... I used it for my husband and he was amazed to see and feel how smooth his feet were. It&#x27;s really amazing and I recommend it 100% !  Amazing !</li>
            <li> Magnificent! Transformed my Viet Nam Veteran Crusted Paws into Human Feet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of electric and manual foot filers, emory boards, etc., and none of them worked near as well as this.  It has a wide enough head to cover larger areas than most pedicure tools, and works continuously and effortlessly.  You don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure because it gently takes the dead skin off your foot without any effort at all.  It works wonders on my heels as well as any calluses.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8-12-17:&lt;br /&gt;My Emjoi quit working all of a sudden so I wrote Shave Now to see if I had any kind of warranty left.  No questions asked and 5 days later I have a brand new replacement!  Now that&#x27;s EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! I still highly recommend the Emjoi AND this great company!</li>
            <li> Wow this product really works. I like having the plug in versus batteries or rechargeable. Never lose power.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! I have the typical exerciser feet. Nothing until this product helped beautify my fret until I purchased this product. Easy to use and results after the first time. You won&#x27;t be disappointed .</li>
            <li> Product was horribleâ¦ Once applied to the foot the motor would stop.. Item was defective from the start with no power. Has to be plugged in at all times. Seller does not stand behind return policy and charges you even for defective items. I had to pay to ship it back to the seller.</li>
            <li> Kudos I love this!!!  It works GREAT.  I like that it is ELECTRIC.  My feet feel like FEATHERS.  Rubbing and messaging my feet is now a definite Honey Do!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with this corded version of the Emjoi Nano Micro-Pedi. Using their most coarse roller (Xtreme Coarse) I am able with several passes to get extremely thick dry skin off the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately don&#x27;t have the corded one.  Mine works on batteries which are not cheap but they last a little while.  This really helps keep the calluses to a minimum.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of them completely but it probably would if I used it more often.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well. Hard to get into the smaller spots, but it a small little machine so it&#x27;s handy. I would still recommend but would recommend getting a more corse roller, the one it comes with is not very corse.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING. It can do in 5 minutes what a ped-egg can do in an hour of scrubbing. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I just used it and I still like it.</li>
            <li> No more batteries and works just the same.</li>
            <li> I like it not that powerful same as the battery operated one, I bought both. It does turn your callus&#x27;s to dust.</li>
            <li> IT........REALLLLLY .........WORKSSSSSsssssss  Truly, I&#x27;ve tried different things this is THE answer.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> A very great product. I purchased the one with the cord as I had tough skin and callouses so I knew I needed more time to work on them. It is very handy and just right for a female had to get those tough parts. Is is simple and easy to use. Comes with the blue roller. I bought the Xtreme Coasre rollers additional for tough skin. It does the job better than any pedicure and any slicing equipment or brushes. I clean it with some hot water and some antiseptic alcohol solution. I would recommend this to all women. It is a great tool for maintaining your feet and a bonus is that your feet shine so nice and pretty when you&#x27;re done with your treatment. When using the first time one tough skin, callous and especially cracks please be patient and don&#x27;t get discouraged. The first use takes a bit long because it has to break through all that tough and hardened skin. Afterwards all you have to do is maintenance here and there every week or two. I would recommend you buy the  GENUINE Micro Pedi Xtreme Coarse Rollers for tough skin and tough callouses. PLease note when you purchase the rollers to buy the GENUINE one. Enjoy ladies !</li>
            <li> my heels are so bad that when I go for a pedicure they sneak in bringing out the razors! This product is the most amazing thing in the world it&#x27;s better than sliced bread!</li>
            <li> Love this product - feet are pretty and smoother.  Would highly recommend to anyone!  Priced right as well - better than battery operated model - so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is much more powerful than battery powered callus removers. I purchased several sets of rollers as it only come with one roller. This is a must have for removing dry/callused skin on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works well, but you have to moisturize after you use it or it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Works very well, just a light touch does it.  After using it I apply A &amp; D ointment at night and wear socks to bed&lt;br /&gt;My feet feel soooo much better now.  Take several days of using this gradually and applying ointment, within a week&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll see a great difference to the looks and to the feel of your feet.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of crusty feet that would snag on the sheets and anything that was knit.  Wearing sandals was out of the question and winter only made my feet worse.  I bought this think well I am willing to try anything.  The first day I tried it when I got out of the shower and there was some improvement but I didn&#x27;t want to over do it.  The second day I tried it again right out of the shower (dried my feet first) and used U-Lactin lotion after then even more improvement.  The third day, I went for it.  My feet were dry and not just out of the shower.  I used the machine until I could feel only smoothness on my feet.  If I felt an area that was still rough, I went over it until it was smooth.  This took a while maybe 15-25 minutes.  I wasn&#x27;t scared of going to far with it because as long as there is roughness the area was protected.  The corded model ensured that I would not run out of power and that was a great bonus.  After using it, I applied alot of the U-Lactin lotion.  Next day, my feet are as smooth as when I was a young girl.  I am going around telling everyone feel my feet (not weird...LOL!).</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous.  2 speeds and removes callouses in a couple of minutes or less!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again or give as a gift!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this thing worked. My calluses are smoothed out in a jiffy. I should use it more often.</li>
            <li> best product for pedicure treatment</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!!  My feet are very dry and had rough dry skin, which this product has nearly eliminated. Now my feet do not wreck my stockings. The only suggestion I have is to have several different callus rollers for the product in a finer one and a coarser one for harder more callus skin. This has made my feet feel so much better. I did buy this model because you can plug it in to an outlet and I don&#x27;t have to worry about being out of batteries.</li>
            <li> i thought &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; yeah won&#x27;t work that great.  But after just one use that dead skin came off without any pressure.  It says use 3 seconds, well i need like 20 seconds, but other than that, it does what it says.  I opted for the corded one because I&#x27;m tired of using batteries all the time, and i had seen where the corded one was more powerful, which made sense.  It comes with a travelling pouch as well.</li>
            <li> where has this been when i was sharp blades to get the callus removed</li>
            <li> Paired with the IVog extra buff, extra coarse chrome rollers I no longer have to visit the spa bi-weekley.This is the best invention since sliced bread.!!</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will get smooth heels.  Very quick, efficient and helps keep your feet smooth between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, it really does work great. It&#x27;s effectively a tiny drum sander. It&#x27;s pretty underpowered, so you need to use a light touch. But, even then, it removes even thick callus quickly. My main objection is that the sanding cylinders are pretty expensive for what they are, and they don&#x27;t last long if you&#x27;re going through thick stuff. But, it&#x27;s a sanding drum. A little experimentation with a small screwdriver and some sandpaper sheets, presto, infinite life from one cylinder. I used open-coat 120 grit, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, now seeing what it does, just pull out your orbital sander. :)</li>
            <li> easy to use. Does what it says.gets the calluses off your feet quickly. No need for costly pedicures anymore. Great</li>
            <li> This plug in is far better then the basttery one - it does not die down and the cord is well over 4&#x27; so it&#x27;s convenient anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week and use a good foot balm after - Voila!  Beautiful feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet have never looked better and I am finally happy about wearing sandals.</li>
            <li> Great purchase - I am so happy with it. I use this often &amp; it makes my feet look better much more quickly &amp; easily than using a file or anything else.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life!!!  I have been fighting calluses and roughness on my feet for years.  Two treatments with this Emjoi micro pedi has solved my problem.  The customer care department at Shave Now was wonderful when I contacted them regarding receiving a model of micro pedi that I did not order.  Even though the glitch was with Amazon and not them, they shipped a new model to me at no cost and let me keep the one that was sent in error.  Five stars to them and their product!!  They also offer a refill program for a lower cost than you can find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This buffer was just what I was looking for. It is simple to use and buffers rough spots on the feet smoothly.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toy.  It actually makes me sad that it does the job so quickly.  Put a towel underneath it to catch all the dead skin it will take off. It&#x27;s better than a weekend at the beach...well, not really, but it makes your feet look that good.</li>
            <li> love using this, works fast and does a good job</li>
            <li> WOW!  Tried it within minutes of receiving it and it was even better than I expected!!!!  It only took a minute to get the smoothest heels ever!!!!!  I&#x27;m thrilled.  For the first time (outside of the salon) I have smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually shaves down calluses without hurting.  I&#x27;ve tried Epsom salts, kerasal, metal scrapers, my fingernails, etc., and nothing has made a dent in the calluses on the sides of my big toes, and the balls of the feet under the big toes.  In a couple of minutes using this Emjoi a couple days in a row (did not want to overdo), the calluses were gone and the skin was smooth.  There was no pain or discomfort involved.  I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last without needing to be changed, but I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t much care with results like this.  It seems pretty powerful to me, the cord is much better than batteries.  I definitely recommend for anyone looking to finally smooth their feet.</li>
            <li> Love this it&#x27;s the best way to get rid of cruddy callouses my feet haven&#x27;t felt this great in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;As I was using a pumice stones.</li>
            <li> I love this Emjoi product, I immediately took it out the package and started working on my feet and it works tremendous removing all of my dead skin ..  I am a mail lady and constantly need to use this weekly and as of today my feet feel like a babies bottom ... I highly recommend this product to any anyone who has problems with callus feet.</li>
            <li> It really works! Looks almost after I get a pedicure. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This callus remover is great.  Much more powerful than the battery one I already had.  I really like how it works and only wish I&#x27;d gotten some spare inserts.  You can was them off, but I sorta wish I had new ones too!</li>
            <li> Great product although small and a little flimsy.  I suggest the electric over battery operated.  Not that powerful; perhaps I&#x27;m used to power tools.  But it does get the job done.  I have some smooth, soft feet.  But this time, with less effort.  Very easy to go over your feet once a day or whenever need, then smooth on some of your favorite foot cream or lotion.  You&#x27;ll notice the difference almost immediately.  If this one ever goes bad, I&#x27;ll just order another one.</li>
            <li> Pretty powerful for the price--I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing much, as I couldn&#x27;t really feel it--but it made a big difference in just one use.  Because of the size and shape, it&#x27;s really great at getting into that area right where the big toe joins the foot, and it really does polish away thick deadened skin (gross, sorry).  I will probably continue to use my Ansr Sole on my heels, but this little tool is fantastic for the built-up calluses on the balls of my feet that the Ansr didn&#x27;t really help, for a great price.</li>
            <li> This broke the third time I used it -- and yes, I followed the directions. It simply stopped working. Will never buy Emjoi again.</li>
            <li> I use it for sanding my hands. Excellent job! Peels dead skin right off. I remove the drum and clean it under water. I had doubts about this device, but It fooled me. I loved it!</li>
            <li> Very effective. Like that it has a cord rather than batteries. Gets rid of callouses easily. Wish refill rollers cost a bit less.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I always have calluses on my heels and have tried other devices and they weren&#x27;t very powerful. This one really doesn&#x27;t either. If you put any pressure on it, it slows down. It works but takes a long time.</li>
            <li> This is now my primary tool for eliminating calluses.  I have better things to do than spend my time primping and this gets the job done.  Very pleased with the power and effective end result.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best callus remover I have ever used.  The corded option keeps it from going dead or even loosing power.  It does a fantastic job of smoothing out a callus, too.</li>
            <li> This little machine is awesome. I was skeptical before it arrived even though it has great reviews. It really does work great. Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> OMG! Glad my search is over for a pedi device. Had a little callus on the outside of my foot from flip flops. It was gone in about 30 seconds at the most. I bought a  coarse roller, but really didn&#x27;t it need it. Good to have if you have major calluses.Went lightly over the soles of my feet and then applied a foot night cream. So soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think they should put ridges on the power/speed switch for easier activation.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect but you must follow few simply steps- use it only on a very dry skin- works perfect, do not press against skin when in use otherwise it will not work. Brush the roll from time to time when in use.</li>
            <li> I love this item and highly recommend purchasing it.  I have bunions and it would take up to 15 minutes sometimes to rub my bunions smooth.  It takes about 2 minutes to rub the bunions smooth with the Micor Pedi Callus Remover.  My bunions are totally smooth for several days and before the Micro Pedi the next day the bunions were hard and rough again.&lt;br /&gt;chh</li>
            <li> This little tool is absolutely wonderful!  It removes my rough heels and leaves them smooth as silk.  My husband is benefitting from it too as I use it on his calluses.  I plan on ordering more for Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> It works ok but the roughness returns in a day or two</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the roller is going to last as long as I thought it would based on other reviews, but the machine itself is great! Just will need to order replacement rollers sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little device that has helped my feet become smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  I used this for the first time and was amazed at how easy it is to use.  I have used the pumice stone and the grater on my feet for years and was always seeking a better way to get amazingly soft and smooth heels.  I even tried the listerine method to no avail.  I decided to try this product since Costco was selling the battery operated version - and we all know that Costco sells only the best!  Needless to say, I am well pleased with the results of this little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband suffers greatly with calloused and chapped hands this time of year.  Whenever he would touch fabric you could hear the callouses scratching the fabric.  I used the machine on his hands and he is also amazed how smooth and soft his hands have become.  You do need to be very careful when using the Emjoi that you keep the machine moving and at 2-3second intervals for the best result.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this for amazing soft, smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first with it until I really put some time in with it. After I did that, I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it ever since. I don&#x27;t see recommending the rechargeable or the battery operated one tho. Continuous power is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! It does what it is meant to do. This Callus remover is gentle and it&#x27;s super easy to use, it&#x27;s just a breeze! This product should work for anyone you just have to choose the right refills for your machine and of course for the condition of your calluses. Great solution when you can&#x27;t get to nail shop and or afford a pedicure.</li>
            <li> This item is just ok - let me put it this way - since I have it I will keep it and use it but if anything ever happened to it- I wouldn&#x27;t replace it - had I used someone elses 1st I never would have given more than 20 bucks for it. I get a pedicure every 2-3 weeks and this does help keep my feet smoother for longer using it 2 times a week - but will it take someone who has neglected feet with layers and layers of dead skin and calluses and get them soft and smooth like the picture - absolutely not - at least not without going through tons of rollers which would not be cost effective.  this item would be a decent value at 20 bucks especially considering the cost of the rollers - is it worth 50? not to me. I think emoji has spent more effort on marketing and branding themselves than they have on making quality products and I feel that this brand in particular has tons of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> The best Callus remover ever.  Have used others that just don&#x27;t due the job.  This has more power since it is electric and not battery operated.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, allows me more time between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Would buy the one without the cord, I think it would be more convenient. But really like the results you get with this.</li>
            <li> This is a great invention to shave the dead skin off the bottom of the feet. I worked better than I expected. I would buy this item again and again for family and friends. In just 10 minutes my feet were as smooth as they had been in all the years of going to the nail salon for pedicures. I real money saver..!!!</li>
            <li> After neglecting my feet over the winter and with spring (and cute sandals) right around the corner, I knew I had to up my game.  I was a pretty devoted Ped Egg user for several years.  There is nothing wrong with the Ped Egg, but I needed something stronger that could whip my feet into shape.  After reading many reviews for callus removers, I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to go for it.  I definitely recommend spending the extra money for the corded version (vs. battery operated).  I could be wrong, but I am guessing I would go through a lot of batteries before I achieved smooth and callus-free feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord was long enough for my needs.  It did sand away the hard, dried skin on my feet very quickly. I worked on my feet 3 consecutive days to get them to the point of satisfaction.  I didn&#x27;t want to do too much the first day for fear I would go overboard and be in pain if went too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchase refill heads, I will buy a coarser grain to get them REALLY smooth.  The finer grade (the one that is included) worked well, but I feel like it is more appropriate for finishing/buffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to friends/family.</li>
            <li> I have terrible feet, and have tried everything, including the Ped Egg and lots of files and creams.  The Micro Pedi is fabulous. I also read the reviews for this, and regardless of some of the complaints, am very happy that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the corded version, and it works really, really well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  People have commented that if you push too hard it stops the rotation, but you don&#x27;t need to push very hard to make it work.  Hold it lightly and it gets the job done.  And the actual callus removers last a long time.  I clean mine afterwards with an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order a couple of other grades of the tubes, and although the regular ones did a fine job, the extra abrasive ones help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is corded because I think it is more powerful and it won&#x27;t run down the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used the battery Emjoi which I really like but the plug in version is awesome. Constant power and no need to worry about power loss as with the battery model. I take one with me when I travel and keep one at home. Very good product!</li>
            <li> I also have a battery powered Emjoi, which I love, but this one works even better. Really smooths out rough and cracking feet. Definitely well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t had one of these until now.  My feet are so soft and smooth all the time.  No tough callused feet, no cracked heels.  Love love love it.</li>
            <li> Just received my enjoy callous remover and it definitely lives up to the anticipation and all the great reviews.  It is GREAT!!  I tried everything and nothing worked.  The pedi egg comes in a distant second place.  This is fantastic.  So glad I got the rechargeable one.  I hate dealing with batteries.  Love love love this product!!  Will be recommending this to people I know.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, calloused feet with multiple cracks on the heels.  This works very well for smoothing my feet and heels. Very easy to use and gentle.</li>
            <li> Great product. This corded product works great and the sanding discs last a really long time. Very please I got this one.</li>
            <li> Much more effective than other methods I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very effective at removing nasty callouses.  Works better than I anticipated.  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, as an alternative to my current pumice stone. I found it to be very disappointing with minimal results.  Maybe it is effective for persons who routinely receive professional pedicures and their feet are in pretty great shape to begin with.  I have calluses, this only took off the superficial first layer. I did not find this device \\&quot;powerful.\\&quot;  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!  Works great, no more batteries and much more powerful than a battery operated one.</li>
            <li> I am veery pleased with the performance and ease of handling this product.  Would reccomenf to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for to remove callouses on my hands from doing Crossfit.  This device is like a mini sander and removes the callous layer by layer.......I used the blue roller and it did a nice job albeit a little awkward to use between my palm and finger area-just need to hold the device parallel with your hand to get at the callous.  I will try the more course rollers and see if that does the job faster.  It will be nice to have soft, feminine hands again!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> No longer need callus remover when I get a pedicure. In fact, they don&#x27;t even ask if I want it. My feet are that smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she sometimes suffers from hard skin on the heels. She has used it once so far and rates it very highly.  Easy to use and left her feet feeling much better.</li>
            <li> My nail tech does pedicures, too, and once I showed it to her and she tried it, she was sold!  I have had to order for several people or give them the website.  Gave my daughter one for Xmas and she said it was her favorite gift.</li>
            <li> My bare feet felt like Velcro on the carpet.  Now, they&#x27;re so smooth!  It takes mantainance, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and this works so much better than a pumice stone.  I purchased this one because it is corded and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery running down.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I do not have to change batteries every other time I use it, and it has sufficient power to get the job done.</li>
            <li> LOVEâ¤ï¸ LOVE â¤ï¸LOVEâ¤ï¸Wish I had this years ago! BEST foot product ever!!!! Highly recommend!!!! ððð</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy on the feet. Removed calluses as suggested.</li>
            <li> Surpassed my expectations &amp; even bought a 2nd one for my husband.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully!  I can&#x27;t believe how smooth it makes my feet feel.</li>
            <li> I have one callus to remove from the ball of my left foot. If I had ALL day I might get it done! Don&#x27;t let the power cord fool you........it has NO more power than something battery operated.</li>
            <li> Does the Job.  Saves lots of work with an emery stone.  Be careful tho as it goes fast.</li>
            <li> World much better than other similar products. Have tried manual products as well as the pedi spin. The pedi spin was pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> a sand block works faster</li>
            <li> I brought this Corded Micro-pedi Callus Remover by Emjoi for my wife last year and she is still happy with it. I recommend the corded over the battery one, which is more powerful. Also I purchased at the same time extra Genuine Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers. But as of now my wife has not needed to replace the old one. Happy Wife Happy Life !!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any one who would rather use this than pay for a monthly pedicure. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> My feet have some fairly deep cracks.  I&#x27;d say this is doing the job fine.  It took a few times, but i think it is far easier than trying to do it manually.</li>
            <li> This product does what it advertises.  I have heavy calluses on my feet and get spa pedicures every three weeks.  This does a better job than the salon does when it comes to callus removal. This is not my first Emjoi product and I&#x27;ve been satisfied each time. My husband also uses the Emjoi for calluses.  I would recommend this product to any woman who loves soft and pretty feet and to any man who likes the comfort of callus-free feet.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I have tried everything else and I am very happy with this.  I threw everything else away including ped eggs!</li>
            <li> I love this callus remover.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate. If your feet are thick with calluses you need this now. The device is easy to use. Just spread a towel on your lap, turn your heel up so you can see it and press the device lightly to the skin. You may need a mirror if you can&#x27;t see the underside. It&#x27;s like a miracle watching the thick skin melt away. I follow up with some hydrating cream. In my case it&#x27;s currently from Dead Sea Essentials but use any hydrating cream to comfort and soften your feet afterwards. It feels great. I took down about 2/3 of my calluses on my first treatment.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however I wish it would have come with at least one replacement roller.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself.  It worked so well that I bought more as gifts!  The company was very reasonable when I had an issue with one of the Micro Pedi removers.  It wasn&#x27;t a fast response initially, but things did get resolved and I am happy with their response.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by a friend who has one so I ordered it.  It is exceptional, nothing has ever worked better for me, easy to use and does a great job.  Intend to get them as gifts for family at Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have the Emjoi Tornado rechargable, which is a two speed, with a thinner body than the Nano, and is more expensive.  The Nano has a 5 year warranty and the Tornado only has a 1 year warranty.  They both work on the same principle, only the top speed on the Tornado is 47 rather than 30.  I don&#x27;t really notice much difference between the 30 and 47 speed in terms of callus removal.  I suffer from pronated feet making the inside bottom surfaces of my feet prone to development of thick calluses.  I got sick of using a pumice stone daily to try to sand months of callus development.  I&#x27;ve only had my Emjoi for 3 days, and have been using it for about 10 minutes per foot daily and just about have the calluses completely removed.  While not mentioned in the instructions, I have also used the roller for removing calluses on the elbows for removing the thin calluses on my hands.  It works well.  For those who are unhappy about the speed in which calluses are removed, Emjoi also has super coarse rollers.  As a nurse, I would be very careful using the super coarse rollers as I can see that it would be very easy to sand until you are sanding on soft skin rather than calluses.  I have found the blue coarse rollers supplied with my unit to be more than adequate for the purpose with less danger of sanding below calluses.  I&#x27;m going to buy my husband and my mother Nanos for Christmas.  I think they will find them as useful as I do.  These make callus removal not only possible (which I never found using a pumice stone to be unless I was willing to sand for hours at a time), but fast and painless (if the unit is used according to the directions).  I&#x27;m glad that this product was invented as I would often use my Dremel Tool with a fine sanding pad on low speed to electrically sand calluses on my feet (and I use the Dremel Tool and sanding pad for cleaning grills and heavy baked on grease from pans, etc.).  With the Tornado, you run less risk of skin damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dremel grinder on my callouses, which are very thick.  That method is awkward, so I tried this.  All in all, I was surprised by this product.  It could be a little more powerful, but it&#x27;s much better than most.  The life of the roller was disappointing though.  The abrasive was worn smooth after spending 20 minutes on just one foot, even keeping the dust brushed off of it.  I&#x27;d like to see an option for a stone wheel rather than just sandpaper glued to a plastic cylinder.  Maybe I&#x27;ll make my own.</li>
            <li> Thought it was better then it look. Not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  I had another brand battery powered which was still better than using a manual foot scrubber.  But this thing is great and I do not have to keep buying batteries</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  My feet are almost always dry and cracked so treating them well is important, especially as a dancer.  This little baby makes my feet baby soft again in no time.  I loved it so much I brought more as gifts for friends.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife.  She has been using manual callus removers.  She told me this unit works very well, and because this is the corded version, it is powerful, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting weak due to batteries depleting.</li>
            <li> This corded one is more environment friendly than the other battery operated model. And the price is pretty much the same, so I would definitely recommend this model. Works just as well as the other emjoi devices. The performance of the device is dependent on the type of roller you use with it.</li>
            <li> Very weak. It barely shaves off any callous&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s like having a mini pedicure at home.</li>
            <li> Saw this demo&#x27;d on Steven &amp; Chris. It does work and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Tough  skin on my heels and big toes. This thing does the trick!</li>
            <li> Works great...I love it....Worth the $$$</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter. She loved it but use caution with the coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> I have been a life long runner and I have to say, I developed some awful calluses, long and hard won but awful to see. I do Pilates 5 times a week and everyone sees one&#x27;s feet there.  I am elated to say that after trying those awful things that are scary to run across your skin which do little, that this is fabulous.  I had to spend a fair amount of time this first use but wow, almost baby butt smooth.  Can&#x27;t wait to use another time or two and expect my feet to be glorious. After just one use, OMW, what a difference. Those awful calluses are not quite completely gone but nearly. I never would have expected that after just one use.  And the heels are divine.  I bought the corded so I could have constant and continual power without lagging w/battery usage. It is quiet and the color is so to my liking.  I don&#x27;t find the shape all that swell. I think another outline would have fit my hand better but really, not that annoying.  The results say it all. Thanks for a great product. Wish I had purchased it sooner, however, there is so much hype with things, you never can quite believe their claims. In this case, they are spot on.</li>
            <li> Love it.... Got it yesterday...shipped sooner then first stated!  Used it last night and it was fantastic.... I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased... My toes and heels get slightly callused in summer from sandals it using this was a breeze.. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND..GREAT PRICE TOO!!!!</li>
            <li> removes a little of the callus but I had to manually use my pumice and my feet are not bad at all. Against the heel it stops. It is not powerful.... looking to send it back!</li>
            <li> Good powerful little unit to sand down rough callus.  All they need to do to make it a 5 is to design it with a roller pumice stone.  The basic sandpaper roll is fine but is a consumable item that doesn&#x27;t need to be there.</li>
            <li> very nice and powerful. thank you</li>
            <li> Powerful and feet feel  soft when done. Don&#x27;t waste your time on a Battery operated. They cannot last as long as this one and not as powerful</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!! This sounds bizarre, but I liked seeing all the dead skin just flake away as I was using it. My feet feel awesome even after one use. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Finally!!!!  Something that works!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon for $29.95 and it is well worth the price!  I love it!  I used it on my heels for about 2 minutes and they are so smooth.  The dry callous skin has almost all disappeared.  I had cracks in my heels that would get very sore, but this device really does smooth the dry skin away.  During my pedicures, the tech would try to file down the dry skin on my heels, but it never worked for very long.  It came back again in a very short time.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  It really does the job very well!</li>
            <li> love it works as advertised</li>
            <li> Last week I added the Corded Micro-pedi Callus Remover by Emjoi to my wish list on Amazon, planning to purchase it out of my next paycheck.  Meanwhile the price DOUBLED!  Needless to say, I will not be ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I like it. I would definitely try the more coarse rollers when its time to purchase new rollers.</li>
            <li> I got this from my daughter for Christmas (at my request) and just love it! Even though I get pedicures on a monthly basis, my heels have always been dry and crack easily. I&#x27;ve been using a scrubbing device similar to what is used at the salon but it leaves my heels rough and doesn&#x27;t resolve my problem. I also use foot cream every night and put socks on to make things better. Then I saw the Emjoi on TV and was impressed enough to give it a try. I LOVE THIS THING! I use it every few days when needed. Every night I still use foot cream and socks to soften my feet up. They are getting so much better! This device is the best thing I have ever used on my feet and I&#x27;m raving about it. My husband has noticed the difference as well (he doesn&#x27;t need it because his feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t get it)! I live in the south and wear sandals most of the time; therefore, it is important to have decent looking feet when they are exposed all of the time. I can&#x27;t wait for sandal weather! I&#x27;ll still continue pedicures because I love the way they do my toes but I&#x27;ll spread it out a little more.</li>
            <li> Just got, not sure how would work.  So glad, I bought this brand.  Batteries or loss of power.  Used for the first time, and can only say suberb.  Made quite a lot of progress, with my feet, but will not failover night.  Love it.  Use toothbrush to clean file roller.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  I have had very dry calloused feet for many many years and have tried lots of different products.  I do use this regularly and my feet are soft and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper any more.  I highly recommend the corded over the battery veery rsion which I was using - it burns through batteries every 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but felt I had to for this product. This product is awesome! I have runner&#x27;s feet and they are always dry, blistered, and calloused. This callus remover takes off all of that dead stuff. When I&#x27;m done, I use some unrefined shea butter. I liked this so much that I ordered one for my mother&#x27;s birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that say it slows down and has no power...don&#x27;t use so much pressure!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth this makes my heels and feet! It is like a mini belt sander for your feet. Forget expensive pedicures...this will defiantly save you tons of money!</li>
            <li> quick and ez.  I love it.  Much easier than manual method. I would recommend this product to all of you</li>
            <li> It does the job it says it does!!!  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for beautiful feet and smooth soles.</li>
            <li> Since I love Emjoi I thought this would be a no brainer.  My feet aren&#x27;t overly dry, but my boyfriends are so I thought I would give it a test run before I told him about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take off a lot of skin which surprised me because like I said - my feet weren&#x27;t that dry.  The whole process took at least an hour, but I figured it was my first time and when my feet have regular treatments it wont take any longer than 15-20 minutes.  Wrong!  Not only does it take forever to use, but your feet have a scratchy feel to them even after all of the time you&#x27;ve spent trying to make them smooth.  On top of that, if you sit back down to redo your feet and make them soft it only last a few days and they feel like sandpaper when you walk on carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I convinced myself that it was a matter of time before things would turn around and they didn&#x27;t  - it went from bad to worse - the Emjoi is now dead which is probably for the best.  I don&#x27;t feel as though I was too rough with it for it to have died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a product does not have good ratings on amazon I don&#x27;t buy it.  I don&#x27;t understand why this product has good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the brushes, the scrapers, the graters (ped egg?), lotions and pumice. All of these removed very little and required quite a lot of elbow greece (minus the lotion). This callus remover actually works! I spent a bit of time the first go, but the results were immediately noticable. So worth it! Walking barefoot is much more comfortable....</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about buying this even though I read the great reviews.  I looked at all the models and decided on this one because it was corded. I was not that impressed with it until I installed the green rollers (extra course). What a difference!! The green rollers will save you a lot more time and your feet will come out baby soft. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> works good if your feet are already in decent shape.  not for the barefoot person that I am... you will got through many of the &amp;#34;sanders&amp;#34; which will be costly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this.  I had been wanting the emjoi, and decided on the Nano because of its small size.  Very powerful and does an excellent job on calluses and rough cracked heels. My feet are considerably smoother and prettier than they are after a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at its  effectiveness!</li>
            <li> For what your Paing it does the trick handi conveniant.......Lt use&lt;br /&gt;foot care,,, if your going to heavy use this not recommended</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This Micro-Pedi is fantastic! I&#x27;ve had callouses on my feet for years that now are gone. I think I&#x27;ll order some replacement rollers that are even more abrasive to get the toughest areas, and a smoothing roller as well. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have used a few other products like this and so far this has done the best job. Like the corded version because it never loses power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle--I now have smooth, pretty feet instead of rough, dry calloused embarrassments! I bought the corded because I read some reviews that said the battery-operated models could be weak. It was a good choice. I&#x27;ve only used it once, so I don&#x27;t know how long the roller will last, but it worked well this first time. I no longer have to try to scrub off callouses with a pumice stone. Love this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was sure it would work, but it really worked.  It came with a medium attachments I had to order the extra course ones.  It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a great machine. I do want the larger one though, and this one I will use as my travel one.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that it came with additional rollers instead of just one.&lt;br /&gt;But it does exactly as it says it will!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to order it - was not disappointed I literally took it out of the box, plugged it up and used it straight away! Amazing - great for in between pedicures! Very, very, happy!</li>
            <li> This gadget works great.  It made my Alligator feet as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I used the extreme coarse rollers on it.  My daughter tried it also and really liked the results.  I will buy her one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet super smooth.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is this product is a little expensive. Other than that, it works surprisingly well. It is powerful so you can carefully bear down on it without the roller slowing down too much or locking up. My calluses were extreme so it took awhile, but after the first session the maintenance is quick and easy. Follow up with a good moisturizing foot lotion.</li>
            <li> I had to buy the super extra coarse rollers - I&#x27;ve got very rough, dry feet. I&#x27;m not going to say it doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin. It does. But I think I&#x27;d do better with a power sander honestly. I can use this thing for 30-45 minutes and it&#x27;s no better than a $2 foot file from the beauty store.</li>
            <li> Nice product and my husband really loves it; as do I!</li>
            <li> Needs MUCH COARSER sandpaper!  It would take forever to remove tough heel callouses with this.  I have taken to using an orbital sander which works great!</li>
            <li> It works but not as well as manually filing.  The roller is too short. Would be nicer if it was an inch longer so you can get more done with less effort.  I love their hair removal product and was hoping to love this product as well. But I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I tried the product,  I was expecting it to be more powerful, and I was a bit disappointed. I have a callus problem and even though I went over the problem area for over 5 minutes, coming and going back over it, the callus is still there.</li>
            <li> Had to buy the green coarser grinder, but once I changed to these it worked very well, so much so that I bought one for my mother. She is very pleased with the outcome also.</li>
            <li> Very good for hard skin. Light to handle. No batteries so keeps to a steady speed. Nice variety of emery files.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful -- 10 times better than various &amp;#34;battery operated&amp;#34; versions.  Does a great job -- Excellent investment!!  Buy it -- You will love it!!</li>
            <li> This works really good on my feet. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have ever use. Nice to have a plug in rather than batteries. more power and don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries all the time</li>
            <li> It is great. If your feet have very very thick callus, buy extra green rolls. I used the blue one for my feet, and the green roll for my husband. Although Works fast,still take me a very long time. Very good.</li>
            <li> Great price,delivered in two days! Works so much better than the battery operated model. Stronger power &amp; so quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is much safer than the blades, which I have used to simply slice the dead skin off.  Using this unit takes some time, if your feet are as hard and dry as mine were, but in the end, you&#x27;re left with baby smooth pink soles, rather than chalk white dry looking zombie feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this:&lt;br /&gt;As a wonderful gift for anyone who cares about their feet, and they will love it.  It comes with a carrying white bag and simple white brush to clean the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Replaces:&lt;br /&gt;This one unit takes the place of the pumice stone, ped egg and all that other stuff.  I would recommend getting a good cream to extend the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Additional plus:&lt;br /&gt;You can travel with it.  I appreciate the way it can be used with either US Voltage or European Voltage.&lt;br /&gt;Gripe/Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;It has two settings, but it could be a bit more powerful.  It took me about an hour to use the first time. My feet were snagging the covers and they were long overdue for some TLC.  I probably should have went for the model just above this for $59.00.  A collecting unit for the dead skin wouldn&#x27;t have been the worse idea either.  Do this over a disposable surface otherwise you will have dead skin EVERYWHERE!  The brush that comes with it is flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> I only give this 4 stars because it can be bogged down easily if you press too hard. But if you have a light touch and time it&#x27;ll clear away most any callus. I recommend it, but I also recommend the manufacturer to upgrade the motor to one more powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a time saver.  It just takes a light touch to get smooth skin.  It would be a must if you have heavy callous.</li>
            <li> I love this product its something I should have had long ago. My feet went from dry and cracked to soft and smooth. The way feet are supposed to be. I&#x27;d never be without it.  I got tired of sanding them by hand all the time and the results were no where near wthis&#x27;lltles wonderful machine can do without all the labor of the hand sander. You may just have to be patient as it will take a couple of sessions to get them perfect. But they will be baby soft if you do them a couple of times ..this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever had for my nasty scaling cracked feet. Nothing compares.  Its wonderful I would recommend this to everyone that struggle with dry cracked feet. It really works wonders.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and have spent years of my life trying to find something that would grind off my cracked, dry and flaky feet.  I tried everything under the sun.  This is the only thing that has been able to repair my feet back to normal within one treatment.  Do keep in mind that  the roller will only grind/sand in one direction, so if it does not seem to work at first change up the way you hold the item.  I am left handed so this was a problem for me until I held/used it with my right hand.  Also it does not hurt soft or delicate surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;contour toe file\\&quot; is a safer item. They sell them on Amazon as an Add-on-item but I got mine at Meijer. I have also seen them at CVS. Look at Amazon&#x27;s picture so you know what to look for.&lt;br /&gt;My review:&lt;br /&gt;It works well on heels but I had a hard time maneuvering the Emjoi over the entire surfaces of my feet. I would have been fine if i didn&#x27;t try to fix my feet in one day. I wasn&#x27;t aware of the damage I was doing to my right foot. Within 2 days I was in pain. I went to the doctor on day 5. The raw section was infected and I was prescribed antibiotics. I thought I had a hard time using the Emjoi but trying to tape non-stick gauze pads with antibiotic ointment on the bottom of my foot was even more challenging.</li>
            <li> This is great. Works wonderful, run it over your dry areas , its fast and works great.  I usually put on heavy lotion followed by socks and my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> This is not for heavy callouses.  I have rough feet and was hoping to make them look good but this is not at all for calloused feet.  It&#x27;s weak and just stops when you press down on it.  I watched a video of a girl explaining it and saying how great it is and how the skin just comes off.. not true. Money spent is wasted, there&#x27;s really nothing else it can be used for.</li>
            <li> works very well and quickly but I thought it would be a little more powerful. my feet are very soft and callous free</li>
            <li> Excellent item.... should have bought this long ago.  What a difference between this and my razor device.  Does a better job and no cuts!</li>
            <li> Excellent callus remover. This has the power you need to take care of your feet the right way. I own a battery operated one and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It is little and works  just like it states.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly. From the first use I felt a huge difference, and my feet were getting pretty bad with cracked heels so i didn&#x27;t expect an instant baby-soft foot.  I used it for 5 minutes each foot for a few says in a row at first. It did take a few uses to get really smooth, probably because I went slow and gingerly at first careful not to burn the skin or wear the motor. Next few uses I got more brave, applied more pressure, it will stop if you push too hard but that&#x27;s ok with me. I use it once every two weeks now and it keeps my feet smoother than they&#x27;ve been in at least 10 years. I also apply lotion afterward, but I did that before anyway.  I still have the original buffer on it, and will look into ordering that same type for future uses when this one wears down.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I&#x27;ve been using the sandpaper things for years and this just blows it away!  There were some negative reviews so I almost didn&#x27;t get it, but SO glad I did!  If you get one of these, just keep in mind that you don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure.  If you do, it will stop.  I also got the corded one for a couple reasons, one being that I already put batteries in enough stuff and the second is that I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work as well when the batteries started to get weak.  I also want to say that I use this on my hands and my elbows.  I handle  lots of paper at work and that causes dry, scaly patches on my hands.  This removes the dry skin and makes my skin look so much better!</li>
            <li> I love this device, it smooths out everything very nicely, my feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in many years. I bought the Xtreme green refill rollers &amp; those make it work better especially on the thickest callouses &amp; heels but I did get results with the blue roller too. My toes were very calloused &amp; my heels were rough &amp; unevenly thickened. A small crack had started to form on the back of my left heel &amp; it made walking uncomfortable which is mainly what made me seek out a better solution than the Pedi egg I had been using. I got great results the very first time I used the Micro Pedi. You have to make sure your feet are absolutely dry or it won&#x27;t work very well, so do not use moisturizer. Its best not to do it immediately after getting out of the shower or after taking off the shoes you&#x27;ve been wearing all day as your feet will have been basting in sweat that whole time. Air out your feet for a few hours first. When I used my Micro Pedi the dead skin would kind of pile up on the bottom of the roller rather than flaking away so I would have to blow on it or brush away the excess often to keep it working optimally. After smoothing away all my problem areas I found that I can use it maybe once a week to maintain it. It doesn&#x27;t take away all the thickened skin, such as on the heels, but it does make what&#x27;s left very smooth to the touch, a vast improvement from before. It also got rid of that crack that was forming, no more pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve included a picture that shows one foot done, one not done yet. It was taken right in the middle of my first use of the Micro Pedi. I ended up doing a foot peeling treatment (Etude House Bebe Foot Mask) a couple months later to remove the thickened areas the Micro Pedi didn&#x27;t get rid of. That brought back my feet to baby softness &amp; I kept using the Micro Pedi weekly to keep them that way.</li>
            <li> This is great but dont expect miracles after 1 use especially with the original rollers it comes with. I think it works just as well as getting a pedicure. I have severely dry skin and i&#x27;m on my feet a lot therefore I have very thick callous on my feet. If you are like me then it take about 3-4 tries before you are able to fully remove all of the dead skin. I had to buy the super coarse rollers for this. I think I will be buying the extreme coarse rollers next as I still have a little of callous. I have gotten pedicures and even then had a hard time completely removing all of the callous, so when I found this it was such a bargain because I am getting the same results. You have to use this on dry feet as it is completely useless on wet feet or even moist feet. Your feet will still be smooth after the first try. I had a thick ring around the heels of my feet and still got the smoothness.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and it greatly reduced my calluses......wish I knew about this product sooner.</li>
            <li> Love this device...it is a godsend for helping my poor bunion afflicted feet not feel and look as awful as they are...worth every penny and thensome!  Will definitely save you time and money over going to a salon or using normal pedicure tools...your feet will be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s foot!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Just what I needed for my heels.  And the price was right also.</li>
            <li> The seller is amazing! !!!!! The product. ..ok Definitely  I need something stronger.</li>
            <li> Much better than a salon pedicure and easier than any over the counter callus file I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cutters and graters (made for this purpose) which sometimes took too much skin off if I wasn&#x27;t careful, not to mention the tedious effort, time and ellbow grease required to get the heels smooth. Plus the time for pre-soaking. You have none of that with this handy little gadget. It&#x27;s designed to be used on dry skin only and it works really well. Apply some foot lotion afterwards and you&#x27;re done. Love it. I can&#x27;t speak for how long one roller lasts. It says, just a few sessions, I hope it&#x27;s longer than that, but it&#x27;s worth to me buying replacement rollers.</li>
            <li> Great product...I have used several other products that say they will remove callous skin but nothing does it as quickly and throughly as this one...it&#x27;s by far the best available.</li>
            <li> My feet are extremely dry and I have to always use products pumice stones, files etc to try and keep the callous at bay . . . without much luck.  I found this on Amazon and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled that it made my feet baby smooth in less than 1 minute.  My feet are soft and not dry and/or callous at all.  I am so thankful I found this amazing device and my feet feel healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has rough, dry and calloused feet.  It works and it is worth the money.  I would buy the refills with the product.  I had to go back and purchase the refills -- they last a while but want to have them ready to make sure my feet stay baby smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use foot files it takes a long time to smooth out your feet . . . this product is simple and easy to use.  If feels like an electric razor and it takes about 1 or 2 minutes to make your foot smooth.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with calluses for years, and found only a monthly pedicure could keep them at bay -- until I purchased this product!  In the \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; of a few minutes, I was able to grind off those nasty calluses myself!  This is the product I have been looking for, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it all the time. My only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is the grip. I think for me the other version with the handle would be easier to hold.</li>
            <li> If you have feet that flake, this is your solution!! If you&#x27;re a guy and you have painful calluses on your feet from work that are stubborn and hard to remove, this is your solution!! Not only does this product leave your feet as smooth as silk, once you&#x27;ve lotioned your feet after the treatment you&#x27;ll be completely satisfied. Of course I used my boyfirend as the guinea pig and it smoothed his calluses down to nothing and their gone!! I&#x27;m in love with this Emjoi Micro-Pedi and as a female user I can save money between pedi spa treatments. Ladies and Gentleman this is the answer and the solution to crusty feet, lol!  And it does crunchy elbows too!! You do the math!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy my new Emjoi!  It works very well and adds another dimension to my pedi regimen.</li>
            <li> The motor could have more power. Not the best of quality. But it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Nice idea but DO NOT waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;This thing does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also know there&#x27;s a 50% restocking charge if you return it.</li>
            <li> Something that does what it says it will do!!!</li>
            <li> slow, but works well. No chance of cutting yourself using this. Left my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This corded version is awesome. I took off thick callus with the extra course and then used the blue one to fine tune. Have bought one for everyone for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing to going to the podiatrist.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of calluses on my feet from running and the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using ped egg over the years which works great but it is a lot of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase the Micor-pedi callus remover hoping that it would cut down the work. but it didn&#x27;t, so I purchase the more corse sander cylinders for another $18. Still didn&#x27;t work. So now I&#x27;m back to the ped egg and use the Micro pedi as a buffer in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the expense. Too bad and an expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> OMGosh! My feet are smooth!!! I love it soooo much! I will write another review in a month or so if the motor gives out like some of the reviews say. But so far this is a miracle for me!!    October 9, 2014 Updated review:    OK, it has been a 5 weeks since I bought this and I promised to add to my review. I used it daily ( a couple times 2x a day) for the first 2 weeks to try to get rid of a huge crack I had on my left foot. After two weeks the crack was still there, but was about 3/4 as deep as it use to be and no longer had a black line in it. The only way I knew it was still there was by feel.     The following week I used it 4x that week and the crack almost disappeared. I could barley feel it. Now don&#x27;t get grossed out, but also I wear flat sandals daily during the summer and one thing I hated was that my big right toe and my heals would be so dirty at the end of the day. NOT ANY MORE! OMGosh, who knew that it was because my feet were so dry and need some TLC!?! Now I can go all day and unless I step in something or rub up against something, my feet are not dirty on the bottoms. YEA!    OK, so these last two weeks I have been using it only 2-3x a week just to maintain my beautifully smooth and wonderfully gorgeous feet. I have to admit I used a pumice stone daily in the shower b4 buying this and I thought my feet were in pretty good shape except for that one crack (due to a limp I have), but OMGosh, they were disgusting compared to now.    My son and even my daughter are willing to rub my feet for me daily. No more dry crack left heel, no more dirty feet after wearing sandals, no more big toe hard dry skin, no more dryness at all. Just soft, beautiful feet.    So now about the rollers. I will say they do not last as long as I would like. The first roller lasted me about 3 weeks, but I was using it a TON! I am on my 2nd roller (bought extras) and I will guess that it will last me about 2 months with usage of 2-3x a week. Soooo, I would like it to last a littlelonger, but for the difference it has made in my feet I DON&#x27;T CARE! It is worth it.    Oh! One more thing, put a towel on the floor under where you are doing this to catch the excess skin dust. I did not do that the first time and it&#x27;s kinda gross if you think about it!    Enjoy this and buy one for everyone. And if you are trying to decide between the plug in and the battery, skip the battery and go for the plug in. I can tell you right now that the battery will not work as well! BTW sorry it was so long, but wanted to make sure you all know this is worth the price!</li>
            <li> My mom has over-zealous callus growth on her feet causing discomfort. Before this she used some manual tools which were slow and tedious. This is perfect for her.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product.  Really works on even the driest of feet.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Quit working after 3 times use, within 6 weeks.  I have the battery-operated and it still works,&lt;br /&gt;but this was a lemon.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed switch, slightly weak motor, but looks nice.</li>
            <li> This is a little powerhouse of a callus remover.  It meets my expectations and more.  Callus is gone!  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> i had dry daed skin on the bottom of my feet and try creams power to get rid of it but i seen the Pedi Foot buffer on TV it looked like something i wanted to try I went on line looked it up came to Amazon and bought it when it came in the frist thing i did was use it and it done what they said it would. All the dead dry skin on the bottom of my foot is gone and thats what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
            <li> That is why I ordered it.  There is no work involved.  Just turn it on and let it do the buffing for you.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think I was looking for a replacment for the file.  This didn&#x27;t do it.  I will keep it, probably not use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow, but it helps.  Purchased additional for Unisex or Men style rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Started using it.  Do not how to each roller last for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish we can reuse or wash the rollers</li>
            <li> I love this product. My feet have never been so smooth!</li>
            <li> Works good I just wish I could use it more than 2-3 seconds as recommended. Gets the job done. :)</li>
            <li> I was previously disappointed by its weakness, but I am updating this review to reflect my new opinion of this device: it blows through batteries like nobody&#x27;s business if you use regular, run of the mill batteries. If you don&#x27;t replace the batteries with great quality new ones every fifth time or so you use it, it will appear weak and shut off with any pressure... so just bear in mind to keep it fresh with good quality batteries and it will work well</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I could not be more happy with the results for the foot buffer.  I&#x27;m ready for summer sandals!</li>
            <li> my wife likes it very well make sure to buy extra stones</li>
            <li> Worked as described.  I should&#x27;ve bought this ages ago.</li>
            <li> At last, a product that delivers all that it describes.  Easy to use and very good results.  Only comment is that I wish it had 2 speeds.  However, that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using and enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> Finally found something to take care of the tough calluses on my feet. I&#x27;ve purchased additional courser rollers and found they work great. I was surprised at how little effort it really took. I am very happy to have found the corded model as I think I might have gone through a couple sets of batteries by now. The unit has 2 speeds but I have only used the first speed. It feels so great to &#x27;feel my heels&#x27; for the first time in years. I might have to reconsider summer shoe styles to include open backs!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Worked very well. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day!  Yeah, I know it is not the most romantic gift in the world, but you don&#x27;t know how hard it is to buy for my hubby!!  He just kind of looked at me strangely when he opened it but as I explained to him, he has very rough heels! Of course, he says I buy him gifts that I want, and that may have been a bit true in this case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, he tried the Emjoi that evening and seemed to like it (he isn&#x27;t vocal about things he likes, as I am).  After he finished, I got my turn at it.  I used it on my feet and was very happy with the results!  As advised on other reviews, I was sure to put a towel under my feet to capture the dust it causes.  I am so glad I did!  Wow, it is pretty amazing how much dust it makes while filing your feet!  My feet weren&#x27;t in terrible shape and yet it made a good amount of dust!  When I finished, I massaged body lotion into my feet and they felt so smooth and soft!  Even better than when I get a pedicure at the local nail salon!  My feet are so smooth now, they don&#x27;t even try to sell me the extra callous remover service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered refills of extra coarse and super coarse for the Emjoi and I am glad I did.  I used the super coarse on my feet first and then smoothed with the extra coarse.  I go barefoot a lot so my feet are pretty tough.  I did find that I sanded the heel of one of my feet probably a bit more than I should have and it was slightly tender.  Not sore really, just a little tender for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like my husband&#x27;s Valentine Day gift!  Every woman should get their man one!  *wink*</li>
            <li> I believe this is my first review although I buy almost everything thru Amazon. This little device is THE BEST THING on the market. I&#x27;ve tried many other tools to get rid of my callouses on my feet but this is the one I&#x27;ll be sticking with. No pain, works fast and leaves my feel silky soft!</li>
            <li> I love it, thinking about adding this to my gift giving list.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift--she loves it!!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL GREAT TOOL. JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Try it--great product</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!  I use about every 3-4 days, really gets off the dead skin.  Like the power cord option so as to eliminate changing batteries.  Bought a small makeup bag to put the cord and the pedi gadget in (little bag it comes with doesn&#x27;t have enough room for both).  Waiting to see how long before I have to change the roller, but so far I am really liking this.  Will still get my monthly pedi for the professional touch and polish, but in between this does the trick nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy work fantastic</li>
            <li> I love this foot buffer!  I had been using a pumice stone which took so much work just to make even  a little difference.  This thing effortlessly pulverizes layers and layers of old, dead skin.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  Now my husband doesn&#x27;t hate to give me a foot massage because now my feet are so smooth!</li>
            <li> I like it! I try to use it often, and when I remember, i do see a noticeable difference in my heel.</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY WELL, NEEDS REPLACING ROLLER OFTEN.</li>
            <li> I owned the battery operated Emjoi Micro-Pedi and love it. When it start to get weak, I&#x27;m never sure if it is the batteries or the roller so I land up changing both. Finally decided to get an electric but they were costly. Finally found this one at a great price. Never looking back at my battery one or my Ped Egg which was my first love!</li>
            <li> Love! love! love! this Nano! I tossed my battery operated one in the garbage! It required new batteries after only three uses. This one is perfect! My feet are so nice and smooth now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday and it arrived on Wed, so fast shipping.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this callus remover/smoother.  I have tried so many things from pumice stones to files to battery powered callus removers.  Nothing has put a dent in my heel calluses, I run and walk a lot and am always barefoot in my house. In fact in the last couple of years my heels have started cracking, very painful.  Anyway, couldn&#x27;t wait to try this electric powered callus remover.  It&#x27;s great, my feet have not felt this smooth for years.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.  I have great hope that my calluses are a thing of the past.  I would recommend ordering extra rollers, I wish I had ordered more than 2..  It has taken 2 of the 3 to get my calluses smooth.  Maybe I won&#x27;t wear down the rollers maintaining my new smooth feet.  I would highly recomment this corded callus remover.  It has the power you need to remove th calluses.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would definitely recommend it.  It works as promised and I am very happy with it. I am going to buy one for my daughter for her birthda y!</li>
            <li> Now I have sandal ready feet</li>
            <li> I have tried the manual handheld files but they&#x27;re just too much work.  So, I gave this one a try and I am super impressed,  I got the version with the cord because I feared batteries might not be as strong.  I made the right choice.  I highly record the Emoji Micro Pedi Nano Callus Remover.  One of my best purchases.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing roughness of heels.</li>
            <li> easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li> gets rid of dry skin and makes heels very smooth.  My husband likes it to.  I prefer this one because it has an electric plug.&lt;br /&gt;the other one is battery operated and may be more convenient but as batteries wear down the power will diminish&lt;br /&gt;the electric model has even power.  the rollers last along time.  We live in arizona so our feet get really dry and it takes care of removing dry hard skin</li>
            <li> I take regular care of my feet and they&#x27;re normally in pretty good shape, but I can never make a dent on the rough, cracked skin on my heels. I&#x27;ve tried pumice stone, emery boards and metal files -- all worked a little bit, but never really smoothed that skin. This battery-powered roller made an immediate difference! My heels are smoother after just one quick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used the device three times and still do not need to change the roller. I will update this review when I have an idea of how long the roller lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had the buffer for about ten weeks now and still really like it. Each roller lasts about 6 full feets&#x27; worth, more if you just use this on your heels. I use this Emjoi buffer, then bathe (a lot of dust is generated), then oil, and my feet are looking and feeling great. What a luxurious feel to slip into socks or sheets and get the smooth sensation of pampered feet! The cracks in my heels are still visible, and I&#x27;ll continue to work on those and update later, but they feel very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2: After a couple years I find I still use this device and it pays big dividends. The best results come from using this once in a while, augments by a rasp or file, and then putting a little oil on the heels and wearing heel sleeves a few nights a week. Your feet will feel like a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Great product very happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the battery operated and loved them, but when I bought this one I realized it is much better.  You always have plenty of power, paired with the green rollers, the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been whittling away at my hard cracked heels since I got this.  It has been very helpful!</li>
            <li> This is terrible.  Absolutely no power.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to prep for a beach vacation.  I am a man, and my feet help support that fact.  I cut my toenails regularly (as Jerry Seinfeld once said, &amp;#34;Ever two to six weeks.&amp;#34;), but that was about the only care I ever paid to my feet on a regular basis.  With them being a bit worse for wear, regarding dry skin and callouses, I wanted to do something about it.  Not a fan of people touching my feet, so I opted for this as opposed to a couple pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I am impressed.  This thing is, really, a glorified dremel tool, but it definitely does the job, eventually.  As I said, my feet weren&#x27;t in a great spot, and after four 10-15 minute sessions with the Emjoi, they are a lot better.  However, I will probably have to go at them again at least two more times to get them to be &#x27;perfect&#x27; and get rid of a couple stubborn calluses.  Also, I am using the Xtreme (green) rollers instead.  I have yet to use the blue roller that came with the unit.  I&#x27;ll probably save that for more &#x27;upkeep&#x27; jobs.  The power of the plug-in model is adequate, but I would not risk trying the battery operated or rechargeable models.  Stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issues I have with it is the price and the mess.  It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, especially when you factor in replacement/extra rollers.  I will say that the rollers do last though.  Four uses in with one of the Xtreme rollers and it&#x27;s still usable (though not as course as it was, which is expected).  Plus, when you compare the cost to the price of a pedicure, you&#x27;re saving some cash in the long run, even if you just use this as a fill-in every other time.&lt;br /&gt;And the mess...there&#x27;s no trap to catch the shavings, so it&#x27;s a personal white Christmas during use.  Keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado where it is very dry and even after regular pedicures my feet need to be buffed often as they get ragged, especially the heels.  I threw out my Pedi-Egg after I used this the first time.  It does a great job in such a short amount of time!  It is amazing, I am in love with it!  Can&#x27;t wait to get one for all my friends for their birthdays!  I turned it on low and used an old soft bristled toothbrush and lightly ran across the head to clean and it really did a nice job.  The roller head seems to be very durable and has lasted a long time but I ordered the refills because I don&#x27;t want to be without this!  I highly recommend this product, very worth the money!</li>
            <li> This thing really works! I have bad calluses on my feet, very hard to maintain a nice, soft heel. But the micro-pedi grinds right through it, leaving them soft.</li>
            <li> The shaver works quite well; it is powerful, very fine sanding, and safe. However, it has taken 3 uses &amp; my heels are still a little rough. Each time I use it my heels feel smooth. I use Shea butter on my heels every night, but within a few days my heels are rough again. I live in CO &amp; have very dry skin to begin with. This may not be the perfect solution, but it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried to date. Glad I got the plug in version. Lots of power.</li>
            <li> This tool is FABULOUS!  I get regular pedicures,  but this item removed more hard heel skin then any  manicurist ever did.  I have used a ped egg in the past, but many times I actually hurt myself by overfiling an area.  You can&#x27;t do that with this file.  It runs on electricity  so no batteries to worry about.  It is more like an electric razor and very easy to handle.  There is a cylindrical file that needs to be replaced and others have said it can get expensive -  but you get what you pay for.  It feels good, does not hurt in any way and leaves your feet amazingly softt.  If you wear hosiery -  you NEED this.  No litttle pieces of hard skin sticking out.  I highly recommend this - and may even cut back on pedicures - except that I like the massages and nail clipping!</li>
            <li> I kept it just on the surface layer of skin and it truly does work, You don&#x27;t need to press down with it. Just go over the necessary areas slowly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t push down, if sounds like it is dragging let up on pressure as hard pressure it will not work.  for seriously thick callouses you will need the extreme course rollers.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item even after some of the negative reviews.  This product is simply amazing! Trying to keep my feet decalloused, smooth, and soft  has been an almost impossible task especially as I reached the age of 40!  Anyway, the Emjoi has worked miracles! My feet are now softer and smoother than ever. Even professional spas have not been this successful with my feet. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Bravo... this is a perfect product.  I have waited a long time for this.  I invented it in my mind while trying to sand my feet with a Dewalt Â® sander and hurt myself.&lt;br /&gt;JonaGeniusofTanglewoodHOUTx.</li>
            <li> This buffer worked better than expected.  My heals are now nice a smooth.  Don&#x27;t press too hard.  Just lightly touch.  Let the buffer do the work.  Also, do in an area that can be swept.  Powdery stuff will go all over.</li>
            <li> Goodness, what a pleasure to finally have a device that works. I have tried many. I have an old injury to my hand so this electric powered  smoother makes it so much easier! I also like NOT  having to change batteries. My feet have improved well enough to wear sandals and not have to pay for expensive pedicures.</li>
            <li> works good, was hoping that the cord could be unplugged from the unit, but it works great!</li>
            <li> The best ..... it doesn&#x27;t get tired and I now have pink heals. Good idea to buy the green extreme rollers if your skin is really bad...they work.</li>
            <li> Works better than the nail salon!  I am in love with my feet now! Only regret that I waited so long to buy this!</li>
            <li> So, I read the reviews before I bought it.  A number of reviewers said it took one shot and their feet were perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t believe that and it wasn&#x27;t true for me... but I&#x27;m still really happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with really bad feet -- I live in bare feet and flip flops and, recently... maybe as I got older... I started to get cracks, which hurt like crazy and are super unattractive.  Plus, if my feet got dirty, I couldn&#x27;t scrub the dirt off - I guess because it was stuck in the cracks?  It was too hard for me to maintain my feet with pumice... they seemed to be callousing and cracking faster than I could pumice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got this electric (corded) remover.  It&#x27;s super easy to use, and I was fearful it would create hotspots or over-remove the callouses, or hurt if I accidentally ran it on uncalloused skin, but none of that was true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower, towel-dried my feet, and then sat on the floor and went to work.  It rubs off the callouses gradually, a layer at a time, creating soft dust that falls to the floor (occasionally, I had to stop and blow the dust off the remover).  After about 20 minutes, my feet had lost the moisture from the shower and it seemed harder to sand the callouses off, plus I was bored, so I stopped.  But I got the first couple of layers off and I know that if I repeat that a few more times, I can see that I will have nice, soft, smooth feet that will be easier to maintain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is great!  It was easy for me to hold it in the right way (I&#x27;m left-handed) and I didn&#x27;t have the problem of pressing it too hard and making it get stuck.  I did the little spots on my toes and the big giant callouses on my heels, and I was able to maneuver it and it worked just fine!</li>
            <li> This is the best investment I ever made. Follow the advice, don&#x27;t use it too long in one spot, it is easy to go too deep.</li>
            <li> great product--works great</li>
            <li> This works very welll but i like the cordless one better. If you want to save on batteries, than you will love this one too. I like to  use it on my front porch so I use the cordless but regardless something that I can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> A small but powerful tool. It did what it was suppose to do. Leaves your feet very smooth.Happy to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I broke my ankle and have been walking messed up for 7 years, I get callus&#x27;s on my feet from walking crooked, this little thing took care of them in no time at all, they are nice and smooth and can&#x27;t wait too use again, highly recommend</li>
            <li> This worked really well to remove several years worth of \\&quot;foot stuff\\&quot;. My feet are now really soft and feel REALLY STRANGE now after being completely yuck for so long. I did buy some of the \\&quot;extra course\\&quot; rollers and they work better for me than the one it came with. I like it; it has done a great job.</li>
            <li> Works great for my feet. I doubt it would do justice to rough callouses tho. Removes dry skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> Still working!! Removes all the rough calluses with ease.</li>
            <li> wow.....best investment on callus remover.  I have very happy with EMJOI products.  And after reading all the reviews, I went ahead and order this callus remover.  And, I was quite impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from someone who always have dry, coarse callus, I have tried just about anything.  This is actually one callus remover that I am truly happy with.  My feet feel soooo smooth and no pain or cuts.  The key thing is not to press too hard when using it.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful my feet are callous free now</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected.  I recomended to every person.</li>
            <li> I love how well my original Emjoi took down my callused skin, and was in the market for a corded version.  I love this corded Nano version even more.  No loss of power.  No need for batteries.  Small size of the unit fits comfortable in my hands.  I use it weekly for smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised. The seller shipped on time. Overall good experience.</li>
            <li> It would be wrong for me not to give a glowing review for a product I immediately love so much. I&#x27;m kicking myself for not taking a &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; picture, and the only reason I&#x27;m going to give details about the pre-Emjoi condition of my feet is because you need an objective standard to gauge its usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea, I have spent most of my life out of shoes. I love to be barefoot, even on non-grass surfaces, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time my feet looked smooth. My feet are so flat that my footprints look like those of a duck. The result is large, thick calluses on the balls of my feet, outer sides of my big toes and the joints below, and splitting heels-- much worse than the condition of the &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; foot in the photo above. Walking around? The calluses would burn from the friction, and my heels felt like they had power cords lining the perimeters. I tried almost everything-- lotions, manual PedEggs, and even just gouging holes into my feet with toenail clippers. This went on for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a dance injury stemming indirectly from my calluses landed me at the podiatrist&#x27;s office, I was finally convinced to invest and do right by my feet. They were so bad that I needed a prescription cream to hydrate them, and while that took some of the edge off the discomfort, the difference was minimal, especially in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My podiatrist recommended that I try this kind of product. Without a brand in mind, I did research on battery-vs.-corded and decided that batteries would be less powerful and more annoying than the convenience of complete mobility was worth. I still hesitated that there was hope for my feet, but even the Emjoi&#x27;s worst reviews gave me an idea of its nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One use and a shower later, I am nothing short of delighted by the effectiveness of this product. Immediately, I am walking differently, not just without the usual discomfort to which I&#x27;d grown accustomed, but my feet are actually hitting the floor more properly. What a perk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the tips from other reviewers, I put a towel on the floor to catch the dust, and I am thankful that I did. Some have complained that there is only one side of the roller accessible for use, but I found that it keeps a lot of the dust from flying everywhere and also protects the soft underside of my toes while I tackle the ball-of-my-foot calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I tried a couple of techniques: back and forth, random, from top to bottom in one long pass, etc. It would have taken forever, and so I decided to risk it and just hold the thing against one spot for longer than the recommended 2-3 seconds. I know, I know, big gasp and all that, but remember that I&#x27;m used to taking clippers to my feet. That&#x27;s where the real action happened! Without even having to push down, I applied the Emjoi maybe 10-15 seconds on a tiny target area, only until there began to be a sensation of heat. I examined the spot, and I had one of those jaw-drops you see in cartoons: it was a beautiful, smooth, healthy-red (as opposed to scary-red) patch buffed below the surrounding calluses. YE-HE-HE-HESS-S-S! I moved on in this same manner, and 20 minutes later, I had finished both feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower, prescription lotion, socks-- voila! My feet feel amazing. Now, some of the cracks go too deep for the Emjoi&#x27;s reach, but now the edges are smoothed enough that the lotion won&#x27;t be wasted on surface toughness and will now be able to reach deeper. The calluses on the balls of my feet are still there, but they&#x27;re level with the surrounding skin. Like with my heels, these spots will now be more easily helped by the lotion. My podiatrist says that they will always come back. That&#x27;s not Emjoi&#x27;s problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is after just one use, folks. Granted, I went against the directions by quintupling the recommended time of continuous buffing, but my feet aren&#x27;t the least bit sore. Imagine that I just dragged my feet across the floor to makesure. Yup, still good. I hardly recognize my feet, whether by sight or self-awareness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. Even if this thing stops working after the second use, I&#x27;m going to order another one. Five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using the Emjoi for about 4 months now, and I&#x27;m still a fan. My advice is to stay on top of regular sessions. The calluses want to grow back, and your feet can get sore as they come in. The first session is the longest; regular follow-ups are shorter. Also, lotion afterwards only amplifies the effect. I stand by my earlier endorsement-- it&#x27;s so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the photo. I took these immediately before and after using the Emjoi. I also tried to shoot both photos from the same angle in the same sunlight. No lotions were used in the after photo-- amazing, right? The condition in the &#x27;before&#x27; shot is only a fraction as bad as the condition I described in my first post, but I wanted to provide at least a basic example of the work this product can do. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> After receiving the product and using it twice, I&#x27;ve moved all of the other foot care products (pumice stones, volcanic rocks, steel scrapers, etc.) to the throwaway pile as they are now, truly obsolete.  This product works and works very well.  One thing, be sure not to breathe in any of the dead skin dust as you&#x27;re using it - keep a dry cloth handy to wipe the dust away as the gentle sanding effect works it magic on your feet.  I&#x27;ve only used it on dry feet and will do testing w/ damp feet as well. Try using it in the tub before running water, then have your favorite emollient/moisturizer/foot care product available for after wash/rinse.  You wont be disappointed.  The &#x27;sanding/buffing&#x27; cartridge is very gentle (it almost tickles your feet) and is a breeze to remove, clean and replace. Will most likely order one of the other models for the other bathroom.  First time I&#x27;ve seen my feet look this great in years... Thank you Emjoi !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews on this little device.  It works well for me and think, in time, it would wear down my rather thick callouses.  They didn&#x27;t develop overnight and they won&#x27;t go away overnight.  I have a professional pedicure once a month, and even they can&#x27;t get all the callouses off, so this is perfect for smoothing my heels in between visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it runs slowly or sounds like it&#x27;s laboring, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  It&#x27;s not like the harder you press, the better it will work.  You don&#x27;t need to press at all.  It comes with a brush to clean the dry skin off the roller.  It&#x27;s worthless.  Throw it out.  Rescue an old toothbrush with soft bristles, and the job is done in a jiffy while extending the life of the roller.  If it&#x27;s clogged up with dry skin, it&#x27;ll never do anything.  That being said, it&#x27;s a decent product for the price and I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from very dry cracked heels for years.  I have tried everything and nothing seemed to help!  I came across this and thought, why not?  I saw instant results the next morning after I used it.  My heels didn&#x27;t hurt so horribly and my feet were smooth!  I did this nightly for 1 week, applying cracked heel cream afterwards and my heels have been cured.  My heels no longer ache and my cracks are gone.  Amazing product - small but powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to remove callouses, etc. from your feet. For awhile now I&#x27;ve been grinding callouses from my feet with a Dremal. The small sanding drums worked well. The problem with the Dremel bits was that they would begin to heat up due to friction if to much pressure was applied. Also they are very small and therefore it would take some time to complete the task. The first thing  I noticed while abrading my toe, with the Emjoi, was how fast the abrasive wheel was removing the callous with no frictional heat occurring. It appears that the Emjoi wheel is made of a abrasive material that either dissipates heat well or is resistant to heat? I had to be careful not to use it in an area for to long since it produced no uncomfortable friction. Very nice light weight tool with two speed settings,\.</li>
            <li> ordering two more for my family members with icky feet...wanted to try  it on mine first to see if it really worked and it does!!! if you have hard, scaley, peeling, dry, cracked skin on your heels and feet, order this product today...</li>
            <li> A certain warehouse sells the big version for a little less, but I bought the Nano &amp; am SUPER happy!  If you buy this, the blue roller that comes with it is pretty much useless. Buy the green ones!  The pic shows 2, but I received 4.  My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  I&#x27;ve made people touch them, I&#x27;m so impressed!!</li>
            <li> I have to say  just love this I like how it work this is the best ;) thank you for make this sweet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this item is the best!  Buy one now, you won&#x27;t regret the purchase.  The bottoms of my feet are/were like sandpaper.  In just a short amount of time the are very smooth with first try.  Of course, I also recommend Gold Bond Ultimate skin therapy cream.  My feet are like new!</li>
            <li> I wanted a corded callus remover so I got this one. It broke the third time I used it. The roller part no longer turns making it useless! :( This one was a waste, so disappointed....</li>
            <li> Totally not what I expected.  The pumice stone that I have does a much better job than the Emjoi Callus Remover.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not too late to return it for a full refund</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purposes I have made.  I have a terrible time with my heels in the winter months being cracked and dry.  My only complaint would be that they offer extra cartridges with the machine.</li>
            <li> Maybe too early to write a review but here goes.  I&#x27;ve only used this once, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up over time.  However, what a difference with one use; I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  Used the low setting on each foot and then the high setting.  Let the machine do the work--do not push down--just let it glide.  I try to get a pedi at least once every month to two months.  This little machine is great for the in between or even without a pedi.  Just a word about battery vs. corded.  Never used the battery operated; however, after using the corded and the length of time I used my machine, I would suspect you may be looking at a lot of batteries.  My feet felt great, relaxed and massaged.  Take your time in the application,  and enjoy this great little machine.</li>
            <li> Best callus remover I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly expensive little item considering what it does. I bought this for my wife for her feet. It just did not have the power or roughness to get the job done. Ultimately, she went back to using an old fashioned, hand held callus remover. It is a neat idea, but needs more power and rougher surface to truly be effective on tough skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my feet but use it on my cuticles and finger calluses especially in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I have to be very careful with my fingers but it really helps to avoid cracking.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> More importantly, my heels love this!</li>
            <li> It takes way too long to remove tough callouses with this.  It works fine for final smoothing if you&#x27;ve removed the callouses with other methods.  I use a callous shaver then a  ped egg then this.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool out there for your feet.  My 70 year old feet never looked better.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would have hoped for, especially for a plug in device.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life? Honestly, after reading horror stories about the tools used in some salons for getting a pedicure, we decided that we needed a tool to help us perform pedicures at home. This is the solution for us. Easy to use, outstanding results and best of all my flip-flop wearing husband now has feet as soft and callus free...just like a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well after I &amp;#34;prepped &amp;#34; my very dry feet.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to control calluses on my feet.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it works</li>
            <li> This little gem has saved me lots of money already, way less pedicures, manicures etc.  I love how my feet feel afterward.  I am so glad I got the corded model instead of the battery operated one, this has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t always have to go to my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I love this. My feet are smoother than they have been in years. They also look great. And I don&#x27;t think that I will need to use this anymore than once a week to keep my be looking great, healthy and smooth.  I normally have ridges on my feet and they are all gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to spend money on pedicures anymore.  Frankly, this does a better job than any pedicure that I&#x27;ve had.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great machine for calluses.</li>
            <li> I have the battery- operated one, too, but thought I would give this a try. Love it! I have given the Emjoi to my daughters,nieces, hair dresser....a great buy! My husband likes it, too.</li>
            <li> This product is a slow and steady foot smoothing machine!  At first I thought I ran too slow but soon I found out I was wrong.  Walking across the living room I caught out of the corner of my eye my wife, frying pan in attack position.  I heard something about my nasty heals, rubbing against her legs in bed and then a ringing sound.  I awoke to super smooth heals.  My socks slide on without getting caught up on nasty skin.  Now, I&#x27;m a willing victim and she keeps my heals in check.  The device works great, been using it for weeks and the grinding pad still has the grit to remove the dead skin.  Just let it float and watch it go.  Make sure you use a towel.....</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> Finally a solution for dry cracked heels. Works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried including sanding pads.</li>
            <li> It did what it said it is small but powerful.  I don&#x27;t usually give reviews, but I think I will start.  I have not purchased the extra rollers these are still going strong.  I would recommend this to anyone with rough feet.</li>
            <li> Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it quickly. Be careful because you could clean away more skin than you intended to. I also bought the elbow file that fits this enjoy and it works nicely. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  My feet aren&#x27;t even that bad and the first roller is already worn out and I still have ragged areas. I love emjoi but have found I have to work with their most expensive product to get it to work, and I just  can&#x27;t see that for the bottoms of my feet !!</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to use. Safe! My husband loves it too. Going to buy another for a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quite well, i need to purchase the courser roller because my husbands feet are pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product !!!</li>
            <li> No more sawing back and forth over stubborn hardened callus. A pleasure to use. Quiet as well, not a giant buzz.</li>
            <li> It might be because my only problem is simple dry skin but I just didn&#x27;t like the product. My device also was turning off periodically during the first use. I decided to return it. The seller was very good about refunding in a timely manner though.</li>
            <li> absolutely the BEST!  Would Recommend To All.  You Can&#x27;t Go wrong with it.  Would Recommend to everyone who has this need.</li>
            <li> My husband first bought the battery version.  It worked very well but the batteries didn&#x27;t last very long.  He bought me this version and it woks perfectly.  So much better than using a pumice stone or the Egg.  Highly recommended.  Feet are smooth is a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> I love it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I do not know if I would say I have baby soft feet but there has been an amazing difference and feel in rubbing my feet together at night in bed. They have not felt this soft since when? I cannot remember!</li>
            <li> I like it but thought it came with more blue disks. what you see in he picture is everything you get!</li>
            <li> This callus remover is small, lightweight, and travels well.  It&#x27;s cheaper than a single pedicure, fast, efficient, easy to use, and does an excellent job, so I don&#x27;t need to use it as often as I was having salon/spa pedicures.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I got it because she saw a commercial for the cordless one &amp; said she&#x27;d like to get one of them if it plugged in, rather than replacing batteries.  She says it works great, but she already needs replacement wheels.  They wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> A product that does what it is supposed to and does it well.  Wish the rollers weren&#x27;t quite so expensive but so be it.  So easy a cave (wo)man can do it!</li>
            <li> It is better than expected,finally  I don&#x27;t tear my stockings.I recomment it highly..It is important to me that I don&#x27;t need to soak my feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and fast. Don&#x27;t forget to change rollers. Only thing is that it will not help if your feet are too bad.</li>
            <li> I was watching this product for a while now.  Works well on hard calluses and makes your feet smooth.  Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have such a problem with rough, calloused feet, we&#x27;ll not any more. This little gadget is amazing! It is so easy to use and leaves my feet so soft.</li>
            <li> Glad I read the reviews and bought the model with the cord. Very pleased with the results.  Recommend getting extra coarse rollers to start.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice with the callous file. My feet were terrible; they were actually snagging on the sheet in bed. This has really smoothed them. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product for dry cracked heels. I love that it is electric and doesn&#x27;t require batteries, my dry feet have never looked better, and I have tried everything! My only gripe is the cost of the replacement cartridges</li>
            <li> No more rough heels. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I searched for something to use on mine and my husbands feet. While the manual apparatus is okay it is time consuming and my hands get very tired, which isn&#x27;t good for arthritis. The battery operated may be well and good but I do not recommend the battery operated because of power issues and bogging down with too much pressure. The corded, electric is the best way to go. It may bog down a little bit but you don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries.  This fits the hand very well and has made a difference in our feet. I have diabetes and my doctor said I need to take care of my feet by trying to get rid of the rough, dry areas....so I got this and it has made my feet feel brand new.</li>
            <li> Best little gadget I&#x27;ve purchased in years. I&#x27;m not the type to go spend money on pedicures, but I sure do need them!  This unit gives me the perfect pedicure at home in no time at all. I purchased all the little accessories to do my nails and also some additional refill rollers. All this for the cost of maybe 2 pedicures and these will last me for at least a year! The electric unit is perfect, compact, quiet, will fit in any bag if I&#x27;m traveling and I never have to worry about dead batteries. Love it so much I ordered additional one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> This is a corded model.  I like it much better than the battery operated kind.  The batteries just don&#x27;t last.  This is great.  You will need to order extra rollers at some time.  I did it when first ordering, so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  I ordered regular ones and the green ones(coarse) also.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Agree with all the positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve stopped going to salons because I seem to get a fungus every time but wanted to have smooth feet again.  This machine is trimming off all the rough edges on my feet that were literally pulling threads out of the bedsheets.  Got the heavy duty roller and have been using it lightly every three days or so over about two weeks (didn&#x27;t want to accidentally put a hole in my foot trying to sand out everything at once).  I use it over the waste basket because there&#x27;s lots of ... crud.. that flies off the roller.  Am still using the same roller and it&#x27;s still working (have rinsed and dried it between uses).  Have applied the roller gently but firmly and experienced no problems with stalling or stopping.  It&#x27;s light and comfortable in my hand.  I used high speed because my slightly arthritic hand can&#x27;t slide the switch into low easily.  I stand up and use it near the plug so there&#x27;s no issues with the length of the cord.  Has a nice little bag that the machine and cord fit into so it can be easily stored in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before I ordered. Some were good and some were bad.  I found changing the pressure used changed the results.  This product worked well for me and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Reviews are very important to me.  So before purchasing this product I read the review and took a chance.  This gadget really, really works.  I&#x27;m just loving it!!!Must purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I know longer have to worry about dry/ruff feet!</li>
            <li> So much quicker than a foot file.  Perfect size for your hands.  Corded has good power throughout.</li>
            <li> i use it every now and then, I wish it was a little stronger&lt;br /&gt;it serves the purpose for getting most of the callus off of my feet</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten this a long time ago! Great at getting those rough spots gone quick. Heavy duty calloused areas will use a roller up pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li> No more ped-egg scraping.  Well worth the money. Cuts callus removal time in half. Refill rollers are a little expensive but can be used over and over.</li>
            <li> I have heels like a farm woman who has been barefoot all her life - thick, callused, ugly and they crack - painfully I might add. This is the first device I&#x27;ve tried that actually works! I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since Christmas and my heels look like Pretty Lady Heels. Yay me! At first it&#x27;s a little scary but it doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit, even now that my calluses have been removed.  Two bits of advice - first, buy the green heavy duty rollers and get extra if you have heavy calluses.  Also, when you work on your heels put the foot you&#x27;re working on over your other knee and then hold it over a waste basket while you remove callus. The unit makes a lot of skin dust and it&#x27;s handy to have the wastebasket there to periodically tap the unit it to clean, as well as keeping the dust from settling on the floor. I&#x27;m buying several of these for Christmas gifts next year.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find it to work as described. Just seems to shred your feet. not a good result. Save your money and go get a pedi.</li>
            <li> FIRST CALLUS REMOVER I HAVE HAD THAT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT YOU EXPECT.....REMOVE  CALLUS FROM FEET &amp; HEELS!!!!!  I THINK THIS ONE IS BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE POWER  DUE TO THE FACT IT PLUGS IN.  I HAVE TRIED THE BATTERY OPERATED ONES....NO GOOD!  YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE!!!!  A. KESNER</li>
            <li> I guess t was decent. I would not buy this one again. Maybe another model!</li>
            <li> its ok, not sure if there is anything better on the market. the roller is kind of small, i thought it would be a bit bigger. if i could i would probably try something different. i don&#x27;t think its worth the price i paid</li>
            <li> This thing fixed my feet in a matter of minutes! So glad to find this product!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. These are GREAT.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;m glad it has a cord, I think I&#x27;d really go through a lot of batteries w/this. I can&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because of the mess.(use it near the trash or someplace easy to clean up) And the fact that I have to keep restocking the &#x27;X-treme Coarse Rollers&#x27; for my very dry rough feet, but maybe after I get things under control, those issues will subside. At least this is a product that offers something in the way of a solution for removing extremely dry skin that doesn&#x27;t involve blades.</li>
            <li> This works great!!! I totally recommend this product. It&#x27;s better to have plug in. I think it will last longer and you don&#x27;t need batteries ever.</li>
            <li> Love this product works so much better than the battery operated one. I highly recommend it with the extra course rollers</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! As an older adult, this makes it so much easier to use than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I ordered the extra rollers: regular (blue), coarse (dark blue), and the green rollers. All work really well for whatever my particular needs are on the day of use. Electric products are always more powerful, and I don&#x27;t have to keep replacing batteries! I&#x27;m just sorry I waited so long to buy it. I LOVE MY EMJOI Micro-Pedi ...get one, you will, too! :-)</li>
            <li> I have been trying for the longest to remove the dead, cracked skin from the bottom of my feet and heels.  I have tried using multiple products and lotions.  Even the all-in-one brush/file/emery board type tool in the shower and nothing ever helped.  That was until I ordered this Emjoi foot buffer.  It is amazing how great my feet look after only one use.  One of my best purchases....  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually do a self pedicure weekly in between professional pedicures every month or so.  This product, hands down, is the best I&#x27;ve encountered!  A light touch is needed, but if you are patient and work the machine properly, it will do all the work.  I noticed some reviews are poor and they mention that the power is not strong enough and keeps stopping if any pressure is applied.  I did have the same issue after I stole double A&#x27;s from my remote to get it going the first night.  After I placed in new batteries though, it worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can move this little machine 360 degrees so it&#x27;s very easy to use.  The only down side I can foresee is that the rollers really do get sanded down easily if you have rough patches and callouses.  Buying the extra rough replacements is probably recommended if your feet are in really bad shape, especially for the first time use.  After that, you probably just need to maintain once a week and reuse the same scrubber several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mostly used to the CVS brand callous scrapers that I&#x27;ve used over the past 20 years.  It&#x27;s really quite nice not breaking into a sweat while pedicure-ing!</li>
            <li> I find this shape of unit quite clumsy to use. I have the original shape which is more conducive for a better result. Was not impressed, and was high in price. Only feature i like is that it is electric, but i could have got the original shaped unit that now has electric, cheaper too. For the price of this unit, they could have thrown in another sander. It was quite difficult to maneuver and use this unit. Not impressed</li>
            <li> This is a great little workhorse when it comes to removing Calluses.  It is powerful and so far has worked flawlessly.  We love it.</li>
            <li> Not very effective.  Needs more grit and power.  It&#x27;s not very powerful and it&#x27;s rather expensive once you factor in the replacement emory tubes.</li>
            <li> Do the job perfect, is for a light + callus problems.  it not work, if not connected to outlet while you use it.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this other contraption for $199  at ulta but I&#x27;m so glad i waited! This works great!</li>
            <li> Also bought one for sister as gift, she loves it too... using a callus blade sometimes makes callus return thicker and can leave feet tender ,  this is so easy, don&#x27;t need to really see area you are treating.  so glad it is NOT battery operated,  also works on hand palm callus</li>
            <li> Wow!  Unbelievably effective.  My feet didn&#x27;t look or feel bad at all before I used this but WOW, what a difference!  This got rid of so much dead skin.  My feet are crazy soft and smooth now.  I previously had the battery powered version and believe me, this is far superior in terms of it&#x27;s power and effectiveness.  Takes much less time than the battery powered one which just sort of chugged along even with fresh batteries.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> So much better than battery powered one.Works much faster</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t had a pedicure or really spent any time buffing off the dead skin on my feet in almost 2 years (and I live in a place where flip flops are worn pretty much all year long)....my feet were so bad that I didn&#x27;t even want to go to a salon because I was embarrassed for the nail tech to see how bad they were.  My hubby got this for me for Christmas and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Within 10 minutes my feet were almost totally smooth, I waited a couple of days to do it again so that i didn&#x27;t irritate the skin and now my feet are PERFECT!!!!  This is the best pedicure item out there, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I always read the negative reviews first- I used this for the first time yesterday and LOVE it! I have a really gross habit of picking and pealing at any skin on my feet that is not perfectly smooth (a habit that of course leads to not smooth skin and all sorts of other problems). Frequent pedicures don&#x27;t work and I&#x27;ve picked so much that I can&#x27;t even get near my feet with a rasp or corn shaver without drawing blood. Well- this thing got my skin incredibly smooth in five minutes (and it didn&#x27;t hurt- which is amazing considering the condition I&#x27;ve got my feet in). This really works so well that I&#x27;m already planning on buying them for my friends and family as gifts!</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget , works great !!!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews criticizing the inadequate power of the battery powered model, I purchased the corded model and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and it has never even come close to stalling.  This model has two speeds, but I find that the lower speed, with the blue roller, is good for my needs.  Perhaps the higher speed is better suited to some of the other available rollers. Rather than using the supplied brush to clean skin dust off the roller, I&#x27;ve found that low pressure compressed air does the best job, by far.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and performance of the Nano and highly recommend it to anyone that has an ongoing foot callus/corn problem.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I ordered this, but it turned out to be a fantastic product. My feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I had used a battery operated one &amp; it was not doing the job of removing my callasses on the bottom of my feet. very disappointed.  When I saw this one with the cord I hesitated but decided to try it. It is fantastic!! So happy with this product!!! It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do. I use it maybe every 10 days depending if I need it. The price is wonderful &amp; I also ordered the extra rollers a few days later because I knew I was happy with this purchase. Don&#x27;t bother with the battery ones they&#x27;re a waste.</li>
            <li> Great way to remove a callus and keep your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> After comparing many products like this , I decided on the Micro-pedi. (The Dead Sea Scrolls are in better shape AND softer than my feet...) The Micro-Pedi is AMAZING!!!! My feet look human again and are really nice to touch. There is no need to apply a lot of pressure for it to work. Because it is corded, there is no &#x27;bogging down&#x27; like battery operated models do. The other great thing is the price. This little gem is the best price I found. I am very happy and would recommend the Micro-Pedi to anyone with rough, callused feet.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Well worth the money.  The product should be designed to have a cover to catch shaving debris.  The on/off switch is a little difficult. There should be information regarding the motor on the product description.  I had to contact customer service to find the distinction between the corded long handle and the corded Nano.  Customer service was efficient by e-mail; however, there is no live âchatâ or phone number for immediate assistance.  The corded long handle runs at 47x p/second.  The Nano runs at 30x p/second. The only other difference is the shape.  The Nano works well.  Just an after-treatment tip:  I clean the roller with an old toothbrush under a light stream of water and let it air dry.  This allows for further uses of each roller.  The product needs to come with at least one extra set of rollers for the price.  The original product and replacement rollers should be accompanied with finishing emery pads (like the Pedi-egg) for premium after-treatment, or to use between treatments.  Thank you Emjoi.</li>
            <li> This product does remove calluses, but not as fast or effectively as a good old foot file.  Motor slows down quite a bit with too much pressure.  I have the plug in model.  I guess my expectations were a  little too high.  I have to say it does what it claims to do, but I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Item works but be careful not to get charged for two when you buy one</li>
            <li> I love to use this - summer or winter it is a great tool for keeping your feet in check. I have not had to replace the roller yet. I love to see the results.</li>
            <li> My big toes had callouses, and I spent a lot of time trying to remove the rough skin.  I am not one to spend money on pedicures, and envied other women whose feet looked so soft and smooth.  Now, my feet look good, and with little effort and time involved.  This Callus Remover works and works very well.  You can&#x27;t go wrong on this purchase.</li>
            <li> For those with extremely rough calluses this is a must have for that much-desired soft summer sandal look.  I never thought I&#x27;d get rid of the horrible calluses I&#x27;ve lived with for years - until I bought this product.  Used with extreme coarse rollers, my feet are now the way I&#x27;ve always wanted them to look and no longer am embarrassed by the condition of my feet.  Thank you Emjoi!</li>
            <li> Great product, it works as described.</li>
            <li> Really ?  Why didn&#x27;t I buy this sooner?  Heels are super smooth in no time with no effort.  I thought this was going to be good, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be great.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s corded because the motor is strong and smooth.  I don&#x27;t think I could bog it down without shaving off a part of my heel.  It has a low and high setting.  I run it on low to make sure I don&#x27;t over do.  So fast.  So effective.  Love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  when I started it for the first time the roller wouldn&#x27;t spin.  I rolled it by hand several times and it took off spinning on it&#x27;s own.  No issues since.</li>
            <li> Excellent to remove warts and dry skin. But expensive to operate due to replaceable abrasive cylinders</li>
            <li> Good that it is electric and no batteries.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered a long time ago. More powerful and gives better results than Artemis Heel Smoother.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  I think the fact that it has a cord is what makes it powerful enough to do the job.  It does not hurt and safely takes off the dead skin and callous a bit at a time.</li>
            <li> This works very well for reducing calluses on my feet.  I&#x27;ve even been able to minimize the cracking I was starting to get along the sides, with little effort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one before so I have nothing to compare it with, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my sister and she LOVES it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this callus remover.  I used it only once and felt the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Just not strong enough. I&#x27;ve been filing everyday for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s not getting rid of the tougher skin. Really wanted this product to be great. I might be better off with my sandpaper attachment to my drill!</li>
            <li> This is really a great tool. I read the other reviews about it taking a long time and to buy the green rollers, but I have found it to work really quickly and with the original rollers. It works great and my feet are noticeably smoother. I really like this tool !</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...wonderful results.  Soooooo much easier than any pedi foot product I have tried in the past.  Best of all super fast..and no my feet are not rhino feet. However..my husbands are and he achieved great results as well (using his own rollers). I chose the electric model because I am tired of feeding landfills and this product is something I will always use in the privacy of my home. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. The amount of calloused skin that comes off is deliciously gross (smile).</li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars a year on pedis, this is the answer for me!  My heels are normally so rough between pedicures that they wear holes in my socks and damage the insoles of my shoes. With this product, about 5 minutes a week of &#x27;filing&#x27; my heels successfully keeps them baby soft.  In fact,  I now cut my own nails and spend just $10 a month to have my nails professionally painted, giving an overall &#x27;professional&#x27; effect. This product quickly pays for itself, but buy the model with the cord!</li>
            <li> this was a gift.  The person receiving it said it worked great.</li>
            <li> I love it and how a good job it does on your feet.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awesome! I have the worst feet ever since I love t6o go without shoes, so I was looking for a product that I felt would do an awesome job. Through the advice of my daughter, she convienced me to order this. I LOVE IT! My feet have never, ever, ever been this soft since I was a small child. I use to love to go to the mall and get pedicures--no more. The Emjoi Pedi does a much better job than a professional pedi. If you order this, I can promise you--you will not be disappointed in the least. I have now decided to put this on \\&quot;My Top Ten List of Needed Necessities in Order to Feel Good About Yourself\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this for family member and she is very pleased that it does what it says it will do. So far it is working ok, and is saving some trips to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing this product for awhile now and decided to finally buy it!  I am super glad that I did!  it is absolutely amazing...even my hubby started using it.  After buffing my heel the first time, it felt soooooooo smooth.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this! It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very happy with purchase. Does the job, would recommend highly, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift; recipient loves it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. It is very easy to use, I purchased the electric one and it has good power and is very easy to manipulate. I have tried everything to get smooth heels including seeing a podiatrist and for the first time in years I have soft smooth heels again and am actually looking forward to sandal weather.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  It is so easy to use and reload the rollers.</li>
            <li> Love this! I take a bath, to soften my heels,dry well, then use my Emjoi! I have very tough heels so I recommend the extra coarse rollers! Do this once a week, and your heels will be softer in no time!</li>
            <li> I was on the verge of using a Dremel until I stumbled on this.  You don&#x27;t apply any pressure when using, just gently glide over the area and watch the dead skin disappear (be sure to do it over a trash can or over the tub/shower.) I can find no fault with this appliance and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Did a much better job than expected.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and have noticed a huge difference. My feet have only felt this soft after leaving the podiatrist office.  The roller insert that came with it is stronger than expected.</li>
            <li> Works good, no complaints.  Well worth the money.  Better than any other product I have previously used.  Little unhandy to hold and angle on heel because of design.</li>
            <li> Love this little remover. Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I ordered the above version, but received &amp;#34;a new and improved&amp;#34; version.  While it works adequately, it only smoothes calluses and does not actually remove them</li>
            <li> I recently acquired psoriasis &amp; it has affected the skin on my feet &amp; lower legs &amp; on my hands.  Psoriasis is a condition where the skin cells over multiply &amp; cause scales.  It can be treated by a doctor but there is no cure.  It is not contagious.  I&#x27;ve been lucky so far.  Mine is not too severe but this Micro-Pedi has been a life saver.  It&#x27;s made my feet look beatufiul again.  With this disease, the skin just starts to harden on my toes but with a light use of this Micro-Pedi, I can bring it back down to the soft skin.  Even before I got psoriasis this year, I still think it is multitudes better than the steel file I used to use that irritated my skin &amp; left it course only to grow back worse.  I also used to use the sharp razor pedi cure that pulled layers of the skin away.  That only left uneven layers &amp; that would grow back worse too.  This Micro-Pedi is something that can be used on a regular basis to keep ones feet looking smooth &amp; soft at all times.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the Best investments of less than $40 I have made.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my husbands feet - which are in work-boots 12+ hours a day. His feet were so calloused and painful to him - and they were starting to look like they were going to start splitting and were really thick in callouses.  I used it without soaking his feet! This was the key to using this item to it&#x27;s full potential. Do not need to use any elbow grease! Simply run it over the areas that need to be smoothed. I bought the coarse refills with the order because I knew I would need them! Great great buy! He is now walking on less painful feet with smooth soft bottoms....mind you it did take me 2 weeks of doing this every 2 days on his feet. I wet them and soaked them in Listerine for 10 minutes as a natural antiseptic and bacterial deterrent. Then Baby Oiled them with the new Shea Butter Scent. He is so happy and for a rugged hunter to be happy is a true testimonial. Love this item. It is a plug in one so this is awesome never have to worry bout running out of battery juice. Will order again when I need to or as a gift for others.</li>
            <li> I used the Christmas gift of a Clairsonic for weeks, trying to get rid of the callouses on my feet. I finally gave up and bought this Emjoi, which did more in one session than the Clairsonic did in four weeks. Wow! I&#x27;ve already given another as a gift.</li>
            <li> This foot buffer is awesome. I have the PedEgg which takes forever to sand the rough spots on your feet and it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable bending over trying to reach each foot. This battery operated one literally takes seconds to do each foot with a nice soft feel. I highly recommend this product and will be buying another as a beautifying gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Had no problems with it working fine.</li>
            <li> This product does work, but it is seriously lacking in power.  I put new, high quality batteries in prior to the first use, and it seemed to operate rather weakly.  I tried two other new batteries and the same thing happened.  It does remove calluses, but it seems to me it&#x27;s more of a foot polisher than a true hard callus remover.  It&#x27;s rather disgusting that this company seems to make a \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; model quite often.  Who has the money to keep buying the latest and \\&quot;greatest?\\&quot;  They should&#x27;ve made the best possible model they could before bringing this item to market initially.  And yes, the rollers do wear out relatively quickly, so there is the added expense of buying replacements.  However, again, my biggest complaint is that this thing is just too wimpy.  My search continues for the ultimate callus remover.  I&#x27;m NOT getting a battery operated unit next time.&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I believe one reason this and other companies make a weak unit is that diabetics who have neuropathy (or neuropathy from some other condition) may not feel how much dead skin they are removing and hence sustain a minor injury.  Everyone seems to be afraid of a dreaded lawsuit.  However, it seems to me that a clearly stated disclaimer could resolve this fear.  Then again, maybe I&#x27;m totally wrong and the manufacturer is just too stupid to design this thing better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to rough, dry cracked skin-especially on the toes and heels, although I take very good care of my feet through moisturization. This easy device removes all that dry skin 1-2-3 by simply passing the roller up and down the affected area. You can see the exfoliated skin dropping onto the floor. It sure beats manually filing your heels for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I bought a refill roller for every person in the house so that everyone can have their own.  We all love it.</li>
            <li> I do like this because it&#x27;s not battery operated. The cord is a not too secure when attached but this works great. I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last but as long as it works now I&#x27;m glad. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works very well. the electrical cord is pretty long so that was a nice plus. 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, item as described, works perfect!</li>
            <li> It works!!!!!!  I thought nothing could help my toe and heel callouses but I have to say it really does work!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> Great product, works well, and glad to find online as not in local stores.</li>
            <li> 1000x better than battery one</li>
            <li> I bought this for my college student and she was crazy about it!  So glad I purchased it!  It does a great job and leaves her feet very smooth.  I have heard the battery powered ones do not work as well so I got the corded one and am very pleased</li>
            <li> I had calluses on the backs of my feet, that have been developing for years.  These calluses had become large and extremely hard.  (Although they did not crack or cause any pain.)  Various attempts at removing them in the past were unsuccessful.  An old fashioned pumice stone and the PedEgg did a fair job of removing the top layer of dead skin, but that&#x27;s about it.  They also required a lot of hard work to accomplish even that.  The battery powered PediSpin was even less effective.  All that did was make the calluses a bit smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The corded Emjoi has removed my calluses almost completely; at this point, they are reduced by about 90%.  This hasn&#x27;t been a particularly fast process.  It&#x27;s taken about 5 sessions of 10 minutes each to accomplish this much.  Unlike the pumice or the PedEgg, however, the effort involved is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the Emjoi had some method to capture the dead skin like the PedEgg, but having to vacuum afterwards is a small price to pay to finally have my calluses removed.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  I like that you use it on dry feet so you can control the amount of skin removed. I use it between my pedicures at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> works but very slow and if you put to much presser it stops.......&lt;br /&gt;it does work but take long time if you have a lot to buff</li>
            <li> Great product, love it, going to get my daughter and son one as a gift</li>
            <li> pretty good machine could use a little more power though</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;glad i bought it&lt;br /&gt;better  than the tip 2 toe callus remover</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve problems with rough heels.  I&#x27;ve worn through multiple pairs of socks &amp; nylons to boot.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of pumice and lotion on the market.  I&#x27;m embarrassed to say I even tore a hole in one of my bed sheets.  But this Emjoi Micro-Pedi Foot Buffer is the best thing since Apple Pie.  This is one product that really works like it says it will.  I kid you not it is so easy to use and truly does the job.  I find it so easy to use that each day I take a few minutes and buff my heels whether they need it now or not.  I&#x27;m never going back to ugly rough heels again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely rough on my feet. I walk barefoot most of the summer, half of the spring and fall. I&#x27;ve never had a pedicure, mainly because my feet were so embarrassing. I had horrible cracks on my heels and dry flaky skin on my toes. I have tried all the over the counter creams, ointments and lotions. They temporarily made it look better, but nothing touched the years of abuse. Needless to say, I was skeptical. I&#x27;m writing this for all you feet abusers that would rather die than get a professional pedicure.... This thing is a miracle worker. After the first treatment the difference was UNBELIEVABLE. I&#x27;ve used it 3 days in a row now, afterwards using Badger Foot Balm (which I tried using alone, with no difference) and putting on socks. Holy smokes... I&#x27;m ecstatic! Best money I ever spent! They look and feel beautiful, for the first time in years! Definitely recommend. I also bought the extra rollers in extreme course , FYI. I&#x27;ve been using the extreme course one for the last three days. :)</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, I don&#x27;t even need a pedicure anymore! It files your feet just about right amount. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product. :)</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this.  I get bad callus&#x27;, especially over the winter months.  My feet are so smooth now after using this.  I will definitely keep using it.  I am getting one for my daughter as she has the same type of feet like mine.  I Love it.</li>
            <li> This items quickly and efficiently removes the rough, dry skin. Within a matter of minutes you have wonderfully smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best method I found found. Superior to everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
            <li> Genius product. Works amazingly well. Get the replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> This is the best heel smoother I have used. It does what it is supposed to, is easy to use, and is gentle to your feet. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Can&#x27;t cut yourself like with the Ped Egg.  This buffs the skin smooth.  Just got it, wondering how long the pad will last but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This unit works pretty well due to its corded feature which I believe makes it more powerful than battery-operated competitors.  However, the design hinders access or positioning since you can only use the front face. Recommend purchasing additional rollers as they wear out easily.  Fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected. Great buy.  Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> emjoi makes great products but I was hesitant about this one, however, it works great! I used the ped-egg prior to buying this but now I will use this in conjunction with it because the ped-egg will scraped deeper and faster then I can maintain my pedicure with this. it is quite powerful; I saved a patch of skin when I was using the ped-egg so that I could test this emjoi and it is magnificent.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, now my feet are smooth all the time. Save on biweekly pedicures. Strong little motor!</li>
            <li> After my husband commented on my heels I had to do something.  This really works!  The first time I used it I spent about 1/2 an hour, now a few minutes every week or so does the job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a great job! I readily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I highly recommend it!  It leaves my feet smooth with little effort!</li>
            <li> Best callus remover I have tried</li>
            <li> Since childhood, I&#x27;ve always worn thongs daily; in adulthood, 12 months a year. (Don&#x27;t get all excited--moderns call these flip-flops!) This has resulted in big, hard, rough callouses on both feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine. (Yes, it does require a bit of cleaning as its sandpaper gets clogged with callous dust. I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d like coarser rollers to make lighter work. It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2), then green ones called &amp;#34;Xtreme Coarse&amp;#34; (#3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try these in due &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s not great.  Either that or my feet are super tough.  After one use I need to change out the roller for more grit.  It is powerful but the roller needs to be tougher.  Not as powerful as I expected.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy way to get smooth feet.</li>
            <li> I have really really ugly callouses on the bottom/side of my big toes, which I&#x27;ve spent long amounts of time filing down, even using a razor.  This battery operated buffer works really well.  It saves on time and &amp;#34;elbow grease.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I saw what this demonstrated and wondered if the results were legitimate. After using it I can attest that the results are fantastic! It sure beats using the grater-like foot smoother I&#x27;ve been using for the last 5 years. My feet are so much smoother and don&#x27;t snag my socks. My husband loves it, too. He has a callus that causes him problems. This took care of it quickly. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having this to use in addition to my mani, pedi&#x27;s I purchased my first Emjoi from QVC years ago. It was battery operated, this is a much better product for me and more cost effective. I use it on my feet keeping them in perfect summer condition, which is all of the time here in So Cal.  I also use it on my index finger and thumb where at 54 I have callouses from writing, gardening and working with my hands , my college age son has thick callouses on his feet from going bear foot most of the time, this has worked well for him. I may have to gift him one so he leaves mine alone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE AND LOVE THIS BUFFER!!!!!!!!! AND DID I MENTION THAT I LOVE THIS FOOT BUFFER!! I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST THING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT TO USE ONMY FEET AT HOME THAT HAS EVER WORKED AS WELL AS THIS DOES!!!!!!!  I HAVEN&#x27;T EVEN NEEDED TO GO TO THE SALON SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING THIS AND IT WORKS FANTASTIC ON MY HUSBANDS FEET TOO!!! YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG BUYING THIS EMJOI POWERFUL FOOT BUFFER. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AND IT WILL WORK LIKE A CHARM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, but it is amazing.  You won&#x27;t believe the results after just one use.  I just went out and bought 2 new pair of sandals!</li>
            <li> I bought this not really believing all the great reviews, but had to give it a try.  The Calluses on my feet were awful and nothing was working on them.  Not even the &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; that they used at the nail salon I go to. What can I say, this thing really works!  It took 4 or 5 sessions using it to get my heels super soft, but now they look great.  It&#x27;s been years since they were this smooth.  Pretty unbelievable, but true.  Could not recommend it more!</li>
            <li> Friends insisted this product was the best for calluses.  After a little thought and more insisting, I purchased it.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift.  She loves it! Great product for keeping your feet sandal and flip flop tip top condition.</li>
            <li> After trying to buy different foot products, this by far, has been the greatest invention. I had callous&#x27; and tough skin on my feet. Not anymore, I absolutely love this product and would recommend to everyone to try. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I didn&#x27;t feel embarrassed on showing my feet. Now I have no problem at all. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Mrs. Ricci here.    Have had this Emjoi for a month now. It is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my less-than-dainty heels.    Using this a few times a week for at least 10 minutes per foot each time, with no worries about checking after a few seconds for too much filing. After each use my heels and tootsies are smooth, but due to the nature of my skin it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 48 hours. Using great lotions and oils after each session gives a little longer smoothness but not much.  Again, it&#x27;s MY skin, not the product.    I get excellent, temporary results with Emjoi. The BEST results of anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried everything else.    Highly recommended. even with the necessary ordering of replacement files. I am going to see if Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or the like carries these.    The only trouble is I can&#x27;t find a way to \\&quot;polish\\&quot; my feet after using the Emjoi. That is likely not anything to do with the Emjoi itself. My feet are smooth after, but still \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on the sheets - I think polishing them somehow would be great - just have to figure out how.    Update Jan 9: After using the Emjoi for more time I finally have achieved consist smoothness with once or twice a week maintenance. I can now say truly this IS the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my tootsies!! Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> need to improve the roller functionality, it stops in one place a lot.</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked on my very hard calluses and feet.  I take a lot of medications that dry my skin out especially my feet!  this is the only thing that has worked!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this tool! While I read many complaints about it not being powerful enough, it is unreasonable to have a tool more powerful that could actually harm your skin. I use it on my feet, legs, arms and elbows. You have to constantly clean the bar while using this tool for the first time on dry skin; get a toothbrush and while the machine is on, take the toothbrush and hold it against the bar to get the flakes off. If you think you still need more &#x27;power&#x27;, purchase a more course bar to replace the one that comes with the unit. Make sure you use this on clean, dry skin only. Using it on skin that has been moisturized will gunk up the bar. As frequently as I use it, I recommend purchasing the electric vs. the battery operated otherwise you&#x27;ll spend a fortune on batteries. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wearing boots all day and getting a pedicure every other month makes for some rough spots on my feet.  I love this little nano. Perfect in my hand and does the job. My feet are sooo soft and a drastic improvement;). I&#x27;ve only used it once, when I first received it..its been about 2 weeks and my feet are still soft. I have a few dry skin areas back on my feet but not like it was before...so it seems it should be used every 2 weeks to keep your feet looking and feeling nice. You should definitely give it a try if you have dry, cracked heals or calluses or rough patches that need attention.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom for Christmast 2014, and she has already used it &amp; loves it!  She never had anything like it before, but she saw a similar product on TV, so I researched it &amp; decided this was the best option since it was corded and had 2 speed settings.  My runner up option that I did not get was the Emjoi rechargeable.</li>
            <li> not bad, works well. wondering how long it will last, use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!! Glad that I bought it without batteries and it can be used also when travelling in Europe. I have sometimes used it also for the skin in my hands. I also bought the Emjoi Micro-pedi Manicure Kit and Emjoi Micro-pedi Precision Kit. I recommend these products for all, including elderly and people with diabetic or psoriatic nails.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted this for Christmas , she loves it.</li>
            <li> I was searching around for something like this for quite a bit of time. I was almost ready to order the pedicure device that is made by Clarisonic. That option is far too pricey for the same great job that the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano does. This little gem is wonderful. Quiet and easy to operate but most importantly, my feet have enjoyed the relief from hard, calloused skin. The Emjoi leaves the bottoms of your feet feeling as though you never had callouses before. Baby smooth and sandal ready. I have already told others about the Emjoi. Great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other battery-operated products to remove feet callouses, and this one seems the most effective so far. It has a broader operating surface and works well if you do not press toohard. it get the job done safely, without cuts. have ordered plenty of the rougher type for my heels, the one it comes with being better for the front of the feet or hands.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works quickly and I can keep my feet silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have VERY bad callouses, to the point where the pedicure people say &amp;#34;we can&#x27;t do too much with them&amp;#34;.  This thing took them off like they were nothing!  It really IS powerful, so you do have to be careful not to do too much, too fast.  I got a little over zealous my first time using it and ended up hurting myself by taking too much off (even though the package did give me a warning not to do that!).  But after reigning in my callous-removing enthusiasm,  I am using it &amp;#34;safely&amp;#34; now and the improvement is incredible. I didn&#x27;t think my feet would ever look, let alone actually feel, nice!  This thing is great.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this is absolutely the best pedicure kit. i would have never thought of it. I just came upon it when looking up foot filers on amazon. i was too embarassed to get a professional pedicure and always keep my feet well hidden in water shoes. i hated my feet (and they hated me) . my feet look super after one time using it. i just wish i had taken before and after pictures. I have used it a couple other times this week and put moisturizer on afterwards. now i will probably just use it once a week. I did order the extra course rollers because i thought it might get the job done quicker. but it is fine with the rollers it comes with. it will be the first time in forever that i will expose my feet in public this summer. thank you</li>
            <li> Still need a stronger one but better than battery operated! Works well</li>
            <li> This device is wonderful.  If you are expecting miracles the first time you use it, you will be disappointed.  If you use it several times a week, and spend 2-4 minutes on each foot, you will be amazed at the outcome over time.  Since a cutting accident when a pedicurist used a scraping tool on me I will never go that route again.  The fact is that my Emjoi (and make SURE you get a cordless model) works wonders.  Using it several times a week is part of my routine, and my feet (which were in horrible shape before) are soft as a child&#x27;s. Of course it makes sense to use cream on your feet each night.  In combination with the regular use of the CORDLESS Emjoi you will see incredible results.  NOTE: Do NOT get a battery operated model.  The batteries die quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool for smoothing the bottoms of my feet.  I use to file them but this is much quicker and it leaves them in better shape than a file.&lt;br /&gt;It would recommend this buffer to anyone that would ask.</li>
            <li> The powered nano does exactly what it is supposed to.  Far superior to a battery operated version (I have a battery operated full sized one) and the small size makes it much easier to use with consistent power and rotations.</li>
            <li> I love this little heel scraper - it really gets the job done.  It is more powerful than you&#x27;d think from it&#x27;s small size - even with the lesser strength rollers it went to town on my heels.  I found that using a hand held, finer grain scraper afterwards really helped smooth things out.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband who complains of rough feet. He loves it.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what they say!</li>
            <li> I like that this is electric because it save on batteries.  But I have to use it within 6 feet of electrical plug.  I wish I bought the model with longer handle.  This fits in hand but is sometimes hard to reach very back of heels where my callouses are worst.</li>
            <li> Face it, rough feet are the bane of many teachers......this does smooth out the feet as well as a pedicure....it is fast, easy to change the. Pumice roller, and a breeze to clean up. I would suggest putting  a hand towel under the foot as you use it..that way you catch all the rough patch &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; as it rolls it off.  No pain, no cutting by blades.  This is the system for me!</li>
            <li> It takes a little time, and don&#x27;t snag your non calloused skin! It does a great job. It&#x27;s light years ahead of doing it manually. I was reluctant to spend the money, but now wish I&#x27;d done it a year ago. Plenty of power.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this product.  It does a great job on rough feet, elbows, hands, and knees.  The fact that it is corded is also a plus because the power is constant unlike battery products that tend to die after a few uses and be replaced.  The cord is long and removable for storage.  The shape of the Emjoi fits the hand very nicely and is easy to handle.  The unit is not cumbersome at all and is good for men as well as women.  It has two speeds, and the rollers are very, very easy to replace.  In comparison to those other expensive removers this one was tops on my list.  It even comes with a pouch to store the unit, or make it easier to take along on a trip.  If you purchase this make sure you use the Emjoi replacement rollers as they fit the unit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works well</li>
            <li> This product does just what it is suppose to do.  It made my heels feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and worked really well a few times.  Feet felt great.  Then suddenly just stopped.  Changed batteries and new batteries got really hot fast and emjoi wouldn&#x27;t start.  Must be a short.  Pitched it out and wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t review this one but I got one that I love. Does a great job on my cracked dry heels. So easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> Excellent. works great!</li>
    </ol>
