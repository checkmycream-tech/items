            <li>A GOOD BACK UP ITEM</li>
            <li>It heats up quick but does not get my hair silky smooth and straight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth to spend the money for.</li>
            <li>This is a great product exactly what I expected and it straighten and curl hair very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It glided right over my hair.</li>
            <li>it was not even hot enought to burn me.</li>
            <li>used it this morning (you know to test that it was working ;) )</li>
            <li>The only thing that got hot was my hair :)</li>
            <li>I needed the heat setting to be higher.  </li>
            <li>I needed these to replace my Gold n Hot ceramics that burned up on the ceramic plates.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t let you change heat doesn&#x27;t even get hot</li>
            <li>Sure enough I found it on my fav site</li>
            <li>Since it gets hot really fast, you will have to turn it off when it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Gets hot in 1 mn, straighten your hair really fast.</li>
            <li>At the time, I did really think much of the fact that there was no way to adjust the temperature of the iron.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve started to use it, I really wish I&#x27;d thought it through a while longer.</li>
            <li>but its doesn&#x27;t matter that much it since doesn&#x27;t overheat where I have to worry about burning my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said this product even beats a Chi, and at a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>well came on time heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Also it was a new flat iron and it came in its original box as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product since high school and the name was warn off</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know if its because its new</li>
            <li>and this will lessen as I become more accustomed to it, but as of right now it&#x27;s really frustrating.</li>
            <li>Its ok, no more no less</li>
            <li>but if I want some curls or feathers in my hair, I&#x27;m come straight to this flat iron for the tricks.</li>
            <li>I used it for my hair multiple times but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is hot enough.</li>
            <li>Thought this flat iron would be hot enough for my hair</li>
            <li>but no matter how long I had it plugged in, it would not get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>

            <li> bout ten years hope these do too recommend to anyone looking for a flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace the 2 inch flat iron from the same company.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does the work.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in order to help stretch my relaxers for longer periods of time.</li>
            <li> broke my friend&#x27;s flat iron and had to replace it.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t know anything about hair products before purchasing this flat iron and I wish I would have</li>
            <li> Although this is the only heat that I use on my hair (direct or indirect), I&#x27;d prefer something a little milder.</li>
            <li> like the little mechanism near the extension that allows me to close the jaws when not in use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I think a newer version; as I noticed minor differences in this one compared to the one I broke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair</li>
            <li> Also, when I do use the iron (once every other month)</li>
            <li> Be very careful though.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this flat iron because I have not had luck with them in the past</li>
            <li> Although the product is flawed, I will admit that my hair is much straighter after each use.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick, I use a hotter flat iron (one that goes up to about 430 degrees) to straighten my hair...</li>
            <li> my hair gets caught in the pieces between the two plates and pulls a few strands out each time.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a flat iron before, so the concept is still a little awkward for me.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it for at least 7 years)</li>
            <li> (I use a towel to reduce the heat since my hair is really thin).</li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>

            <li> This flat iron does the work. Gets hot in 1 mn, straighten your hair really fast. Be very careful though. Since it gets hot really fast, you will have to turn it off when it gets really hot. (I use a towel to reduce the heat since my hair is really thin). It&#x27;s worth to spend the money for.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in order to help stretch my relaxers for longer periods of time. I&#x27;d never used a flat iron before, so the concept is still a little awkward for me.

Also, when I do use the iron (once every other month) my hair gets caught in the pieces between the two plates and pulls a few strands out each time. Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to it and this will lessen as I become more accustomed to it, but as of right now it&#x27;s really frustrating. Although the product is flawed, I will admit that my hair is much straighter after each use.</li>

            <li> I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke my friend&#x27;s flat iron and had to replace it. This was the brand she had. This is the same brand, same size but I think a newer version; as I noticed minor differences in this one compared to the one I broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it this morning (you know to test that it was working ;) ) and it was so SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glided right over my hair. And I don&#x27;t know if its because its new but I didn&#x27;t scortch myself from the heat -not even once! The only thing that got hot was my hair :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the little mechanism near the extension that allows me to close the jaws when not in use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like that there&#x27;s no temperature control but its doesn&#x27;t matter that much it since doesn&#x27;t overheat where I have to worry about burning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good iron for the price. I&#x27;m getting myself one, recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is the best!  I always buy it for my daughter, who straightens her hair all the time.  She said this product even beats a Chi, and at a much lower cost.  She is in love with it!</li>
            <li> Its ok, no more no less</li>
            <li> Thought this flat iron would be hot enough for my hair but it isn&#x27;t. Not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I needed the heat setting to be higher.  I have thick natural hair and I need more heat. But I think it does what it promise</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful flat iron.  I was hesitant to purchase this flat iron because I have not had luck with them in the past but this is by far the best product for the price!  I have used friend&#x27;s $100+ flat irons and this one is just as good!!!  Excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I used it for my hair multiple times but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is hot enough. I am out of return window so I&#x27;m just waiting until I find a better straightener.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS PRETTY GOOD BUT I DONT LIKE THAT THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE. A GOOD BACK UP ITEM</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick, I use a hotter flat iron (one that goes up to about 430 degrees) to straighten my hair... but if I want some curls or feathers in my hair, I&#x27;m come straight to this flat iron for the tricks. I love love love using this flat iron to curl y hair. I think it&#x27;s because of the way it&#x27;s shaped but they come out so nice. I need a replacement since there&#x27;s a shortage in the one I have now (I&#x27;ve had it for at least 7 years) and I see I can come to this to get one for cheap.</li>
            <li> Works great looks great was  packaged well came on time heats up fast. Its an all rounder. It curls great too. Love this.</li>
            <li> I needed these to replace my Gold n Hot ceramics that burned up on the ceramic plates.&lt;br /&gt;My local beauty supply was over charging and I decided to check here on Amazon and viola!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon once again.</li>
            <li> Good item accordingly to its price</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t know anything about hair products before purchasing this flat iron and I wish I would have so I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money. It heats up quick but does not get my hair silky smooth and straight like I desire. It still looks puffy after I use it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at a great price.I could not have found it anyhwere else  for this price.Great deal .</li>
            <li> Great worked as expected had one before lasted bout ten years hope these do too recommend to anyone looking for a flat iron</li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve been trying to get for a while and finally I have it. It does exactly what I need it to do. I thank the seller for promptly fulfilling my order and I would recommend doing business with them.</li>
            <li> Hate it! Doesn&#x27;t let you change heat doesn&#x27;t even get hot like I want it and does flatten my hair that great</li>
            <li> I am so happy i found the same model i had. I&#x27;ve had this product since high school and the name was warn off so i just had to guess. Sure enough I found it on my fav site and i got it cheaper then what I originally got it for. Also it was a new flat iron and it came in its original box as well. Thank You!!!!!</li>
