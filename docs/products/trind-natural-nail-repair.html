            <li>Absolutely the best product I have tried, and I have tried lots and lots of nail strengtheners.  </li>
            <li>My nails look great thanks to trind, it&#x27;s a great product for the money.</li>
            <li>No longer paying for gel nails have my own.</li>
            <li>Much to my great surprise and delight, my nails are significantly stronger than ever before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s great for keeping your nails strong and for healthy growth.</li>
            <li>: my nails have never looked so good nor been so strong.  </li>
            <li>I never had good strong nails,but this product helped me.</li>
            <li>Cannot adequately describe what a great product this is.</li>
            <li>After just a couple of weeks,they began to grow out and now are very strong.</li>
            <li>Tissue-thin nails that dissolved if you looked at them, now very strong and flexible.</li>
            <li>and they had never been very strong to begin with.  </li>
            <li>The best is that they are natural nails!  </li>
            <li>My nails have grown and putting Trind Natural Nail Repair on them once a week, has kept them looking real good.</li>
            <li>I file and clip them to make sure that they are nice and even</li>
            <li>Trind Natural Nail Repair works great!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my own nails for 25 years.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m over 45 years old, this was an AWESOME find!!!  </li>
            <li>Perfect product for strength and general health of my nails!</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I experienced the nail splitting others have mentioned, so I abandoned it and just conditioned my nails instead.  </li>
            <li>Even before doing hair, they have never been this strong this polish is truly amazing</li>
            <li>I will say that TRIND nail Repair is amazing on making your nails extremely strong after applying three to four coats of the TRIND nail repair polish&lt;br /&gt;(REMEMBER one coat of nail polish each day do not bulk up four or more coats of nail repair in one day)</li>
            <li>In the first month, I knew my nails were getting stronger, but at the end of 3 months, I was the envy of many as I beautiful strong nails.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I experienced some loss of my nail bed on certain nails.  </li>
            <li>Do it as the instructions tell you, and I swear it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>Had to buy a better nail file to shape them.</li>
            <li>, my nails were the most healthy they have ever been.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll will keep using it for a couple more weeks</li>
            <li>and they look healthy.</li>
            <li>After two weeks my nails look 100% better</li>
            <li>I love the product and how it truly does speed along the growth of your nails.</li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>I use it exclusively and my nails have never been better.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve had problems with my nails FOREVER.</li>
            <li>Before putting on the nail polish I made sure to wash my hands and moisturize them with lotion.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased I have been using and gifting for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>What more need be said.</li>
            <li>I love this product and now that I&#x27;ve found it</li>
            <li>I use it as a bottom coat and top coat for manicures, as well.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, also, and those stay on forever.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I have to say that it works to help my peeling and splitting nails better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I did follow the program closely and probably used every day for one month or more before dropping to once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never looked better or been stronger.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my nails since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I was sure nothing could help.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for others.</li>
            <li>My cuticles started looking better sooner, I assume from the nail balsam.  </li>
            <li>my nails are amazingly better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for about 3 years now and love, love it.  </li>
            <li>my nails looked better and with continued use even better.</li>
            <li>Is better than OPI and Nailstique (sp?).  </li>
            <li>Many users blame the pain from allergic reactions to the formaldehyde that is used in this product.</li>
            <li>I love Trind nails polish for so many years.</li>
            <li>I guess after maybe 2 months I would love to give another review on the progress of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Suzan</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for many girls that never had their nails grow...</li>
            <li>I know there are better ingredients out there</li>
            <li>product is on the pricy side but it works beautifully and fast if you want your nails strong.</li>
            <li>As a first time user I was surprised but happy to find that this product is as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>Best money I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li>I am now looking forward to my nails becoming strong and growing again.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to find it again.</li>
            <li>I had nails that wouldn&#x27;t grow and they would peel so easily,</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have never had strong nails, so for years I had acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never been so strong.</li>
            <li>They still aren&#x27;t as strong as they used to be, but it&#x27;s an improvement.</li>
            <li>I decided it was only fair to share my experience: for me, this nail repair was kind of miraculous.</li>
            <li>I have not had strong nails ever.</li>
            <li>This is my first review of any kind.</li>
            <li>It is amazing in how it works, and for the first time in over fifty years, I have beautiful, strong, long fingernails.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly so I can apply and go!</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Trind fan!  </li>
            <li>Now, my nails are long, strong and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This product makes a huge a difference in the growth of my nails.</li>
            <li>That for me is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I use it regularly have great results</li>
            <li>You need to use the product every week and follow the regimen of buffing with a smooth buffer.</li>
            <li>I had all but given up on the prospect of any product working for me until I read something that confirmed what I&#x27;d suspected for some time</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to many others who have had success growing their nails after using it.</li>
            <li>I had used this product before but had been told it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>They look fabulous</li>
            <li>Followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li>Primarily, I feel this is an excellent value because the amount of product you&#x27;re getting for the price goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li>I have beautiful long nails.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t thank you enough for the wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the product, and the price is very reasonable for what the product does.</li>
            <li>hope you will find this useful!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m soooooo excited to have found this because now I dont have to cover them up with color nail polish.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go! :)</li>
            <li>I put it on everyday for two weeks (more like a month lol)</li>
            <li>Trind Natural Nail Repair -- is the simply the best.  </li>
            <li>I noticed results right away!  </li>
            <li>I told my co-worker how lucky she was to be able to grow such beautiful natural nails.</li>
            <li>I have very soft nails that peel easily, especially on my right hand that I cook and do dishes with.  </li>
            <li>She quickly recommended Trind.  </li>
            <li>Super product that works.</li>
            <li>Package came quickly.</li>
            <li>Feeds the nails and keeps a manicure looking great for a much longer time when used shortly after a manicure.</li>
            <li>Thank you for getting this to me so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, my nails are hard and super healthy!!</li>
            <li>My first few weeks of using this product were very encouraging - nails grew stronger and longer, which was great since I never had nice nails before.</li>
            <li>My nails were brittle, broke easily after a certain length and then after a year of gel overlays, they were destroyed.   </li>
            <li>I am not kidding you when I say my nails are strong and healthy and NATURAL for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with the results, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my nails after two weeks of consistent use!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this long, but think I am going to like it better than most.</li>
            <li>For once, a product that does exactly what it says it will!  </li>
            <li>and i take the time to do, because the result is worth it.   </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>but it worth it.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, here is what I did -</li>
            <li>Effective if used regularly.</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>I put a fresh coat on every Sunday night and then re-apply another coat every day or so.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this product did not bother me at all, in fact my cuticles never looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of strengtheners without success.  </li>
            <li>In only two weeks I really nice nails..don&#x27;t even wt to wear polish</li>
            <li>I presently have 10 long beautiful strong nails -- a first for me.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE my Trind for giving me long strong nails -</li>
            <li>Came super fast!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement in my nails for the first couple of months, but that was fine because I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles.  </li>
            <li>nice thing is when everyone asks your secret you really can answer honestly that all you do is put polish on them!</li>
            <li>I saw results right away</li>
            <li>For less than the price of one manicure, you can buy this product, and with a little time and patience, grow your own beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>The most wonderful treatment for bad nails.  </li>
            <li>Although the Nail Balsam instructions say the product should sit on the nail for two minutes before you rub it in, I always allow the wet product ample time to be thoroughly absorbed into the nail on its own (around 15 mins).      </li>
            <li>This is the first time since trying to grow my own nails that I have had to file them because they were TOO LONG!</li>
            <li>the faster it peels off - more is not better, it is just more.   - reapply ever day or so.</li>
            <li>I now use one coat of Trind on all my nails on the first day.  </li>
            <li>This is the first of the Trind products that I tried.  </li>
            <li>, at first I thought it was the nail polish</li>
            <li>and it does not look pretty</li>
            <li>exactly</li>
            <li>After the first 2 (even 3) weeks, my nails seemed a bit stronger, but they were still flimsy and still cracking at the sides.</li>
            <li>my* nails, I&#x27;m confident that it can help many, if not most others.    </li>
            <li>I began using Trind according to the directions, and filing off the damaged nails as they grew out until only healthy nail was growing.  </li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed, taking it off (with the Trind remover) and reapplying every two or three days.  </li>
            <li>that not only look nicer but feel better.</li>
            <li>I bought the starter kit with both the Trind Nail Repair and the Nail Balsam and used it EXACTLY as described in the pamphlet</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it is the only thing that makes my nails grow.</li>
            <li>However&#x27;, I now have nails that actually look healthy, even though I keep them shorter for work.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I am re-ordering because it&#x27;s the first one that&#x27;s made a difference on my nails.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what my nails needed.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about this product from my nail technician.</li>
            <li>Amazon never fails to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>this product really works!</li>
            <li>I paid over thirtyfive dollars for this product and had higher expectations for the price.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It seems the Nail Balsam and Natural Gloss are likley the primary components to breakage relief.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, but much to expensive</li>
            <li>And the first thing I saw after 2 weeks, was the chipping had stopped.  </li>
            <li>Here is what I have learned and when i stick to it, I have no problems - just long strong nails!   </li>
            <li>After using Trind for 3 months my nails are 1/4 inch long, strong and no chips or flakes!  </li>
            <li>It does require reapplication often but is certainly easy enough to do and I think it&#x27;s worth having nails</li>
            <li>&quot; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.    </li>

            <li>I have tried many nail strengthening products but this is the only one that really works.</li>
            <li>My nails usually get nicks in them at the top and sides and break easily.  </li>
            <li>I have never had success growing long, strong nails until I found this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to everyone with soft fine nails.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d pretty much lost hope that anything else was a possibility for me</li>
            <li>However, given how resistant to other products my nails have always been and how dramatically they&#x27;ve improved with Trind, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a fair try.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff that makes my nails strong and grow.</li>
            <li>A single bottle lasts for many months of weekly manicures.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me.</li>
            <li>They were amazed at how much my nails improved.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now 2 months and my nails are much stronger and do not peel and break like before.</li>
            <li>It really does strenghten your nails so they do not break and split.</li>
            <li>Like many people, I do not take time to use rubber go es when scouring sinks, pots, pans, etc.  </li>
            <li>This product has really strengthened them.</li>
            <li>this product really helps my nails to get stronger and grow.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really fuss with them.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>If it hurts you are using too much, so remove polish and give yourself a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to that regimen</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I alo really like the nail balsam.</li>
            <li>and this seems to really help my nails in terms of strength and growth.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend Trind products!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Now they strong and long.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended the Trind product to me after showing me her long and strong nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails are long and extremely strong... stronger than I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>My nails are strong and long.  </li>
            <li>My nails are so strong and long</li>
            <li>They are long and strong.</li>
            <li>I just bought my second bottle of Repair and am still using my original bottle of Balsam.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply and dry.</li>
            <li>-  Essentially, products that are brushed on one layer on-top of another really can&#x27;t make a significant difference for nails in need of real help because the fresh product doesn&#x27;t make contact with (and thus can&#x27;t penetrate) the nail&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li>how different the over-all condition of my nails is right now for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>After 6 weeks of frequent use (much more frequent than prescribed), I&#x27;ve only gone through about 2/3.</li>
            <li>I tried Trind Nail Repair exactly as directed for 7 months and it didn&#x27;t help my soft, peeling nails at all.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, need patience to keep doing it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone with splitting nails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for stronger, longer nails when used as directed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that it chips off easily, doesn&#x27;t stay on the ends for more than 2 days</li>
            <li>No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail.</li>
            <li>Even the plain color works like a very light nail polish.</li>
            <li>Really gardens my soft nails.  </li>
            <li>I hope they grow out normally and re-attach to my my nail bed.</li>
            <li>The instructions in the package said to apply a fresh coat daily for two weeks, then twice after that.</li>
            <li>Have received many compliments and have recommended this product to quite a few friends.  </li>
            <li>Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of Nail Repair.    </li>
            <li>Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.    </li>
            <li>I have used Trind for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>New in box like it says.</li>
            <li>I use it every day for 3-4 days and then take it off and start with new layers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my nails are dry and super brittle I decided to take her advice.</li>
            <li>least they are honest and listed the ingredients, but hopefully this company will come up with a formula that is actually natural.</li>
            <li>My nails were breaking easily once grown out past a certain length and were always flaking.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not advertised as such, in my experience there were two critical components (two separate Trind products) to my significant nail improvement.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews and this is probably my first or second time doing so.</li>
            <li>By nature I am a skeptic, but this product surprised me!</li>
            <li>Do exactly as the directions say, give it about 3 weeks, and you will definitely see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and always love it.  </li>
            <li>I use one coat of this product, one coat of Hanson&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure(tm), then a quick dry product by Opi.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.    </li>
            <li>Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.    </li>
            <li>I have struggled with nails that peel, break easily and tear down low my whole life.</li>
            <li>and I guess I&#x27;ll just have to live with my soft, unattractive fingernails.</li>
            <li>The natural color looks pretty, as if you had a French manicure done.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *</li>
            <li>My nails had always split and chilpped easily, but they usually looked decent.  </li>
            <li>Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going \\&quot;Woah, are these really MY nails?\\</li>
            <li>I had previously tried the Quimica Alemana which had great reviews but caused a serious skin and cuticle reaction for me.</li>
            <li>After that, I use another clear polish on the nails that had nail bed loss and use the Trind on the nails that did not have any adverse effect.  </li>
            <li>, I like to keep my nails painted close to natural colors or clear to see my natural nail</li>
            <li>The whitish looking bottle comes out clear.  </li>
            <li>which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both of these must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>steer clear of that poison.  </li>
            <li>It is also important to wipe off the rim of the bottle after each use so dried polish doesn&#x27;t break the seal and cause the polish to lose its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>If I go for a professional manicure, I always take my Trind with me for the manicurist to use.</li>
            <li>I really like this product I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn&#x27;t for leaving two of my nails with white dots</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Trind Natural Nail Repair for 4 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18 years old</li>
            <li>Use clear or natural color</li>
            <li>About three months ago, I had it with acrylics and gels, and I was determined to grow natural nails.  </li>
            <li>The very minute there was a tiny bit of growth, the nail would break.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one whole bottle and just came back to place another order.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using it and recommending it to anyone with my old nail problems.</li>
            <li>B0019RVJGC Trind Nail Repair Natural Gloss .30oz]]</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed at the results in a short time.  </li>
            <li>B0019RVJGC Trind Nail Repair Natural .30oz]]</li>
            <li>and I will be surprised</li>
            <li>I would never waste money on this product.</li>
            <li>I found Trind Natural Nail Repair online while researching nail products.  </li>
            <li>I always had soft 7 nails that split.</li>
            <li>I tried this and although it is a slow process they have been getting better.  </li>
            <li>After the two weeks of removing and applying everyday (with non-acetone remover!), my nails looked much better, especially the new growth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After just 3 weeks of use,for the first time in a very, very long time I have begun to see results.  </li>
            <li>When I use this product consistently, that does not happen and my nails actually look like a french manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a hard time growing my natural nails out because they break and peel easily.  </li>
            <li>is my new favorite beauty secret.  </li>
            <li>I can now wear my nails short and natural with the cool dark polishes</li>
            <li>* how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:    1.</li>
            <li>I started looking into the product reviews and several users have similar experiences if not worse.</li>
            <li>your initial purchase will last a little over 2 months, and if you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll probably get enough product for 3 months or more.    </li>
            <li>I ran out of my first bottle and thought the other products I was using might be helping my constantly soft, breaking nails; unfortunately in a short time my nails were reverting to that again; I reordered Trind and it appears within a couple of weeks I am seeing improvement.  </li>
            <li>Until recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1.</li>
            <li>I would use a regular clear polish on the damaged nails and the Trind on the others.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t be alarmed, just one of those busy mom situations we deal with - try different brands of sunscreen, wear rubber gloves or reapply polish!    </li>
            <li>I begin by applying Solar Oil to my bare nails.  </li>
            <li>For the first time ever I have to cut them down.</li>
            <li>- if you have kids - certain products like bug sprays and sunscreens will \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the polish due to acetate).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my review needs to tell you that this stuff really works, because all of the other reviewers have already told you that.  </li>
            <li>My nails are longer &amp; stronger for the first time in my life--I&#x27;ll never go back to artificial nails again :-)</li>
            <li>so believe me, I&#x27;ve been watching out for the possibility that something other than Trind is responsible.</li>
            <li>Now my routine is to use the balsam and repair before applying my nail polish weekly-ish, do my cuticles when they start to grow onto the nail bed too much (every 1-2 mos) and buffing my entire nail-bed when they get rough and ridge-y (every 2-3 mos).</li>
            <li>I used it according to the directions, applying everyday for the first two weeks, then weekly after that.  </li>
            <li>My nails have gone from tissue thin to unbelievably strong.  </li>
            <li>Havent seen much improvement yet, but my nails were a mess</li>
            <li>My nails are not fabulous but they are decent and no longer embarassing which is a major step ahead.    </li>
            <li>&quot; Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch.</li>
            <li>I read the good and bad reviews about this product and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>They still do snag if I do stupid things like dig in the dirt without gloves, but the stuff is great.</li>

            <li> The Trind products are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would have nice nails again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not the kind to wear gloves when working ...</li>
            <li> but honestly I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and I would recomend it to everybody who wants to improve their nails.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product I have tried, and I have tried lots and lots of nail strengtheners.  </li>
            <li> My nails look great thanks to trind, it&#x27;s a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> No longer paying for gel nails have my own.</li>
            <li> Much to my great surprise and delight, my nails are significantly stronger than ever before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s great for keeping your nails strong and for healthy growth.</li>
            <li> : my nails have never looked so good nor been so strong.  </li>
            <li> I never had good strong nails,but this product helped me.</li>
            <li> Cannot adequately describe what a great product this is.</li>
            <li> After just a couple of weeks,they began to grow out and now are very strong.</li>
            <li> Tissue-thin nails that dissolved if you looked at them, now very strong and flexible.</li>
            <li> and they had never been very strong to begin with.  </li>
            <li> The best is that they are natural nails!  </li>
            <li> My nails have grown and putting Trind Natural Nail Repair on them once a week, has kept them looking real good.</li>
            <li> I file and clip them to make sure that they are nice and even</li>
            <li> Trind Natural Nail Repair works great!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my own nails for 25 years.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m over 45 years old, this was an AWESOME find!!!  </li>
            <li> Perfect product for strength and general health of my nails!</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I experienced the nail splitting others have mentioned, so I abandoned it and just conditioned my nails instead.  </li>
            <li> Even before doing hair, they have never been this strong this polish is truly amazing</li>
            <li> I will say that TRIND nail Repair is amazing on making your nails extremely strong after applying three to four coats of the TRIND nail repair polish&lt;br /&gt;(REMEMBER one coat of nail polish each day do not bulk up four or more coats of nail repair in one day)</li>
            <li> In the first month, I knew my nails were getting stronger, but at the end of 3 months, I was the envy of many as I beautiful strong nails.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I experienced some loss of my nail bed on certain nails.  </li>
            <li> Do it as the instructions tell you, and I swear it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a better nail file to shape them.</li>
            <li> , my nails were the most healthy they have ever been.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll will keep using it for a couple more weeks</li>
            <li> and they look healthy.</li>
            <li> After two weeks my nails look 100% better</li>
            <li> I love the product and how it truly does speed along the growth of your nails.</li>
            <li> okay?</li>
            <li> I use it exclusively and my nails have never been better.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve had problems with my nails FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Before putting on the nail polish I made sure to wash my hands and moisturize them with lotion.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased I have been using and gifting for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> What more need be said.</li>
            <li> I love this product and now that I&#x27;ve found it</li>
            <li> I use it as a bottom coat and top coat for manicures, as well.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, also, and those stay on forever.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I have to say that it works to help my peeling and splitting nails better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I did follow the program closely and probably used every day for one month or more before dropping to once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never looked better or been stronger.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my nails since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I was sure nothing could help.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it worked for others.</li>
            <li> My cuticles started looking better sooner, I assume from the nail balsam.  </li>
            <li> my nails are amazingly better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for about 3 years now and love, love it.  </li>
            <li> my nails looked better and with continued use even better.</li>
            <li> Is better than OPI and Nailstique (sp?).  </li>
            <li> Many users blame the pain from allergic reactions to the formaldehyde that is used in this product.</li>
            <li> I love Trind nails polish for so many years.</li>
            <li> I guess after maybe 2 months I would love to give another review on the progress of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Suzan</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for many girls that never had their nails grow...</li>
            <li> I know there are better ingredients out there</li>
            <li> product is on the pricy side but it works beautifully and fast if you want your nails strong.</li>
            <li> As a first time user I was surprised but happy to find that this product is as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best money I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li> I am now looking forward to my nails becoming strong and growing again.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I had nails that wouldn&#x27;t grow and they would peel so easily,</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have never had strong nails, so for years I had acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never been so strong.</li>
            <li> They still aren&#x27;t as strong as they used to be, but it&#x27;s an improvement.</li>
            <li> I decided it was only fair to share my experience: for me, this nail repair was kind of miraculous.</li>
            <li> I have not had strong nails ever.</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any kind.</li>
            <li> It is amazing in how it works, and for the first time in over fifty years, I have beautiful, strong, long fingernails.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly so I can apply and go!</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Trind fan!  </li>
            <li> Now, my nails are long, strong and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This product makes a huge a difference in the growth of my nails.</li>
            <li> That for me is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I use it regularly have great results</li>
            <li> You need to use the product every week and follow the regimen of buffing with a smooth buffer.</li>
            <li> I had all but given up on the prospect of any product working for me until I read something that confirmed what I&#x27;d suspected for some time</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to many others who have had success growing their nails after using it.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before but had been told it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> They look fabulous</li>
            <li> Followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li> Primarily, I feel this is an excellent value because the amount of product you&#x27;re getting for the price goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li> I have beautiful long nails.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t thank you enough for the wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the product, and the price is very reasonable for what the product does.</li>
            <li> hope you will find this useful!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m soooooo excited to have found this because now I dont have to cover them up with color nail polish.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go! :)</li>
            <li> I put it on everyday for two weeks (more like a month lol)</li>
            <li> Trind Natural Nail Repair -- is the simply the best.  </li>
            <li> I noticed results right away!  </li>
            <li> I told my co-worker how lucky she was to be able to grow such beautiful natural nails.</li>
            <li> I have very soft nails that peel easily, especially on my right hand that I cook and do dishes with.  </li>
            <li> She quickly recommended Trind.  </li>
            <li> Super product that works.</li>
            <li> Package came quickly.</li>
            <li> Feeds the nails and keeps a manicure looking great for a much longer time when used shortly after a manicure.</li>
            <li> Thank you for getting this to me so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, my nails are hard and super healthy!!</li>
            <li> My first few weeks of using this product were very encouraging - nails grew stronger and longer, which was great since I never had nice nails before.</li>
            <li> My nails were brittle, broke easily after a certain length and then after a year of gel overlays, they were destroyed.   </li>
            <li> I am not kidding you when I say my nails are strong and healthy and NATURAL for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with the results, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my nails after two weeks of consistent use!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this long, but think I am going to like it better than most.</li>
            <li> For once, a product that does exactly what it says it will!  </li>
            <li> and i take the time to do, because the result is worth it.   </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> but it worth it.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, here is what I did -</li>
            <li> Effective if used regularly.</li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> I put a fresh coat on every Sunday night and then re-apply another coat every day or so.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this product did not bother me at all, in fact my cuticles never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of strengtheners without success.  </li>
            <li> In only two weeks I really nice nails..don&#x27;t even wt to wear polish</li>
            <li> I presently have 10 long beautiful strong nails -- a first for me.  </li>
            <li> i LOVE my Trind for giving me long strong nails -</li>
            <li> Came super fast!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement in my nails for the first couple of months, but that was fine because I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles.  </li>
            <li> nice thing is when everyone asks your secret you really can answer honestly that all you do is put polish on them!</li>
            <li> I saw results right away</li>
            <li> For less than the price of one manicure, you can buy this product, and with a little time and patience, grow your own beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> The most wonderful treatment for bad nails.  </li>
            <li> Although the Nail Balsam instructions say the product should sit on the nail for two minutes before you rub it in, I always allow the wet product ample time to be thoroughly absorbed into the nail on its own (around 15 mins).      </li>
            <li> This is the first time since trying to grow my own nails that I have had to file them because they were TOO LONG!</li>
            <li> the faster it peels off - more is not better, it is just more.   - reapply ever day or so.</li>
            <li> I now use one coat of Trind on all my nails on the first day.  </li>
            <li> This is the first of the Trind products that I tried.  </li>
            <li> , at first I thought it was the nail polish</li>
            <li> and it does not look pretty</li>
            <li> exactly</li>
            <li> After the first 2 (even 3) weeks, my nails seemed a bit stronger, but they were still flimsy and still cracking at the sides.</li>
            <li> my* nails, I&#x27;m confident that it can help many, if not most others.    </li>
            <li> I began using Trind according to the directions, and filing off the damaged nails as they grew out until only healthy nail was growing.  </li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed, taking it off (with the Trind remover) and reapplying every two or three days.  </li>
            <li> that not only look nicer but feel better.</li>
            <li> I bought the starter kit with both the Trind Nail Repair and the Nail Balsam and used it EXACTLY as described in the pamphlet</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is the only thing that makes my nails grow.</li>
            <li> However&#x27;, I now have nails that actually look healthy, even though I keep them shorter for work.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I am re-ordering because it&#x27;s the first one that&#x27;s made a difference on my nails.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what my nails needed.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from my nail technician.</li>
            <li> Amazon never fails to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> this product really works!</li>
            <li> I paid over thirtyfive dollars for this product and had higher expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It seems the Nail Balsam and Natural Gloss are likley the primary components to breakage relief.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, but much to expensive</li>
            <li> And the first thing I saw after 2 weeks, was the chipping had stopped.  </li>
            <li> Here is what I have learned and when i stick to it, I have no problems - just long strong nails!   </li>
            <li> After using Trind for 3 months my nails are 1/4 inch long, strong and no chips or flakes!  </li>
            <li> It does require reapplication often but is certainly easy enough to do and I think it&#x27;s worth having nails</li>
            <li> &quot; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.    </li>

            <li> comment.[[ASIN:B001CSGMTW Trind Natural Nail Repair - Original Gloss]]</li>
            <li> I have tried many nail strengthening products but this is the only one that really works.</li>
            <li> My nails usually get nicks in them at the top and sides and break easily.  </li>
            <li> I have never had success growing long, strong nails until I found this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to everyone with soft fine nails.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d pretty much lost hope that anything else was a possibility for me</li>
            <li> However, given how resistant to other products my nails have always been and how dramatically they&#x27;ve improved with Trind, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a fair try.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that makes my nails strong and grow.</li>
            <li> A single bottle lasts for many months of weekly manicures.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> They were amazed at how much my nails improved.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 2 months and my nails are much stronger and do not peel and break like before.</li>
            <li> It really does strenghten your nails so they do not break and split.</li>
            <li> Like many people, I do not take time to use rubber go es when scouring sinks, pots, pans, etc.  </li>
            <li> This product has really strengthened them.</li>
            <li> this product really helps my nails to get stronger and grow.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really fuss with them.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> If it hurts you are using too much, so remove polish and give yourself a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to that regimen</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I alo really like the nail balsam.</li>
            <li> and this seems to really help my nails in terms of strength and growth.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend Trind products!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Now they strong and long.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the Trind product to me after showing me her long and strong nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails are long and extremely strong... stronger than I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> My nails are strong and long.  </li>
            <li> My nails are so strong and long</li>
            <li> They are long and strong.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle of Repair and am still using my original bottle of Balsam.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to apply and dry.</li>
            <li> -  Essentially, products that are brushed on one layer on-top of another really can&#x27;t make a significant difference for nails in need of real help because the fresh product doesn&#x27;t make contact with (and thus can&#x27;t penetrate) the nail&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li> how different the over-all condition of my nails is right now for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of frequent use (much more frequent than prescribed), I&#x27;ve only gone through about 2/3.</li>
            <li> I tried Trind Nail Repair exactly as directed for 7 months and it didn&#x27;t help my soft, peeling nails at all.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, need patience to keep doing it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone with splitting nails.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for stronger, longer nails when used as directed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it chips off easily, doesn&#x27;t stay on the ends for more than 2 days</li>
            <li> No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail.</li>
            <li> Even the plain color works like a very light nail polish.</li>
            <li> Really gardens my soft nails.  </li>
            <li> I hope they grow out normally and re-attach to my my nail bed.</li>
            <li> The instructions in the package said to apply a fresh coat daily for two weeks, then twice after that.</li>
            <li> Have received many compliments and have recommended this product to quite a few friends.  </li>
            <li> Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of Nail Repair.    </li>
            <li> Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.    </li>
            <li> I have used Trind for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> New in box like it says.</li>
            <li> I use it every day for 3-4 days and then take it off and start with new layers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my nails are dry and super brittle I decided to take her advice.</li>
            <li> least they are honest and listed the ingredients, but hopefully this company will come up with a formula that is actually natural.</li>
            <li> My nails were breaking easily once grown out past a certain length and were always flaking.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not advertised as such, in my experience there were two critical components (two separate Trind products) to my significant nail improvement.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews and this is probably my first or second time doing so.</li>
            <li> By nature I am a skeptic, but this product surprised me!</li>
            <li> Do exactly as the directions say, give it about 3 weeks, and you will definitely see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and always love it.  </li>
            <li> I use one coat of this product, one coat of Hanson&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure(tm), then a quick dry product by Opi.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.    </li>
            <li> Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.    </li>
            <li> I have struggled with nails that peel, break easily and tear down low my whole life.</li>
            <li> and I guess I&#x27;ll just have to live with my soft, unattractive fingernails.</li>
            <li> The natural color looks pretty, as if you had a French manicure done.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *</li>
            <li> My nails had always split and chilpped easily, but they usually looked decent.  </li>
            <li> Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going \\&quot;Woah, are these really MY nails?\\</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Quimica Alemana which had great reviews but caused a serious skin and cuticle reaction for me.</li>
            <li> After that, I use another clear polish on the nails that had nail bed loss and use the Trind on the nails that did not have any adverse effect.  </li>
            <li> , I like to keep my nails painted close to natural colors or clear to see my natural nail</li>
            <li> The whitish looking bottle comes out clear.  </li>
            <li> which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both of these must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> steer clear of that poison.  </li>
            <li> It is also important to wipe off the rim of the bottle after each use so dried polish doesn&#x27;t break the seal and cause the polish to lose its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> If I go for a professional manicure, I always take my Trind with me for the manicurist to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn&#x27;t for leaving two of my nails with white dots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Trind Natural Nail Repair for 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old</li>
            <li> Use clear or natural color</li>
            <li> About three months ago, I had it with acrylics and gels, and I was determined to grow natural nails.  </li>
            <li> The very minute there was a tiny bit of growth, the nail would break.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one whole bottle and just came back to place another order.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it and recommending it to anyone with my old nail problems.</li>

            <li> B0019RVJGC Trind Nail Repair Natural .30oz]]</li>
            <li> and I will be surprised</li>
            <li> I would never waste money on this product.</li>
            <li> I found Trind Natural Nail Repair online while researching nail products.  </li>
            <li> I always had soft 7 nails that split.</li>
            <li> I tried this and although it is a slow process they have been getting better.  </li>
            <li> After the two weeks of removing and applying everyday (with non-acetone remover!), my nails looked much better, especially the new growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After just 3 weeks of use,for the first time in a very, very long time I have begun to see results.  </li>
            <li> When I use this product consistently, that does not happen and my nails actually look like a french manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time growing my natural nails out because they break and peel easily.  </li>
            <li> is my new favorite beauty secret.  </li>
            <li> I can now wear my nails short and natural with the cool dark polishes</li>
            <li> * how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:    1.</li>
            <li> I started looking into the product reviews and several users have similar experiences if not worse.</li>
            <li> your initial purchase will last a little over 2 months, and if you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll probably get enough product for 3 months or more.    </li>
            <li> I ran out of my first bottle and thought the other products I was using might be helping my constantly soft, breaking nails; unfortunately in a short time my nails were reverting to that again; I reordered Trind and it appears within a couple of weeks I am seeing improvement.  </li>
            <li> Until recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1.</li>
            <li> I would use a regular clear polish on the damaged nails and the Trind on the others.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be alarmed, just one of those busy mom situations we deal with - try different brands of sunscreen, wear rubber gloves or reapply polish!    </li>
            <li> I begin by applying Solar Oil to my bare nails.  </li>
            <li> For the first time ever I have to cut them down.</li>
            <li> - if you have kids - certain products like bug sprays and sunscreens will \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the polish due to acetate).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my review needs to tell you that this stuff really works, because all of the other reviewers have already told you that.  </li>
            <li> My nails are longer &amp; stronger for the first time in my life--I&#x27;ll never go back to artificial nails again :-)</li>
            <li> so believe me, I&#x27;ve been watching out for the possibility that something other than Trind is responsible.</li>
            <li> Now my routine is to use the balsam and repair before applying my nail polish weekly-ish, do my cuticles when they start to grow onto the nail bed too much (every 1-2 mos) and buffing my entire nail-bed when they get rough and ridge-y (every 2-3 mos).</li>
            <li> I used it according to the directions, applying everyday for the first two weeks, then weekly after that.  </li>
            <li> My nails have gone from tissue thin to unbelievably strong.  </li>
            <li> Havent seen much improvement yet, but my nails were a mess</li>
            <li> My nails are not fabulous but they are decent and no longer embarassing which is a major step ahead.    </li>
            <li> &quot; Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch.</li>
            <li> I read the good and bad reviews about this product and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> They still do snag if I do stupid things like dig in the dirt without gloves, but the stuff is great.</li>
            <li> or I would have), but other than that I&#x27;ve been as diligent as possible and as far as I can tell, the only thing that could account for the drastic change is Trind.    </li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well for my extremely thin, weak nails, but for the regimen required I think it could be better.  </li>
            <li> I know that this brand may seem expensive at first glance, but let me assure you that from my perspective, it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Around the 6th week one of my beautiful newly strong nails developed a nasty split well below the fingertip area which was quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The pink part of my nails got smaller and the white part much bigger, as though the nail bed itself was being damaged.  </li>
            <li> Everything else I&#x27;ve tried peels off within a day, usually taking the top layer of my nail with it and consequently further weakening my already weak nails.</li>
            <li> Following that,I applied every other day (same application routine as above) for about a week, and then I resumed near-daily use about a week ago.</li>
            <li> They were extremely soft and brittle and chilpped and peeled and broke and always looked a mess.  </li>
            <li> Trind Natural Nail Repair (one bottle&#x27;s worth since Sept 2011 - 3 1/2 months) exactly as directed, and I \\&quot;graduated\\&quot; to using it as a base coat for color manicure which lasts approx.</li>
            <li> Having long nice nails added a feminine touch to my hands but was IMPOSSIBLE for me to maintain.  </li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t read other testimonials saying 2 weeks wasn&#x27;t quite enough to see results (and in some cases, that it took several weeks for the WOW-style improvement), I might have given up.</li>
            <li> really worked wonders for my brittle and hard to grow nails.</li>
            <li> Anyone that has trouble with their nails, needs to try Trind Natural Repair.</li>
            <li> I never had this happen to me before so it must have been the Trind or, for some strange reason, my body&#x27;s reaction to it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always admired the long nails some girls/women have.</li>
            <li> The only treatment I have ever used that really strengthens my nails, need to use it at least every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The honest-to-goodness truth is that in the last 2 weeks, my nails have grown little white tips that haven&#x27;t split and/or needed to be trimmed off at all!</li>
            <li> After the initial application I experienced awful pain in my fingernails that would radiate through my joints.</li>
            <li> I actually have to file them down  every couple of weeks because they get too long.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every single nail strengthening product out there, no kidding.</li>
            <li> If u have nails that split &amp; break, or are thin, Trind REALLY fixes ALL that!</li>
            <li> my nails are very dry, brittle and would not grow.......</li>
            <li> After having gel nails removed the last time, my nails were a mess.  </li>
            <li> Although Trind prescribes the above routine daily for the first two weeks followed by a break and then intermittent application a couple of times a week, my nails were bad enough that I chose to follow guidelines I found in a number of reviews.</li>
            <li> Because they would always occur right where the nail bed ended and the tip began, if left unattended the inevitable result was a painful, unsightly (occasionally infected) mess.</li>
            <li> I really love what it did for my badly bitten nails, however.  </li>
            <li> I would STILL chip and ruin the job though even when I was careful and maintained at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nails grow faster and they are much harder.</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails harder, so they can grow longer.  </li>
            <li> Another 5 gals ordered this product so I will be curious to see how it works for them.  </li>
            <li> This product did not deliver as expected, so I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> A few of the other nail treatment products worked for a few months before following the same pattern.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 2 decades, I&#x27;ve spoken to about a billion nail techs and tried everything they recommended from brush-on treatments (e.g. Nailtiques, Pink Armor, etc) to lotions (e.g. Mane N&#x27; Tail Hoof Maker) to dietary remedies (e.g. gelatin, various vitamins).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably take a break for a few days again now and then do every other day (3 or 4 times a week) for awhile before I drop back to twice a week or less.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands because my nails are extremely weak and soft.</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended it after one of her other clients started using it.  </li>
            <li> You do have to follow the directions and reapply every day (or every other day) for the 1st two weeks.</li>
            <li> They were extremely weak/thin and overly flexible.</li>
            <li> Other than file and polish at home</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand over any other nail strengthener.</li>
            <li> I now have very rough surfaced nails, Trind on part and rest uncovered and peeling.</li>
            <li> Be very careful not to get any of it on your cuticles or surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times hoping my nails would get use to it as I really wanted to like this product and hoped it would work for me, but alas it&#x27;s a bust for me.  </li>
            <li> (my nails were always so weird even high-end salon artificials would pop right off after a few days).    </li>
            <li> or so I have been trying every nail strengthening product and supplement I can find, usually trying them for about 3 months each because that&#x27;s how long it takes for the nail to grow.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the solution, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> I had tried every product but my nails were always thin, soft and peeling.  </li>
            <li> so I broke down and got it.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I was not let down.</li>
            <li> The pink pearl color is a waste of money...peels off after a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week now, and there is already a noticeable difference in my nails.</li>
            <li> I does peel easily unfortunately, not a negative just an unfortunate feature.</li>
            <li> My nails were a mess.  </li>
            <li> My nails were just a mess, weak,chipping, no growth.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just a little trial and error to see if this can work for you.  </li>
            <li> My nails have been weak and splitting for the last 7-8 years.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the nail beds returned.  </li>
            <li> but so far, I am NOT impressed</li>
            <li> i was applying it everyday for a month</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my nails spliting and breaking</li>
            <li> My nails were destroyed from a few manicures I had.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> It was not available for a while, but has now returned to the market.  </li>
            <li> Within the next 2 weeks, the same thing happened to 4 other nails, forcing me to cut all of them back to very painful levels.</li>
            <li> My job puts a lot of abuse on my nails - what I don&#x27;t like is that you have to remove it nightly, or at the least every other night, to get results.  </li>
            <li> I had artificial nail for many years and every time I attempted to remove them my natural nail was so bad I went back to the artificial option.  </li>
            <li> What I mean by this is, they&#x27;re much less flexible and they feel thicker and \\&quot;harder.\\</li>
            <li> I am pursuing other options for my weak nails.</li>
            <li> After removing artificial nails, I tried everything I could find to repair my soft, damaged nail beds.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and am using it again.</li>
            <li> a real mess after a couple of years of using gel polish.</li>
            <li> They are very small</li>
            <li> I used the product for three days and found my nail bed seriously shrinking.  </li>
            <li> I seriously cannot over-state</li>
            <li> My nails now grow to ridiculous lengths and my friends look at them with envy -</li>
            <li> In any event, it is obviuosly not good for me</li>
            <li> At the time, my nails were weak, brittle and peeling.  </li>
            <li> My nails were so weak and brittle that I could not even grasp the clasp on my chain.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so thick that the color lasts forever on them!</li>
            <li> I get down and dirty.  </li>
            <li> BUT I am very hard on my hands between housework and typing and kids</li>
            <li> So I can see the nail growth but the nail is thin and weak causing hang nails and soreness.</li>
            <li> I had the worse nails in the world.</li>
            <li> When I got tired of the time/expense of them, I tried Trind.</li>
            <li> I must start by explaining that life-long, I have had terrible, stubby nails with problems that were resistant to absolutely every remedy I could find (specifics below).</li>
            <li> I have horrible nails and have tried about every product I could find with nothing really helping.</li>
            <li> , that is the secret.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, bendy nails</li>
            <li> This Nail repair seems to work on my poor nails.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and my nails are in worse shape than before.</li>
            <li> Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve typically worn my nails in this ugly, stubby condition</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;dramatic decrease\\&quot; because I&#x27;m scared to jinx it.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But one day, I just got tired of fake nails.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the issue is, but I can&#x27;t use this product as I find it too painful.</li>
            <li> My nails were very weak and tended to break and split.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t done a blind trial of Trind versus a placebo (I didn&#x27;t have someone to help with it every day</li>
            <li> I have terrible peeling nails, this product actually seals the nail surface, preventing my nails from peeling.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my nails continued to break, so I figured I&#x27;d give the Nail Repair another try.  </li>
            <li> For being as expensive as it is I was looking forward to using the product.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to order this because it seemed expensive, but my nails were chipped and peeling.  </li>
            <li> but I was desperate</li>
            <li> I wore acrylics for years but had to stop when our hospital prohibited nurses from wearing artificial nails.</li>
            <li> This product was extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> My nails were so bad at that time</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve always been jealous. :(</li>
            <li> my boyfriend had nicer nails than me. :(</li>
            <li> so I cannot tell you about using as a base coat when getting a manuicure</li>
            <li> Since using it as a base coat, I have never had a nail break, peel, or rip.  </li>
            <li> I was doubtful yet hopeful and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Now I use it as a base coat under my polish.  </li>
            <li> I stopped putting tips and wraps and just use this as my base coat</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I tried two bottles of Trind nail repair; very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely horrible and should be taken off the market.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Seems to work pretty well for my extremely thin, weak nails, but for the regimen required I think it could be better.  My job puts a lot of abuse on my nails - what I don&#x27;t like is that you have to remove it nightly, or at the least every other night, to get results.  I am pursuing other options for my weak nails.</li>
            <li> This product has loved up to its claims. I use it regularly have great results</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any kind. I had the worse nails in the world. Now they strong and long. For the first time ever I have to cut them down. Best product for repairing nails!!!</li>
            <li> Dries out your nails.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my nails are hard and super healthy!!</li>
            <li> I have using this product as directed. I have ben using the product for four weeks , There is no improvement in the condition of my finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Stuart</li>
            <li> I have tried every single nail strengthening product out there, no kidding. I&#x27;ve spent thousands because my nails are extremely weak and soft. I never had white on my nails or had nails longer than my fingertips ever in my life until I used this stuff for a month. Do it as the instructions tell you, and I swear it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my review needs to tell you that this stuff really works, because all of the other reviewers have already told you that.  What I do want to tell you is that you have to pay attention to the directions. Here is what I have learned and when i stick to it, I have no problems - just long strong nails!   - apply ONE coat - DO NOT APPLY TWO COATS - the thicker the coat the faster it peels off - more is not better, it is just more.   - reapply ever day or so. I does peel easily unfortunately, not a negative just an unfortunate feature.I don&#x27;t have time for manicures so I cannot tell you about using as a base coat when getting a manuicure BUT I am very hard on my hands between housework and typing and kids - I have to reapply every 2-3 days to keep my nails looking good.  and i take the time to do, because the result is worth it.   - if you have kids - certain products like bug sprays and sunscreens will \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the polish due to acetate). don&#x27;t be alarmed, just one of those busy mom situations we deal with - try different brands of sunscreen, wear rubber gloves or reapply polish!    Good Luck! i LOVE my Trind for giving me long strong nails - hope you will find this useful!</li>
            <li> I read the good and bad reviews about this product and decided to try it.  My nails have not looked this good in 20 years.  Yes, I experienced some loss of my nail bed on certain nails.  I stopped using it on those nails.  After a few weeks, the nail beds returned.  I would use a regular clear polish on the damaged nails and the Trind on the others.  I now use one coat of Trind on all my nails on the first day.  After that, I use another clear polish on the nails that had nail bed loss and use the Trind on the nails that did not have any adverse effect.  There&#x27;s just a little trial and error to see if this can work for you.  It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years.  At the time, my nails were weak, brittle and peeling.  After just a couple of weeks,they began to grow out and now are very strong. You need to use the product every week and follow the regimen of buffing with a smooth buffer. It is also important to wipe off the rim of the bottle after each use so dried polish doesn&#x27;t break the seal and cause the polish to lose its effectiveness. I never thought I would have nice nails again. I love this product! If I go for a professional manicure, I always take my Trind with me for the manicurist to use. They were amazed at how much my nails improved.</li>
            <li> This item undoubtedly works but it does contain formaldehyde. I quit using it, it sits unused on my shelf.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail strengthening product you will ever find!  My manicurist recommended it after one of her other clients started using it.  Since using it as a base coat, I have never had a nail break, peel, or rip.  It is an amazing product.  Highly recommended.  Well worth the price.  A single bottle lasts for many months of weekly manicures.</li>
            <li> I have never had strong nails, so for years I had acrylic nails.  When I got tired of the time/expense of them, I tried Trind. Amazing: my nails have never looked so good nor been so strong.  Had to buy a better nail file to shape them. A great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve always had a hard time growing my natural nails out because they break and peel easily.  So I would give up and get acrylics so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with it. But one day, I just got tired of fake nails. I took them all off, walked into my beauty supply store and asked the saleswoman for the best nail repair.  She quickly recommended Trind.  It was a bit pricey and I thought she was only trying to sell it to me because it was the most expensive--but I was desperate so I broke down and got it. I used it devoutly as directed and within 2 months, my nails were the most healthy they have ever been.  So yes it does take a while to work, but it DOES work!  I just read the reviewer who said it didn&#x27;t work for her but she only used it for 2 weeks.  Obviously if your nails are that damaged, it&#x27;s going to take longer than two weeks for this stuff to kick in.  After using it for 2 months, my nails are stronger, thicker and have yet to peel or break.  I just can&#x27;t get over it.  This stuff is absolutely fantastic! Worth every penny! I can now wear my nails short and natural with the cool dark polishes and they&#x27;re so thick that the color lasts forever on them! But like I said, when you get it, give it time. 2 months flies by and you won&#x27;t regret it! I promise!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for some time now and find it to be great.  My nails have grown and putting Trind Natural Nail Repair on them once a week, has kept them looking real good.</li>
            <li> Tissue-thin nails that dissolved if you looked at them, now very strong and flexible. They still do snag if I do stupid things like dig in the dirt without gloves, but the stuff is great. Nails are not brittle. I&#x27;d like it if they were a bit stronger, but hey - this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the first of the Trind products that I tried.  (about 10 years ago)  It, and the Trind Nail Balsam, are the only products I use on my fingernails.  (Toes get bright colors!!) All I can say is that they work, and I have recommended them to many people that now agree!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Triad for about two weeks and so far I&#x27;m very disappointed. Nothing has changed. My nails still break off and snag on everything. I&#x27;ve found Triad starts peeling off my nails after about two days. I&#x27;ll will keep using it for a couple more weeks but so far, I am NOT impressed</li>
            <li> I have very soft nails that peel easily, especially on my right hand that I cook and do dishes with.  Trind is the only product that has helped strengthen my nails and keep them from peeling and breaking.  It dries quickly so I can apply and go!</li>
            <li> I have tried many nail strengthening products but this is the only one that really works. You do have to follow the directions and reapply every day (or every other day) for the 1st two weeks.</li>
            <li> I never had good strong nails,but this product helped me. Nails are not splitting anymore and they look healthy. i was applying it everyday for a month and then i start seeing the difference. Highly recommended, need patience to keep doing it. but it worth it. I ordered third bottle already.[[ASIN:B001CSGMTW Trind Natural Nail Repair - Original Gloss]]</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying I&#x27;ve always been a bit self concious about my hands.  They are very small but I work with them all the time so a bit muscular.  Having long nice nails added a feminine touch to my hands but was IMPOSSIBLE for me to maintain.  Between gardening, teaching, house cleaning, cooking, sports and playing with my animals they would be ruined!  I&#x27;m also not the kind to wear gloves when working ...I get down and dirty.  I paid a TON for regular manicures, tips, silk tips, permanent french etc.  I would STILL chip and ruin the job though even when I was careful and maintained at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite beauty secret.  It protects my nails and allows them to grow.  The best is that they are natural nails!  I can still button my jeans, type, cook without them getting in the way like wraps or tips would.  I file and clip them to make sure that they are nice and even and that&#x27;s all they need.  It did take a while for my nails to adjust and you have to follow the directions of reapplying the nail polish every day or two for 2 weeks.  I saw results right away and now I only apply the polish 2 times a week with 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing is when everyone asks your secret you really can answer honestly that all you do is put polish on them!</li>
            <li> I really like this product I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn&#x27;t for leaving two of my nails with white dots, at first I thought it was the nail polish but when I cleaned the TRIND nail polish off the dots were still  there.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions as they were written and this happened, I like to keep my nails painted close to natural colors or clear to see my natural nail but I cannot do that know because you can see the white dots and it does not look pretty it could also be that I hit my nails and it could have pushed my nails apart in the place were the dots are but honestly I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;But I will say that TRIND nail Repair is amazing on making your nails extremely strong after applying three to four coats of the TRIND nail repair polish&lt;br /&gt;(REMEMBER one coat of nail polish each day do not bulk up four or more coats of nail repair in one day) each coat for each day thats how you build up, you do that for two weeks and then after one coat every week.&lt;br /&gt;This product is on the pricy side but it works beautifully and fast if you want your nails strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works...I noticed results right away!  After two weeks my nails look 100% better</li>
            <li> After removing artificial nails, I tried everything I could find to repair my soft, damaged nail beds. I happened to find Trind mentioned in a blog post, tried it &amp; now this is the only nail hardener I&#x27;ll use. My nails are longer &amp; stronger for the first time in my life--I&#x27;ll never go back to artificial nails again :-)</li>
            <li> I have the worlds weakest nails, i was rec&#x27;d this product by a youtube girl I follow and I must say that I was not let down. I love the product and how it truly does speed along the growth of your nails.</li>
            <li> I used the product for three days and found my nail bed seriously shrinking.  The pink part of my nails got smaller and the white part much bigger, as though the nail bed itself was being damaged.  I&#x27;m alarmed enough by this reaction to post this comment.[[ASIN:B001CSGMTW Trind Natural Nail Repair - Original Gloss]]</li>
            <li> And I only need to polish my nails every two weeks.  The whitish looking bottle comes out clear.  The pink pearl color is a waste of money...peels off after a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Trind Natural Nail Repair for 4 years.  It&#x27;s the only product I use on my nails.  Nothing else - polish or nail treatments - stays on my nails.  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried peels off within a day, usually taking the top layer of my nail with it and consequently further weakening my already weak nails. A few of the other nail treatment products worked for a few months before following the same pattern.  But Trind continues to work for me.  My nails look good and are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been.  I only hope it doesn&#x27;t disappear from the market.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my nails after one week of using this product. It&#x27;s now 2 months and my nails are much stronger and do not peel and break like before.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Helps keep my nails looking good for days longer.</li>
            <li> Trind Natural Nail Repair works great!!! It really does strenghten your nails so they do not break and split. The nails grow faster and they are much harder. This product is wonderful and I would recomend it to everybody who wants to improve their nails. You can actually see the results after one application.  The natural color looks pretty, as if you had a French manicure done.</li>
            <li> Anyone that has trouble with their nails, needs to try Trind Natural Repair. I have trouble with my nails spliting and breaking but since I have been using this it&#x27;s amazing in the difference.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It has brought my nails back to life. I had artificial nail for many years and every time I attempted to remove them my natural nail was so bad I went back to the artificial option.  Trind has stopped that cycle. Thank you, thank you.....</li>
            <li> I promise that what you&#x27;re about to read is a legitimate customer review and not an advertisement or commercial product endorsement.    I must start by explaining that life-long, I have had terrible, stubby nails with problems that were resistant to absolutely every remedy I could find (specifics below). Over the past 2 decades, I&#x27;ve spoken to about a billion nail techs and tried everything they recommended from brush-on treatments (e.g. Nailtiques, Pink Armor, etc) to lotions (e.g. Mane N&#x27; Tail Hoof Maker) to dietary remedies (e.g. gelatin, various vitamins). Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.    Until recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1. They were extremely weak/thin and overly flexible. 2. No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch. No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail. Because they would always occur right where the nail bed ended and the tip began, if left unattended the inevitable result was a painful, unsightly (occasionally infected) mess. Thus once a split would start, I had no choice but to clip the entire tip off. Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve typically worn my nails in this ugly, stubby condition and I&#x27;d pretty much lost hope that anything else was a possibility for me (my nails were always so weird even high-end salon artificials would pop right off after a few days).    To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.    I had all but given up on the prospect of any product working for me until I read something that confirmed what I&#x27;d suspected for some time -  Essentially, products that are brushed on one layer on-top of another really can&#x27;t make a significant difference for nails in need of real help because the fresh product doesn&#x27;t make contact with (and thus can&#x27;t penetrate) the nail&#x27;s surface. This, combined with the countless Trind testimonials all over the web inspired me to give it a try. Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.    I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *drastically* improved my nails! Much to my great surprise and delight, my nails are significantly stronger than ever before. What I mean by this is, they&#x27;re much less flexible and they feel thicker and \\&quot;harder.\\&quot; Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR. I say \\&quot;dramatic decrease\\&quot; because I&#x27;m scared to jinx it. okay? The honest-to-goodness truth is that in the last 2 weeks, my nails have grown little white tips that haven&#x27;t split and/or needed to be trimmed off at all! I seriously cannot over-state how different the over-all condition of my nails is right now for the first time in my life. I&#x27;m a scientist so believe me, I&#x27;ve been watching out for the possibility that something other than Trind is responsible. Granted, I haven&#x27;t done a blind trial of Trind versus a placebo (I didn&#x27;t have someone to help with it every day or I would have), but other than that I&#x27;ve been as diligent as possible and as far as I can tell, the only thing that could account for the drastic change is Trind.    I know that this brand may seem expensive at first glance, but let me assure you that from my perspective, it really isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. Primarily, I feel this is an excellent value because the amount of product you&#x27;re getting for the price goes a pretty long way. After 6 weeks of frequent use (much more frequent than prescribed), I&#x27;ve only gone through about 2/3. So figure if you use it as often as I have (see below) your initial purchase will last a little over 2 months, and if you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll probably get enough product for 3 months or more.    For those who wish to know *exactly* how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:    1. Although it&#x27;s not advertised as such, in my experience there were two critical components (two separate Trind products) to my significant nail improvement. These are Trind Nail Repair *and* Trind Nail Balsam. I followed what I&#x27;d read in several reviews which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both of these must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks. Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of Nail Repair.    2. Although the Nail Balsam instructions say the product should sit on the nail for two minutes before you rub it in, I always allow the wet product ample time to be thoroughly absorbed into the nail on its own (around 15 mins).      3. Although Trind prescribes the above routine daily for the first two weeks followed by a break and then intermittent application a couple of times a week, my nails were bad enough that I chose to follow guidelines I found in a number of reviews. For what it&#x27;s worth, here is what I did - I used both products religiously every day (as described above) for 3 weeks solid and then took a break for about 4 days. Following that,I applied every other day (same application routine as above) for about a week, and then I resumed near-daily use about a week ago. I&#x27;ll probably take a break for a few days again now and then do every other day (3 or 4 times a week) for awhile before I drop back to twice a week or less.    4. Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer. After the first 2 (even 3) weeks, my nails seemed a bit stronger, but they were still flimsy and still cracking at the sides. If I hadn&#x27;t read other testimonials saying 2 weeks wasn&#x27;t quite enough to see results (and in some cases, that it took several weeks for the WOW-style improvement), I might have given up. For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going \\&quot;Woah, are these really MY nails?\\&quot; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.    Look, I obviously can&#x27;t guarantee with 100% certainty that your nails will respond the way mine did - Lord knows, I have read thousands of reviews like this for products that did nothing for me. However, given how resistant to other products my nails have always been and how dramatically they&#x27;ve improved with Trind, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a fair try. If this can help *my* nails, I&#x27;m confident that it can help many, if not most others.    I hope this review has been helpful.    And THANK YOU, TRIND, for giving me what I never thought I could have - nails that I feel good about!</li>
            <li> Improved the look of my nails.  Purchased to improve my nails after having gel nails taken off.</li>
            <li> The most wonderful treatment for bad nails.  I use it exclusively and my nails have never been better.</li>
            <li> My first few weeks of using this product were very encouraging - nails grew stronger and longer, which was great since I never had nice nails before. Around the 6th week one of my beautiful newly strong nails developed a nasty split well below the fingertip area which was quite uncomfortable. Within the next 2 weeks, the same thing happened to 4 other nails, forcing me to cut all of them back to very painful levels. I never had this happen to me before so it must have been the Trind or, for some strange reason, my body&#x27;s reaction to it. In any event, it is obviuosly not good for me and I guess I&#x27;ll just have to live with my soft, unattractive fingernails.</li>
            <li> For once, a product that does exactly what it says it will!  I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my own nails for 25 years.  Intermittent acrylic nail use had damaged them to the point they just wouldn&#x27;t grow before they peeled, split and broke.  After having gel nails removed the last time, my nails were a mess.  I began using Trind according to the directions, and filing off the damaged nails as they grew out until only healthy nail was growing.  Now, my nails are long, strong and beautiful.  I actually have to file them down  every couple of weeks because they get too long.  Trind makes a great base coat, as it doesn&#x27;t peel and flake off like regular nail products.  For less than the price of one manicure, you can buy this product, and with a little time and patience, grow your own beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve had problems with my nails FOREVER. I&#x27;m 18 years old and I&#x27;ve always admired the long nails some girls/women have. And I&#x27;ve always been jealous. :( BUT, I found this and everything changed. I was doubtful yet hopeful and it worked wonders. My nails have never been so strong. EVER. I put it on everyday for two weeks (more like a month lol) and I removed it daily with the Trind nail polish remover. Before putting on the nail polish I made sure to wash my hands and moisturize them with lotion. I would recommend this to ANYONE who has problems with their nails. I never write reviews and this is probably my first or second time doing so. I had nails that wouldn&#x27;t grow and they would peel so easily, my boyfriend had nicer nails than me. :( but I&#x27;m soooooo excited to have found this because now I dont have to cover them up with color nail polish. All I need is my Trind and I&#x27;m ready to go! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product Trind Natural Nail Repair (one bottle&#x27;s worth since Sept 2011 - 3 1/2 months) exactly as directed, and I \\&quot;graduated\\&quot; to using it as a base coat for color manicure which lasts approx. 4-7 days. I think it has helped my nail edges as they had become quite soft as I aged. They still aren&#x27;t as strong as they used to be, but it&#x27;s an improvement. I use one coat of this product, one coat of Hanson&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure(tm), then a quick dry product by Opi. I will probably try Trind&#x27;s color as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to everyone with soft fine nails.  Since I tried everything decided to take a chance on this product.  I am so pleased I have been using and gifting for over 10 years.  Great product.  Use clear or natural color you will be very pleased.  Trind is amazing.  Strength and length.  Easy to use.  Just polish.  Like many people, I do not take time to use rubber go es when scouring sinks, pots, pans, etc.  No problem with Trind.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> Effective if used regularly.</li>
            <li> I have used Trind for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  I now have fingernails that aren&#x27;t split and stubs.  I tried it on a whim because nothing else had worked when I saw the ad in a flier.  Best money I have ever spent.  I now have two relatives using it.</li>
            <li> Trind is a nail product that I recommend to all of my friends!  It is amazing in how it works, and for the first time in over fifty years, I have beautiful, strong, long fingernails.  It is like magic!</li>
            <li> It truly works.  This product makes your nails harder, so they can grow longer.  I highly recommend it.  Try it,</li>
            <li> Super product that works. I have used it for a while now and it is easy to apply and dry.</li>
            <li> About three months ago, I had it with acrylics and gels, and I was determined to grow natural nails.  The problem was mine were ruined and they had never been very strong to begin with.  My nails were so bad at that time, I couldn&#x27;t stand to look at them.  The very minute there was a tiny bit of growth, the nail would break.  I tried salon products and Sally Hansen -- nothing worked.  I saw an ad in a magazine for this stuff and thought...why not?  I used it exactly as directed, taking it off (with the Trind remover) and reapplying every two or three days.  I am not kidding you when I say my nails are strong and healthy and NATURAL for the first time in my life.  I&#x27;ve used one whole bottle and just came back to place another order.  I decided it was only fair to share my experience: for me, this nail repair was kind of miraculous.</li>
            <li> The only treatment I have ever used that really strengthens my nails, need to use it at least every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase and use it</li>
            <li> Came super fast! New in box like it says. Let&#x27;s see if it works. My stepmom recommended it to me and her nails are beautiful from just 2 weeks of use!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with nails that peel, break easily and tear down low my whole life. I have tried a number of products that seem to work well initially but then disappoint. This product has really strengthened them. It also doesn&#x27;t peel off or turn my nails yellow. It does require reapplication often but is certainly easy enough to do and I think it&#x27;s worth having nails that not only look nicer but feel better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like a miracle for nails. My nails were brittle, broke easily after a certain length and then after a year of gel overlays, they were destroyed.   I bought the starter kit with both the Trind Nail Repair and the Nail Balsam and used it EXACTLY as described in the pamphlet it comes with, except I didn&#x27;t buy the Trind cuticle products, just used some drug store ones. After the two weeks of removing and applying everyday (with non-acetone remover!), my nails looked much better, especially the new growth. Now my routine is to use the balsam and repair before applying my nail polish weekly-ish, do my cuticles when they start to grow onto the nail bed too much (every 1-2 mos) and buffing my entire nail-bed when they get rough and ridge-y (every 2-3 mos). After six months my nails are like ROCKS. I just bought my second bottle of Repair and am still using my original bottle of Balsam. My nails now grow to ridiculous lengths and my friends look at them with envy - I tell them all - BUY TRIND!</li>
            <li> But----the nails began to separate from my fingers.  It&#x27;s a type of fungus, I guess. I had to stop using Trind.  I really love what it did for my badly bitten nails, however.  I hope they grow out normally and re-attach to my my nail bed.</li>
            <li> As a first time user I was surprised but happy to find that this product is as good as advertised. What more need be said.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have tried that actually works....my nails are very dry, brittle and would not grow.......using this product as directed improves nails so that they can grow.......GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> this product really helps my nails to get stronger and grow. Takes a couple of weeks for it to kick in but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is the only thing that makes my nails grow. I have used it for years. Package came quickly. Happy with this order.</li>
            <li> My nails have always peeled and shattered and no matter what nail strengthening product I used they remained the same.  A friend recommended the Trind product to me after showing me her long and strong nails.  After using Trind for 3 months my nails are 1/4 inch long, strong and no chips or flakes!  I love this product and now that I&#x27;ve found it I will keep using it and recommending it to anyone with my old nail problems.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, and it is really wonderful. Feeds the nails and keeps a manicure looking great for a much longer time when used shortly after a manicure. I use it as a bottom coat and top coat for manicures, as well.</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use this product.  Yoo soon.to tell.</li>
            <li> Yes,&lt;br /&gt;is amazing, i will recommend this to my friends and family. happy holidays!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years and wouldn&#x27;t have nails if it wasn&#x27;t for Trind Nail Repair.  Love the colors, also, and those stay on forever.  I have recommended this product to many others who have had success growing their nails after using it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not attached to the handle&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be used&lt;br /&gt;What can I do?</li>
            <li> I have been using it as directed.  Havent seen much improvement yet, but my nails were a mess so I guess it will take some time.  :)</li>
            <li> Trind Nail Repair:  Trind Nail Repair is the only product that has helped me grow my nails to any length.  My hands and fingernails were damaged in an accident in 1978.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked except Trind.[[ASIN:B0019RVJGC Trind Nail Repair Natural Gloss .30oz]]</li>
            <li> I have horrible nails and have tried about every product I could find with nothing really helping. My manicurist recommended this and I have to say that it works to help my peeling and splitting nails better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. The only negative is that it chips off easily, doesn&#x27;t stay on the ends for more than 2 days so I have to keep reapplying. But it helps and that&#x27;s what matters to me.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula and this stuff now EATS your fingernails off. It&#x27;s absolutely horrible and should be taken off the market. Don&#x27;t buy it!! Buyer Beware!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product I have tried, and I have tried lots and lots of nail strengtheners.  My nails are long and extremely strong... stronger than I have ever had.  I did follow the program closely and probably used every day for one month or more before dropping to once or twice a week.  Overall took about 3 months to get my nail issues totally resolved after years of using gel on my nails.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Trind fan!  My nails had always split and chilpped easily, but they usually looked decent.  Other than file and polish at home I didn&#x27;t really fuss with them.  However, following treatments of chemotherapy, my nails were ruined.  They were extremely soft and brittle and chilpped and peeled and broke and always looked a mess.  Then I discovered Trind Nail Repair.  I used it according to the directions, applying everyday for the first two weeks, then weekly after that.  Now I use it as a base coat under my polish.  My nails have never looked better or been stronger.  Been using this product for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short, bitten nails all my life that split and break. I&#x27;ve tried almost every product ever recommended by anyone with no luck. However&#x27;, I now have nails that actually look healthy, even though I keep them shorter for work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It does not have chemicals in it that cause my nails to peel or break.  I prefer this brand over any other nail strengthener.</li>
            <li> It felt like my nail bed was burning when I put this on.  I tried it a few times hoping my nails would get use to it as I really wanted to like this product and hoped it would work for me, but alas it&#x27;s a bust for me.  Not sure what the issue is, but I can&#x27;t use this product as I find it too painful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this polish for some time now and I love it.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my nails since I started using it.  It is a must have nail product!</li>
            <li> A product that does what it says it will do.  My granddaughter and I have found the longer nails we wanted.</li>
            <li> Not so much. You have to keep taking it off and putting it on.</li>
            <li> My nails were destroyed from a few manicures I had.  I was sure nothing could help.  A family member told me about Trind.  I thought why not??  I was absolutely amazed at the results in a short time.  In the first month, I knew my nails were getting stronger, but at the end of 3 months, I was the envy of many as I beautiful strong nails.  I now have 5 friends and family members using this product.  It is a MUST TRY if you have a problem with your nails.....</li>
            <li> I tried Trind Nail Repair exactly as directed for 7 months and it didn&#x27;t help my soft, peeling nails at all.  I called for advice several times and followed it religiously, but nothing changed.  I bought from a seller who gave a money back guarantee, which I got.  I&#x27;m glad it worked for others. Maybe my nails are hopeless![[ASIN:B0019RVJGC Trind Nail Repair Natural .30oz]]</li>
            <li> My nails are still peeling on the tips but the Trind is on the nails, what has not peeled off. I can not get it off. Tried nail polish remover. I now have very rough surfaced nails, Trind on part and rest uncovered and peeling.</li>
            <li> My nails have been weak and splitting for the last 7-8 years.  I had articial nails for about 3 years which I loved, but I couldn&#x27;t keep up with the maintenance.  So I had them removed and the last 3 years or so I have been trying every nail strengthening product and supplement I can find, usually trying them for about 3 months each because that&#x27;s how long it takes for the nail to grow.  This is the first one I am re-ordering because it&#x27;s the first one that&#x27;s made a difference on my nails.  I&#x27;ve been using it with the Trind Nail Balsam.    I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement in my nails for the first couple of months, but that was fine because I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles.  My cuticles started looking better sooner, I assume from the nail balsam.  My nails are not fabulous but they are decent and no longer embarassing which is a major step ahead.    I remove the nail repair with non-acetone remover and re-apply it every couple of days.    I&#x27;m reordering the Nail Repair and the Nail Balsam and I&#x27;m also going to try the Cuticle Balsam.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my nails needed.  I followed the instructions and my nails are amazingly better.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for strength and general health of my nails!</li>
            <li> Brilliant! It makes your nails stronger and longer. Even the plain color works like a very light nail polish. Your nails look healthier!</li>
            <li> I have terrible peeling nails, this product actually seals the nail surface, preventing my nails from peeling. You do have to repeat process often if your hands are washed or in water a lot.</li>
            <li> My nails were a mess.  Splitting and cracking no matter what I tried.  I&#x27;d been using nail proteins for years and they were no longer working for me.  I tried this and although it is a slow process they have been getting better.  I did have 8 nails damaged and now I have two.  I have been using this since May now so I&#x27;m content with the progress.</li>
            <li> This is the only nail repair product that I have ever used that does what it claims. A friend told me about it and I&#x27;ve used it faithfully ever since.  I even bought some for my brother. If you have severly damaged nails this works.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from my nail technician. She swore it was a miracle product!&lt;br /&gt;Since my nails are dry and super brittle I decided to take her advice. The instructions in the package said to apply a fresh coat daily for two weeks, then twice after that. After the initial application I experienced awful pain in my fingernails that would radiate through my joints. The second, third, fourth day all the same. I decided to look online and found that others had the same issues. SO HERE IS THE KEY... If it hurts you are using too much, so remove polish and give yourself a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I found I want experiencing the pain any longer</li>
            <li> This makes my nails beautiful and strong!!!!  This product makes a huge a difference in the growth of my nails.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product at Bliss Spa.... It has saved my nail. Seems to make them stronger and they grow faster.... It seems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks frosted but it&#x27;s not.. 2 coats of just this and I will be surprised if you don&#x27;t like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price</li>
            <li> Thank you for getting this to me so quickly.  Really gardens my soft nails.  Gives my nails (&amp; my pocketbook) a rest from no-chip manicures.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have any nails it it were for Trind!</li>
            <li> Have used product for years....it NEVER FAILS TO DO A GREAT JOB!  Amazon never fails to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I tried two bottles of Trind nail repair; very disappointed. Even after following instructions it did nothing for my nails. In fact, they started to break and tear. I would never waste money on this product.</li>
            <li> I told my co-worker how lucky she was to be able to grow such beautiful natural nails. I wore acrylics for years but had to stop when our hospital prohibited nurses from wearing artificial nails. I had tried every product but my nails were always thin, soft and peeling.  She told me it wasn&#x27;t luck, it was a product called Trind. She gave me a bottle as a gift for Christmas. I started using it January 1 and this product has been amazing. This is the first time since trying to grow my own nails that I have had to file them because they were TOO LONG! I put a fresh coat on every Sunday night and then re-apply another coat every day or so. I use a nail whitening pencil under the tips and people think I get French manicures.  Now I am the one getting compliments! Another 5 gals ordered this product so I will be curious to see how it works for them.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this product did not bother me at all, in fact my cuticles never looked better. I had previously tried the Quimica Alemana which had great reviews but caused a serious skin and cuticle reaction for me. Everyone has different results to different products but I would definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> My opinion of this product keeps changing.  When I first tried it, I experienced the nail splitting others have mentioned, so I abandoned it and just conditioned my nails instead.  Unfortunately, my nails continued to break, so I figured I&#x27;d give the Nail Repair another try.  I finally found the solution, at least for me.  And that is to keep my nails super-hydrated while using this product.  The combination seems to work.  I begin by applying Solar Oil to my bare nails.  After that, I use the Trind Nail Balsam.  Once that has soaked in, I apply the Nail Repair and/or polish, and then a final coat of Solar Oil, followed by my regular hand moisturizer.  Whether or not my nails are polished, I apply Solar Oil twice a day to my nails to keep them hydrated.  Thanks to that regimen, I now have the longest, strongest nails I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  In conclusion, this product worked for me, but only if I keep my nails moisturized.  Using Solar Oil twice a day religiously seems to be the key.</li>
            <li> I found Trind Natural Nail Repair online while researching nail products.  My nails were very weak and tended to break and split.  I decided to try the starter set - Nail Repair, Cuticle Balsam and Nail Balsam.  I have been using the product for about six months.  My nails have NEVER been stronger.  I am extremely pleased with the product, and the price is very reasonable for what the product does.</li>
            <li> By nature I am a skeptic, but this product surprised me! I have not had strong nails ever. I do now! Buy this product! It works.</li>
            <li> this product really works! I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a product that would stay on and help my nails strengthen after removing acrylic nails. The directions tell you to apply it once a day for two weeks then once a week after that. After a week of following the directions it started to lift and peel. The color ends up a milky color after about three applications which isn&#x27;t attractive and the brush detached from the cover after three days of use. I paid over thirtyfive dollars for this product and had higher expectations for the price. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> If u have nails that split &amp; break, or are thin, Trind REALLY fixes ALL that! It&#x27;s AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  I had used this product before but had been told it was no longer available.  I was so excited to be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I love it.  My nails usually get nicks in them at the top and sides and break easily.  When I use this product consistently, that does not happen and my nails actually look like a french manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of strengtheners without success.  The Trind products are amazing.  I have the &amp;#34;Perfect System&amp;#34; kit and so cannot say which specific item was the key to solving my nail woes.  It seems the Nail Balsam and Natural Gloss are likley the primary components to breakage relief.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I started using it when I decided I couldn&#x27;t afford acrylic nails anymore.  My nails are strong and long.  In fact I have to file them with a battery operated nail file.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this long, but think I am going to like it better than most.</li>
            <li> Do exactly as the directions say, give it about 3 weeks, and you will definitely see the difference.  Be very careful not to get any of it on your cuticles or surrounding skin. It dries the skin and hurts.  Does great on strengthening nails.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for about 3 years now and love, love it.  It totally changed my nails.  They look fabulous now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the 3 sided/type buffing board before applying, that is the secret.  The instructions say to do it daily for a couple of weeks at the beginning.  I have always done it just once a week and from the get go my nails looked better and with continued use even better.</li>
            <li> Trind Natural Nail Repair -- is the simply the best.  Does what it is suppose to do.  Is better than OPI and Nailstique (sp?).  Since I&#x27;m over 45 years old, this was an AWESOME find!!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My Mum told me about this product after she started using it and had great results. I bought a bottle and started using it and am super happy with my results! My nails were splitting, peeling, breaking.....a real mess after a couple of years of using gel polish. Now I&#x27;ve done away with the gel and just use Trind. Fantastic results for my Mum and me!! We are both really happy!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, but much to expensive</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and am using it again. It really works. I alo really like the nail balsam. I use Derma Nail also--needless to say my once splitting, peeling, breaking nails are beautiful!</li>
            <li> It is just the best repair system; better than anything else I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone with splitting nails.</li>
            <li> This product was extremely disappointing. For being as expensive as it is I was looking forward to using the product. I put it on and as it was drying my nails started to feel like they were on fire and hurt all the way to the bone. I started looking into the product reviews and several users have similar experiences if not worse. Many users blame the pain from allergic reactions to the formaldehyde that is used in this product. AWFUL!&lt;br /&gt;It was a waist of money and will not finish using this product.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that has kept my nails form chipping, peeling and breaking off.  In only two weeks I really nice nails..don&#x27;t even wt to wear polish they look so good.  I use it every day for 3-4 days and then take it off and start with new layers.</li>
            <li> great seller, and LOVE my trind products! This is my third bottle of trind nail repair and ill be a customer for life my nails have never looked better. I&#x27;m a hairstylist which means my nails go through A LOT of abuse and trind has been the only thing to repair and strengthen my nails. Even before doing hair, they have never been this strong this polish is truly amazing like i said im a lifer.</li>
            <li> Been using Trind for 10+ years. Highly recommend it for stronger, longer nails when used as directed. Wish it were in stores.</li>
            <li> Works well for my nails. I have thin, bendy nails and this seems to really help my nails in terms of strength and growth.</li>
            <li> This is a superb product.  It was not available for a while, but has now returned to the market.  It really is exceptional - keeps my nails strong and  in great shape and prevents them from breaking. I HIGHLY recommend Trind products!</li>
            <li> I have tried every nail product on the market and haven&#x27;t found anything that works.  Well this is it!!  I am changing  the polish daily  per the directions and it is working!!  I am so happy I&#x27;m using it!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product !!  I have never had success growing long, strong nails until I found this product.  It WORKS!  My nails have gone from tissue thin to unbelievably strong.  I presently have 10 long beautiful strong nails -- a first for me.  Have received many compliments and have recommended this product to quite a few friends.  Cannot adequately describe what a great product this is.</li>
            <li> This Nail repair seems to work on my poor nails.  I have used it for several years and it seems to help my fragile nails.</li>
            <li> I love Trind nails polish for so many years. I have beautiful long nails. As a child I use to bite my nails. I always had soft 7 nails that split. I have told several people about your product. I can&#x27;t thank you enough for the wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all. I bought all the Trind products and my nails still crumbled and broke. Followed the directions precisely. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have just started using Trind nail repar 3 weeks ago, after a lady recommended it to me at the nail salon.  I complimented her on how beautiful her nails were.  I thought they were tips and she told me no, they were her very own after using Trind nail Repair. After just 3 weeks of use,for the first time in a very, very long time I have begun to see results.  My nails were just a mess, weak,chipping, no growth.  My nails were so weak and brittle that I could not even grasp the clasp on my chain. And the first thing I saw after 2 weeks, was the chipping had stopped.  That for me is a huge plus.  I am now looking forward to my nails becoming strong and growing again.  I guess after maybe 2 months I would love to give another review on the progress of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Suzan</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My nails are so strong and long</li>
            <li> Best I have ever had for repairing my nails!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and always love it.  When I stop using it my nails break, then I order more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week now, and there is already a noticeable difference in my nails. I had gels for a long time, so my bare nails were wrecked when I picked off my last gel manicure (I shouldn&#x27;t have done that, I know). My nails were breaking easily once grown out past a certain length and were always flaking. This has soothed my nails and sped up the recovery process. Overall, very pleased with the results, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my nails after two weeks of consistent use!</li>
            <li> I ran out of my first bottle and thought the other products I was using might be helping my constantly soft, breaking nails; unfortunately in a short time my nails were reverting to that again; I reordered Trind and it appears within a couple of weeks I am seeing improvement.  I am sold on it.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to order this because it seemed expensive, but my nails were chipped and peeling.  In two weeks I can see a big difference! This is absolutely beyond my expectations.  Five stars plus!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My nails look great thanks to trind, it&#x27;s a great product for the money. If you want healthy nails try there repair it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for many girls that never had their nails grow...its a miracle in a bottle to strengthen &amp; make UR nails grow!</li>
            <li> It has made my nails stronger and they grow faster.</li>
            <li> I tried this after a friend recommended it.  I was good - I would purchase again.  I have not found anything like it at Ulta.  My nails no longer peel and are stronger.</li>
            <li> I almost ordered based on the reviews, and the word &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; in the name.  Then I read the ingredients and it has toluene.&lt;br /&gt;I steer clear of that poison.  I know there are better ingredients out there, I will keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;At least they are honest and listed the ingredients, but hopefully this company will come up with a formula that is actually natural.</li>
            <li> Nails chipping, or pealing?  Use Trind and your nails will grow out beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that makes my nails strong and grow.</li>
            <li> really worked wonders for my brittle and hard to grow nails.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, your nails will get stronger and longer.  You have to keep putting a coat on every day or so, then remove and start over.  I have used this for years and the only time my nails break or peel is when I don&#x27;t use the product correctly.</li>
            <li> Too pricey to test for what it says it can do. I followed the instructions and my nails are in worse shape than before. My nail bed is thinner than before. So I can see the nail growth but the nail is thin and weak causing hang nails and soreness. I gave the second star because not everything will work for everyone.This product did not deliver as expected, so I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best thing to happen to my nails ever. No longer paying for gel nails have my own. They are long and strong. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it really works. I stopped putting tips and wraps and just use this as my base coat&lt;br /&gt;even when I go to a salon, I bring it with me. My nails actually grow. I see the difference and you will too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s great for keeping your nails strong and for healthy growth.</li>
