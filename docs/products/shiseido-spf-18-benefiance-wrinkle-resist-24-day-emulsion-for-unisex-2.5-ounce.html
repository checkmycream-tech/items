            <li> Been using this skin care line for years. Love the scent and the way my skin feels. Obsorbs into skin leaving a silky finish.</li>
            <li> Only day lotion I&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years and every time I think I&#x27;ll try the &amp;#34;new big thing&amp;#34;..I&#x27;m always sorry. My skin and I love Benefiance. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and several times I&#x27;ve told people I have kids in college they actually laugh, and have told me I look 30 something :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for moisturizing my skin. Saw no improvements at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered the above Shiseido product, but received a different Shiseido Day Emulsion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was damaged and the seal on the bottle (indicating that it had never been opened) was missing&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had received what I ordered I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
