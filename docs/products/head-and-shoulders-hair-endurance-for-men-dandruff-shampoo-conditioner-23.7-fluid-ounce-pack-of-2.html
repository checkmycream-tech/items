    <ol>
            <li>I have to say that I am very impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll stick to the one that worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>I was happy with my hair health.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great cause</li>
            <li>I am so SO happy that I can walk around without the worry of people looking at my hair and assuming I had a health issue or even lice (ick).</li>
            <li>Great value and a great product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great too.</li>
            <li>2 in 1 is great for those mornings you need to get out of the house</li>
            <li>And buying this from Amazon is a great deal, can&#x27;t beat the subscription price.</li>
            <li>Plus, this stuff smelled very nice, not &#x27;manly&#x27; at all.  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>price quantity ratio is good on this one and</li>
            <li>Does a good job on the hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, I would suggest this shampoo for anyone trying to get rid of their dandruff while getting a good value.</li>
            <li>Will stick with this product until I develop some kind of allergic reaction or something to this</li>
            <li>Nice hair effect.</li>
            <li>Decided I&#x27;d try H&amp;S again - couldn&#x27;t be happier, my hair loss has reduced, my hair feels clean and soft, smells great, feels stronger - Great solution!</li>
            <li>It has a great fresh scent to it</li>
            <li>This one has a pretty nice scent that I like, also my hair looks great after the wash.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite one, and Amazon has got the best deal around!</li>
            <li>In turn, my hair appears thicker and much more healthy.        </li>
            <li>Still my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love head &amp; shoulders and have tried most of their products.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is better.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is better.</li>
            <li>Could use a better fragrance though</li>
            <li>According to the information I&#x27;ve read online, Zinc helps promote healthy scalp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a 5 star rating if it wasn&#x27;t exclusively marketed to men:)</li>
            <li>one with the conditioner is great, it really keeps my hair feeling good, smooth, not frizzy, calm, toned down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, if your a man with thin hair looking for a inexpensive but good quality shampoo I honestly feel this is the best out there.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel clean and thicker, for us balding guys!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, and it is an effective alternative to Nioxin ($$$) without the overwhelming minty smell.  </li>
            <li>it not only smells great</li>
            <li>Also, using amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save feature, this product comes out to be very cost effective.</li>
            <li>I leave the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>with a daily wash it works wonders in my head and it smells great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about once a day for most of the year, but twice a day when its extremely hot or worked out.</li>
            <li>I have been using \\&quot;Thicker Fuller Hair\\&quot; (a similar product) for the longest time with good results.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more soon :)</li>
            <li>After using it for a good 2 weeks (it took me that long before I felt I was seeing a difference)</li>
            <li>I go on first and clean the hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does a good job controlling dandruff and it does make my hair feel slightly fuller.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does pretty well in keepjng a balanced ph balance on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>My fiancee likes it much better than regular H&amp;S&lt;</li>
            <li>and I are avid head and shoulder users.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and so many different chemicals.</li>
            <li>Tried for last three weeks, and love it.  </li>
            <li>If it seems to over condition your hair use this as your first shampoo then repeat with something else for your desired finish result.</li>
            <li>I am lucky enough to have a pretty full head of hair, and I think that really helps my situation.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does exactly what it wants to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES&lt;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the price!</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t really thicken your hair.</li>
            <li>So I mix it with Zincon; works very well.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and researching the causes of dandruff, since I&#x27;ve been a chronic dandruff \\&quot;sufferer\\&quot; for my whole life, I decided to go with this since it contains Zinc.</li>
            <li>Being on somewhat of a budget, I have never been able to afford the more expensive shampoos that are out there for men with thin/thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I would just do a quick headbang and it would snow particles of scalp and hair, and this NEVER happened prior to this product.</li>
            <li>No complaints from me, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to smell fresh and not fruity.</li>
            <li>For a while, it didn&#x27;t matter what shampoo I used, I was losing hair regularly, my hair always smelled old or like I had just gotten out of bed and just generally didn&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Effective but not good for all hairs.</li>
            <li>To clear a couple of things up, this is not a miracle cure by any means.  </li>
            <li>One day I tried this shampoo, when it first hit the market with this new active ingredient.</li>
            <li>Financially forced to use the cheaper over-the-counter products, I was excited when \\&quot;Head &amp; Shoulders\\&quot; released this particular shampoo.    </li>
            <li>If I notice I am running low on something I would normal get at the drug store, now I just order it with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>No other Shampoo makes your hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>In fact it made my hair look thinner than it normally does and completely flat.</li>
            <li>For those with shoulder length hair, it lengthens blow dry time, but its worth it, totally not greasy up to two days later (writing this on a Sunday).  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the same old head and shoulders smell.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what product other reviewers are being sold, but the one I received was pure rat poison in a bottle.</li>
            <li>It took about a month of heavy duty techniques to get rid of my dandruff (using different shampoos off and on), but once it settled down I&#x27;ve been able to just rely on this shampoo.</li>
            <li>this up on sale, and in Northern New England, dry scalp is an issue in the winter.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few months now (around 6+ months) and have found my dandruff to be completely gone.</li>
            <li> Works great, no more flakes, though I never really had it that bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does keep dandruff away and help somewhat with tougher conditions such as soriasis and other scalp, skin</li>
            <li> This is not a mere coincidence, do a search on Google and you will find that these are all apparently very common side effects.</li>
            <li> Usually buying this off from Walgreens near my place</li>
            <li> Thankfully this year I was pretty well prepared for it with this secret gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair always gets very dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little embarrassed with my hair since at least high school when it becomes winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to give my hair a little boost, but it ended up making things a whole lot worse in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male that has thin hair, and if I&#x27;m not careful with the products I use my hair can really look bad.  </li>
            <li> I used to use some other hair shampoo instead of this specifically made for men.</li>
            <li> Before this active ingredient there was the smelly, scalp burning chemicals and who knows what that I tried to keep the dandruff bunnies controlled.</li>
            <li> My hair felt fuller and less oily than it ever has.  </li>
            <li> , my hair felt/looked less thicker.   </li>
            <li> Even when you are rinsing it out, your hair feels slightly \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Dandruff like crazy and being an african american</li>
            <li> Use it nearlu everyday and thinning has slowed noticeably</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 deal, so you don&#x27;t have to waste time on conditioner.</li>
            <li> At least try shampoo&#x27;s with this active ingredient.</li>
            <li> My small child dropped in the the bath</li>
            <li> but I saved a few bucks by buying it off Amazon (with Prime too!).</li>
            <li> recommend it to everyone to at least try.</li>
            <li> Yeah, seriously.</li>
            <li> and I was so sad at the thought the water might mess with the ingredients I went out and bought another bottle.  </li>
            <li> This makes your hair thin and silky and removes puffness of hairs.  </li>
            <li> Late shipping, the shampoo is really bad since i have using it my hair starts fallen.</li>
            <li> Have horrible flakes!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using for well over a month and the flakes are gone. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Hair was thinning out. This shampoo does pretty well in keepjng a balanced ph balance on your scalp. Use it nearlu everyday and thinning has slowed noticeably</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male that has thin hair, and if I&#x27;m not careful with the products I use my hair can really look bad.  Being on somewhat of a budget, I have never been able to afford the more expensive shampoos that are out there for men with thin/thinning hair.  Financially forced to use the cheaper over-the-counter products, I was excited when \\&quot;Head &amp; Shoulders\\&quot; released this particular shampoo.    I have been using \\&quot;Thicker Fuller Hair\\&quot; (a similar product) for the longest time with good results. Recently, they seemed to have changed their product formula so I decided to give this a try.  I have to say that I am very impressed with the results.  After using it for a good 2 weeks (it took me that long before I felt I was seeing a difference) I was happy with my hair health.  My hair felt fuller and less oily than it ever has.  In turn, my hair appears thicker and much more healthy.        To clear a couple of things up, this is not a miracle cure by any means.  I am lucky enough to have a pretty full head of hair, and I think that really helps my situation.  This product will not regrow hair, it is not a product like Rogaine.  If you are looking for something to health with hair regrowth I would suggest talking with your doctor.  However, if your a man with thin hair looking for a inexpensive but good quality shampoo I honestly feel this is the best out there.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my short review.    I started using it 3 months ago, my hair felt thicker.  I stopped using it 1 month  ago, my hair felt/looked less thicker.   I started using it again a week ago, already noticing it feels thicker and fuller again..    It&#x27;s a great product. My hair has been thinning for a while now and this makes it feel like its fuller. I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does exactly what it wants to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells good. My fiancee likes it much better than regular H&amp;S&lt;br /&gt;2. Stops dandruff&lt;br /&gt;3. My hair feels great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a fan</li>
            <li> My step dad and I are avid head and shoulder users. It&#x27;s great cause it not only smells great but it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 deal, so you don&#x27;t have to waste time on conditioner. It has a great fresh scent to it (it&#x27;s not a fruity type smell) Also, using amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save feature, this product comes out to be very cost effective. No complaints from me, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to smell fresh and not fruity.</li>
            <li> Still leaves my hair somewhat greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little embarrassed with my hair since at least high school when it becomes winter. My hair always gets very dry and I always get dandruff. Thankfully this year I was pretty well prepared for it with this secret gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would seem that my friends and myself have always been convinced that Mens hair products don&#x27;t work for women... UNTIL NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is heaven-sent. I swear. I have no seen one flake since a week after I started using this. I am so SO happy that I can walk around without the worry of people looking at my hair and assuming I had a health issue or even lice (ick). I do however use this (being a 2-1) with my regular TIGI BedHead conditioner to give me that extra shine.</li>
            <li> A miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and so many different chemicals. Before this active ingredient there was the smelly, scalp burning chemicals and who knows what that I tried to keep the dandruff bunnies controlled. One day I tried this shampoo, when it first hit the market with this new active ingredient. It was such a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not burn the scalp, itch, smell, cause any infection, cause any redness, frizz the hair, change hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does keep dandruff away and help somewhat with tougher conditions such as soriasis and other scalp, skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one with the conditioner is great, it really keeps my hair feeling good, smooth, not frizzy, calm, toned down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone to at least try. At least try shampoo&#x27;s with this active ingredient. There are several now out in the market but I&#x27;ll stick to the one that worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price quantity ratio is good on this one and It&#x27;s convenient getting it to the door.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite shampoo. Makes your hair feel clean and thicker, for us balding guys! Highly recommended for the price!</li>
            <li> Late shipping, the shampoo is really bad since i have using it my hair starts fallen. Dont buy it or think about it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a good job controlling dandruff and it does make my hair feel slightly fuller. However, the fullness comes with a downside of giving my hair an oily feel. I will finish the two bottles of my initial shipment but I have canceled my subscription. Back to the regular formula for me.</li>
            <li> I used to use some other hair shampoo instead of this specifically made for men. This one has a pretty nice scent that I like, also my hair looks great after the wash.</li>
            <li> My go to shampoo &amp; conditioner. The only product I&#x27;ll use for my hair. Great value and a great product.</li>
            <li> No other Shampoo makes your hair look thicker. I think what this does is give your hair volume. Once you stop using it, its back to being almost bald.</li>
            <li> I love head &amp; shoulders and have tried most of their products. This is by far my favorite one, and Amazon has got the best deal around! Will be back for more soon :)</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS SHAMPOO. This stuff doesn&#x27;t really thicken your hair. It just dries the hell out of it so that it (temporarily)looks thicker. Furthermore, I don&#x27;t know how it is that they&#x27;re advertising this as an anti-dandruff product. I have NEVER had dandruff in my life, and only started getting it after usage of this product. My hair started falling out. Yeah, seriously. I didn&#x27;t even have to run my fingers through my hair. I would just do a quick headbang and it would snow particles of scalp and hair, and this NEVER happened prior to this product. I also started breaking out in acne along the sides of my face where the shampoo would touch my skin - I haven&#x27;t had acne in YEARS. This is not a mere coincidence, do a search on Google and you will find that these are all apparently very common side effects. I bought this product because I wanted to give my hair a little boost, but it ended up making things a whole lot worse in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what product other reviewers are being sold, but the one I received was pure rat poison in a bottle. Avoid this shampoo.</li>
            <li> From my experience (plus two others at my health club), any benefits from the \\&quot;endurance\\&quot; formula in this product is cancelled out by the difficulty it creates combing your hair.  It seems like it creates tangles in your hair.  Even when you are rinsing it out, your hair feels slightly \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m going back to the regular formula H&amp;S.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised to make your hair look thicker and add body to it. It doesn&#x27;t do either of these things. In fact it made my hair look thinner than it normally does and completely flat. The shampoo also turned my hair color to a lighter tone. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 big bottles and I don&#x27;t know what to do with them.</li>
            <li> Amazon has ruined me when it comes to errands. If I notice I am running low on something I would normal get at the drug store, now I just order it with Amazon Prime. This shampoo works great too.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on the hair.  But doesn&#x27;t quite control dandruff.  So I mix it with Zincon; works very well.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is better. I go on first and clean the hair. Conditioner is better. I leave the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great, no more flakes, though I never really had it that bad. Could use a better fragrance though, it&#x27;s the same old head and shoulders smell.</li>
            <li> Have horrible flakes!! Dandruff like crazy and being an african american it itches like crazy..and head and shoulders takes care of that issue.....with a daily wash it works wonders in my head and it smells great</li>
            <li> For a while, it didn&#x27;t matter what shampoo I used, I was losing hair regularly, my hair always smelled old or like I had just gotten out of bed and just generally didn&#x27;t feel clean.  Decided I&#x27;d try H&amp;S again - couldn&#x27;t be happier, my hair loss has reduced, my hair feels clean and soft, smells great, feels stronger - Great solution!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few months now (around 6+ months) and have found my dandruff to be completely gone. It took about a month of heavy duty techniques to get rid of my dandruff (using different shampoos off and on), but once it settled down I&#x27;ve been able to just rely on this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for about once a day for most of the year, but twice a day when its extremely hot or worked out. After reading the reviews and researching the causes of dandruff, since I&#x27;ve been a chronic dandruff \\&quot;sufferer\\&quot; for my whole life, I decided to go with this since it contains Zinc. According to the information I&#x27;ve read online, Zinc helps promote healthy scalp so I thought Id give it a try - and found out that it does work. If you do have severe dandruff I would suggest three different shampoos, including this one, and use a different shampoo each day - this is what worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I would suggest this shampoo for anyone trying to get rid of their dandruff while getting a good value.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002UD5IY8 Head &amp; Shoulders Hair Endurance for Men Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 23.7 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;Picked this up on sale, and in Northern New England, dry scalp is an issue in the winter.  Having a thyroid condition which wreaks havoc on my skin and hair, I like anything with thickening ingredients.  Plus, this stuff smelled very nice, not &#x27;manly&#x27; at all.  Tried for last three weeks, and love it.  My small child dropped in the the bath and I was so sad at the thought the water might mess with the ingredients I went out and bought another bottle.  I really like this stuff, and it is an effective alternative to Nioxin ($$$) without the overwhelming minty smell.  For those with shoulder length hair, it lengthens blow dry time, but its worth it, totally not greasy up to two days later (writing this on a Sunday).  I&#x27;d give it a 5 star rating if it wasn&#x27;t exclusively marketed to men:)</li>
            <li> Effective but not good for all hairs. This makes your hair thin and silky and removes puffness of hairs.  a</li>
            <li> Been using this Head &amp; Shoulder for quite a while. I like the fact that it actually gets rid off my dandruff and it smells good too! Usually buying this off from Walgreens near my place but I saved a few bucks by buying it off Amazon (with Prime too!). Will stick with this product until I develop some kind of allergic reaction or something to this (just kidding!).</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s a big claim, but I&#x27;ve noticed that there is almost no hair on my brush or comb compared to before. Try it for a while. If it seems to over condition your hair use this as your first shampoo then repeat with something else for your desired finish result.</li>
            <li> Cured chronic scalp pimples. Nice hair effect.</li>
            <li> I like it, and the shampoo works well. 2 in 1 is great for those mornings you need to get out of the house asap. And buying this from Amazon is a great deal, can&#x27;t beat the subscription price.</li>
