            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>While the Vitamin C H/A worked great (I saw brightening of my skin), using these two products together gave me the added benefit of evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have gotten great results.  </li>
            <li>and this one is also great among all of it.</li>

            <li>Although they did make it good, when I received the replacement bottle, again there was no bubble wrap around the bottle and the ends of the box were not even taped which meant anyone could reach into the package and pull the product out.  </li>

            <li>This serum really is the Best.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best skin product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Awsome product, I am loving this serum</li>
            <li>I ordered this serum because I liked the company&#x27;s rose oil and figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>The packaging the product comes in is nice as well.</li>
            <li>It plumps the skin in a good way, but better you Google it yourself and get the scientific explanation.</li>
            <li>One drop along with two drops of the Rose Hip Seed Oil can cover the face and the neck and chest.</li>
            <li>nice prod</li>
            <li>And yet, it seems to be quite effective...</li>
            <li>Perfect for any type of skin, but oily skins will really appreciate that it isn&#x27;t one bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs very quickly, nice scent.  </li>
            <li>The product soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li>so I honestly did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li>that said, i don&#x27;t have many-- which is good</li>
            <li>This is an excellent reviewed serum with people reporting only great benefits for their skin.</li>
            <li>my face has this glow skin is nice fitted</li>
            <li>People tell me how nice I look and ask what I have done.  </li>
            <li>It has  a nice smell</li>
            <li>Goes on nice not greasy... absorbs well and no odor.</li>
            <li>I received this bottle to review, the opinions within are my own...</li>
            <li>My first impressions are very good.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free for review and was impressed with how quickly it got here and</li>
            <li>So far, this product is great!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I have used!  </li>
            <li>Out of all the hyaluronic acid serums I have tried, this is BY FAR the best on the market!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>It was really great to see results, and it makes me happy that I&#x27;ve found two products by the same company that work well together.</li>
            <li>It plumps my cheeks and fine lines!  </li>
            <li>This was a very light serum with the consistency of water</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and dries nicely.  </li>
            <li>She is very happy with the product as the fine line near her mouth is visibly improved.  </li>
            <li>However, when you rub it together with your fingers, it immediately turns more watery.  </li>
            <li>I saw many reviews how it was ohhh so supple on the skin once applied, I felt no moisture in this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>which I think  should be Hyaluronic Acid :)</li>
            <li>It took me 40 years to find best facial product BRAVO.!!</li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it goes after more than a week of use.</li>
            <li>Nice and light weight.</li>
            <li>I just love the skin care products.</li>
            <li>I do put argon oil on top to moisturize.</li>
            <li>skin is smoother, more even toned and softer.  </li>
            <li>but I love my skin now.</li>
            <li>Not so sure anout this product, I don&#x27;t like the tightness, but I will continue to use, because I just love the serum, such a great product !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know more when I&#x27;ve had more usage.</li>
            <li>Yes my thought is it is a better product than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>helps keep more moisture in the skin.  </li>
            <li>but I know it takes more than 12 percent to be of value for skin care.  </li>
            <li>The serum tightens my skin and help my moisturizer work better.</li>
            <li>This product does what it claims to do and more.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is so lightweight and doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have put a product on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>a product tester I was sent a free bottle in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>how it makes my skin feel.i love the texture</li>
            <li>So I did some more research on it to find out what it is used for and it&#x27;s actions.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li>Thicker than most serums, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>My face and neck is more radiant, velvety and firmer</li>
            <li>Update, on my second bottle and loving this!!!</li>
            <li>I was impressed; I was not excepting this instant result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be able to say that at 62</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the dropper delivery method.  </li>
            <li>Have to say I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed the lines around my lip area are much more diminished.  </li>
            <li>If I wore it alone, it was ok, but if I put any sort of lotion on top of it, it got all gummy and peeled off.</li>
            <li>I love this type of bottle and how you never have to touch the product except what you will use.</li>
            <li>This sat on top of the skin, burned and made my skin look and feel like plastic.</li>
            <li>People even say I&#x27;ve been more refreshed looking and everything.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any difference on my skin,it makes my skin dry.just don&#x27;t understand how people get such a wonderful results.</li>
            <li>Impressed how this serum left my face...</li>
            <li>After reading a million different product reviews, I decided to go with this one, and I am VERY impressed.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i am FOR SURE going to buy the RoseHip Oil again (see my review on that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i felt it DID &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; that a bit more quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am undecided on the 2 products... but LOVE the RoseHip oil...</li>
            <li>And well the price is fabulous!</li>

            <li>I bought this after I started using a Vitamin C serum because I heard they work well together, and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Tripe Action Vitamin C Serum and just a beautiful smooth, glowing and hydrating outcome!</li>
            <li>well I think that is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It was great because I live in a desert environment.</li>

            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not feel tacky.  </li>

            <li>The high Hyaluronic Acid, more so sits on the skin.</li>

            <li>goes on clear and not greasy, which i love.</li>
            <li>And this stuff is definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>&amp; so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading on the newest &amp; best treatments for middle aged skin &amp; this is it.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed by my skin</li>
            <li>Once applied it is absorbed into the skin, almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I wish find this serum before... Very happy and my beauty secret.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried so many serum</li>
            <li>it superior to the other Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past?&lt;br</li>
            <li>just soaked right into my skin.</li>
            <li>Test on a patch of skin first to make sure your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>There is no smell and the product seems very pure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY gentle, you can even use it right around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft from the first application!</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with the stuff I snuck a little bit of it for myself last night</li>
            <li>Just starting using put goes on smoothly so far so good.</li>
            <li>It goes on really watery, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell how good it works as I only started using it</li>
            <li>This is important because the low M.W. HA will be able to penetrate the skin deeper than the high M.W. molecule.</li>
            <li>and it is very important to put the moisture back afterwards.</li>
            <li>I wake up with huge bags around my eyes but after putting on the eye serum and my regular moisturizer, I do notice a significant decrease.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a black liquid dropper top for easy application.</li>
            <li>When I used this product I was afraid, because I don&#x27;t know how it will work in my skin, but the results are amazing, my skin is more better after that</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water</li>
            <li>Very moisturized!</li>
            <li>my skin appears younger, fresher and has a more supple look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of beauty products, and my cabinets are stocked full of different lotions and serums.</li>
            <li>skin feels smooth and soft afterward, and is looking healthier, as with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am back to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I put witch hazel on my face first to help move the serum around otherwise</li>
            <li>/&gt;Originally, I didn‚Äôt like the sticky feel of the hyaluronic acid which I applied first; followed by the vitamin C.</li>
            <li>which indicates my skin can only get better with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I‚Äôm glad I finally got the chance to check it</li>
            <li>After rubbing it on my face, my skin felt instantly smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>any more.it is not for the first time when all reviews are wonderful,.but in reality its not.</li>
            <li>I use this after the deep sea mask and I think the combination of products have lightened my sun spots and made my skin glow more</li>
            <li>In love instantly!  </li>
            <li>I use the Vitamin C first and then the Hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>(it has always been pretty</li>
            <li>Bigger bottles of it would be fantastic!</li>
            <li>The advantage of this groundbreaking formula, as they say, is that it gives you deep penetration and therefore better hydration.  </li>
            <li>and I saw a difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have been using hyaluronic acid for a while.  </li>
            <li>It will quickly plump and moisturize the skin and it improves the appearance of fine wrinkles when used regularly over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has done for me, exactly what they said it would do.</li>
            <li>product had great reviews and seems to be the only one on Amazon that has the high and low molecular weights</li>
            <li>I decided to look for a H Acid product because I like to use some type of &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product at night, and other products I&#x27;ve tried (including Rx ones) weren&#x27;t that effective and made my skin flakey and irritated.  </li>
            <li>Ve has a wide range of beauty products and I have loved everyone so far.  </li>
            <li>My first time using 100% pure Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>and I DO see positive results in the skin being lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li>After 10 days or so of use I could see a positive difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Within the first 4 days of using this serum, I saw that my skin was brighter and so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the more thin HAs because I&#x27;m pretty sure the thinnest serums/creams need to go on first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a difference between hydration and moisturizing, but it seems this product leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and my fine lines are less noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li>This particular brand/molecular structure really moisturizes and improves the texture of my skin; I have tried many brands and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>My skin was super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone how wants younger, fresher and more supple looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micki</li>
            <li>I was so certain  </li>
            <li>I have used Trish Mcevoy face serum and the COSMEDICA PURE HYALURONIC serum</li>
            <li>My skin has improved dramatically since I started using this 100% pure product.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely softened the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>My pores, particularly on the forehead and nose, are pretty much non-existent.  </li>
            <li>suggest buying these now to try while they are offered at such a huge discount.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks, is excelent product</li>
            <li>My face and hands are much smoother, even though I train in mma.</li>
            <li>I waited to weeks before leaving this review in order to give everyone considering this Hyaluronic Acid Serum a REAL review.  </li>
            <li>and this is really all I need when I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li>really like this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, although I do like this product, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference from the others.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin looking young and fresh</li>
            <li>now used this, Oz naturals with Vit. C  and Cosmedica and don&#x27;t see much diff.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s natural, organic, vegan, and has no artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This serum shipped fast and is in a quality container.  </li>
            <li>but it really did the job.  </li>
            <li>This VoilaVe Hyaluronic Serum is much thicker.</li>
            <li>This is very bothersome to me because even when others may not notice it, because of caked on makeup, I know it is there.</li>
            <li>This 30ml high-intensity moisturizing serum really works well for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I have a combination skin and my T-zone tends to get very oily during the day.</li>
            <li>So, I begin blending both - two drops of hyaluronic acid and two spray pumps of vitamin C in the palm of my hand and applying it to my face and  throat which was much</li>
            <li>and I really think my skin is brighter.  </li>
            <li>These products really compliment one another.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much ..</li>
            <li>It will make your skin dry/tight feeling if you use too much.</li>
            <li>3 products combined,&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t feel like it has faded it -- that much (though i have</li>
            <li>I really believe using this product has improved the appearance if my skin.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Really tones and tightens the skin, shrinking the lines , wrinkles and morning puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive for the results it is producing.</li>
            <li>and I am really amazed at the difference in her skin.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, and reduces the wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Gentle, and it works.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well but per instructions, apply moisturizer after it dries.  </li>
            <li>It seems to run out fast</li>
            <li>The serum worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice gel consistency and soaks in after a few seconds.</li>
            <li>This is only 3 days in ; I look forward to seeing if there are any other huge differences in a week or more.  </li>
            <li>, i like it a lot much better than other brands i used before.</li>
            <li>That other stuff is so diluted it seems like it&#x27;s mostly water.</li>
            <li>It is made in the USA and comes together with a generous one year full money back guarantee as well as a free guide to a younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I have written other reviews for this company because I have fallen in love.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>My dark circles are gone and my skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>These are my honest opinions of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The VoilaVe Hyaluronic Serum, was just a pleasure to review these past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week so far, and I do see a filling out in the fine lines on my forehead and upper nose.  </li>
            <li>I love the consistency of VoilaVe compared to other hyaluronic products I have tried!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found out they&#x27;ve added some new products, too, which I can&#x27;t wait to try now!</li>
            <li>love it, arrived on June 19 and in less then a week I saw changes.</li>
            <li>My face is dry and the dryness has gone and it is smooth and has elasticity.</li>
            <li>I have a more even skin tone, less redness,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a healthy glow to my skin as well as less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Works better than the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>many others that are more expensive (for no reason).</li>
            <li>I seen quick results with instantly softer skin .</li>
            <li>I use it on my face to help with some dry skin that I always seem to have trouble getting rid of, and it&#x27;s been amazing!</li>
            <li>I was given this product during a promotional period to try and test it, and I can highly recommend it based on quality  and performance.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is high quality and the bottle itself is weighty glass.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>will continue using it and give it a high recomendation.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to try out .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>High quality bottle, packaging and serum.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have been using both 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and Triple Action Vitamin C Serum for 16-days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I bought it this was exactly what I was looking for and similar to the previous  product I was buying but better and reasonably priced..</li>
            <li>The little bit of flakiness on my forehead is gone and my makeup goes on much better.</li>
            <li>I understand someone at my age, it might take a little while to see wrinkle reduction results, but my skin has never looked or have felt better,</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need more than a pea size amount to cover your entire face - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I generally add a light moisturizer such as avocado oil after I cleanse then add one of these products.</li>
            <li>I like how this tiny bottle packed with powerful moisturizing serum</li>
            <li>Have not used long enough to add more.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and put it everywhere including right under the eyebrows and on my under eye area with out getting too close to my actual eyes!  </li>
            <li>I never knew there were Highs and lows, but you learn something new every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was taken back by all the great ratings but poor outcome I&#x27;ve had with this product.  </li>
            <li>I also use it immediately after any light at-home facial peels that I occasionally use and it seems to help my skin recover faster.</li>
            <li>they state and pictures to show results are of very young women.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long at all to see positive changes; highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid Serum came in a 1 fl oz dark brown bottle that helps keep light out and extends the life</li>
            <li>The first big noticeable difference is the thickness of the serum.</li>
            <li>I can see less fine lines and tighter skin.  </li>
            <li>It plumps up the fine lines I have around my eyes and my little &amp;#34;smile creases&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Usually if I try to use Cetaphil lotion it still burns a little after, but this serum is very nice post-peel and gives my face the pampering it needs without the burning.</li>
            <li>i am  in my late 40s, but my skin didn&#x27;t look this good for a long time!</li>
            <li>Other pros are: plump skin, reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, minimization of puffiness and dark circles, evening of the skin tone, more youthful and radiant skin appearance and a lot of other benefits.  </li>
            <li>feels great going on cold and figure it&#x27;s potency</li>
            <li>The serum itself is clear and you only need a drop for your whole face</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a clear gel like liquid.</li>
            <li>clear--)</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 10 days and now I have ordered the eye cream and the triple action serum as well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I like the results I am getting, and my sensitive skin has had no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>and it is plumped up and nearly gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>kept staring at my face in my rearview mirror in the car on the way home today-looking for that dreaded shadow, but it was nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>So far I think this is helping my skin.</li>
            <li>It immediately made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin and so far the serum is cooperating with my skin.  </li>
            <li>am 30 years old, fair/normal skin, and I use it at night, followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>lush texture and silky feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>With even my sensitive skin I did not have a reaction at all.  </li>
            <li>Whether you are looking to firm , smooth , or just up keep your skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft and moist my face is.  </li>
            <li>I am 73 years old and have never had any thing work this</li>
            <li>It is completely non-irritating, even on the driest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product along with the Triple action vitamin c serum as a combination for my face.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the VoilaVe Organic Rosehip Oil and Triple Action Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this serum has no scent at all, and the thick texture makes it easier to spread.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the expensive stuff</li>
            <li>I noticed how the VoilaVe 100% Pure Low and High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum worked wonders on my skin tone, suppleness, pores and overall</li>
            <li>The fine lines have definitely diminished and the dark spots are lighter.  </li>
            <li>Given the amazing results, especially when compared to much more expensive products on the market today, this is a winner - hands down.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly the high and low molecular weights are important as one weight penetrates deeply into the layers of the skin (low molecular) while the other (high molecular) remains closer to the surface.  </li>
            <li>Also, this particular Hyaluronic acid will not cause any break outs to my skin, which I am very susceptible to with other products</li>
            <li>Low &amp; high molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>This serum contains LOW and HIGH molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product especially if you have age spots too.</li>
            <li>I just received this product a few days ago, so I was only able to test it briefly...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serums can be very expensive but this serum is available on Amazon for $24.95‚Äî 63% off its original price of $67.95!</li>
            <li>I use to buy a product that you can only find in certain spas for over 100$ tiny vials that provided added moisture to my face.</li>
            <li>This is good but a little thick for HA.  </li>
            <li>I really look forward to long term effects!</li>
            <li>Therefore, my skin has been tortured for the last 30 years; I also suffer from dark circles, fine lines, and occasional cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Used this product along with Triple Action Vitamin C Serum, but did not notice any extra benefit since the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum already included Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know all the technical reasons how or why the low and high molecules make this serum work so well, but let me tell you, IT DOES!</li>
            <li>far I am pleased with this product, while also a bit confused.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft but I have not noticed a difference in wrinkles (only been using it for three weeks)</li>
            <li>Well this product offers not only low Hyaluronic Acid, but high as well.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind! { 61 years old} thanks, again!</li>
            <li>No way for completely accurate assessment, but lines, especially around my mouth, seem to be much less deep.</li>
            <li>skin is soft and glowing and today at work, someone guessed my age at 15 years younger than I</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd cooment in addition to a direct email.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>HA is made naturally in the body throughout various types of tissue.</li>
            <li>after cleaning my face and appling the triple action vitamin c serum, i take only a portion the size of a pea, and i  am amazed,</li>
            <li>After a month of use it is  very noticeable how my pores look smaller and how thin and smooth my skin</li>
            <li>Low Hyaluronic Acid is what you would commonly find in most serums such as this.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this serum for 3 weeks so far</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and pores have gotten considerably smaller.  </li>
            <li>Most of the Hyadluronic Serums I have tried have always been on the thin, runny side.</li>
            <li>I like that it is pure Hyaluronic Acid with out Vitamin C or other products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for only a few weeks, and my skin already looks better...</li>
            <li>I had one right down the middle of my face between my nose and my ear.</li>
            <li>Normally my face has dry spots everywhere</li>
            <li>viscous hyaluronic acid serum from Voil&amp;agrave;Ve contains only the essential ingredients, including purified water, both high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids, phenoxyethanol, and ethylhexylglycerin.  </li>
            <li>I use it not only on the more sensitive areas of the face, but also on my elbows and other delicate spots.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Eye Serum I purchased from the same vendor and can see marked improvements in my skin tone as well as diminished wrinkles (crow&#x27;s feet) around my eye area shortly after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>#34;VoilaVe 100% Pure LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum provides you with something that, according to the company, ordinary hyaluronic acids can‚Äôt give you and that is high and low molecular weight.  </li>
            <li>: (If you&#x27;re not 100% happy with your purchase of VoilaVeTM LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum, let us know</li>
            <li>The formula is very thick, but absorbs super fast and does not leave the skin feeling irritated or dry.</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s dry, my skin is so incredibly soft there is no need for a moisurizer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife because she wants to maintain her skin and prevent future wrinkles as she noticed a small wrinkle starting near her mouth and was horrified.  </li>

            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> While the Vitamin C H/A worked great (I saw brightening of my skin), using these two products together gave me the added benefit of evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have gotten great results.  </li>
            <li> and this one is also great among all of it.</li>
            <li> and I like the smoothness, softness and clearer complexion I&#x27;ve experienced since ordering it about a month ago.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue on my face either, which is great.</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try out the Voila Ve Hyaluronic Acid Serum and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Although they did make it good, when I received the replacement bottle, again there was no bubble wrap around the bottle and the ends of the box were not even taped which meant anyone could reach into the package and pull the product out.  </li>
            <li> skin looks good--</li>
            <li> good results in the case of puffy eye bags.</li>
            <li> No stickiness, good product</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the company as well.</li>
            <li> Note: this product was received for the purpose of honest and fair review.</li>

            <li> This serum really is the Best.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best skin product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Awsome product, I am loving this serum</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum because I liked the company&#x27;s rose oil and figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> The packaging the product comes in is nice as well.</li>
            <li> It plumps the skin in a good way, but better you Google it yourself and get the scientific explanation.</li>
            <li> One drop along with two drops of the Rose Hip Seed Oil can cover the face and the neck and chest.</li>
            <li> nice prod</li>
            <li> And yet, it seems to be quite effective...</li>
            <li> Perfect for any type of skin, but oily skins will really appreciate that it isn&#x27;t one bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly, nice scent.  </li>
            <li> The product soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> so I honestly did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li> that said, i don&#x27;t have many-- which is good</li>
            <li> This is an excellent reviewed serum with people reporting only great benefits for their skin.</li>
            <li> my face has this glow skin is nice fitted</li>
            <li> People tell me how nice I look and ask what I have done.  </li>
            <li> It has  a nice smell</li>
            <li> Goes on nice not greasy... absorbs well and no odor.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle to review, the opinions within are my own...</li>
            <li> My first impressions are very good.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free for review and was impressed with how quickly it got here and</li>
            <li> So far, this product is great!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I have used!  </li>
            <li> Out of all the hyaluronic acid serums I have tried, this is BY FAR the best on the market!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> It was really great to see results, and it makes me happy that I&#x27;ve found two products by the same company that work well together.</li>
            <li> It plumps my cheeks and fine lines!  </li>
            <li> This was a very light serum with the consistency of water</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and dries nicely.  </li>
            <li> She is very happy with the product as the fine line near her mouth is visibly improved.  </li>
            <li> However, when you rub it together with your fingers, it immediately turns more watery.  </li>
            <li> I saw many reviews how it was ohhh so supple on the skin once applied, I felt no moisture in this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> which I think  should be Hyaluronic Acid :)</li>
            <li> It took me 40 years to find best facial product BRAVO.!!</li>
            <li> Love the results.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it goes after more than a week of use.</li>
            <li> Nice and light weight.</li>
            <li> I just love the skin care products.</li>
            <li> I do put argon oil on top to moisturize.</li>
            <li> skin is smoother, more even toned and softer.  </li>
            <li> but I love my skin now.</li>
            <li> Not so sure anout this product, I don&#x27;t like the tightness, but I will continue to use, because I just love the serum, such a great product !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more when I&#x27;ve had more usage.</li>
            <li> Yes my thought is it is a better product than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> helps keep more moisture in the skin.  </li>
            <li> but I know it takes more than 12 percent to be of value for skin care.  </li>
            <li> The serum tightens my skin and help my moisturizer work better.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to do and more.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is so lightweight and doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have put a product on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> a product tester I was sent a free bottle in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> how it makes my skin feel.i love the texture</li>
            <li> So I did some more research on it to find out what it is used for and it&#x27;s actions.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> Thicker than most serums, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> My face and neck is more radiant, velvety and firmer</li>
            <li> Update, on my second bottle and loving this!!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed; I was not excepting this instant result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be able to say that at 62</li>
            <li> and I love the feel of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the dropper delivery method.  </li>
            <li> Have to say I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed the lines around my lip area are much more diminished.  </li>
            <li> If I wore it alone, it was ok, but if I put any sort of lotion on top of it, it got all gummy and peeled off.</li>
            <li> I love this type of bottle and how you never have to touch the product except what you will use.</li>
            <li> This sat on top of the skin, burned and made my skin look and feel like plastic.</li>

            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not feel tacky.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t super noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high Hyaluronic Acid, more so sits on the skin.</li>
            <li> I also like to know if you have other kind of serums ..i would like to try some more..</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to use very much it and will last a good while because it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li> I expected it to sting (so that I knew it was working), but it had a pleasant feel</li>
            <li> Softer skin and more vital looking!</li>

            <li> It is easily absorbed by my skin</li>
            <li> Once applied it is absorbed into the skin, almost immediately.</li>

            <li> So far I have tried so many serum</li>
            <li> it superior to the other Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past?&lt;br</li>
            <li> just soaked right into my skin.</li>
            <li> Test on a patch of skin first to make sure your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> There is no smell and the product seems very pure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY gentle, you can even use it right around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft from the first application!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the stuff I snuck a little bit of it for myself last night</li>
            <li> Just starting using put goes on smoothly so far so good.</li>
            <li> It goes on really watery, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell how good it works as I only started using it</li>
            <li> This is important because the low M.W. HA will be able to penetrate the skin deeper than the high M.W. molecule.</li>
            <li> and it is very important to put the moisture back afterwards.</li>
            <li> I wake up with huge bags around my eyes but after putting on the eye serum and my regular moisturizer, I do notice a significant decrease.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a black liquid dropper top for easy application.</li>
            <li> When I used this product I was afraid, because I don&#x27;t know how it will work in my skin, but the results are amazing, my skin is more better after that</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is water</li>
            <li> Very moisturized!</li>
            <li> my skin appears younger, fresher and has a more supple look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of beauty products, and my cabinets are stocked full of different lotions and serums.</li>
            <li> skin feels smooth and soft afterward, and is looking healthier, as with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am back to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I put witch hazel on my face first to help move the serum around otherwise</li>
            <li> /&gt;Originally, I didn‚Äôt like the sticky feel of the hyaluronic acid which I applied first; followed by the vitamin C.</li>
            <li> which indicates my skin can only get better with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I‚Äôm glad I finally got the chance to check it</li>
            <li> After rubbing it on my face, my skin felt instantly smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> any more.it is not for the first time when all reviews are wonderful,.but in reality its not.</li>
            <li> I use this after the deep sea mask and I think the combination of products have lightened my sun spots and made my skin glow more</li>
            <li> In love instantly!  </li>
            <li> I use the Vitamin C first and then the Hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> (it has always been pretty</li>
            <li> Bigger bottles of it would be fantastic!</li>
            <li> The advantage of this groundbreaking formula, as they say, is that it gives you deep penetration and therefore better hydration.  </li>
            <li> and I saw a difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have been using hyaluronic acid for a while.  </li>
            <li> It will quickly plump and moisturize the skin and it improves the appearance of fine wrinkles when used regularly over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has done for me, exactly what they said it would do.</li>
            <li> product had great reviews and seems to be the only one on Amazon that has the high and low molecular weights</li>
            <li> I decided to look for a H Acid product because I like to use some type of &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product at night, and other products I&#x27;ve tried (including Rx ones) weren&#x27;t that effective and made my skin flakey and irritated.  </li>
            <li> Ve has a wide range of beauty products and I have loved everyone so far.  </li>
            <li> My first time using 100% pure Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> and I DO see positive results in the skin being lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> After 10 days or so of use I could see a positive difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Within the first 4 days of using this serum, I saw that my skin was brighter and so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the more thin HAs because I&#x27;m pretty sure the thinnest serums/creams need to go on first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a difference between hydration and moisturizing, but it seems this product leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and my fine lines are less noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li> This particular brand/molecular structure really moisturizes and improves the texture of my skin; I have tried many brands and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> My skin was super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone how wants younger, fresher and more supple looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micki</li>
            <li> I was so certain  </li>
            <li> I have used Trish Mcevoy face serum and the COSMEDICA PURE HYALURONIC serum</li>
            <li> My skin has improved dramatically since I started using this 100% pure product.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely softened the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> My pores, particularly on the forehead and nose, are pretty much non-existent.  </li>
            <li> suggest buying these now to try while they are offered at such a huge discount.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks, is excelent product</li>
            <li> My face and hands are much smoother, even though I train in mma.</li>
            <li> I waited to weeks before leaving this review in order to give everyone considering this Hyaluronic Acid Serum a REAL review.  </li>
            <li> and this is really all I need when I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> really like this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, although I do like this product, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference from the others.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin looking young and fresh</li>
            <li> now used this, Oz naturals with Vit. C  and Cosmedica and don&#x27;t see much diff.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s natural, organic, vegan, and has no artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This serum shipped fast and is in a quality container.  </li>
            <li> but it really did the job.  </li>
            <li> This VoilaVe Hyaluronic Serum is much thicker.</li>
            <li> This is very bothersome to me because even when others may not notice it, because of caked on makeup, I know it is there.</li>
            <li> This 30ml high-intensity moisturizing serum really works well for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin and my T-zone tends to get very oily during the day.</li>
            <li> So, I begin blending both - two drops of hyaluronic acid and two spray pumps of vitamin C in the palm of my hand and applying it to my face and  throat which was much</li>
            <li> and I really think my skin is brighter.  </li>
            <li> These products really compliment one another.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much ..</li>
            <li> It will make your skin dry/tight feeling if you use too much.</li>
            <li> 3 products combined,&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t feel like it has faded it -- that much (though i have</li>
            <li> I really believe using this product has improved the appearance if my skin.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> Really tones and tightens the skin, shrinking the lines , wrinkles and morning puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for the results it is producing.</li>
            <li> and I am really amazed at the difference in her skin.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, and reduces the wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Gentle, and it works.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well but per instructions, apply moisturizer after it dries.  </li>
            <li> It seems to run out fast</li>
            <li> The serum worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice gel consistency and soaks in after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This is only 3 days in ; I look forward to seeing if there are any other huge differences in a week or more.  </li>
            <li> , i like it a lot much better than other brands i used before.</li>
            <li> That other stuff is so diluted it seems like it&#x27;s mostly water.</li>
            <li> It is made in the USA and comes together with a generous one year full money back guarantee as well as a free guide to a younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I have written other reviews for this company because I have fallen in love.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are gone and my skin is more hydrated.</li>

            <li> will continue using it and give it a high recomendation.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to try out .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> High quality bottle, packaging and serum.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using both 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and Triple Action Vitamin C Serum for 16-days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I bought it this was exactly what I was looking for and similar to the previous  product I was buying but better and reasonably priced..</li>
            <li> The little bit of flakiness on my forehead is gone and my makeup goes on much better.</li>
            <li> I understand someone at my age, it might take a little while to see wrinkle reduction results, but my skin has never looked or have felt better,</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t need more than a pea size amount to cover your entire face - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I generally add a light moisturizer such as avocado oil after I cleanse then add one of these products.</li>
            <li> I like how this tiny bottle packed with powerful moisturizing serum</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to add more.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and put it everywhere including right under the eyebrows and on my under eye area with out getting too close to my actual eyes!  </li>
            <li> I never knew there were Highs and lows, but you learn something new every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was taken back by all the great ratings but poor outcome I&#x27;ve had with this product.  </li>
            <li> I also use it immediately after any light at-home facial peels that I occasionally use and it seems to help my skin recover faster.</li>
            <li> they state and pictures to show results are of very young women.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long at all to see positive changes; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum came in a 1 fl oz dark brown bottle that helps keep light out and extends the life</li>
            <li> The first big noticeable difference is the thickness of the serum.</li>
            <li> I can see less fine lines and tighter skin.  </li>
            <li> It plumps up the fine lines I have around my eyes and my little &amp;#34;smile creases&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Usually if I try to use Cetaphil lotion it still burns a little after, but this serum is very nice post-peel and gives my face the pampering it needs without the burning.</li>
            <li> i am  in my late 40s, but my skin didn&#x27;t look this good for a long time!</li>
            <li> Other pros are: plump skin, reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, minimization of puffiness and dark circles, evening of the skin tone, more youthful and radiant skin appearance and a lot of other benefits.  </li>
            <li> feels great going on cold and figure it&#x27;s potency</li>
            <li> The serum itself is clear and you only need a drop for your whole face</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a clear gel like liquid.</li>
            <li> clear--)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 10 days and now I have ordered the eye cream and the triple action serum as well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I like the results I am getting, and my sensitive skin has had no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> and it is plumped up and nearly gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> kept staring at my face in my rearview mirror in the car on the way home today-looking for that dreaded shadow, but it was nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> So far I think this is helping my skin.</li>
            <li> It immediately made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin and so far the serum is cooperating with my skin.  </li>
            <li> am 30 years old, fair/normal skin, and I use it at night, followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> lush texture and silky feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> With even my sensitive skin I did not have a reaction at all.  </li>
            <li> Whether you are looking to firm , smooth , or just up keep your skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft and moist my face is.  </li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and have never had any thing work this</li>
            <li> It is completely non-irritating, even on the driest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the Triple action vitamin c serum as a combination for my face.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the VoilaVe Organic Rosehip Oil and Triple Action Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this serum has no scent at all, and the thick texture makes it easier to spread.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the expensive stuff</li>
            <li> I noticed how the VoilaVe 100% Pure Low and High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum worked wonders on my skin tone, suppleness, pores and overall</li>
            <li> The fine lines have definitely diminished and the dark spots are lighter.  </li>
            <li> Given the amazing results, especially when compared to much more expensive products on the market today, this is a winner - hands down.  </li>
            <li> Supposedly the high and low molecular weights are important as one weight penetrates deeply into the layers of the skin (low molecular) while the other (high molecular) remains closer to the surface.  </li>
            <li> Also, this particular Hyaluronic acid will not cause any break outs to my skin, which I am very susceptible to with other products</li>
            <li> Low &amp; high molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> This serum contains LOW and HIGH molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product especially if you have age spots too.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago, so I was only able to test it briefly...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serums can be very expensive but this serum is available on Amazon for $24.95‚Äî 63% off its original price of $67.95!</li>
            <li> I use to buy a product that you can only find in certain spas for over 100$ tiny vials that provided added moisture to my face.</li>
            <li> This is good but a little thick for HA.  </li>
            <li> I really look forward to long term effects!</li>
            <li> Therefore, my skin has been tortured for the last 30 years; I also suffer from dark circles, fine lines, and occasional cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> Used this product along with Triple Action Vitamin C Serum, but did not notice any extra benefit since the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum already included Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know all the technical reasons how or why the low and high molecules make this serum work so well, but let me tell you, IT DOES!</li>
            <li> far I am pleased with this product, while also a bit confused.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft but I have not noticed a difference in wrinkles (only been using it for three weeks)</li>
            <li> Well this product offers not only low Hyaluronic Acid, but high as well.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind! { 61 years old} thanks, again!</li>
            <li> No way for completely accurate assessment, but lines, especially around my mouth, seem to be much less deep.</li>
            <li> skin is soft and glowing and today at work, someone guessed my age at 15 years younger than I</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd cooment in addition to a direct email.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it make my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> HA is made naturally in the body throughout various types of tissue.</li>
            <li> after cleaning my face and appling the triple action vitamin c serum, i take only a portion the size of a pea, and i  am amazed,</li>
            <li> After a month of use it is  very noticeable how my pores look smaller and how thin and smooth my skin</li>
            <li> Low Hyaluronic Acid is what you would commonly find in most serums such as this.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for 3 weeks so far</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and pores have gotten considerably smaller.  </li>
            <li> Most of the Hyadluronic Serums I have tried have always been on the thin, runny side.</li>
            <li> I like that it is pure Hyaluronic Acid with out Vitamin C or other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for only a few weeks, and my skin already looks better...</li>
            <li> I had one right down the middle of my face between my nose and my ear.</li>
            <li> Normally my face has dry spots everywhere</li>
            <li> viscous hyaluronic acid serum from Voil&amp;agrave;Ve contains only the essential ingredients, including purified water, both high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids, phenoxyethanol, and ethylhexylglycerin.  </li>
            <li> I use it not only on the more sensitive areas of the face, but also on my elbows and other delicate spots.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the Eye Serum I purchased from the same vendor and can see marked improvements in my skin tone as well as diminished wrinkles (crow&#x27;s feet) around my eye area shortly after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> #34;VoilaVe 100% Pure LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum provides you with something that, according to the company, ordinary hyaluronic acids can‚Äôt give you and that is high and low molecular weight.  </li>
            <li> : (If you&#x27;re not 100% happy with your purchase of VoilaVeTM LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum, let us know</li>
            <li> The formula is very thick, but absorbs super fast and does not leave the skin feeling irritated or dry.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s dry, my skin is so incredibly soft there is no need for a moisurizer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because she wants to maintain her skin and prevent future wrinkles as she noticed a small wrinkle starting near her mouth and was horrified.  </li>
            <li> definitely smoother skin and a little certainly goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> They need to take time to protect the merchandise properly as in my instance, (I ordered 3 bottles at 1 time so as to save money) all bottles were put into a rather flat package with no bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> helped my skin to get the needed hydration while making the overall condition of my skin soft, less oily and well</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, so I cannot attest to its long term effects.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to comment about wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different HA serums and this is by far one of my favorites because of the texture and consistency.</li>
            <li> it is a dropper and hard to control how much you get out...</li>
            <li> But I have to use it daily; using it a few times doesn&#x27;t show lasting effects, however that might just be my skin and not necessarily the product.  </li>
            <li> It plumps up my skin and keeps it moist all day long.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> My face is plump and hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> Then I use two drops of the Argan oil and let it absorb then added my other facial products that I use per my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I use the Clarisonic brush in the morning  and evening after a thorough rinse, I pat dry and immediately apply the serum.</li>
            <li> Firms, but does not over dry.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint has to do with the direct shipping from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that this product was not available when I was younger!  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a critical component of the skin structure and our bodies actively use it to repair and replace protein strutures damaged by age or exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> have never used a Hyaluronic acid serum before, but have heard alot of them are pretty thin.</li>
            <li> did want to make everyone aware that this is a very thick product and when you think it is virtually empty, there is still a lot of product in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very strange!  </li>
            <li> neck area has shown definite improvement - looking less like tanned leather...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my eyes are less puffy when I wake up and don&#x27;t have those big eye lines.  </li>
            <li> Pores seem smaller and lines seem to be less pronounced.</li>
            <li> Not that they were very deep, but none the less</li>
            <li> A few drops will go a long way, so the bottle will last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use LacHydrin prescription for very dry skin,  and</li>
            <li> I found the solution to be very dry on my face once I used it and also left a white film once it dried which was not cute in public.  </li>
            <li> have only been using the product for a little over a week now.  </li>
            <li> I finally discovered this little beauty, and have been blown away by how well it works on my skin.</li>
            <li> (RoseHip Oil &amp; Triple Action Vitamin C)&lt;br /&gt;it is hard to tell WHAT/ WHICH is working</li>
            <li> I also recommend mixing a little bit with your other lotions and applying on very dry areas such as feet, elbows, or knees.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount so a bottle lasts a long time..</li>
            <li> My skin has a definite glow just after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> In just a few short weeks my skin has improved in appearance to the point where I am wearing almost no makeup.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind it being thicker than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Using few drops on face daily after a bath.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My few and small age spots on my upper left cheek are less visible now.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thicker than other Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have tried.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently, the dullness of my face and neck due to environmental exposure and age is fading.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other Hyaluronic Acid Serums</li>
            <li> other VoliaVe products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li> Now, I use the other one as part of a conditioner I made for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but was looking for a change ... a friend of mine recommended the line by VoilaVe</li>
            <li> Other hya acid serums don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> It is slightly thicker than I expected but it is not greasy</li>
            <li> Fortunately my skin isn&#x27;t terribly bad</li>
            <li> It brightens my dark spots and my skin appears firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought the serum after reading what it would do for dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> the prices are not beyond the average person&#x27;s reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The articles I read also recommended a dark glass bottle with dropper for application.</li>
            <li> Dark spots and lines gradually disappear.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and the triple action vitamin c serum for approximately 3 months.  </li>
            <li> This product is a thick gel, very similar to Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li> so it seems to run down my fingers before I can get it to my face.  </li>
            <li> so I laid the bottle down on its side and have used it another two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Cannot wait to see what it does with those other &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; lines I am not so bothered about.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> so well hes now been using it for 3 days and no more dry skin</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount for your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> serum is thick and you only need a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using the hyaluronic serum along with the other products in the VoilaVe line for a few weeks</li>
            <li> This product has helped age spots on my hands decrease slightly.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that visibly tightens my skin in less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Will go with Cosmedica since you can get 2x amount for less money.</li>
            <li> I do feel like my skin is firmer and my pores are a bit less noticeable.</li>
            <li> skin is less oily now since I have used it</li>
            <li> The Esthtetician at my Plastic Surgeon&#x27;s office recommended one that they sell which was 4 times the cost, with less tightening and smoothing effect.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it with my typical skincare routine in the evening.</li>
            <li> The lines around my mouth and nose are much less noticeable after just one week.</li>
            <li> Even though it is thicker it does not leave a greasy mess on your face.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with little wrinkles,</li>
            <li> Besides my face i put a little on the tops of my hands.</li>
            <li> The texture of this serum is a little bit thicker than others that I have used that seem too watery.</li>
            <li> My skin seems a little &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but my skin looks a little tighter already.    </li>
            <li> a little research online and Hyaluronic Acid Serum kept coming up in my searches.  </li>
            <li> I told her not to be mad at me if it didn&#x27;t work since I don&#x27;t know the first thing about skincare.  </li>
            <li> I use this serum everyday and every night.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company with a few questions.  </li>
            <li> After application I wait a few minutes before applying my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this serum for a few weeks now using it everyday after I shower when my skin is still damp.</li>
            <li> A few drops is all I need to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> She says it makes her skin feel refreshed and likes that there is no strong odor</li>
            <li> I have used other HA products for years and this one was a major disappointment.   </li>
            <li> It does not feel oily or heavy, and i have noticed small changes since i have started</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply to skin in a thin layer and allow to dry.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered with bad face skin with large pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> so not many products help.  </li>
            <li> It is a small amber glass bottle with a glass pipet and rubber bulb.</li>
            <li> and I think it has made a small difference.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I when  wake up I don&#x27;t have under eye  bags or heavy eyelids!  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews</li>
            <li> One of m pet peeves is that some of these expensive products are so difficult to get the last little bits out of the bottle or tube and I will find a way.  </li>
            <li> At least with Amazon and Piping Rock</li>
            <li> Do not think they show  those over late sixties or into eighties.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been seeing Hyaluronic Acid Serum everywhere lately</li>
            <li> and then I revisted the negative reviews of the one I had been using.</li>
            <li> At least they did for me.</li>
            <li> This serum comes out the dropper like a thick bead of gel, which makes you think it is going to be thick going on.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order it for just that reason, but this stuff is really thick</li>
            <li> I seriously notice a difference if I run out of this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband he suffers with dry flakey skin on his face</li>
            <li> In just a couple of weeks, it seems that all the lines on my forehead disappeared and my skin feels so supple, brighter and seriously hydrated.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to waste.</li>
            <li> I have been regularly using this product but no changes in my skin :(</li>
            <li> As a result the package collapsed and one of the bottles was broken.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it does not have any unnecessary fillers</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum has no fillers and unnecessary dilutions.</li>
            <li> I will keep using as my number 1 anti aging and beauty secret</li>
            <li> and it virtually dissipates into the skin leaving no oily or sticky residue behind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really bad dark circles under my eyes and everyone always says I look exhausted, but I&#x27;ve noticed that ever since I started using this they&#x27;ve been going away.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just moving on as another failed product that doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> A weird vertical line.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am using this wrong?  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there are no miracle cures for aging except surgery</li>
            <li> It was getting too expensive and I needed to find something else.</li>
            <li> I added a negative review because I also was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency, so often serums are so thin, it is nearly impossible to get them out with a dropper.</li>

            <li> Weird!</li>
            <li> As a result, I‚Äôve tried products used by both talk show host Oprah and Ellen which turned out to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say that as a bad thing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum comes out the dropper like a thick bead of gel, which makes you think it is going to be thick going on.  However, when you rub it together with your fingers, it immediately turns more watery.  I don&#x27;t say that as a bad thing.  The Rosehip oil I purchased from the same company comes out of the dropper watery so it seems to run down my fingers before I can get it to my face.  With this serum, you don&#x27;t have to rush to get your hand to your face before the serum runs off your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased with this product, while also a bit confused.  On the one hand, it says it provides &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; but then says you have to follow with a moisturizer.  I&#x27;m sure there is a difference between hydration and moisturizing, but it seems this product leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.  I follow up with the Rosehip Oil as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the product for a little over a week now.  If my opinion changes, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> I was taken back by all the great ratings but poor outcome I&#x27;ve had with this product.  Maybe its because I&#x27;m a dude.  I found the solution to be very dry on my face once I used it and also left a white film once it dried which was not cute in public.  I saw many reviews how it was ohhh so supple on the skin once applied, I felt no moisture in this product.  Fortunately my skin isn&#x27;t terribly bad so I&#x27;m just moving on as another failed product that doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> Great product ,  makes skin feel and look great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff face feels more firm it&#x27;s clear and just feels good and with the eye cream my wrinkles are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  Cover some of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love VoilaVe! I have been using it for 10 days and now I have ordered the eye cream and the triple action serum as well.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer, smoother and everybody realizes the difference. After noticing the improvement in my skin, my husband also started using it and he says that it really works with his skin and it hydrates perfectly!</li>
            <li> Just starting using put goes on smoothly so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic  Acid Serum for several weeks now. Voile Ve  does not disappoint. The consistency of this serum is a bit thicker  than I am used to. Using the dropper I put about a dime sized portion on my palm, rub my hands to gather and apply it to my face and neck. After the serum dries ( minutes) I apply a layer of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I find Hyaluronic Acid + moisturizer is a winning combination for me, for my mild rosacea. It calms the redness and my face does not seem to get redder as the day wears on. I was given this product during a promotional period to try and test it, and I can highly recommend it based on quality  and performance. I like the results I am getting, and my sensitive skin has had no adverse reaction. I will continue to use this product daily with my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference in my skin within one week of using the vitamin C serum. My pores are smaller and the texture of my skin is smoother. The serum is light and absorbs quickly into the skin. I expected it to sting (so that I knew it was working), but it had a pleasant feel and I saw the effects within days! Once I realized it should be used along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for maximum effectiveness, I started using that as well. My dark circles are gone and my skin is more hydrated. I notice a drastic difference if I stop using them for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying these now to try while they are offered at such a huge discount. I would love to become a loyal customer, however, if the price is increased above $45, I will have to discontinue use and find another excellent product that is affordable.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks and can already see a difference in the wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.  I am very impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product! Keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> After around 2 weeks saw an overall improvement in moisture retention and a wonderful natural glow to my face. Love it</li>
            <li> Ok, I never thought I would write a review based on two applications of this serum, but I feel I must! I have no issues with little wrinkles, hey we age and they are wrinkles are natural.&lt;br /&gt;But I had one right down the middle of my face between my nose and my ear. A weird vertical line. I thought I&#x27;d have to get filler or something, but I did not want to go that route.&lt;br /&gt;Two applications of this serum and it is plumped up and nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;Un-Believable.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft and glowing and today at work, someone guessed my age at 15 years younger than I am.&lt;br /&gt;Nice!&lt;br /&gt;I kept staring at my face in my rearview mirror in the car on the way home today-looking for that dreaded shadow, but it was nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how this works, but it does. Cannot wait to see what it does with those other &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; lines I am not so bothered about.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> If you apply this before your makeup it sloughs off.  Therefore, I started mixing my makeup together with the hyaluronic acid before applying my makeup and that seems to work.  However, not seeing a lot of plumping of skin that should occur with regular use. Maybe I am using this wrong?  Perhaps mixing with my makeup reduces its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic people.  I&#x27;m glad I chose this one in particular -- adding it to my face cream is the best method of use for me.  I&#x27;m 50 &amp; facial lines diminish.</li>
            <li> This is good but a little thick for HA.  I prefer the more thin HAs because I&#x27;m pretty sure the thinnest serums/creams need to go on first which I think  should be Hyaluronic Acid :)</li>
            <li> It goes on really watery, but dries quickly. I&#x27;m using it both night and day. I see that my face is brightening up already... that&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Smooths skin and makes it easy to absorb creams.  Great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. It brightens my dark spots and my skin appears firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, very nicely priced, gets rid of the scaly, crackly texture.  But I have to use it daily; using it a few times doesn&#x27;t show lasting effects, however that might just be my skin and not necessarily the product.  Fantastic alternative to weekly facials at $90 a visit.</li>
            <li> Best Hyaluronic Serum ever!  Results are amazing and I am 67 years old!</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago, so I was only able to test it briefly... I like the gel-like consistency and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  So far it dries to a nice finish, not sticky or goopy.  I cannot yet say if it works to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; my skin, but I&#x27;m hoping it will.  The serum itself is clear and you only need a drop for your whole face so I feel like this is a very good value.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered with bad face skin with large pores on my nose.  Hyaluronic Acid Serum has noticeably reduced pores.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  It took me 40 years to find best facial product BRAVO.!!</li>
            <li> love how the skin seems to soak it right up!  definitely smoother skin and a little certainly goes a long way.  neck area has shown definite improvement - looking less like tanned leather...whew!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, and better as complement of the Vitamin C serum. It needs a moisturizer afterwards though.</li>
            <li> Sticky like honey.  I have used other HA products for years and this one was a major disappointment.   I never received my money back as advertised: (If you&#x27;re not 100% happy with your purchase of VoilaVeTM LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum, let us know and we&#x27;ll refund your entire purchase price...no questions asked!) A big lie.</li>
            <li> On my way to more youthful skin!</li>
            <li> I was given this product free for review and was impressed with how quickly it got here and how well it was packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a Hyaluronic acid serum before, but have heard alot of them are pretty thin. this serum is not..it is quite&lt;br /&gt;thick and disappears into the skin quickly. It does not feel oily or heavy, and i have noticed small changes since i have started&lt;br /&gt;using it. I cant wait to see continued results. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold! I enjoy the fill of my face when I use this.</li>
            <li> so far so good. I bought the serum after reading what it would do for dark circles under the eyes. I ve been using this serum for about two weeks night and day and I DO see positive results in the skin being lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel revitalized. Test on a patch of skin first to make sure your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it. Give it a try and see how it works for you. Softer skin and more vital looking!</li>
            <li> Amazing results using this hyaluronic serum in conjunction with their Vitamin C serum. Besides my face i put a little on the tops of my hands. Love the results. Never want to be without it. I also keep both serums in the refrigerator...feels great going on cold and figure it&#x27;s potency may benefit from storing cold.</li>
            <li> When I used this product I was afraid, because I don&#x27;t know how it will work in my skin, but the results are amazing, my skin is more better after that I use this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hyaluronic acid, with no parabans or chemicals. Adds moisture under products like retin a or  adapalene without reducing their benefits. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t make you break out or make your skin feel heavy or greasy. I work in a derm office and it&#x27;s better than what we carry there!</li>
            <li> My wife said I had bad sun spots and this stuff works!  Smoother and lightening those areas.  Like what I see.</li>
            <li> I use this serum everyday and every night. The texture of this serum is a little bit thicker than others that I have used that seem too watery. I seriously notice a difference if I run out of this product. It plumps up the fine lines I have around my eyes and my little &amp;#34;smile creases&amp;#34;. I also use it immediately after any light at-home facial peels that I occasionally use and it seems to help my skin recover faster. Don&#x27;t hesitate. This serum really is the Best.</li>
            <li> Thanks, is excelent product</li>
            <li> love it, arrived on June 19 and in less then a week I saw changes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd cooment in addition to a direct email.  I received a package with NO product on it. Please refund.</li>
            <li> So far I think this is helping my skin. The first ingredient is water and I wish they give the molecular size of the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; sized molecules. We&#x27;ll see how it goes after more than a week of use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  Seriously. AMAZING.  Absolutely the best skin product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Serum is all the rage these days. It is proven to help with wrinkles and dullness. This serum is a bit watery but seems to be a good one. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. This one seems to be a good one, and for the price is is really great. After a week, my skin is brighter and I look a bit rosier now!</li>
            <li> Only have been using this for 6 months and like it.  Nice and light weight. Goes on milky and cool. I will continue to use this. The price is great compared to what some chains are charging for hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I just love the skin care products. My skin has a definite glow just after a few weeks of use. I get a lot of complements. I will definitely continue to buy all the products from Voila Va</li>
            <li> I love this product! It plumps up my skin and keeps it moist all day long. Will continue to use this with 100% Organic Argan  Oil.[[ASIN:B00I2495QG Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin - Groundbreaking Low &amp; High Molecular Weight Formula Produces Maximum Hydration &amp; Superior Anti-aging Results - Only LH Hyaluronic Acid On Amazon - 1oz]]</li>
            <li> This product has helped age spots on my hands decrease slightly. I will continue to use to see if I have further improvement.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Since using it my skin feels softer, the texture looks smoother and firmer with a radiant glow.[[ASIN:B00I2495QG Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin - Groundbreaking Low &amp; High Molecular Weight Formula Produces Maximum Hydration &amp; Superior Anti-aging Results - Only LH Hyaluronic Acid On Amazon - 1oz]]</li>
            <li> I am 63 with fair skin.  I have rosacea which I am keeping almost under control.  The VoilaVe hyaluronic acid goes on smoothly and feels wonderful on the skin.  In just a few short weeks my skin has improved in appearance to the point where I am wearing almost no makeup.  My skin feels smooth and hydrated and looks much, much better than before I started using this product.  I contacted the company with a few questions.  I received a prompt, polite and helpful response.</li>
            <li> Love this serum, will buy again soon! Very moisturized! Good quality!</li>
            <li> This serum goes on so smoothly, dries quickly, and leaves my face feeling hydrated.  I love that you don&#x27;t need more than a pea size amount to cover your entire face - a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week so far, and I do see a filling out in the fine lines on my forehead and upper nose.  I apply it both day and night before I go to bed with a moisturizer and I&#x27;ve noticed my eyes are less puffy when I wake up and don&#x27;t have those big eye lines.  So far, this product is great!</li>
            <li> goes on clear and not greasy, which i love. I do put argon oil on top to moisturize.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, have been using it now for about two weeks along with the Vitamin C serum and am very pleased .My skin is smoother, more even toned and softer.  The fine lines have definitely diminished and the dark spots are lighter.  I use this at night and apply moisturizer after it dries.  A little goes a long way so I am happy it will last a while-definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Awsome product, I am loving this serum, I see results every time I use, I will continue to order . I am very happy with this line of skin care, I am so happy I found them. Great products at affordable prices üòçüòç</li>
            <li> I have used this product and the triple action vitamin c serum for approximately 3 months.  I receive compliments on my skin. I hardly ever write reviews but I love my skin now. I am in my mid forties and I haven&#x27;t had a facial in the spa sent I bought these two. I generally add a light moisturizer such as avocado oil after I cleanse then add one of these products.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! I give it 5 stars. I use it with my moisturizer and get compliments all the time. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not so sure anout this product, I don&#x27;t like the tightness, but I will continue to use, because I just love the serum, such a great product !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week but I already notice a difference in the overall tone of my skin. My skin is smoother and softer. It soaks in immediately and feels very nice. It only takes three drops for my entire face. I&#x27;m hopeful it will help my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I started using a Vitamin C serum because I heard they work well together, and so far so good!  My first impressions are very good. The packaging is high quality and the bottle itself is weighty glass. I LOVE that this serum has no scent at all, and the thick texture makes it easier to spread. It immediately made my skin feel soft. I really look forward to long term effects! I have acne-prone skin and so far the serum is cooperating with my skin.  Note: this product was received for the purpose of honest and fair review.</li>
            <li> I started using this as a moisturizer. It does a great job there, but it also smooths the skin. My face and hands are much smoother, even though I train in mma. I&#x27;ve even noticed this smooths out surface scar tissue! I&#x27;m really glad I found this and can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll ever need another skin care product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product so far.  I&#x27;ll know more when I&#x27;ve had more usage.</li>
            <li> Yes my thought is it is a better product than others I have tried.  I am 86 so not many products help.  I use LacHydrin prescription for very dry skin,  and my Hyaluronic Acid serum  helps keep more moisture in the skin.  There are Vit C serums  but I know it takes more than 12 percent to be of value for skin care.  At least with Amazon and Piping Rock the prices are not beyond the average person&#x27;s reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  There is no skin product that can accomplish all the claims they state and pictures to show results are of very young women.  Do not think they show  those over late sixties or into eighties.</li>
            <li> I use the serum Morning and Evening.  The serum tightens my skin and help my moisturizer work better. I have been using the drum for Over 6 months and my skin looks wonderful</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks. My face is dry and the dryness has gone and it is smooth and has elasticity. I do see brightness and hope the fine lines on the forehead will vanish.</li>
            <li> Used it on my sun spots on my face and it seemed to lighten up a bit</li>
            <li> I waited to weeks before leaving this review in order to give everyone considering this Hyaluronic Acid Serum a REAL review.  And this stuff is definitely worth a try.  For starters, I&#x27;m 31 years old and have never really used sunscreen.  Therefore, my skin has been tortured for the last 30 years; I also suffer from dark circles, fine lines, and occasional cystic acne.  Within the first 4 days of using this serum, I saw that my skin was brighter and so much smoother.  Now 2 weeks in, I can tell that around my eyes is smoother and the darkness under my eyes is significantly lighter.  I&#x27;ll give another update once I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle.  All in all, I&#x27;m very impressed and would certainly recommend this serum to anyone, men and woman.  At this price point, it&#x27;s certainly worth it!</li>
            <li> After using ViolaVe Hyaluronic Acid Serum my skin appears younger, fresher and has a more supple look. Also, there appears to be improved elasticity to the face. This product does what it claims to do and more. I would highly recommend this product for anyone how wants younger, fresher and more supple looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micki</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very impressed by this product. I can actually feel my face tighten after application &amp; can see noticeable changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about two weeks.  It cetainly does the trick on my puffy under eye bags.  I put a bit on the am and in minutes the bags are gone!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week &amp; so far I love it. Not only does it make my skin feel so soft but it gets rid of my puffy eyes.  I love it because it is so lightweight and doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have put a product on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading on the newest &amp; best treatments for middle aged skin &amp; this is it. Low &amp; high molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It hydrates &amp; plumps without fillers, parabens, alcohol, or fragrance. The articles I read also recommended a dark glass bottle with dropper for application. Happy with the product &amp; the price.</li>
            <li> Tightens.  Need to order more!</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are fading and skin appears improved</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of beauty products, and my cabinets are stocked full of different lotions and serums. I ordered this serum because I liked the company&#x27;s rose oil and figured I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I have never used a product that visibly tightens my skin in less than 30 seconds. It&#x27;s AMAZING. I use this at night and put a light layer of lotion over it to lock in the moisture. My skin feels smooth and my fine lines are less noticeable in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t work as well for me under makeup, so I stick to night-only use. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this is too. So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum came in a 1 fl oz dark brown bottle that helps keep light out and extends the life span.&lt;br /&gt;It has a black liquid dropper top for easy application. I can get a drop or two out easily and this is really all I need when I apply it to my face. This product is a thick gel, very similar to Aloe Vera Gel. It is a bit thicker than other Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have tried. It has no scent to it and it isn&#x27;t sticky. It is easily absorbed by my skin and yes it does hydrate my skin after using the Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that this particular product has no fillers, parabens, alcohol, fragrance and is cruelty free. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue on my face either, which is great. I can use this under my makeup and also before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it superior to the other Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past?&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, although I do like this product, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference from the others. They all seem to do about the same.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels smooth and soft afterward, and is looking healthier, as with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I was sent a free bottle in exchange for my honest review. No other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> great product for  wrinkles! My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind! { 61 years old} thanks, again!</li>
            <li> Great little bottle of magic for a very affordable price ! After 10 days or so of use I could see a positive difference in the texture of my skin.  A little dab goes a long way.  After application I wait a few minutes before applying my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this serum for a few weeks now using it everyday after I shower when my skin is still damp. It has a really nice gel consistency and soaks in after a few seconds. It moisturizes my skin without leaving a greasy feel that I get with some lotion based moisturizers. This serum contains LOW and HIGH molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid. This is important because the low M.W. HA will be able to penetrate the skin deeper than the high M.W. molecule. HA is made naturally in the body throughout various types of tissue. I have tried a few different HA serums and this is by far one of my favorites because of the texture and consistency. There is no smell and the product seems very pure. The packaging the product comes in is nice as well. It is a small amber glass bottle with a glass pipet and rubber bulb. I also recommend mixing a little bit with your other lotions and applying on very dry areas such as feet, elbows, or knees. Another use for this type of moisturizer is post AHA or BHA peel. I often do Glycolic, Lactic, or Salicylic Acid face peels and it is very important to put the moisture back afterwards. Usually if I try to use Cetaphil lotion it still burns a little after, but this serum is very nice post-peel and gives my face the pampering it needs without the burning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 days and I am hooked. It is giving my skin a smoother surface and seems to be reducing fine lines. The little bit of flakiness on my forehead is gone and my makeup goes on much better. I use the Clarisonic brush in the morning  and evening after a thorough rinse, I pat dry and immediately apply the serum. A few drops is all I need to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product!  after cleaning my face and appling the triple action vitamin c serum, i take only a portion the size of a pea, and i  am amazed, how it makes my skin feel.i love the texture and it leaves my skin looking young and fresh.. mind you- i am  in my late 40s, but my skin didn&#x27;t look this good for a long time! this product together with the vitamin c serum is a must!!</li>
            <li> Works as what it claims to do. And it works well my break out prone skin. I do highly recommend this product. It makes my skin looks dewy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking the tightness and smoothness of my face with this product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it! The formula is very thick, but absorbs super fast and does not leave the skin feeling irritated or dry. After a month of use it is  very noticeable how my pores look smaller and how thin and smooth my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 30 years old, fair/normal skin, and I use it at night, followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s and I think it has made a small difference. My skin seems a little &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve had a face lift but it is helping! There is nothing bad or harmful in it that I know of so it&#x27;s all good! Unfortunately there are no miracle cures for aging except surgery so I will continue to use this with a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is incredible. I use to buy a product that you can only find in certain spas for over 100$ tiny vials that provided added moisture to my face. It was great because I live in a desert environment. It was getting too expensive and I needed to find something else. I have read about Hyaluronic Acid and this is found in a lot of well named products as part of their ingredients. So I did some more research on it to find out what it is used for and it&#x27;s actions. It plumps the skin in a good way, but better you Google it yourself and get the scientific explanation. When I bought it this was exactly what I was looking for and similar to the previous  product I was buying but better and reasonably priced.. And you don&#x27;t have to use very much it and will last a good while because it is so concentrated. One drop along with two drops of the Rose Hip Seed Oil can cover the face and the neck and chest. Awesome. Then I use two drops of the Argan oil and let it absorb then added my other facial products that I use per my dermatologist. And of course my sun screen.  I am very pleased with this product and the company as well.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday! Great product.  I even ordered an extra one and gave as a gift,  now she loves it.  Will continue to order!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> very good product will recommend and will by again</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long at all to see positive changes; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Only used for 1 week.</li>
            <li> Best serum! Beautiful and really effective!  great tool! Definitely recommend to try!</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of this hyaluronic acid.  I love the consistency of VoilaVe compared to other hyaluronic products I have tried!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Skin feels soft. Pores seem smaller and lines seem to be less pronounced.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love! For some reason this has helped cut back the oil production in my skin. I&#x27;m not as shiny anymore. my skin feels great. will buy again.</li>
            <li> nice prod but  don&#x27;t expect permanent results , does seem to help on a temp. basis though.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to help with large pores more than anything, overall.&lt;br /&gt;Have now used this, Oz naturals with Vit. C  and Cosmedica and don&#x27;t see much diff.  between  them all .&lt;br /&gt; Will go with Cosmedica since you can get 2x amount for less money.</li>
            <li> I am back to purchase more. I am seeing a younger reflection in the mirror after about 2 weeks of using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Once applied it is absorbed into the skin, almost immediately. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I decided to look for a H Acid product because I like to use some type of &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product at night, and other products I&#x27;ve tried (including Rx ones) weren&#x27;t that effective and made my skin flakey and irritated.  I read an article by a dermatologist who said that H Acid is great for the skin, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  So much to love about this product!  I like that it&#x27;s natural, organic, vegan, and has no artificial fragrance.  It&#x27;s VERY gentle, you can even use it right around the eyes.  And yet, it seems to be quite effective... I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for only a few weeks, and my skin already looks better... I have a more even skin tone, less redness, no breakouts out all (for a nice change!). and somewhat clearer pores.  Don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; turn you off... this product really sinks into the skin immediately; it&#x27;s invisible and completely weightless. Perfect for any type of skin, but oily skins will really appreciate that it isn&#x27;t one bit greasy.  As an aroma-therapist I like using this product as a &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; for therapeutic essential oils that I use for skin care purposes.  GREAT customer service too!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but this stuff truly is amazing!</li>
            <li> This serum shipped fast and is in a quality container.  The serum feels very smooth and rich going on.  You only need a very small amount for your face and neck.  I put witch hazel on my face first to help move the serum around otherwise it soaks in too quickly.  My skin feels very soft but I have not noticed a difference in wrinkles (only been using it for three weeks)</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a month. I do feel like my skin is firmer and my pores are a bit less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely essential to use with this with the Vitamin C serum! Love love love!</li>
            <li> I was so certain  I had written a review and now I can&#x27;t find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great...it seems to have thickened my skin and I will probably use it forever if the price stays reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did want to make everyone aware that this is a very thick product and when you think it is virtually empty, there is still a lot of product in the bottle.  I use the eyedropper as an applicator so I laid the bottle down on its side and have used it another two weeks.  One of m pet peeves is that some of these expensive products are so difficult to get the last little bits out of the bottle or tube and I will find a way.  Too expensive to waste.</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> I like the consistency, so often serums are so thin, it is nearly impossible to get them out with a dropper. I was hesitant to order it for just that reason, but this stuff is really thick so it is easy. Doesn&#x27;t take but a drop to cover my face and neck. It&#x27;s not greasy and makes my face look luminescent. Can&#x27;t wait to see results after using for awhile. Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been researching products that not only work, but that also don&#x27;t test on animals. I finally discovered this little beauty, and have been blown away by how well it works on my skin. I use it on my face to help with some dry skin that I always seem to have trouble getting rid of, and it&#x27;s been amazing! It&#x27;s made my skin so much more smooth and soft! And since I work at a gym I&#x27;m always looking for a way to make my skin look great, quickly so that I can work the morning shift without spending all day getting ready! It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve found out they&#x27;ve added some new products, too, which I can&#x27;t wait to try now!</li>
            <li> lush texture and silky feel on my skin. Thicker than most serums, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly, nice scent.  Haven&#x27;t seen any results however.</li>
            <li> Works great together with Triple Action Vitain C Serum, tighter skin and radiant glo.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling good and I definitely see a difference in my skin. A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try out the Voila Ve Hyaluronic Acid Serum and loved it.  I love to find great beauty products and this one was great.  This was a very light serum with the consistency of water but it really did the job.  I could feel my skin tighter after just one use.  With even my sensitive skin I did not have a reaction at all.  My skin was just tighter and softer after just one use.  This product did not have smell at all so you did not smell the product instead of your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;  Voila Ve has a wide range of beauty products and I have loved everyone so far.  They are a must check out on Amazon.  Whether you are looking to firm , smooth , or just up keep your skin you will find what you are looking for.  I used this product in the morning before my lotion and makeup and at night before my night lotion it was a perfect match just soaked right into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me to review. These are my honest opinions of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The VoilaVe Hyaluronic Serum, was just a pleasure to review these past couple of weeks. You might be wondering what is the difference between this serum and the others I have tried? Well let me tell you there are a couple of differences that are noticeable and welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The first big noticeable difference is the thickness of the serum. Most of the Hyadluronic Serums I have tried have always been on the thin, runny side. This VoilaVe Hyaluronic Serum is much thicker. It really is not a bad thing at all.  It comes with a dropper which can still be used with this product and it functions properly. Even though it is thicker it does not leave a greasy mess on your face. The product soaks in nicely. leaving you refreshed and feeling so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) So by now you are wondering what the LH in the title means. Well this product offers not only low Hyaluronic Acid, but high as well. Low Hyaluronic Acid is what you would commonly find in most serums such as this. The low penetrates deeply into the skin. The high Hyaluronic Acid, more so sits on the skin. I never knew there were Highs and lows, but you learn something new every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are the two big differences that I found with this serum. I have used this product in the morning and at night and have noticed great differences and I think it helped my face after the reaction from another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one big difference that I have noticed using this product is that my uneven skin tone has really evened out. This is very bothersome to me because even when others may not notice it, because of caked on makeup, I know it is there. I would recommend this product for all of its qualities.</li>
            <li> Happy with product...</li>
            <li> This 30ml high-intensity moisturizing serum really works well for my skin type. I have a combination skin and my T-zone tends to get very oily during the day. I noticed how the VoilaVe 100% Pure Low and High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum worked wonders on my skin tone, suppleness, pores and overall texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is less oily now since I have used it and I don&#x27;t have to apply face powder anymore to my T-zone to remove the shine. I like how this tiny bottle packed with powerful moisturizing serum helped my skin to get the needed hydration while making the overall condition of my skin soft, less oily and well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product especially if you have age spots too. My few and small age spots on my upper left cheek are less visible now.</li>
            <li> I have been using both 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and Triple Action Vitamin C Serum for 16-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a product that improves the texture and appearance of my face and neck.  As a result, I‚Äôve tried products used by both talk show host Oprah and Ellen which turned out to be very expensive. After seeing a Dr. OZ show regarding the benefits of using products with high-levels of vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and retinol; a Google search led me to these VoilaVe products which were affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I didn‚Äôt like the sticky feel of the hyaluronic acid which I applied first; followed by the vitamin C. So, I begin blending both - two drops of hyaluronic acid and two spray pumps of vitamin C in the palm of my hand and applying it to my face and  throat which was much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, the dullness of my face and neck due to environmental exposure and age is fading. My face and neck is more radiant, velvety and firmer which indicates my skin can only get better with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these products to people wanting to improve the texture and appearance of their face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have used Trish Mcevoy face serum and the COSMEDICA PURE HYALURONIC serum and  this ONE is so greasey and It made me forehead break out and I have never had any problems with breakouts.  I am 44 and Cosmedica works so well!!  It plumps my cheeks and fine lines!  I use it morning and night and put it everywhere including right under the eyebrows and on my under eye area with out getting too close to my actual eyes!  I have noticed that I when  wake up I don&#x27;t have under eye  bags or heavy eyelids!  I stopped using it for a week and I will never to that again!  I can&#x27;t beilieve how well it works!!</li>
            <li> So far I love it! Goes on easily and dries nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now, maybe I&#x27;m seeing things but my skin looks a little tighter already.    Update, on my second bottle and loving this!!!</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been seeing Hyaluronic Acid Serum everywhere lately and I‚Äôm glad I finally got the chance to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to skin in a thin layer and allow to dry. Use sparingly at first and work up to the desired amount that works perfectly on your skin type. Use a moisturizer after applying. Apply morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is thick and you only need a little. After rubbing it on my face, my skin felt instantly smoother and more hydrated. My skin not only felt this way but it LOOKED smoother and healthier too. I was impressed; I was not excepting this instant result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serums can be very expensive but this serum is available on Amazon for $24.95‚Äî 63% off its original price of $67.95!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! And always great customer services!</li>
            <li> This serum really did  Immediately Deliver a more  Youthful Appearance to my Skin.  I applied this serum after washing my face in the morning.  My fine lines disappeared.  I am a 30 yo female btw.</li>
            <li> was a lil scared trying this but i did and i tell ya it is very smooth and it made my skin fresh looking. i would buy this again</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic acid serums for a while now and I really think my skin is brighter.  To be able to say that at 62 well I think that is pretty good. This absorbs well. I use it every evening before bed and before I apply my makeup in the morning. It only takes a small amount so a bottle lasts a long time..I&#x27;ve read that it helps hold in moisture so I have a mist bottle and before I apply I mist my face with water...It will always be part of my skin regimen. I like that it is pure Hyaluronic Acid with out Vitamin C or other products that way I get the full effect of the product..</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for problem skin. This particular brand/molecular structure really moisturizes and improves the texture of my skin; I have tried many brands and keep coming back to this one. Also, this particular Hyaluronic acid will not cause any break outs to my skin, which I am very susceptible to with other products</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing!!!!! Already on my 2nd bottle</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for 3 weeks so far and I love the feel of the product. I understand someone at my age, it might take a little while to see wrinkle reduction results, but my skin has never looked or have felt better,</li>
            <li> I never received the starbucks 5 gift card that was suppose to come with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the dropper delivery method.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had used this product for a while before writing a review.  Have to say I am quite pleased.  I use this in conjunction with their Vitamin C serum.  These products really compliment one another.  My pores, particularly on the forehead and nose, are pretty much non-existent.  I have also noticed the lines around my lip area are much more diminished.  Given the amazing results, especially when compared to much more expensive products on the market today, this is a winner - hands down.  My only complaint has to do with the direct shipping from Amazon.  They need to take time to protect the merchandise properly as in my instance, (I ordered 3 bottles at 1 time so as to save money) all bottles were put into a rather flat package with no bubble wrap.  As a result the package collapsed and one of the bottles was broken.  Although they did make it good, when I received the replacement bottle, again there was no bubble wrap around the bottle and the ends of the box were not even taped which meant anyone could reach into the package and pull the product out.  This is a direct problem of Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment center - not the manufacturer of the product itself.  Amazon are you listening???</li>
            <li> If I wore it alone, it was ok, but if I put any sort of lotion on top of it, it got all gummy and peeled off. Very strange!  I never used it enough to judge its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product !</li>
            <li> I did receive the VoilaVe LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Amazon, I been using it and its amazing , i like it a lot much better than other brands i used before. Thank you so much .. I will definitely keep using VoilaVe LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum now on. I also like to know if you have other kind of serums ..i would like to try some more..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again</li>
            <li> Used this product along with Triple Action Vitamin C Serum, but did not notice any extra benefit since the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum already included Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  It will make your skin dry/tight feeling if you use too much.</li>
            <li> great service.... love the serum~!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference at all...:(:(:(</li>
            <li> I used the cosmedica equivalent for awhile until I read about this brand and then I revisted the negative reviews of the one I had been using. I added a negative review because I also was disappointed. That other stuff is so diluted it seems like it&#x27;s mostly water. This serum however seems like the consistency of a real serum and is doing an ok job after a couple of weeks. It seems to cause zits occasionally though. Weird!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband he suffers with dry flakey skin on his face so I thought that we would give it a try it is working so well hes now been using it for 3 days and no more dry skin thank you for a wonderful product that does mousturise</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid works so well on my skin to make it softer and more ready to absorb moisture. I love this type of bottle and how you never have to touch the product except what you will use.</li>
            <li> Reviva hyalurinic serum soaks into the skin and feels great. This sat on top of the skin, burned and made my skin look and feel like plastic. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really bad dark circles under my eyes and everyone always says I look exhausted, but I&#x27;ve noticed that ever since I started using this they&#x27;ve been going away. People even say I&#x27;ve been more refreshed looking and everything. I know men aren&#x27;t &#x27;supposed&#x27; to use products like this but I figured... What the heck is the 21st century!</li>
            <li> Another great product by this company!!  Works better than the more expensive products.  Firms, but does not over dry.  Dark spots and lines gradually disappear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference on my skin,it makes my skin dry.just don&#x27;t understand how people get such a wonderful results.,by using this product.its just nothing......I dont trust reviews  any more.it is not for the first time when all reviews are wonderful,.but in reality its not.</li>
            <li> Impressed how this serum left my face... I put it alone and under my moisturizing cream either way works!!! I throw away all my anti aging cream cause this serum works better than all my expensive cream. I wish find this serum before... Very happy and my beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I use this after the deep sea mask and I think the combination of products have lightened my sun spots and made my skin glow more</li>
            <li> In love instantly!  After reading a million different product reviews, I decided to go with this one, and I am VERY impressed.  I jut received Belotero injections around my eyes and folds(pure Hyraluronic Acid that plumps skin) and this product just enhanced it!  The Esthtetician at my Plastic Surgeon&#x27;s office recommended one that they sell which was 4 times the cost, with less tightening and smoothing effect.  Thank you for this product; I am SOLD.  I use it with the Tripe Action Vitamin C Serum and just a beautiful smooth, glowing and hydrating outcome!</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other Hyaluronic Acid Serums so I honestly did not know what to expect. I do like that it isn&#x27;t sticky and it easily absorbs into my skin. I like to use it with my typical skincare routine in the evening. It is slightly thicker than I expected but it is not greasy so I don&#x27;t mind it being thicker than I expected it to be. I also like that it does not have any unnecessary fillers and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated. It also seems to work great for me on puffiness under the eyes! That alone make is a Beauty Must-Have in my book!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased it.  Great consistency ...blends into skin --moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> I love this serum!! Since I have started using it I have noticed the frown lines above my nose on my forehead lessening. Not that they were very deep, but none the less I do see a difference in the three weeks of use. My skin feels soft and pores have gotten considerably smaller.  I also use VoilaVe Vitamin C serum which is another excellent product.  I use the Vitamin C first and then the Hyaluronic acid.  Try them both - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, so I cannot attest to its long term effects.  So far I like it very much.  It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not feel tacky.  I can&#x27;t wait to see if there is a difference a month or so after using it.  Shipment was extremely fast and it was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> so i use this in conjunction w/ 2 other VoliaVe products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since i use all 3 together (RoseHip Oil &amp; Triple Action Vitamin C)&lt;br /&gt;it is hard to tell WHAT/ WHICH is working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am FOR SURE going to buy the RoseHip Oil again (see my review on that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a clear gel like liquid. it is a dropper and hard to control how much you get out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said,&lt;br /&gt;all 3 products&lt;br /&gt;my skin looks good-- (it has always been pretty clear--) i had a scar i picked (yes, WHEN i get a pimple, i can&#x27;t help but pick) that said, i don&#x27;t have many-- which is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 3 products combined,&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t feel like it has faded it -- that much (though i have dark(er) skin to begin w/) it isn&#x27;t super noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;what i DID notice&lt;br /&gt;is that i had a blemish (that time of the month) and i felt it DID &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; that a bit more quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles--&lt;br /&gt;i do feel my skin is smoother... like if it was a 6/7 before-- i would say it is an 8 now.  so&lt;br /&gt;u know a step up from what it was...&lt;br /&gt;and in a product, i guess that&#x27;s all we can ask for...!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am undecided on the 2 products... but LOVE the RoseHip oil...</li>
            <li> I really believe using this product has improved the appearance if my skin. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really makes a huge difference in the moisture level of my skin.  Bigger bottles of it would be fantastic!</li>
            <li> I did my research about this product, under the 10 best acid serums.  This is what I found in 4th place: VoilaVe LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum  &amp;#34;VoilaVe 100% Pure LH Hyaluronic Acid Serum provides you with something that, according to the company, ordinary hyaluronic acids can‚Äôt give you and that is high and low molecular weight.  The advantage of this groundbreaking formula, as they say, is that it gives you deep penetration and therefore better hydration.  Other pros are: plump skin, reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, minimization of puffiness and dark circles, evening of the skin tone, more youthful and radiant skin appearance and a lot of other benefits.  This hyaluronic acid serum has no fillers and unnecessary dilutions. It is also free of parabens, alcohol and fragrance.  It is made in the USA and comes together with a generous one year full money back guarantee as well as a free guide to a younger looking skin.  What Do People Review About VoilaVe Hyaluronic Acid Serum?  This is an excellent reviewed serum with people reporting only great benefits for their skin. So, how has this product enhanced their skin care? Let‚Äôs see! ‚Ä¢More plump and moisturized feeling skin. ‚Ä¢Reduction of wrinkles and even elimination of fine lines. ‚Ä¢Softer, smoother and brighter skin. ‚Ä¢Very good results in the case of puffy eye bags. ‚Ä¢Minimizing of the pores.&amp;#34;  Now I know what to order in my next purchase. Raquel</li>
            <li> I have been researching hyaluronic acid for some time and have used several products.  I have paid up to $85 for 1 ounce.  This is by far the best I have used!  And well the price is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I tried a product from another provider but it was nothing like this one. Now, I use the other one as part of a conditioner I made for my hair. I save this product for my face. It works very well and I saw a difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing! I don&#x27;t have enough words to describe the beauty of this stuff on the face. In just a couple of weeks, it seems that all the lines on my forehead disappeared and my skin feels so supple, brighter and seriously hydrated. I am so glad I tried this fantastic product! I will keep using as my number 1 anti aging and beauty secret</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it with the Eye Serum I purchased from the same vendor and can see marked improvements in my skin tone as well as diminished wrinkles (crow&#x27;s feet) around my eye area shortly after 2 weeks of use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really tones and tightens the skin, shrinking the lines , wrinkles and morning puffiness.  Like an instant face-lift.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft and moist my face is.  Normally my face has dry spots everywhere and this eliminates all the dryness.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have been using hyaluronic acid for a while.  I had received a recomendation from my dermatologist and so I did my research and yes .. ton&#x27;s of stuff out there about all the benefits.  I have tried other products but was looking for a change ... a friend of mine recommended the line by VoilaVe and I got several products ... I am just in love! My skin has improved dramatically since I started using this 100% pure product.  I had a fine line on the side of my mouth and it is practically gone .. then when I had ear surgery I suffered facial paralysis for a while and it left deep lines on my forehead ... again dramatically improved .. and I never thought that could happen.  I love this product .. will continue using it and give it a high recomendation.  I have written other reviews for this company because I have fallen in love.  And I have tried so many others .. many others that are more expensive (for no reason).</li>
            <li> Works just as well as brands I&#x27;ve paid 3x for.  Great value!  Will continue to use this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I seems to be working on tightening and firming the skin. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to comment about wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using the hyaluronic serum along with the other products in the VoilaVe line for a few weeks and I can&#x27;t believe how amazing my skin looks and feels. Very inexpensive for the results it is producing. My skin feels more hydrated and has never felt softer.  It has definitely softened the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  My only regret is that this product was not available when I was younger!  You can feel it tightening your skin as it is drying but once it&#x27;s dry, my skin is so incredibly soft there is no need for a moisurizer.  I will most defintely continue to use this line of products.</li>
            <li> They are great products are recommended works good after using vitamin C together my face has this glow skin is nice fitted i am really happy !</li>
            <li> Use this in combination with triple c serum twice a day.  It is wonderful.  I am 73 years old and have never had any thing work this well. Don&#x27;t get discouraged, it took about a month to get the full effect.  People tell me how nice I look and ask what I have done.  Love...Love.. Love</li>
            <li> After reading the question and answer above about the difference between this and the VoilaVe Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid (they should be used together), I decided to do just that. I had already received the Vitamin C H/A as a product sample and was asked to review this product as well. While the Vitamin C H/A worked great (I saw brightening of my skin), using these two products together gave me the added benefit of evening out my skin tone. My skin was super soft to the touch. My husband asked what I was doing in the bathroom to my face to make my skin glow and be so radiant! It was really great to see results, and it makes me happy that I&#x27;ve found two products by the same company that work well together.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Just as good as the expensive stuff</li>
            <li> Very good product for skin - need only one or two drops. Have not used long enough to add more. When I do, will rate again.</li>
            <li> I  love this! it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft from the first application!</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my face!</li>
            <li> No results as advertised.  Disappointed!  I have been regularly using this product but no changes in my skin :(</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a critical component of the skin structure and our bodies actively use it to repair and replace protein strutures damaged by age or exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This viscous hyaluronic acid serum from Voil&amp;agrave;Ve contains only the essential ingredients, including purified water, both high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids, phenoxyethanol, and ethylhexylglycerin.  It will quickly plump and moisturize the skin and it improves the appearance of fine wrinkles when used regularly over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum should be applied after bathing or washing the face for best effect.  I use it not only on the more sensitive areas of the face, but also on my elbows and other delicate spots.  It is completely non-irritating, even on the driest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 oz. (30 ml) amber bottle has a dropper cap for ease of use.  A few drops will go a long way, so the bottle will last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voil&amp;agrave;Ve provided a review sample for evaluation.  I like the simple formula and the effect it has on my skin and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency and is easy to apply and absorbs quickly and completely. I&#x27;ve noticed a healthy glow to my skin as well as less wrinkles. The lines around my mouth and nose are much less noticeable after just one week. I will definitely reorder this.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the Triple action vitamin c serum as a combination for my face.  I have gotten great results.  My skin is smoother, and I have seen a reduction in fine lines around my eyes.  This is a great skin product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because she wants to maintain her skin and prevent future wrinkles as she noticed a small wrinkle starting near her mouth and was horrified.  I have always felt that she had beautiful skin and was thinking, \\&quot;what the heck?\\&quot; but wanted her to be happy so I did a little research online and Hyaluronic Acid Serum kept coming up in my searches.  I decided to come on Amazon since it&#x27;s my #1 spot to shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product had great reviews and seems to be the only one on Amazon that has the high and low molecular weights so I decided to order it.  Supposedly the high and low molecular weights are important as one weight penetrates deeply into the layers of the skin (low molecular) while the other (high molecular) remains closer to the surface.  When the product came I told her I had something I wanted her to try and explained that I had researched and decided this was the best product.  I told her not to be mad at me if it didn&#x27;t work since I don&#x27;t know the first thing about skincare.  Well she has been using it now for over a week now and I am really amazed at the difference in her skin.  As I said she has always had beautiful skin, but this product has truly brought out the best in her skin.  Her skin looks like it is glowing even more and honestly appears younger.  She is very happy with the product as the fine line near her mouth is visibly improved.  She says it makes her skin feel refreshed and likes that there is no strong odor and it virtually dissipates into the skin leaving no oily or sticky residue behind.  I am so impressed with the stuff I snuck a little bit of it for myself last night and I&#x27;m going to see if she notices my \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Blends or absorbs into your skin almost immediately.  No stickiness, good product</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I use it with the entire line of VoilaVe products. I am a devout believer in this product line and will continue to use it. It has done for me, exactly what they said it would do. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very good product, as I posted in the seller review, I have noticed a decrease in the puffiness around my eye area.  I wake up with huge bags around my eyes but after putting on the eye serum and my regular moisturizer, I do notice a significant decrease.  This is only 3 days in ; I look forward to seeing if there are any other huge differences in a week or more.  But right now, I am very happy with this product and if all goes well, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum! I&#x27;ve used this product for about 4 days now and i am really impressed.  Goes on smoothly and evenly.  No sticky feeling. My face is plump and hydrated all day long.  Really loving this product!</li>
            <li> So far I have tried so many serum and this one is also great among all of it. It has  a nice smell and it&#x27;s not sticky at all which I mostly love about it. I use it at night before bed so that it absorb well when i am sleeping. You can say that I am using it as a sleeping mask. A little goes a long way. Highly recommend this to try out .&lt;br /&gt;I have received this free for review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this sooner!! I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this serum ... I seen quick results with instantly softer skin . I recommended this to all my girl and guy friends and you too !!</li>
            <li> So far so good. My first time using 100% pure Hyaluronic acid. Goes on nice not greasy... absorbs well and no odor. I&#x27;m a guy and trying to take care of my skin, so this isn&#x27;t just for you ladies out there... share it with your man. Too early to tell how good it works as I only started using it and I&#x27;m sure it takes some time, but as of now I&#x27;ll keep using it to see how it works. For full disclosure I did receive a promotional price on this product for a review.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing serum. I am going through menopause and suffering from severe cystic acne. The acne meds can cause dryness and irritation to the skin. The serum helps with the dryness, redness, and scarring caused by the acne. In addition, I have noticed a lightening of the age/sun spots. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my third bottle of hyaluronic acid. It is a valued step in both my morning and evening rituals. I&#x27;ve started treating the back of my hands, and the inside of my elbows. Just wish I had this product when i w&lt;br /&gt;as a teenager in California!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Voilave Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks now, and my skin looks and feels great. It is gentle, and reduces the wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. It is working great and keeping the moisture in my skin, so it appears younger. I love the ingredients in this topnotch serum. Gentle, and it works. High quality bottle, packaging and serum. I received this bottle to review, the opinions within are my own...</li>
            <li> Out of all the hyaluronic acid serums I have tried, this is BY FAR the best on the market! Other hya acid serums don&#x27;t even compare. I don&#x27;t know all the technical reasons how or why the low and high molecules make this serum work so well, but let me tell you, IT DOES! It truly is ground breaking in the sense it works so much better than anything else I have used. When you apply it to your skin you can immediately feel it working and plumping the skin. You can also see the difference because the fine lines truly begin to disappear. At least they did for me. It also helped my skin texture immensely. This serum is truly a miracle and all I can say for me it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well but per instructions, apply moisturizer after it dries.  No way for completely accurate assessment, but lines, especially around my mouth, seem to be much less deep.I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I do love this product.  It seems to run out fast and I wish it came in the 4oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this with the VoilaVe Organic Rosehip Oil and Triple Action Vitamin C Serum and I like the smoothness, softness and clearer complexion I&#x27;ve experienced since ordering it about a month ago.</li>
            <li> The serum worked very well. Using few drops on face daily after a bath. No allergic reactions encountered. Feels awesome! A sample was provided for a review.</li>
            <li> Very drying. No change in skin.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this product.  I can see less fine lines and tighter skin.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this Hyaluronic oil.  Works great.  I use it all over my face as a serum, even on my lips.  Noticed a difference on the creases from my nose to mouth immediately.  Absorbs quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, and so is the price. I highly recommend it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
