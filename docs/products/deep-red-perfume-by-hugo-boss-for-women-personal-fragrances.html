            <li>favorite perfume right now!</li>
            <li>Its a beautiful deep citrus cedar vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I still buy it and get complimented all of the time for it&#x27;s fabulous spicy and sweet smell!</li>
            <li>Would like this product to be available always.</li>
            <li>I have never regretted buying from your site, and I hope the services would only get better.&lt;br /&gt;You are all doing a great job...</li>
            <li>I love this brand of perfume and for $39.99 this was well worth it for the size.</li>
            <li>so I figured it would be a good Christmas present :)</li>
            <li>very nice present.</li>
            <li>i love it very much</li>
            <li>I love Deep Red, it is just perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>totalmente original y muy bien especificado en los detalles del producto</li>
            <li>Hey what ever works right!  </li>
            <li>good but does not sprays properly thankyou</li>
            <li>Hugo Intense is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>For sure not the real stuff, buyer beware because there is a lot of this going on.</li>
            <li>Obviously, she loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume much and this is more of a fall/winter scent.  </li>
            <li>I knew the perfume, the brand also well regarded in the market, came everything right, sealed perfume</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right combination of spice and musk.  </li>
            <li>So, I ordered a larger size, it got here fast, smells amazing and was not a tester, had the cap and everything.</li>
            <li>The process was very fast.</li>
            <li>Hugo Boss, why did you stop making such a lovely perfume?</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;re married they want to get it for their wives.</li>
            <li>I first got this perfume when it came out in 2001.</li>
            <li>it is my 2nd one, each one lasted more than one year.&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>She needed more since she was running low</li>
            <li>The perfume shipped FAST!  </li>
            <li>It is most definitely the scent I choose for evening wear...</li>
            <li>am waiting soon buy another ;)</li>
            <li>While I still love the sweetness of Prada, nothing beats the sexy, sultry spice of my Deep Red.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased Deep Red many times on Amazon and it has always been fine.  </li>
            <li>Been my favorite scent for a long time, and always will be.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the last bottle I purchased but still smells wonderfull</li>
            <li>Slightly sweet, very sensual, and not heavy or cloying like so many other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>My daughter in law will really be suprised when she gets this</li>
            <li>It stays on really well.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>But really turns my man on.  </li>
            <li>Even a gentle spritz before I crawl into bed</li>
            <li>This is such a sweet scent and has a cherry blossom aroma to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve occasionally tried to try out something new, but this is the only perfume that I&#x27;ve had people constantly compliment that I smell good.</li>
            <li>I love Hugo Deep Red!</li>
            <li>I love Hugo Boss&#x27; Deep Red!!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the woman who loves feeling sensual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My guess is that this particular seller is not shipping the genuine Hugo Boss Deep Red.  </li>
            <li>And of course I do love the scent myself and this is a decent price to what I usually get.  </li>
            <li>the other perfumes I wear and enjoy besides this one are Coach Poppy Blossom and Marc Jacobs Daisy.</li>
            <li>I had previously but not quite as strong...</li>
            <li>Away from the original fragrances without sacrificing quality and sobriety, not for everyday use, I would say that only for special events.</li>
            <li>I recommended for surprised your mother or wife or girlfriend!</li>
            <li>I ordered the Hugo Boss Deep Red perfume as a birthday present for my mom, as it is her favorite perfume</li>
            <li>The perfume I received was fine- sealed in the original box, not a tester (I know a few other reviewers has complaints about these things.)</li>
            <li>It was professionally packaged.  </li>
            <li>I have used Hugo Deep Red for many years and would not consider using another other perfume.  </li>
            <li>rich, complex scent has green, sensuous elements combined with notes of sandalwood, ginger flower, blood orange, woods and spices into a mature combination that gives it a spicy, oriental and very feminine character.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those who love such a scent because I know you would get addicted to it as I am.  </li>
            <li>Important - it lasts a long time, so a little spray goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this brand of perfume and for $39.99 this was well worth it for the size.</li>
            <li> so I figured it would be a good Christmas present :)</li>

            <li> totalmente original y muy bien especificado en los detalles del producto</li>
            <li> Hey what ever works right!  </li>
            <li> good but does not sprays properly thankyou</li>
            <li> Hugo Intense is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> For sure not the real stuff, buyer beware because there is a lot of this going on.</li>
            <li> Obviously, she loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume much and this is more of a fall/winter scent.  </li>
            <li> I knew the perfume, the brand also well regarded in the market, came everything right, sealed perfume</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right combination of spice and musk.  </li>
            <li> So, I ordered a larger size, it got here fast, smells amazing and was not a tester, had the cap and everything.</li>
            <li> The process was very fast.</li>
            <li> Hugo Boss, why did you stop making such a lovely perfume?</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re married they want to get it for their wives.</li>
            <li> I first got this perfume when it came out in 2001.</li>
            <li> it is my 2nd one, each one lasted more than one year.&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> She needed more since she was running low</li>
            <li> The perfume shipped FAST!  </li>
            <li> It is most definitely the scent I choose for evening wear...</li>
            <li> am waiting soon buy another ;)</li>
            <li> While I still love the sweetness of Prada, nothing beats the sexy, sultry spice of my Deep Red.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Deep Red many times on Amazon and it has always been fine.  </li>
            <li> Been my favorite scent for a long time, and always will be.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the last bottle I purchased but still smells wonderfull</li>
            <li> Slightly sweet, very sensual, and not heavy or cloying like so many other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law will really be suprised when she gets this</li>
            <li> It stays on really well.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> But really turns my man on.  </li>
            <li> Even a gentle spritz before I crawl into bed</li>
            <li> This is such a sweet scent and has a cherry blossom aroma to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve occasionally tried to try out something new, but this is the only perfume that I&#x27;ve had people constantly compliment that I smell good.</li>
            <li> I love Hugo Deep Red!</li>
            <li> I love Hugo Boss&#x27; Deep Red!!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the woman who loves feeling sensual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My guess is that this particular seller is not shipping the genuine Hugo Boss Deep Red.  </li>
            <li> And of course I do love the scent myself and this is a decent price to what I usually get.  </li>
            <li> the other perfumes I wear and enjoy besides this one are Coach Poppy Blossom and Marc Jacobs Daisy.</li>
            <li> I had previously but not quite as strong...</li>
            <li> Away from the original fragrances without sacrificing quality and sobriety, not for everyday use, I would say that only for special events.</li>
            <li> I recommended for surprised your mother or wife or girlfriend!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Hugo Boss Deep Red perfume as a birthday present for my mom, as it is her favorite perfume</li>
            <li> The perfume I received was fine- sealed in the original box, not a tester (I know a few other reviewers has complaints about these things.)</li>
            <li> It was professionally packaged.  </li>
            <li> I have used Hugo Deep Red for many years and would not consider using another other perfume.  </li>
            <li> rich, complex scent has green, sensuous elements combined with notes of sandalwood, ginger flower, blood orange, woods and spices into a mature combination that gives it a spicy, oriental and very feminine character.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those who love such a scent because I know you would get addicted to it as I am.  </li>
            <li> Important - it lasts a long time, so a little spray goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will buy it as long as he keeps on getting turned on</li>
            <li> have been wearing this scent for a long time and have been complimented on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll hopefully will order it for as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Little black dress&amp;#34; is an expression used to define an evening or cocktail dress, cut simply and often quite short.</li>
            <li> It has a clean expensive smell.</li>
            <li> Finally found it at amazon and at half price.    </li>
            <li> Introduced in 2001, Hugo Deep Red by Hugo Boss has been called &amp;#34;The Little Black Dress&amp;#34; of fragrances.</li>
            <li> She did not like it like her other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Not good wiil call because the sprayer does not work properly  fragrance y</li>
            <li> This is not original.</li>
            <li> I order this product less than a week ago and it already arrived, not to mention it was packaged so well that even if it was dropped countless times it wouldn&#x27;t have broken the glass.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong cologne.</li>
            <li> A fake or old and gone bad, either way, it&#x27;s garbage as it has that &#x27;old lady perfume&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li> It is usually seductive.</li>
            <li> This is the dress that usually hugs curves you never knew you had.</li>
            <li> Out to dinner, or in bed with lace, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this womanly scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this perfume was ever discontinued!</li>
            <li> approximately $2.00 cheaper shipped than I could find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Too bad this is a hard to get parfum.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been discontinued and that makes me a sad panda.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for the cold weather to come along</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t that illegal?!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The shippimment was terrible!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is really very good , I recommend it</li>
            <li> I recently bought 2 different deep red bottles from amazon. One was for me and one was a gift to my mother. Mine was authentic and my mother received an imposter. Hers almost smelled like a man&#x27;s cologne. Amazon, please help to weed out the imposters!  Hugo Boss, why did you stop making such a lovely perfume?</li>
            <li> OMG! This is my favorite perfume. I&#x27;ve been buying/wearing this for 12 years. I use to buy this in my Penny&#x27;s but it&#x27;s been discontinued and that makes me a sad panda. I was really happy to find it on Amazon. So, I ordered a larger size, it got here fast, smells amazing and was not a tester, had the cap and everything. I would say most women on earth should smell like this. It&#x27;s awesome! Get it for your gf or wife, I bet she loves it!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite scent for fall and winter.</li>
            <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t know what is in this perfume, but every time I wear it I notice the men around me want to talk and they notice the smell. They&#x27;ve all said &#x27;what is that you&#x27;re wearing?&#x27; If they&#x27;re married they want to get it for their wives. If not, the question comes out more as a flirtation. I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PARFUM AND GLAD I FOUND IT ON AMAZON BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER BEING SOLD IN STORES.I AM SO HAPPY,BECAUSE ITS A FAVORITE OF MINE AND WHEN I WAS TOLD BY THE SALES LADY AT MACY&#x27;S THAT IT HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED I WAS UPSET. THEN I DECIDED TO CHECK ONLINE AND SINCE I MAKE A LOT OF PURCHASES WITH AMAZON I DID NOT HESITATE TO BUY IT FROM THEM AT A GREAT PRICE TOO...I AM VERY HAPPY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good item for  Very good price.</li>
            <li> I received Deep Red as a gift from a friend in Germany for my nineteenth birthday several years ago. It&#x27;s been my favourite scent ever since!</li>
            <li> Was looking for this perfume forever. Finally found it at amazon and at half price.    Good perfume will recommend it to any one looking for it.</li>
            <li> Love its scent, had a sample but wanted more. Can&#x27;t think of anything else. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not good wiil call because the sprayer does not work properly  fragrance y good but does not sprays properly thankyou</li>
            <li> This parfum is ... yummy ! c&#x27;mon is so sexy and feminine ! buy it ! you won&#x27;t regret</li>
            <li> I love Deep Red, it is just perfect for me.  It is delicious and intoxicating scent without being too feminine or floral.  Every time I&#x27;d visit a Hugo Boss outlet, I&#x27;d spray some on a test card and end up carrying it around in my coat pocket for weeks.  After the third time I did it, I knew it was time to buy.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my girlfriend brother and she loves the perfume. Thanks</li>
            <li> I first got this perfume when it came out in 2001. It was my HS signature fragrance until Del Pozos Halloween took over.  I am 24 now and I still had to go back to it. Its a beautiful deep citrus cedar vanilla scent. Its sultry and sexy. I can&#x27;t wait for the cold weather to come along and I could wear it more. Pretty good price as well. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this EDP for my wife. She did not like it like her other perfumes. When I smelled it, I agreed with her.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for this perfume and amazingly found it here on Amazon.  This is such a sweet scent and has a cherry blossom aroma to it.  I would recommend it to those who love such a scent because I know you would get addicted to it as I am.  So happy to find it again. Of course I will buy it again here.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Deep Red many times on Amazon and it has always been fine.  However, this time the bottle that was sent to me which I purchased for my wifes Mother&#x27;s Day present was much different. Whatever was in this bottle was not Deep Red.  My guess is that this particular seller is not shipping the genuine Hugo Boss Deep Red.  There seems to be no return on this item.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I think this was the third perfume I had ever tried, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it since I was 14.  I&#x27;ve occasionally tried to try out something new, but this is the only perfume that I&#x27;ve had people constantly compliment that I smell good.</li>
            <li> it is my signature perfume. it is my 2nd one, each one lasted more than one year.&lt;br /&gt;now it is time to order 3rd one.</li>
            <li> My mother LOVES this scent and can&#x27;t get enough of it.  She needed more since she was running low so I figured it would be a good Christmas present :)</li>
            <li> My friend asked me to buy it online for her, it arrived well and she is still loving the smell. But not my style, a bit to strong like al of Hugo Boss perfume.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> Hugo Intense is my favorite.  I have used it for 7 years.  I thought I would try Hugo Deep Red and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife love it, I buy it for her in mother&#x27;s day!... very nice present. I recommended for surprised your mother or wife or girlfriend!</li>
            <li> I have used Hugo Deep Red for many years and would not consider using another other perfume.  I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Always my go to fragrance......smells great. Would like this product to be available always. The price is really nice. Always</li>
            <li> I always get my mom this for Xmas every year in her stocking. She loves it! Great Gift, Smells Great!</li>
            <li> My daughter in law will really be suprised when she gets this, Think she&#x27;s going to just love it. Nice</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She&#x27;s worn this scent for many years and still loves it. It was also a great price.</li>
            <li> I love Hugo Deep Red! It has that perfect blend of sexy with just a splash of sweetness. It&#x27;s my perfume of choice and I found it on here approximately $2.00 cheaper shipped than I could find it anywhere else. This is my perfume of choice and I&#x27;ll order it again and again at the cheapest possible place of course.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. Slightly sweet, very sensual, and not heavy or cloying like so many other perfumes. It stays on really well. I have sprayed it when wearing scarves or coats and I can still smell the perfume on the clothes days later when I go to put them on again. When I go on vacation I spritz some on my clothes as a I pack and can smell it all the way through vacation. The perfume I received was fine- sealed in the original box, not a tester (I know a few other reviewers has complaints about these things.) I get so many complements when I wear this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note...the other perfumes I wear and enjoy besides this one are Coach Poppy Blossom and Marc Jacobs Daisy. So if you have similar tastes, then chances are you will like Hugo Deep Red.</li>
            <li> For sure not the real stuff, buyer beware because there is a lot of this going on. It is going on all over with on line distributers.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I was happy to find it on line.</li>
            <li> very good product I received in very good condition cumpe with everything said, I recommend agan your buy without thinking twice excellent 5 stars</li>

            <li> Best parfume ever. I bought it for my wife. Scent gets better as the time goes by. I wish i&#x27;d had purchased another or a big one.</li>
            <li> Ths was a Christmas gift for a dear friend in Oklahoma.  I was unsure if this was the correct perfume she liked.  However, she was ecstatic when she received the package.  It arrived in good condition. And, was the correct scent.</li>
            <li> Perfect arom, arrived fine to Ecuador.&lt;br /&gt;The price is ok for the great size and I feel good whith him</li>
            <li> The shippimment was terrible!!!</li>
            <li> Work out beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> I knew the perfume, the brand also well regarded in the market, came everything right, sealed perfume, now I hope that fixing is good in my skin. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend.It&#x27;s not a strong cologne.The only draw back is it doesn&#x27;t last that long,but I&lt;br /&gt;still love it.</li>
            <li> I will be honest, it did come in a legit box but it was not wrapped in the plastic which threw me off. It did smell like the Hugo Boss I had previously but not quite as strong... My question is why wasn&#x27;t it sealed in the plastic?</li>
            <li> Perfect... Love it...nice size bottle and very good price!!! Best Christmas gift ever for my mother in law!!! Good thing!</li>
            <li> very good, the article is the same as the description and arrived in very good condition, thank you very much!</li>
            <li> just what was ordered and wanted</li>
            <li> Not sure why this perfume was ever discontinued! I still buy it and get complimented all of the time for it&#x27;s fabulous spicy and sweet smell!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my sister in love and she loves it. The price was very low in com parisson with Colombian Stores</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s \\&quot;signature\\&quot; perfume. When I was deployed in Afghanistan in 2002, a sample of this perfume was in the Holiday Edition of Stars and Stripes. I loved the way this smelled, and got as many of the samples as I could find. I ordered this perfume for my wife as a Christmas present, and kept the samples by the head of my bunk to smell at night before going to sleep. I knew that I would smell this on her when I went home, and it gave me something to look forward to every night. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume, and I continue to buy it for her.</li>
            <li> Perfume had no lid and adapted a cardboard cover, it shows that it was a perfume that was used to show the public, as it was not sealed and it is indicated TEST</li>
            <li> The perfume shipped FAST!  It was professionally packaged.  I was VERY happy.  My wife thinks I am a stud now.  I saved $$$ and still received a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, cumple totalmente con el requerimiento, escelente entrega, buen negocio, muy agradecido.  Llego en buen estado y perfectas condiciones</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend (she kind of dropped a hint..) Obviously, she loved it. Packaging was good, shipped pretty fast, overall I&#x27;m very happy :)</li>
            <li> Excellent choice , is a great perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume coming at time, was a gift to my sister and was a better option.&lt;br /&gt;She love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Deep Red for 15 years + and I can say without a doubt that this is NOT Deep Red! It&#x27;s not even a knock off perfume? NOT EVEN CLOSE. Couldn&#x27;t believe that Amazon would do this.......isn&#x27;t that illegal?!!</li>
            <li> I have never regretted buying from your site, and I hope the services would only get better.&lt;br /&gt;You are all doing a great job...Kudos to customer care :)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrance&#x27;s and I am always satisfied. I have told all of my friends and their husbands that this is one that needs to be on the must have list.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto recomendado.. lo recomiendo! funciona excelente y llego a tiempo, excelente envoltura y tal cual lo describio el vendedor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good fragance. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> favorite perfume right now!</li>
            <li> This was a gif t for my Fiance for Christmas. Being her favorite perfume, she knows what it should smell like and this was not even close. She even had a bottle with a quarter left to compare the scents. A fake or old and gone bad, either way, it&#x27;s garbage as it has that &#x27;old lady perfume&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li> product complies with the specifications&lt;br /&gt;no to claims&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend to all</li>

            <li> I ordered the Hugo Boss Deep Red perfume as a birthday present for my mom, as it is her favorite perfume and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores (I was told before that it was discontinued). Ordered it on Amazon.com and it arrived on time and when I gave it to my mom, she was ecstatic to finally have a bottle after 5 years.</li>
            <li> Love this Parfume - I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  It&#x27;s my fall Parfume....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K Manz</li>
            <li> My husband loves this perfume!  I used to be able to get it at Khols but no longer carry it.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume much and this is more of a fall/winter scent.  But really turns my man on.  Hey what ever works right!  Will buy it as long as he keeps on getting turned on lol.  And of course I do love the scent myself and this is a decent price to what I usually get.  J&#x27;adore.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the last bottle I purchased but still smells wonderfull</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on it hours after I put it on and think  no one can smell it. It has a clean expensive smell. I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Introduced in 2001, Hugo Deep Red by Hugo Boss has been called &amp;#34;The Little Black Dress&amp;#34; of fragrances. &amp;#34;Little black dress&amp;#34; is an expression used to define an evening or cocktail dress, cut simply and often quite short. It is usually seductive. Many women have one in the recesses of their closet. This is the dress that usually hugs curves you never knew you had. One that looks as if it was made for your body and your body only. One that makes you feel sexy the second you put it on. Yep!!! That&#x27;s what I feel like when I wear Hugo Deep Red. It is most definitely the scent I choose for evening wear...especially special evenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rich, complex scent has green, sensuous elements combined with notes of sandalwood, ginger flower, blood orange, woods and spices into a mature combination that gives it a spicy, oriental and very feminine character. Important - it lasts a long time, so a little spray goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing this scent for a long time and have been complimented on it. Highly recommended for the woman who loves feeling sensual.&lt;br /&gt;JANA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume 2 to 3 times a year . I like the price for the size of the bottle .</li>

            <li> my favorite perfume for years. I can&#x27;t quite describe the scent, but I like to think of it as having a sexy smell. Not fruity or floral, just sexy.</li>

            <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife . Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love Hugo Boss&#x27; Deep Red!!!!</li>
            <li> my boyfriend gets turned on when i wear this perfume. ive been a fan of this scent for last 10 years probably.. lol i get so many compliments! love the spice+sweet combination. even though its more of the evening scent i do wear it during the day sometimes when i feel like adding something extra to my outfit.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying how impressed I am with the speed on receiving this product. I order this product less than a week ago and it already arrived, not to mention it was packaged so well that even if it was dropped countless times it wouldn&#x27;t have broken the glass. I love this brand of perfume and for $39.99 this was well worth it for the size. You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I loved it good price and great purchase</li>
            <li> This fragrance is incredible.  It&#x27;s the right combination of spice and musk.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this fragrance.  I&#x27;ll hopefully will order it for as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> Away from the original fragrances without sacrificing quality and sobriety, not for everyday use, I would say that only for special events.</li>
            <li> is perfect, good smell, soft and sweet, recomended. i love it very much it is a very good product i love it very much it is a very good product</li>
            <li> Great! The process was very fast.</li>
            <li> Been my favorite scent for a long time, and always will be.  While I still love the sweetness of Prada, nothing beats the sexy, sultry spice of my Deep Red.  Even a gentle spritz before I crawl into bed has me feeling ultra sexy. Out to dinner, or in bed with lace, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this womanly scent.</li>
