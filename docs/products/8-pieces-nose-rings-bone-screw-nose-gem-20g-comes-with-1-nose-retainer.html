            <li> I received two red same shade, two blue same shade, two green same shade, and two pink again of the same shade.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t nearly as concerned if one turned up missing after sleeping in it overnight or bathing.</li>

            <li> A little disappointed with this because the main reason of my order was that this set supposedly came with a retainer along with the other studs (L shaped retainers are surprisingly hard to find).</li>
            <li> They are at least an 18..</li>
            <li> The pieces are very small and hard to notice.</li>

            <li> DO not buy.. read all reviews.... hat only 7 out of 8 5 of then were blue and 3 stones were loses and no retainer..</li>
            <li> i bought these and they are not a 20 gauge. They are at least an 18.. I know it isn&#x27;t the right size a regular earing is a 20, I regular earing fits in my nose fine I can&#x27;t even get this in a little bit. don&#x27;t buy this unless you are planning to gauge your nose higher! I am very angry! And if I could I would return this item!!! I paid $13 for somthing I cannot use! Don&#x27;t buy this unless you wanna get screwed over.</li>
            <li> did not come with a retainer and only had 3 different colors, not a very good variety.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes the nose rings and we received them very quickly. This would have been a 5 star rating but we did not receive  the retainer nose ring which she needs for playing sports. We ordered these mainly for the retainer.</li>
            <li> When I opened them there were already 3 missing their little gems. What a waste of money. If I could give it half a star I would.</li>
            <li> there was no nose retainer included here. The pieces are very small and hard to notice.</li>
            <li> Did not sent clear nose ring, and they are difficult to put in.</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal! The rings were exceptionally good quality and for the price I wasn&#x27;t nearly as concerned if one turned up missing after sleeping in it overnight or bathing. ;)</li>
            <li> I received a nice variety of stones and the retainer. I&#x27;m very pleased and would order again.</li>
            <li> Mine had 2 red, 2 pink,2 green and 2 blue. Not much selection. Semi-crooked stone settings. And also, there was no retainer, even though it&#x27;s clearly stated that it&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. I received two red same shade, two blue same shade, two green same shade, and two pink again of the same shade. Also NO Retainer if your not gonna include a retainer don&#x27;t include it in your description.</li>
            <li> Two were missing gems, and there was no retainer.</li>
            <li> Great for price. Gems fell out of a few.</li>
            <li> I only ordered it because I needed a nose retainer fast. The clear nose retainer it comes with wasn&#x27;t in the package. The rest of the pieces were there. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> I recieve the 8 nose ring bones which is great but NO RETAINER .. Idk whats going on.</li>
