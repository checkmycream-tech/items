            <li>This is an excellent relaxant with pharmacological benefits.</li>
            <li>, this is the one that is the perfect mix of cost vs performance.  </li>
            <li>PLUS it smells incredible!</li>
            <li>My colored hair feels brilliant after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>hair just looked so amazingly beautiful.</li>
            <li>The color is still looking great.</li>
            <li>shampoo does bring out the color of hair very nicely, but it&#x27;s not a nourishing shampoo, but it does do what it says-for the price</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how good the color still looks.</li>
            <li>and you need to use some effort to work it into a good</li>
            <li>It does a great job of washing my hair and it looks nice using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So use a dedicated towel for your hair to avoid messing up your good towels.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shampoo with a really good conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems like a good shampoo to keep hair color looking bright and keep it looking good longer.  </li>
            <li>I have upgraded my star rating to 5 as I have been more and more impressed with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>has its own characteristics but for the money this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it does a good job moisturizing and leaving the hair feeling silky and with a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>, this is a nice shampoo, but I have to use a really good conditioner</li>
            <li>and I could tell the color was looking washed out, and now it looks nothing but shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li>so all I have is MY silky, shiny, more volumous hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely an amazing line for colour treated hair.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>I do like the scent, kind of a new-mowed grassy smell.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay because it is good shampoo, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for the color protection.</li>
            <li>For the last three weeks I used the Brilliant Brunette Colour Protecting Moisturizing Shampoo with the hope of maintaining brilliant color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>This line probably has a nice conditioner that it pairs with</li>
            <li>Their shampoos clean gently and produce great excellent results.</li>
            <li>those new to colour-enhancing shampoos, don&#x27;t use your best towels.</li>
            <li>The shampoo produces a nice sheen, but, again, nothing special beyond the results of any good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am using this shampoo and conditioner of its kind to keep the color more in place</li>
            <li>John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Colour Protecting Moisturizing Shampoo is a good solid shampoo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a ton of lather, and the scent is very light and non-offensive.</li>
            <li>My daughters love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure everyone&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels as it did before I used any products, or maybe even better.</li>
            <li>We brunettes deserve love too, and John Frieda gives it to us with this brilliant brunette, refreshing and rejuvenating color protector that makes my hair shine and feel so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>like this color wash system better than the dye.  </li>
            <li>The Color refreshing gloss reflects my hair color and this keeps the tone correct while the gloss makes my hair look shiny and manageable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and must say that I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>it is more muted.  </li>
            <li>I trust the name brand as it has been around for some time and John Frieda is a quality I have come to love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, after using this for a while, my hair seems a lot more coarser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rene Furterer, Keratase, Wella and Aveda,  This one also lathers up the most if you like lots of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of John Frieda hair products, but I truly do love the way this brunette line makes my hair look and smell.</li>
            <li>(Just avoid the John Frieda Color Refreshing Gloss ...</li>
            <li>The John Frieda Color enhancing shampoos are pretty good.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and not at all perfume-y or fruity like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells nice and you just need a bit to get a great lather if you have short hair like I do.  </li>
            <li>I need to use a lot more product after my shower now to keep my hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to use it while using these though, they  give great moisturizing benefits so that the dryness, split ends, and damage are rehydrated to give soft, silky locks that stay that way</li>
            <li>This is a good, gentle shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a very mild scent and cleans well without leaving hair feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it does clean my hair and scalp well without stripping too many oils from it.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, it rinses easily.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say that it makes my hair any more brilliant (but I didn&#x27;t expected it to), I can say that it makes my hair feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a caramel color and doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical scent which I like.  </li>
            <li>because it does a great job cleansing and moisturizing, but nothing apparently is going to save my fading brunette hair.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>This seems to work fine and doesn&#x27;t strip hair color from the hair.  </li>
            <li>They clean hair very well and lather up nicely and leave hair nice and clean with a clean scent, but they seem to be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>The cleaning feels gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li>This is great for me, because I have a ton of hair that can get ridiculously big.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking at the ingredients, this seems to be free of parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>and I do use a good conditioner after my shampoo so that most likely helps a lot just on</li>
            <li>This produced the best results but because other shampoos give good results even with only a rinse-out conditioner I would not buy this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works fine, but I can&#x27;t say I notice anything special about it.</li>
            <li>The first thing we noticed was the very light scent of coconut.</li>
            <li>I would prefer no scent or something more natural suitable for use by men and women.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild - good for those folks who are extremely sensitive to scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Preserves colour keeping it rich &amp; vibrant&lt;br /&gt;For colour-treated brunettes&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing</li>
            <li>It also cleans great and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or leave it greasy as some shampoos do.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>I do not see anything special about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is rich and sudsy with a mild scent, which I couldn&#x27;t identify.</li>
            <li>The price is really good compared to similar products as well.</li>
            <li>Overall I really loved this and plan to continue to use it from here on out.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser even commented on how good my color was looking last time I was in for a cut.</li>
            <li>This is good as a regular shampoo, but I see no noticeable color protection.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>A good wash with this shampoo definitely keeps the itchy scalp at bay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is great, and I love the shine plus it extends my time between colorings because I don&#x27;t get the dull rat look dyed hair can get when the color starts to fade.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly, alternating with the blonde color correcting to get the brass out, and my hair looks better than it has i a while.</li>
            <li>For me, this has been working out great as I have natural highlights from being outdoors, and it keeps my hair looking natural and NOT grey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a fragrance to this that is not particularly unpleasant</li>
            <li>It seems gentle and very mild.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which I really appreciate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good shampoo, although I really don;t see much difference between the results I got from this and normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I almost could not believe how much I liked the fragrance because it&#x27;s natural, subtle, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>My light brown hair is much richer and feels like heaven.  </li>
            <li>I have only used Brilliant Brunette Shampoo during this time and I have to say I never expected my color to stay looking this nice for so long.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it, but even more, I appreciate that this is a low sudsing shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I would use that with this product or a really nice moisturizing conditioner or deep conditioner if needed.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love the smell (reminiscent of coconuts?), but I love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is supposed to help keep the color but more importantly keep my hair from getting too frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li>and I liked the Blonde Highlight John Frieda shampoo more than they liked the brunette version and had the same dry effect from the product as I did.</li>
            <li>Such luxury for such a great price.</li>
            <li>When paired with the conditioner, my hair is left soft, bouncy, silky, and just gorgeous.    </li>
            <li>And while my hair looks good and has not faded out, the shampoo did not prevent the color from lightening up a little.</li>
            <li>I first used this shampoo alone, without conditioner or leave-in products.</li>
            <li>I double rinsed to be sure none remained, but the itching continued.</li>
            <li>I use Kerastase products after to make hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has any magical powers; it&#x27;s just the opposite of volumizing or clarify shampoos, which tend to be harsher and strip a lot of oil (and color) from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably since I had my first child was born.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say that it is doing a lot more than my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is exactly how I remembered it to be.  </li>
            <li>I could tell even from the first use that it made an impact on the shine and fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After enjoying some highlights all summer long, I decided to go back to a more natural light brown hair color.  </li>
            <li>I have been using John Frieda’s color refreshing gloss in warm brunette (and sometimes cool) to freshen the color of my hair without having to do expensive and time-consuming hair coloring at the salon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy with the way my hair looks - soft, silky and shiny- but not the way my head feels.</li>
            <li>It just overall looked better, more vibrant and luxurious even after only one washing.</li>
            <li>When my hair dries, it looks glossy and feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>wise this is reasonable comparded to a few I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It simply seems to be a good, basic shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair did have slightly more body but was unacceptably dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is very shiny and sleek after shampooing.</li>
            <li>So really, any color hair could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to swim every morning before work and the chlorine in the pool was really hurting my hair and scalp..</li>
            <li>I really like this Brunette Colour shampoo from John Frieda.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it really irks me.    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy, but it cleaned my hair without seeming to strip it or do any damage.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair shiny, and rich looking.</li>
            <li>This shampoo left me with clean hair</li>
            <li>There was nothing really special enough about this shampoo for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li>It fades just as fast as it normally does.</li>
            <li>I keep it dark, because I love how it compliments my skin</li>
            <li>Perhaps the answer to the mystery is in the \\&quot;Caramel\\&quot; ingredient listed relatively high up on the list.</li>
            <li>* Contains crushed pearl, I believe in a highly fine powder.</li>
            <li>My hair looked shiny and quite pretty, but it didn&#x27;t look terribly different from most other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, sort of like those old all-in-one shampoo and conditioner products (do they still make those?).</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting that, because their normal conditioners work well for me.</li>
            <li>At least the fragrance is light, and after shampooing it dissipates quite quickly.</li>
            <li>day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is so thick, rich, and doesn&#x27;t take very much to shampoo all my hair!</li>
            <li>colour after using it for 11 shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;There is no noticeable fragrance even though the bottle says \\&quot;with crushed pearls and sweet almond oil\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am a natural brunette with some graying hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I switched from regular shampoo to colour-protecting shampoo, I really did see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter had just highlighted her naturally chestnut locks when I received this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dye my hair, but I like to use shampoos designed for dyed hair simply because they seem to focus on making sure your hair doesn&#x27;t get dried out.</li>
            <li>In fact, this brown crown is starting to go lighter and I am ready to go back to blonde (as in right now).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair which tends to fade to dark blonde in the summer.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a smell from my childhood - like an older relative&#x27;s liquid face foundation.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a nice shampoo albeit a little more expensive than my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my hair and did no damage, but neither did it do anything different than a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>just rejoined our local YMCA and am back to swimming but not as much as before.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit thick and not so easy to bubble up.</li>
            <li>Recently I tried a comparable formula for colored blonde hair because I normally highlight my natural shade.</li>
            <li>With crushed pearls and sweet almond oil, moisturising formula protects and preserves brunette colour as it rehydrates and replenishes dry, colour-treated brunette</li>
            <li>hair is very soft after using this, and somewhat flat.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair color is a medium ash blonde.</li>
            <li>shampoo left her hair soft and moisturized, as promised.</li>
            <li>I did not expect anything from the product other than preventing the color from fading so fast.</li>
            <li>but this particular shampoo is toning them down a bit which I am ever so grateful for.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo has a very mild scent and cleans well without leaving hair feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it does clean my hair and scalp well without stripping too many oils from it.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it rinses easily.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say that it makes my hair any more brilliant (but I didn&#x27;t expected it to), I can say that it makes my hair feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a caramel color and doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical scent which I like.  </li>
            <li> because it does a great job cleansing and moisturizing, but nothing apparently is going to save my fading brunette hair.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> This seems to work fine and doesn&#x27;t strip hair color from the hair.  </li>
            <li> They clean hair very well and lather up nicely and leave hair nice and clean with a clean scent, but they seem to be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> The cleaning feels gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li> This is great for me, because I have a ton of hair that can get ridiculously big.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking at the ingredients, this seems to be free of parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> and I do use a good conditioner after my shampoo so that most likely helps a lot just on</li>
            <li> This produced the best results but because other shampoos give good results even with only a rinse-out conditioner I would not buy this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works fine, but I can&#x27;t say I notice anything special about it.</li>
            <li> The first thing we noticed was the very light scent of coconut.</li>
            <li> I would prefer no scent or something more natural suitable for use by men and women.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild - good for those folks who are extremely sensitive to scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Preserves colour keeping it rich &amp; vibrant&lt;br /&gt;For colour-treated brunettes&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing</li>
            <li> It also cleans great and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or leave it greasy as some shampoos do.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> I do not see anything special about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is rich and sudsy with a mild scent, which I couldn&#x27;t identify.</li>
            <li> The price is really good compared to similar products as well.</li>
            <li> Overall I really loved this and plan to continue to use it from here on out.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser even commented on how good my color was looking last time I was in for a cut.</li>
            <li> This is good as a regular shampoo, but I see no noticeable color protection.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> A good wash with this shampoo definitely keeps the itchy scalp at bay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is great, and I love the shine plus it extends my time between colorings because I don&#x27;t get the dull rat look dyed hair can get when the color starts to fade.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly, alternating with the blonde color correcting to get the brass out, and my hair looks better than it has i a while.</li>
            <li> For me, this has been working out great as I have natural highlights from being outdoors, and it keeps my hair looking natural and NOT grey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a fragrance to this that is not particularly unpleasant</li>
            <li> It seems gentle and very mild.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which I really appreciate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good shampoo, although I really don;t see much difference between the results I got from this and normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I almost could not believe how much I liked the fragrance because it&#x27;s natural, subtle, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> My light brown hair is much richer and feels like heaven.  </li>
            <li> I have only used Brilliant Brunette Shampoo during this time and I have to say I never expected my color to stay looking this nice for so long.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it, but even more, I appreciate that this is a low sudsing shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I would use that with this product or a really nice moisturizing conditioner or deep conditioner if needed.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love the smell (reminiscent of coconuts?), but I love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is supposed to help keep the color but more importantly keep my hair from getting too frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> and I liked the Blonde Highlight John Frieda shampoo more than they liked the brunette version and had the same dry effect from the product as I did.</li>
            <li> Such luxury for such a great price.</li>
            <li> When paired with the conditioner, my hair is left soft, bouncy, silky, and just gorgeous.    </li>
            <li> And while my hair looks good and has not faded out, the shampoo did not prevent the color from lightening up a little.</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo alone, without conditioner or leave-in products.</li>
            <li> I double rinsed to be sure none remained, but the itching continued.</li>
            <li> I use Kerastase products after to make hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has any magical powers; it&#x27;s just the opposite of volumizing or clarify shampoos, which tend to be harsher and strip a lot of oil (and color) from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably since I had my first child was born.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say that it is doing a lot more than my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is exactly how I remembered it to be.  </li>
            <li> I could tell even from the first use that it made an impact on the shine and fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After enjoying some highlights all summer long, I decided to go back to a more natural light brown hair color.  </li>
            <li> I have been using John Frieda’s color refreshing gloss in warm brunette (and sometimes cool) to freshen the color of my hair without having to do expensive and time-consuming hair coloring at the salon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy with the way my hair looks - soft, silky and shiny- but not the way my head feels.</li>
            <li> It just overall looked better, more vibrant and luxurious even after only one washing.</li>
            <li> When my hair dries, it looks glossy and feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> wise this is reasonable comparded to a few I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It simply seems to be a good, basic shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair did have slightly more body but was unacceptably dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is very shiny and sleek after shampooing.</li>
            <li> So really, any color hair could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to swim every morning before work and the chlorine in the pool was really hurting my hair and scalp..</li>
            <li> I really like this Brunette Colour shampoo from John Frieda.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it really irks me.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy, but it cleaned my hair without seeming to strip it or do any damage.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair shiny, and rich looking.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left me with clean hair</li>
            <li> There was nothing really special enough about this shampoo for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> It fades just as fast as it normally does.</li>
            <li> I keep it dark, because I love how it compliments my skin</li>
            <li> Perhaps the answer to the mystery is in the \\&quot;Caramel\\&quot; ingredient listed relatively high up on the list.</li>
            <li> * Contains crushed pearl, I believe in a highly fine powder.</li>
            <li> My hair looked shiny and quite pretty, but it didn&#x27;t look terribly different from most other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, sort of like those old all-in-one shampoo and conditioner products (do they still make those?).</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting that, because their normal conditioners work well for me.</li>
            <li> At least the fragrance is light, and after shampooing it dissipates quite quickly.</li>
            <li> day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is so thick, rich, and doesn&#x27;t take very much to shampoo all my hair!</li>
            <li> colour after using it for 11 shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;There is no noticeable fragrance even though the bottle says \\&quot;with crushed pearls and sweet almond oil\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am a natural brunette with some graying hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I switched from regular shampoo to colour-protecting shampoo, I really did see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter had just highlighted her naturally chestnut locks when I received this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dye my hair, but I like to use shampoos designed for dyed hair simply because they seem to focus on making sure your hair doesn&#x27;t get dried out.</li>
            <li> In fact, this brown crown is starting to go lighter and I am ready to go back to blonde (as in right now).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair which tends to fade to dark blonde in the summer.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a smell from my childhood - like an older relative&#x27;s liquid face foundation.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice shampoo albeit a little more expensive than my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my hair and did no damage, but neither did it do anything different than a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> just rejoined our local YMCA and am back to swimming but not as much as before.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit thick and not so easy to bubble up.</li>
            <li> Recently I tried a comparable formula for colored blonde hair because I normally highlight my natural shade.</li>
            <li> With crushed pearls and sweet almond oil, moisturising formula protects and preserves brunette colour as it rehydrates and replenishes dry, colour-treated brunette</li>
            <li> hair is very soft after using this, and somewhat flat.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a medium ash blonde.</li>
            <li> shampoo left her hair soft and moisturized, as promised.</li>
            <li> I did not expect anything from the product other than preventing the color from fading so fast.</li>
            <li> but this particular shampoo is toning them down a bit which I am ever so grateful for.  </li>
            <li> naturally have brunette hair, but I dye it darker shades of brunette because in the summer my hair turns dark blonde.</li>
            <li> I also thought it would enhance my natural dark brown hair color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo 4 times in the past 3 days straight and it hasn&#x27;t stopped the fading or camouflaged it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is slightly bronze-colored, but the package clearly states that it does NOT deposit any color on the hair.</li>
            <li> This tends to leave hair dry, especially if you have damaged/dry ends, it doesn&#x27;t help them much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of these shampoos leave a slight coloured residue that coats your hair supposedly for various reasons such as UV protection, colour adjustment to prevent brassiness, and extra moisturization.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it really does.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use much on my long hair to achieve the desired results either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any additional conditioner, except on the ends of my long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Again my hair was too dry.</li>
            <li> My scalp was not as itchy and dry and my hair felt softer.  </li>
            <li> or it leaves my hair dry feeling.</li>
            <li> : I do this probably every three to five years, hate the change because it fades very quickly, and invariably go back to my natural color.</li>
            <li> My hair is not colored, it&#x27;s dark brown, about one-quarter gray, cut short and dry.</li>
            <li> Third time I skipped the conditioner and applied Frizzease serum to my thoroughly towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> that I can even comb my fingers through my hair while it&#x27;s wet instead of</li>
            <li> I must do this so infrequently that the reality never quite sinks</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin without much body, you are probably not going to like</li>
            <li> Next I used my regular thick rinse-out conditioner after shampooing.</li>
            <li> shampoo is harsh, and my hair definitely is definitely frizzier and felt drier after use even though I conditioned, but given the sulfate-and alcohol in the product, I suppose it is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure why this happened, but I noticed after using this that my shoulders/upper back started to break out in little red bumps.</li>
            <li> Tried it the next day and have shampooed my hair every other day for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> In fact I think it causes my hair to be dryer than my other shampoos.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any change in texture or shine versus other shampoos I use.</li>
            <li> Alternating with this shampoo keeps me from using the other too often and getting darker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no product residue leftover, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair-</li>
            <li> This is always a purely subjective issue, but to me it is reminiscent of a dusty slightly perfumey scent that has been floating around for at least a couple of decades.</li>
            <li> I use coloring once in a while, not often, and so don&#x27;t see terrible drying that other more frequent users might.</li>
            <li> These ingredients normally strip color from color-treated hair, so again, I am confused that my hair seemed a little darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just me makes hair dark ..</li>
            <li> Just a slight &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It seems to, slightly.  </li>
            <li> It tangled less and brushing it out was easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a little harsh for me and caused an itching feeling.</li>
            <li> so instead of the stark gray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few colour-protecting and colour-enhancing shampoos over the years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those odd, subjective things that&#x27;s hard to quantify.</li>
            <li> I usually always add a conditioner after shampooing but thought I would test to see how this worked without adding conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I usually like my products unscented.</li>
            <li> My daughters are brunette and have used color in the past</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a little unpleasant jolt of cold water the next time you open the cap.</li>
            <li> I did not understand how this shampoo keeps color treated hair from going dull but that&#x27;s the claim.</li>
            <li> The color protection qualities are subtle.</li>
            <li> scent of the shampoo is a subtle almond.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to explain this weird phenomena</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong as it&#x27;s not coloring my hair just toning it a bit</li>
            <li> This might be a plus if you hate smelling the scent of your shampoo all day, or a negative if you want your hair to smell like *something.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but sometimes it just looks bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo is really different. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Has a scent that includes almond oil and cocoa seed butter. I almost could not believe how much I liked the fragrance because it&#x27;s natural, subtle, and beautiful. My wife loves the scent. My daughters love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Contains crushed pearl, I believe in a highly fine powder. This is an excellent relaxant with pharmacological benefits. It does something desirable for hair as per our use and the way it made our hair feel. It could be this one ingredient that makes the shampoo so effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I wondered about the &amp;#34;brunette&amp;#34; attributes of this product and so went to their website. One just has to trust in John Frieda&#x27;s &amp;#34;breakthrough technology&amp;#34; to believe it helps maintain brunette color treatments for up to 10 weeks. I did not understand how this shampoo keeps color treated hair from going dull but that&#x27;s the claim.</li>
            <li> Such luxury for such a great price. This shampoo left my hair shiny, and rich looking. It just overall looked better, more vibrant and luxurious even after only one washing. I didn&#x27;t need to use much on my long hair to achieve the desired results either. The price is really good compared to similar products as well. The shampoo left no residue that was noticeable in my shower or on my skin. Overall I really loved this and plan to continue to use it from here on out.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Colour Protecting Moisturizing Shampoo is a good solid shampoo. I did not expect anything from the product other than preventing the color from fading so fast. I had just had my hair colored when the shampoo arrived. Tried it the next day and have shampooed my hair every other day for the past two weeks. The color is still looking great. I usually always add a conditioner after shampooing but thought I would test to see how this worked without adding conditioner. It works fine and now I alternate between applying conditioner and not.  My hair is very shiny and sleek after shampooing. It lathers up nicely. There is a fragrance to this that is not particularly unpleasant but I usually like my products unscented. I am sure everyone&#x27;s hair.  has its own characteristics but for the money this is a good product.  Updating this review. I have upgraded my star rating to 5 as I have been more and more impressed with this shampoo. It has been 8 weeks since I had my hair colored and I can&#x27;t believe how good the color still looks. I have only used Brilliant Brunette Shampoo during this time and I have to say I never expected my color to stay looking this nice for so long. My hairdresser even commented on how good my color was looking last time I was in for a cut.</li>
            <li> My hair is not colored, it&#x27;s dark brown, about one-quarter gray, cut short and dry. I do not see anything special about this shampoo. In fact I think it causes my hair to be dryer than my other shampoos. I first used this shampoo alone, without conditioner or leave-in products. My hair did have slightly more body but was unacceptably dry. Next I used my regular thick rinse-out conditioner after shampooing. Again my hair was too dry. Third time I skipped the conditioner and applied Frizzease serum to my thoroughly towel dried hair. This produced the best results but because other shampoos give good results even with only a rinse-out conditioner I would not buy this shampoo. I also thought it would enhance my natural dark brown hair color but frankly I have not noticed any changes in that department. I do like the scent, kind of a new-mowed grassy smell. Not perfumey, but earthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is supposed to keep brunet hair from fading. I have noticed no difference in my hair colour after using it for 11 shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;There is no noticeable fragrance even though the bottle says \\&quot;with crushed pearls and sweet almond oil\\&quot;. It is simply shampoo with the exception of its revolting colour as it comes out of the tube - a sort of beige taupe creamy substance. It cleaned my hair and did no damage, but neither did it do anything different than a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am a natural brunette with some graying hair.  I like that this shampoo helps my gray hair blend in.  It also cleans great and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or leave it greasy as some shampoos do.</li>
            <li> My colored hair feels brilliant after using this shampoo. It softens and detangles enough as I wash that I can even comb my fingers through my hair while it&#x27;s wet instead of it feeling like a rat&#x27;s nest. I never feel as if my hair is stripped. The cleaning feels gentle, but effective. When my hair dries, it looks glossy and feels clean and soft. It&#x27;s almost as if the damage done by all the coloring products never was. My hair feels as it did before I used any products, or maybe even better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works fine, but I can&#x27;t say I notice anything special about it. It has a pearlized shine to it and you need to use some effort to work it into a good lather-- it&#x27;s a bit thick and not so easy to bubble up. The scent is very mild and not at all perfume-y or fruity like most shampoos. Just a slight &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any change in texture or shine versus other shampoos I use.</li>
            <li> This is good as a regular shampoo, but I see no noticeable color protection.  That&#x27;s okay because it is good shampoo, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for the color protection.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair which tends to fade to dark blonde in the summer. While I don&#x27;t mind the color getting lighter, I don&#x27;t like the loss of color tones and that washed-out look. For the last three weeks I used the Brilliant Brunette Colour Protecting Moisturizing Shampoo with the hope of maintaining brilliant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is beige in color, but it is not supposed to add any pigment to the hair. It is rich and sudsy with a mild scent, which I couldn&#x27;t identify. According to the product information it is formulated with almond oil, but I did not pick up the almond scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy with the way my hair looks - soft, silky and shiny- but not the way my head feels. The shampoo is a little harsh for me and caused an itching feeling. I double rinsed to be sure none remained, but the itching continued. And while my hair looks good and has not faded out, the shampoo did not prevent the color from lightening up a little.</li>
            <li> I ordered shampoo and received conditioner.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a medium ash blonde. About two weeks ago I decided it was time for a change so I used a permanent hair color and went a medium brunette shade. Full disclosure: I do this probably every three to five years, hate the change because it fades very quickly, and invariably go back to my natural color. I must do this so infrequently that the reality never quite sinks in.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has already faded quite a bit. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo 4 times in the past 3 days straight and it hasn&#x27;t stopped the fading or camouflaged it. In fact, this brown crown is starting to go lighter and I am ready to go back to blonde (as in right now).&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness to the Frieda line, I have been a regular user of their shampoos alternating between their volumizing shampoo and their shampoos for darker blond shades Recently I tried a comparable formula for colored blonde hair because I normally highlight my natural shade. Their shampoos clean gently and produce great excellent results. This shampoo left me with clean hair but I noticed no improvement regarding the color. Given my issues with using hair coloring, I think I was a rotten candidate for this shampoo and my results may not have been the norm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 3* because it does a great job cleansing and moisturizing, but nothing apparently is going to save my fading brunette hair.</li>
            <li> We brunettes deserve love too, and John Frieda gives it to us with this brilliant brunette, refreshing and rejuvenating color protector that makes my hair shine and feel so soft and manageable. I use it mostly, alternating with the blonde color correcting to get the brass out, and my hair looks better than it has i a while. The scent is great, and I love the shine plus it extends my time between colorings because I don&#x27;t get the dull rat look dyed hair can get when the color starts to fade.</li>
            <li> It does prevent color from fading. My hair stays brown and does not fade to a shade of reddish brown. I use Kerastase products after to make hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Although the shampoo deposits no color to the hair, and I was not expecting gray coverage (I am probably 10% gray) those strands appear a bit darker. I have no idea how to explain this weird phenomena but it is not enough to make me like the shampoo. Perhaps the answer to the mystery is in the \\&quot;Caramel\\&quot; ingredient listed relatively high up on the list. Caramel what? Color? Strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is harsh, and my hair definitely is definitely frizzier and felt drier after use even though I conditioned, but given the sulfate-and alcohol in the product, I suppose it is to be expected. These ingredients normally strip color from color-treated hair, so again, I am confused that my hair seemed a little darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I do not like the fragrance. This is always a purely subjective issue, but to me it is reminiscent of a dusty slightly perfumey scent that has been floating around for at least a couple of decades. I have noticed it is re-appearing in various products, like lotion. It reminds me of a smell from my childhood - like an older relative&#x27;s liquid face foundation. I would prefer no scent or something more natural suitable for use by men and women. At least the fragrance is light, and after shampooing it dissipates quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the marketing gimmick: shampoo for color-treated brunettes. Yes, it is slightly bronze-colored, but the package clearly states that it does NOT deposit any color on the hair. So really, any color hair could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I like it.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing, sort of like those old all-in-one shampoo and conditioner products (do they still make those?). I don&#x27;t need any additional conditioner, except on the ends of my long hair. It doesn&#x27;t make a ton of lather, and the scent is very light and non-offensive. I actually just washed my hair with it and taking a sniff, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. This might be a plus if you hate smelling the scent of your shampoo all day, or a negative if you want your hair to smell like *something.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very soft after using this, and somewhat flat.  This is great for me, because I have a ton of hair that can get ridiculously big.  If your hair is thin without much body, you are probably not going to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it protect my hair from fading?  It seems to, slightly.  I don&#x27;t think it has any magical powers; it&#x27;s just the opposite of volumizing or clarify shampoos, which tend to be harsher and strip a lot of oil (and color) from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the ingredients, this seems to be free of parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using John Frieda’s color refreshing gloss in warm brunette (and sometimes cool) to freshen the color of my hair without having to do expensive and time-consuming hair coloring at the salon.  For me, this has been working out great as I have natural highlights from being outdoors, and it keeps my hair looking natural and NOT grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this color wash system better than the dye.  The Color refreshing gloss reflects my hair color and this keeps the tone correct while the gloss makes my hair look shiny and manageable (it’s not).  Alternating with this shampoo keeps me from using the other too often and getting darker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does not change the color of my hair; it just keeps the color in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for quite a long time. Probably since I had my first child was born. See the correlation? Anyway, I try to go about 6 weeks between dye jobs but sometimes it just looks bad. This shampoo is supposed to help keep the color but more importantly keep my hair from getting too frizzy and dry. So, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it really does. It does a great job of washing my hair and it looks nice using this shampoo. But I can&#x27;t say that it is doing a lot more than my regular shampoo. It&#x27;s one of those odd, subjective things that&#x27;s hard to quantify. But it&#x27;s a nice shampoo albeit a little more expensive than my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a very mild scent and cleans well without leaving hair feeling stripped. In fact, it does a good job moisturizing and leaving the hair feeling silky and with a nice sheen.  The color protection qualities are subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure why this happened, but I noticed after using this that my shoulders/upper back started to break out in little red bumps. I stopped using it, and they went away, so I returned it. Wasn&#x27;t expecting that, because their normal conditioners work well for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice scent. It lathers up well and rinses cleanly. I color my hair on a regular basis. After using this product for a while I noticed no difference in how my hair color behaves over time. It fades just as fast as it normally does. There was nothing really special enough about this shampoo for me to keep using it. Also, it contains sulfates which I try to avoid. I think I will just go back to my sulfate-free shampoos that I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and must say that I am in love with it.  I do have some grays and they drive me nuts but this particular shampoo is toning them down a bit which I am ever so grateful for.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong as it&#x27;s not coloring my hair just toning it a bit so instead of the stark gray it is more muted.  My light brown hair is much richer and feels like heaven.  The shampoo smells nice and you just need a bit to get a great lather if you have short hair like I do.  I haven&#x27;t found it drying like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried and I do use a good conditioner after my shampoo so that most likely helps a lot just on it&#x27;s own.  Price wise this is reasonable comparded to a few I have tried.  I trust the name brand as it has been around for some time and John Frieda is a quality I have come to love.</li>
            <li> This seems to work fine and doesn&#x27;t strip hair color from the hair.  It seems gentle and very mild.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which I really appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, after using this for a while, my hair seems a lot more coarser.  I need to use a lot more product after my shower now to keep my hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a good shampoo to keep hair color looking bright and keep it looking good longer.  Just be prepared to pamper you hair with extra leave in conditioner, or something similar,  if you use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few colour-protecting and colour-enhancing shampoos over the years.  While I don&#x27;t colour my hair, my hairdresser recommended that I use colour-protecting shampoo simply because it is gentler on my hair.  I used to swim every morning before work and the chlorine in the pool was really hurting my hair and scalp..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I switched from regular shampoo to colour-protecting shampoo, I really did see and feel the difference. My scalp was not as itchy and dry and my hair felt softer.  It tangled less and brushing it out was easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just rejoined our local YMCA and am back to swimming but not as much as before.  This shampoo is exactly how I remembered it to be.  It lathers well and I feel that it does clean my hair and scalp well without stripping too many oils from it.  The chlorine from the pool already does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the colour-protecting shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this is the one that is the perfect mix of cost vs performance.  I&#x27;ve used Rene Furterer, Keratase, Wella and Aveda,  This one also lathers up the most if you like lots of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those new to colour-enhancing shampoos, don&#x27;t use your best towels. Some of these shampoos leave a slight coloured residue that coats your hair supposedly for various reasons such as UV protection, colour adjustment to prevent brassiness, and extra moisturization. This residue rubs off and stains your towels when towel drying your hair.  So use a dedicated towel for your hair to avoid messing up your good towels.</li>
            <li> With crushed pearls and sweet almond oil, moisturising formula protects and preserves brunette colour as it rehydrates and replenishes dry, colour-treated brunette hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preserves colour keeping it rich &amp; vibrant&lt;br /&gt;For colour-treated brunettes&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Non-colour depositing&lt;br /&gt;I naturally have brunette hair, but I dye it darker shades of brunette because in the summer my hair turns dark blonde. I keep it dark, because I love how it compliments my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely an amazing line for colour treated hair. The shampoo and conditioner themselves are so luxurious and silky in my hair. I could tell even from the first use that it made an impact on the shine and fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair just looked so amazingly beautiful. Before this I was using a salon formula mask and leaving it in for about 20 minutes to replenish the dullness and dryness that comes with dying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use it while using these though, they  give great moisturizing benefits so that the dryness, split ends, and damage are rehydrated to give soft, silky locks that stay that way all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is so thick, rich, and doesn&#x27;t take very much to shampoo all my hair! It cleanses SO well. Since I&#x27;ve been tanning my scalp has started itching because of the \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; or whatever. A good wash with this shampoo definitely keeps the itchy scalp at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has already helped my hair colour as well. It&#x27;s about time to color it again and I could tell the color was looking washed out, and now it looks nothing but shiny and healthy! There&#x27;s absolutely no product residue leftover, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair- so all I have is MY silky, shiny, more volumous hair! PLUS it smells incredible!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dye my hair, but I like to use shampoos designed for dyed hair simply because they seem to focus on making sure your hair doesn&#x27;t get dried out. I really like this Brunette Colour shampoo from John Frieda. While I can&#x27;t say that it makes my hair any more brilliant (but I didn&#x27;t expected it to), I can say that it makes my hair feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the shampoo is a subtle almond. I enjoy it, but even more, I appreciate that this is a low sudsing shampoo. Therefore, it rinses easily.</li>
            <li> The John Frieda Color enhancing shampoos are pretty good. They clean hair very well and lather up nicely and leave hair nice and clean with a clean scent, but they seem to be a bit drying. I recommend this shampoo with a really good conditioner. This line probably has a nice conditioner that it pairs with and I would use that with this product or a really nice moisturizing conditioner or deep conditioner if needed. This tends to leave hair dry, especially if you have damaged/dry ends, it doesn&#x27;t help them much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does bring out the color of hair very nicely, but it&#x27;s not a nourishing shampoo, but it does do what it says-for the price, this is a nice shampoo, but I have to use a really good conditioner or it leaves my hair dry feeling. My daughters are brunette and have used color in the past and I liked the Blonde Highlight John Frieda shampoo more than they liked the brunette version and had the same dry effect from the product as I did.</li>
            <li> After enjoying some highlights all summer long, I decided to go back to a more natural light brown hair color.  I am using this shampoo and conditioner of its kind to keep the color more in place and it&#x27;s working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine-med, about 2-3&amp;#34; below my shoulders and it&#x27;s wavy.  This shampoo has a caramel color and doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical scent which I like.  I definitely need conditioner, the shampoo by itself it&#x27;s a bit drying.  The combination of the shampoo and conditioner work well for me.  It definitely does not color the gray coming out but it seems to protect the brown color.  So far I like it.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter had just highlighted her naturally chestnut locks when I received this shampoo. The first thing we noticed was the very light scent of coconut. As a fan of coconut oil, I was encouraged by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo left her hair soft and moisturized, as promised. After two weeks of using it, the condition of her hair has definitely improved. However, we have noticed no difference in the color treatment. But that could be because hers is just highlighted?</li>
            <li> This is good shampoo, although I really don;t see much difference between the results I got from this and normal shampoo. I use coloring once in a while, not often, and so don&#x27;t see terrible drying that other more frequent users might. The shampoo produces a nice sheen, but, again, nothing special beyond the results of any good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years. Not only do I love the smell (reminiscent of coconuts?), but I love how it makes my hair feel! When paired with the conditioner, my hair is left soft, bouncy, silky, and just gorgeous.    My one point of criticism (for years now) is that is you leave these bottles in your shower, the caps will fill with water and you&#x27;ll get a little unpleasant jolt of cold water the next time you open the cap. I don&#x27;t know why, but it really irks me.    I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of John Frieda hair products, but I truly do love the way this brunette line makes my hair look and smell. (Just avoid the John Frieda Color Refreshing Gloss ... those actual do leave color deposits on your hair that DO NOT wash out ... not so with this shampoo though).</li>
            <li> This is a good, gentle shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy, but it cleaned my hair without seeming to strip it or do any damage.  The scent is mild - good for those folks who are extremely sensitive to scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that it enhanced my hair color or added any richness.  My hair looked shiny and quite pretty, but it didn&#x27;t look terribly different from most other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t something I would go out of my way to buy, it&#x27;s also not something I would avoid.  It simply seems to be a good, basic shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like it and l like switching all shampoos.. just me makes hair dark ..someone asked me if i colored&lt;br /&gt;so must ..</li>
