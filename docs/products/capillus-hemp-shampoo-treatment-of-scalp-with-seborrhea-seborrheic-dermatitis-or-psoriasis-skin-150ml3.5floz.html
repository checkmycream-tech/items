            <li>Excellent!!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>this is the greatest shampoo ever made.  </li>
            <li>A very good product.</li>
            <li>Had great results with stubborn Seboretic Dermatitis.</li>
            <li>am so happy I found this shampoo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Leave it to the Czech ingenuity to make such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Simply wonderful shampoo.</li>
            <li>First bottle was very impressive, ordered two more.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of better alternative treatments that don&#x27;t have to pass through U.S. customs to boost a five week delivery time.</li>
            <li>shoudl have kow better but nothing ventured nothing gained would not buy again better off with medicated shampoo</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading some good reviews about this shampoo I decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>is okay with me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells authentic with invigorating undertones as well.</li>
            <li>There is a STRONG smell from the hemp used in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should be sending me the product free after all of that.  </li>
            <li>You should send it for free of charge.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the long term effects of the shampoo will be, but this experience was unforgettable for me, so I can already say that I will buy it again.    </li>
            <li>The shampoo smells of cloves, not the most appealing of smells to me personally, but it does not linger in your hair and that suits me just fine.     </li>
            <li>is gone by the first shampoo, it dried it of and now it looks healthy!!!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it for a week or so of scalp</li>
            <li>The shampoo was far more gentle on my scalp than vinegar was, and it really worked!</li>
            <li>The itching returned sooner next time, which makes me think that it had become more immune to vinegar.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it maybe once or twice more before switching back to my normal shampoo alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are an SD sufferer you know that your scalp never lets you foget its present, as a matter-of-fact, it wants the spot light.</li>
            <li>very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about one week as of this review, and haven&#x27;t noticed much change in scalp condition.</li>
            <li>Really runny consistency and irritated my scalp</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It smells like seafood seasoning though haha</li>
            <li>Hydrogen peroxide only made my light brown hair have a reddish tint.</li>
            <li>And it made my hair super super dry</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from SD for over 10 years now, and never even knew what it really was until I realized that many other people have the condition as well.</li>
            <li>years, I only have ever tried using Neutrogena T-gel to treat my SD, but after my scalp flared up after perhaps 6 months of sweet relief I was disheartened and figured that there was no cure.</li>
            <li>I used it about 5 days ago and have had a considerable DECREASE in itching and scaling on my scalp after the first day.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your hair extremely greasy, has a strong clove-like odor and does not lather very well at all.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>And pleasantly enough, I have also learned how to calm and manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wonder if, in fact, salicylic acid is the true active anti-dandruff ingredient here (as it is in T/Sal, Sebulex, etc.).</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see the package on my doorstep after work today, as I forgot I ordered it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was nearly a month and overcharged.</li>
            <li>, I feel like I can finally have a normal scalp!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it only because of the higher cost, but would definitely not buy again.</li>
            <li>Vinegar seemed to work at first because the problem left for several weeks then returned.</li>
            <li>Based on the price, (and from reading previous reviews), I expected a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t completely disappear when it dries, so be ready for your hair to smell a little funky.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;guilt about not even on the one hand, apparently is to blame USPS you will get your money back,</li>
            <li>, I did not detect any thing other than what I would think a normal scalp to feel like, as if it was your nose, you know, just sitting there on your face doing its job, minding its business.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The shampoo does have a particular small, which some have defined as \\&quot;cloves\\&quot;, but one will notice \\&quot;cannabis seed</li>

            <li> Sadly, it worked only for the first two days,then after that my scalp became itchy again.</li>
            <li> Great results for even the worst of symptoms.</li>
            <li> Granted it had a long journey but not worth it to me...</li>
            <li> Just curious as to what this could be.</li>
            <li> I thought that perhaps it returned because I didn&#x27;t treat my bedding material with vinegar, so I re-soaked my head with a dripping wet vinegar soaked towel again for an hour and soaked my bedding with vinegar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, and only noticeable if you smell the hair up close.</li>
            <li> I might be wary about using this shampoo before having close contact with other people who aren&#x27;t aware of your condition...</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll switch to other products ...</li>
            <li> I tried store bought dandruff and itch shampoo, wrapping my head with a dripping wet towel soaked with vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide treatments with no success.</li>
            <li> I then discover this foreign made shampoo and ordered it.</li>
            <li> have read that SD sufferers must juggle treatment products in order to keep symptoms at bay, and I will definitely keep this in my repertoire, and will only use if my SD is particularly worse than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rest of the previously mentioned products did</li>
            <li> leaves my hair heavy, but scalp doesn&#x27;t itch for 24 hours, than it starts to itch again</li>

            <li> Maybe it helped for a few hours or a day</li>
            <li> You have done nothing for me after two months of me trying to get the product, you have wasted my time.  </li>
            <li> Legit fix for hair gone to shit.</li>
            <li> smell, however, is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I had raw skin splotches on my scalp and no lice.</li>
            <li> , I read the instructions and massaged a small amount onto my scalp, I then waited 5 minutes or so, and rinsed.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it works.</li>
            <li> : When I received my shampoo in the mail, it also came with a small square package of Cannaderm product that is labeled \\&quot;27%\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> What do you mean when you state --guilt about not even on the one hand.  </li>
            <li> And it kinda made the situation worse .</li>

            <li> it could be awkward to explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shampoos made it the US are useless!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the nasty gook anymore, or at least after a week</li>
            <li> Today just so happened to be a really bad day at work, my scalp was itching uncontrollably, I think its because of my diet.      </li>
            <li> I had the worst itching and premature balding in weird spaces on my scalp that this product helpd stop.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! it works all is gone by the first shampoo, it dried it of and now it looks healthy!!! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are a cancer survivor and use tamoxiphen - you might&lt;br /&gt;want to use this for your dry scalp.  It is a comfort.&lt;br /&gt;Kindly,&lt;br /&gt;Rose</li>
            <li> It works.  leaves my hair heavy, but scalp doesn&#x27;t itch for 24 hours, than it starts to itch again and so I have to treat it again.  The suggestion to not rub it into my scalp and let it sit for 5 minutes was helpful.  I wish it didn&#x27;t cost 25 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li> Hello,     I ordered the shampoo on May 14th and I received it today, May  31st. I was pleasantly surprised to see the package on my doorstep after work today, as I forgot I ordered it. Anyway, I exercised and did not hesitate to wash my hair, I read the instructions and massaged a small amount onto my scalp, I then waited 5 minutes or so, and rinsed. I can&#x27;t quite explain the sensation on my scalp as the water washed the suds away, it was not a tingling sensation, or irritation, It did not itch anymore, I did not detect any thing other than what I would think a normal scalp to feel like, as if it was your nose, you know, just sitting there on your face doing its job, minding its business. If you are an SD sufferer you know that your scalp never lets you foget its present, as a matter-of-fact, it wants the spot light. Today just so happened to be a really bad day at work, my scalp was itching uncontrollably, I think its because of my diet.      I don&#x27;t know what the long term effects of the shampoo will be, but this experience was unforgettable for me, so I can already say that I will buy it again.    The shampoo smells of cloves, not the most appealing of smells to me personally, but it does not linger in your hair and that suits me just fine.     If you are patient I suggest you try this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about one week as of this review, and haven&#x27;t noticed much change in scalp condition. It also leaves your hair extremely greasy, has a strong clove-like odor and does not lather very well at all. Based on the price, (and from reading previous reviews), I expected a lot more from this product. I will continue to use it only because of the higher cost, but would definitely not buy again. There&#x27;s plenty of better alternative treatments that don&#x27;t have to pass through U.S. customs to boost a five week delivery time.</li>
            <li> A very good product. Decreases symptoms by 90% if  used daily. Great results for even the worst of symptoms. I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> 3 stars, as ingredients inconsiderately not listed &amp; as salicylic acid is one of them. I wonder if, in fact, salicylic acid is the true active anti-dandruff ingredient here (as it is in T/Sal, Sebulex, etc.). Salicylic acid gives some people (including me) acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqua, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Cannabis Sativa Seed Protein, Lactic Acid, Citrus Grandis Extract, Xanthan Gum, Hyssopus Officinalis Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Eugenia Caryophyllus Oil, Salicylic Acid, Allantoin, Dead Sea Salt</li>
            <li> Did not work....at all. shoudl have kow better but nothing ventured nothing gained would not buy again better off with medicated shampoo</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as anticipated but did help..... One Warning is that you WILL smell like you just smoked marijuana. There is a STRONG smell from the hemp used in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was nearly a month and overcharged. Granted it had a long journey but not worth it to me...</li>
            <li> Really runny consistency and irritated my scalp</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it works. I guess using this on your head qualifies you as a pot head though</li>
            <li> I have been trying all kinds of shampoos and ointments to help with a scalp issue&lt;br /&gt;that showed up. This product works well for me. Maybe it will do the same for you.</li>
            <li> this is the greatest shampoo ever made.  Leave it to the Czech ingenuity to make such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Simply wonderful shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from SD for over 10 years now, and never even knew what it really was until I realized that many other people have the condition as well. And pleasantly enough, I have also learned how to calm and manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I only have ever tried using Neutrogena T-gel to treat my SD, but after my scalp flared up after perhaps 6 months of sweet relief I was disheartened and figured that there was no cure. Come to find out that SD is FOR LIFE, but also quite manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some good reviews about this shampoo I decided it was worth a try. I used it about 5 days ago and have had a considerable DECREASE in itching and scaling on my scalp after the first day. It&#x27;s amazing! I plan to use it maybe once or twice more before switching back to my normal shampoo alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does have a particular small, which some have defined as \\&quot;cloves\\&quot;, but one will notice \\&quot;cannabis seed extract\\&quot; in the ingredients. Haha. But after using this product and then following with my regular shampoo, my boyfriend has pointed out that my hair still smells like weed. It&#x27;s not strong, and only noticeable if you smell the hair up close. I might be wary about using this shampoo before having close contact with other people who aren&#x27;t aware of your condition... it could be awkward to explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that SD sufferers must juggle treatment products in order to keep symptoms at bay, and I will definitely keep this in my repertoire, and will only use if my SD is particularly worse than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Cannaderm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: When I received my shampoo in the mail, it also came with a small square package of Cannaderm product that is labeled \\&quot;27%\\&quot;. I&#x27;m assuming that this is a pre-treatment for especially hardcore SD, but I have yet to try it (if I even need to try it). Just curious as to what this could be.</li>
            <li> This product works for the first day it&#x27;s used and then the flakes are ten times worse for the next week</li>
            <li> First bottle was very impressive, ordered two more. Had great results with stubborn Seboretic Dermatitis. Shampoos made it the US are useless!</li>
            <li> Sadly, it worked only for the first two days,then after that my scalp became itchy again. And it kinda made the situation worse . Not for me, definitely. And it made my hair super super dry like I cannot even comb it the next day(I used conditioner). Guess I&#x27;ll switch to other products ...</li>
            <li> Unable to understand the content of the product, listed in another language.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless things to get rid of my seborrheic dermatitis: T-Gel, apple cider vinegar, Head &amp; Shoulders, but none of it worked at all. Maybe it helped for a few hours or a day but that&#x27;s it. This actually gets rid of my build up! I don&#x27;t get the nasty gook anymore, or at least after a week and then I just use it again. My itching has subsided, but it&#x27;s not completely gone. But anything that can get rid of my build up is okay with me!&lt;br /&gt;The smell, however, is pretty bad. It basically smells like you were smoking weed at a campfire. It also doesn&#x27;t completely disappear when it dries, so be ready for your hair to smell a little funky. I think it&#x27;s worth it for a week or so of scalp relief.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this shampoo, I feel like I can finally have a normal scalp!</li>
            <li> I dont understand you statement. &amp;#34;guilt about not even on the one hand, apparently is to blame USPS you will get your money back, considered this case for closed.&amp;#34;  What do you mean when you state --guilt about not even on the one hand.  You should be sending me the product free after all of that.  I the one communicating with you.  Im doing all the work.  It not about me gettg my money money back.  Im gonna get my money back- I gave it to you, you have to give back if I have no product.  You have done nothing for me after two months of me trying to get the product, you have wasted my time.  I could have went some where in the USA to something instead of dealing with you..  You should send it for free of charge. I will let others know on Amazon how you treated me,</li>
            <li> Legit fix for hair gone to shit. I had the worst itching and premature balding in weird spaces on my scalp that this product helpd stop. Smells authentic with invigorating undertones as well.</li>
            <li> Idk how to explain it.... But it helped for one day.... It smells like seafood seasoning though haha</li>
            <li> I had raw skin splotches on my scalp and no lice. I tried store bought dandruff and itch shampoo, wrapping my head with a dripping wet towel soaked with vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide treatments with no success. Vinegar seemed to work at first because the problem left for several weeks then returned. I thought that perhaps it returned because I didn&#x27;t treat my bedding material with vinegar, so I re-soaked my head with a dripping wet vinegar soaked towel again for an hour and soaked my bedding with vinegar. The itching returned sooner next time, which makes me think that it had become more immune to vinegar. Hydrogen peroxide only made my light brown hair have a reddish tint. The rest of the previously mentioned products did nothing.&lt;br /&gt; I looked on-line for a remedy that would actually work, and the U.S. based doctors were saying that there is nothing that will fix my scalp problem. I then discover this foreign made shampoo and ordered it. The shampoo was far more gentle on my scalp than vinegar was, and it really worked! My scalp cleared after the first use except that I had one small scab. I used it two consecutive times fearing that &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; might develop a resistance to this remedy. A month later the problem is still gone!</li>
