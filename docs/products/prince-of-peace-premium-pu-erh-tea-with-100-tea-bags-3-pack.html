            <li>SO glad I got it...</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this tea which was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>The cost is okay.</li>
            <li>I have had better quality puerh but for the price and being in tea bags this is pretty darn good</li>
            <li>If you are a pu-erh connoiseur, this may not meet your standards, but for daily drinking of a very nice tea at a great price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has become my favorite, and I&#x27;m so happy to be able to order it along with other items that I&#x27;m ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I just add some honey to it and he can drink it just fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a HUGE appetite suppressor for me.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and mellow - no bite or bitterness.</li>
            <li>The energy it gives me is through the roof (not hummingbird in a shoe box energy, but alert and able to exercise energy) for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>A great tasting tea that is delicious hot or cold.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>Helps make you feel full</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t over eat, and also just an overall good tasting tea.</li>
            <li>had no problem with the seller, tea came super quick.</li>
            <li>I receive it quickly.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li>so to have a natural source of energy that helps my health in SO many ways</li>
            <li>I actually like it better without sugar (splenda).</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered Prince of Peace.</li>
            <li>I first saw this advertised in a lady&#x27;s magazine, and just had to try it.</li>
            <li>I love this tea and drink it daily.  </li>
            <li>When I feel gross &amp; bloated, I drink this and feel way better.</li>
            <li>I love the Tea you have listed above.  </li>
            <li>No direct caffeine hit but lovely in flavour.  </li>
            <li>Brews up dark and rich yet not too strong.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this is real puerh with a reddish hue and the distinctly earthy odor and taste.</li>
            <li>All the hype I read about it in a women&#x27;s magazine wasn&#x27;t much to brag about either.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted the convenience of tea bags to take to work etc.  </li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier for me to pop out of bed in the mornings now</li>
            <li>so the taste doesn&#x27;t really get me</li>
            <li>Other than that it is OK.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite black tea.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like it lots better than green tea for taste.</li>
            <li>I plan on being more careful in the future.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s just completely detoxified me!</li>
            <li>The natural levistatin has helped lower my cholesterol.  </li>
            <li>I got this tea because I have been dealing with severe adrenal fatigue and looking for natural ways of getting energy.</li>
            <li>I have a 1 year old daughter so to keep up with her with adrenal fatigue...</li>
            <li>It also helps keep you regular and helps flush you out (not the Dumb and Dumber scene flush you out, just a nice cleansing).</li>
            <li>I found this very acceptable for day to day drinking and extremely convenient for taking to work or on a trip.  </li>
            <li>it took the big guns and they barely made me feel awake..</li>
            <li>If you have a Chinese grocery near where you live, they will always carry this and it will be half the price of what it sells for here.</li>
            <li>To me it really tastes a lot like black tea, there is just a tiny difference.</li>

            <li> I drink a lot of pu-erh also, since our local tea supplier specializes in pu-erh and dark teas.  </li>
            <li> These tea bags can be used several times, as with all pu-erh and dark teas, and you just brew longer each time.  </li>
            <li> A lot less than I would&#x27;ve paid if I had purchased this tea in a local store.</li>
            <li> The taste is OK but the smell is really bad.</li>
            <li> This tea tastes OK but smells bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a tad bit bitter for him.</li>
            <li> I started with the organic one but now drink this one due to price difference.</li>
            <li> It is real tea, not herbal stuff (sorry, I dislike herbal teas) but never gets astringent from overbrewing.  </li>
            <li> Previous reviewers had mentioned the taste but it is the smell that bothers me.</li>
            <li> you get it a little cheaper when you bu t three boxes at a time</li>
            <li> The smell leaves much to be desired as it stinks but does not reflect on the taste, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I drink tea everyday</li>
            <li> So I am disappointed the shelf time is only 6 months.</li>
            <li> It was getting worse with age.</li>
            <li> and I hate to waste my money.</li>
            <li> I tried everything for energy (Rockstar, Redbull, 5 hour energy and sadly Diet Pills)</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really hate this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that the expiration date is 11/15/2015.</li>

            <li> It tastes good. I actually like it better without sugar (splenda). The smell leaves much to be desired as it stinks but does not reflect on the taste, in my opinion. All the hype I read about it in a women&#x27;s magazine wasn&#x27;t much to brag about either. If you&#x27;re gonna lose the belly fat, ladies, (and fellas) do the work outs and portion your food intake. This is nice for sipping and getting a good amount of liquid into your body, but for reducing belly fat on its own, nah! I like it lots better than green tea for taste.</li>
            <li> I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I&#x27;m not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> I had ordered Pu-erh tea before by a different brand name. This is the first time I ordered Prince of Peace. This is a three pack. I am extremely disappointed that the expiration date is 11/15/2015. Only 6 months. I love tea but I won&#x27;t be able to drink all three boxes, 100 count in each box, in 6 months. That&#x27;s 300 bags. I have to drink about 50 cups of tea a month. Can you imagine!!!!!!!!!! So I am disappointed the shelf time is only 6 months. The flavor??? TBD</li>
            <li> I have loved seeing the results of drinking this tea!! I drink tea everyday so I figured I may as well reap the rewards.</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  however it boasts that you will lose weight and have not done so.  but the taste is good and light, I will continue to use it as will my sister and friends that I have gotten hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this one is worth it. This tea is amazing for belly fat. Reduced my belly in one week. My daughter was amazed. I am 59 and was so depressed about my big belly. It was getting worse with age. Heard about this tea and it worked a miracle. I drink it all the time. I started with the organic one but now drink this one due to price difference. Drink it with your meals at all times if possible and drink it during the day to suppress your appetite.</li>
            <li> I first saw this advertised in a lady&#x27;s magazine, and just had to try it. It has become my favorite, and I&#x27;m so happy to be able to order it along with other items that I&#x27;m ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The natural levistatin has helped lower my cholesterol.  I like it best to make ice tea but good either way.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really hate this product. The taste is OK but the smell is really bad. Check the return policy before you order anything. this is a no return and I hate to waste my money. I plan on being more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law brought this stuff to me as a gift.  No direct caffeine hit but lovely in flavour.  Yes, I would definitely buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this tea you don&#x27;t need cream or sugar, and its good for you. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this tea but I really wanted the convenience of tea bags to take to work etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that this is real puerh with a reddish hue and the distinctly earthy odor and taste. I have had better quality puerh but for the price and being in tea bags this is pretty darn good and I would purchase again....especially since it&#x27;s  \\&quot;prime\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Quality herbal tea, packaged and boxed very nicely,  Tea tastes great and really helps curb my appetite. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this tea and drink it daily.  The price was awesome.  I have and will recommend this site to buy this produce.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for the set of three boxes&lt;br /&gt;Taste very good like the loose tea in tevana store&lt;br /&gt;I received the package very soon</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend as a helpful aid in weight control.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true but we did not like the taste at all so now I have 2 1/2 boxes of tea that no one will drink.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an excellent price.  My wife and I have been using Prince of Peace Pu-Erh tea for more than a year.  It is a necessary part of our diet program.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this tea.</li>
            <li> My mother had me try this tea. I loved it. My family has tried it and they love it too. We don&#x27;t buy tea at the store anymore.</li>
            <li> We drink iced tea every day - all year. This is our favorite black tea. It is smooth and mellow - no bite or bitterness. Brews up dark and rich yet not too strong. Thank you, Amazon, for making it available!</li>
            <li> great taste and gives me plenty of energy for hours.  I would order this great tasting tea again and also i like the price.</li>
            <li> Helps make you feel full so you don&#x27;t over eat, and also just an overall good tasting tea. When I feel gross &amp; bloated, I drink this and feel way better.</li>

            <li> I got this tea because I have been dealing with severe adrenal fatigue and looking for natural ways of getting energy. I heard lots of good stuff about this type of tea. Well, this tea is AMAZING. I have 2 cups (1 bag per cup) with each of my 3 meals a day. I  feel like a million bucks. I&#x27;m losing weight, I have no carb cravings, no junk food cravings it&#x27;s a HUGE appetite suppressor for me. The energy it gives me is through the roof (not hummingbird in a shoe box energy, but alert and able to exercise energy) for the first time in years. I feel like it&#x27;s just completely detoxified me! It also helps keep you regular and helps flush you out (not the Dumb and Dumber scene flush you out, just a nice cleansing). It makes it so much easier for me to pop out of bed in the mornings now, I feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have used this tea years ago so I could feel THIS good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big tea drinker so the taste doesn&#x27;t really get me but my husband say&#x27;s it&#x27;s a tad bit bitter for him. I just add some honey to it and he can drink it just fine. To me it really tastes a lot like black tea, there is just a tiny difference. I was scared this good for me tea would be the plug your nose take a swallow sort of drink but it&#x27;s not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with the seller, tea came super quick. SO glad I got it... I tried everything for energy (Rockstar, Redbull, 5 hour energy and sadly Diet Pills) I have a 1 year old daughter so to keep up with her with adrenal fatigue... it took the big guns and they barely made me feel awake..so to have a natural source of energy that helps my health in SO many ways was a blessing I can&#x27;t even describe.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this tea which was recommended to me. This tea is also suppose to help me lose weight. Tastes GREAT!</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift from someone who knows I drink a lot of tea.  I drink a lot of pu-erh also, since our local tea supplier specializes in pu-erh and dark teas.  I found this very acceptable for day to day drinking and extremely convenient for taking to work or on a trip.  Pu-erh is always an earthy tea with an umami flavor.  It is real tea, not herbal stuff (sorry, I dislike herbal teas) but never gets astringent from overbrewing.  These tea bags can be used several times, as with all pu-erh and dark teas, and you just brew longer each time.  If you are a pu-erh connoiseur, this may not meet your standards, but for daily drinking of a very nice tea at a great price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I buy these in Oakland&#x27;s Chinatown all the time. They are sold for $3.99 per box of 100. If you have a Chinese grocery near where you live, they will always carry this and it will be half the price of what it sells for here. The tea itself is not bad and Puerh Tea is good for you.</li>
            <li> I like the taste. The cost is okay. I receive it quickly. I would recommend it.I like that you get it a little cheaper when you bu t three boxes at a time</li>
            <li> This tea tastes OK but smells bad. Previous reviewers had mentioned the taste but it is the smell that bothers me. Other than that it is OK.</li>
            <li> I started drinking this tea after Dr Oz on his tv show had mentioned it. He had declared it to be good for not allowing fat to settle in body but flushing it out.&lt;br /&gt;For me, since I could not drink coffee anymore, it was a good substitute because the color is like coffee and tastes pleasant. I add some honey for sweetening and have a cup every morning</li>
