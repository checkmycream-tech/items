            <li>Love this lip Quencher!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a price hike on something you can get on DermStore&#x27;s own website for twelve bucks.</li>
            <li>i have used it before and liked it</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey,</li>
            <li>The absolute best I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the BEST item I have ever used!</li>
            <li>my lips are still nice and moist to the point that I don&#x27;t need to redo anything except put on a bit of lip stick if I want to.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice guava scent.</li>
            <li>Quick arrival - not as great as the original.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm but this one seemed like an off batch.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still better than most lip balms.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>buy more before I run out :)</li>
            <li>Stays on better than anything else, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and keeps the lips moist.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it  </li>
            <li>I have tried several lip moisturizing products, and none begin to compare with the wonderful results I get from Lip Quench.</li>
            <li>Love this lip quencher....</li>
            <li>I love you guys, but the Lip Quench Lip Treatment irks me to no end.</li>
            <li>that said, it moisturizes perfectly and actually makes your lips look plumper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s colorless, scentless and very smooth, goes on easily</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li>this is the best product I have ever used for dry lips.  </li>
            <li>This works great, I used it as a cheaper alternative to the Sephora &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; lipbalm that costs more than double..</li>
            <li>Always looked forward to free samples.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>I keep asking for the Lip Quench Moisturizing NOT the original.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s unique about it</li>
            <li>its a sweet fruity smell..</li>
            <li>My solution: I put it on before bed, so I don&#x27;t have to be aware of it.</li>
            <li>This is not my first time purchasing Lip Quench.  </li>
            <li>my lips still look dry and cracked but with a shiny sparkle over top.  </li>
            <li>I have one in every bag I carry because I never want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;Gives your lips a super soft feel without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Stay far away from this one, the high price may lure you into thinking that they&#x27;re selling off the last reserves of a great product, but that is simply not the case.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and it actually improved the softness of my lips after only one tube!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the real &amp;#34;Dermstore Lip</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive lips and most lipsticks dry out my lips and give me cracking at the corners.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my purse but need a couple more for other places like my car and my bedside.</li>
            <li>It does make my lips soft, but it irritates me too much to make it my first choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy, it doesn&#x27;t last, and it simply isn&#x27;t half as good as what DermStore used to sell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve can really attest to this, since I swim laps for nearly an hour weekday mornings.  </li>
            <li>It stays on for awhile and gives your lips a nice subtle sheen.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, my lips are still dewy and soft!</li>
            <li>&amp; I wish it was completely clear.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I think $12 is a bit much for lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>This is the vastly inferior new formula, which may as well be scented vaseline.</li>
            <li>- you can apply lip stick on top of a thin coat without any worries of it creeping over the lip line.  </li>
            <li>and although it isn&#x27;t super thick it stays on nearly all day.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Quick delivery and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm but this one seemed like an off batch. It didn&#x27;t quite feel the same but it&#x27;s still better than most lip balms.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. The smell is a little strange but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is not what I wanted.  I keep asking for the Lip Quench Moisturizing NOT the original.  The other one.</li>
            <li> my lips still look dry and cracked but with a shiny sparkle over top.  With continued use (several times daily for a month) no improvement.</li>
            <li> The formula as well as the producer has changed. It is now less sticky and does not last as long as it used to.  I used it for overnight and it would still be on my lips in the morning.  It was very effective.  No longer.  It is generally not as useful especially now that it is $33 a pop. Ridiculous. I paid less than that to try it again</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL! This is the vastly inferior new formula, which may as well be scented vaseline. It&#x27;s greasy, it doesn&#x27;t last, and it simply isn&#x27;t half as good as what DermStore used to sell. Stay far away from this one, the high price may lure you into thinking that they&#x27;re selling off the last reserves of a great product, but that is simply not the case. It&#x27;s just a price hike on something you can get on DermStore&#x27;s own website for twelve bucks.</li>
            <li> It is good and keeps your lips moist for a length of time but I feel it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is awesome! I have very sensitive lips and most lipsticks dry out my lips and give me cracking at the corners. Lip quench does not do that. It stays on for awhile and gives your lips a nice subtle sheen. Tastes good too.</li>
            <li> i have used it before and liked it but this one feels like they changed the formula and it was way over priced!!payed more got less :(</li>
            <li> Best lip product I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips moist for hours. I love this stuff. Its thick and stays put. Kind of pricey, but now I have to have it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lip moisturizer! However, the taste is horrible. Even with the taste, I kept going back to it, because it definitely does the job. I don&#x27;t use this during the day; because, in addition to the taste, it&#x27;s rather thick. I don&#x27;t like the feel of gummy lips. My solution: I put it on before bed, so I don&#x27;t have to be aware of it. When I wake up in the morning, my lips are still dewy and soft! On the occasions that I&#x27;ve applied regular lip balm or Vaseline to my lips before bed, there is no evidence of it when I wake up. It works great!</li>
            <li> The BEST lip moisturizer ever! I have one in every bag I carry because I never want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;Gives your lips a super soft feel without feeling greasy. Lasts long!&lt;br /&gt;I buy more before I run out :)</li>
            <li> Use it everyday! Stays on better than anything else, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and keeps the lips moist. I keep it in my purse but need a couple more for other places like my car and my bedside.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for Chapped lips. No more split, pealing or cracked lips. Plus you don&#x27;t have to use it as much as other products. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it.  I cant ever seem to relieve the drynrss of my lips,  a friend turned me on to lip quench and I love it  I will always buy it.  its expensive I guess .  but I use way less of it then say burts bees or carmex which I was applying fifteen times a day . I use lip quench probably four or five times a day.</li>
            <li> The absolute best I have ever found.  I suffer from dry and cracking lips and this product is unsurpassed.</li>
            <li> This is not my first time purchasing Lip Quench.  I have very dry lips, and by using Lip Quench before I go to bed at night makes all the difference in the world in the morning when I apply lipstick.  I have tried several lip moisturizing products, and none begin to compare with the wonderful results I get from Lip Quench.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item. Stays on lips long time.</li>
            <li> Quick arrival - not as great as the original.</li>
            <li> Have used before - like this product!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to something on my lips other than lipstick.  This is absolutely the BEST item I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Smooth ,the best product that have used on my lips.</li>
            <li> Starting with Chap Stick back in the 1970&#x27;s I have tried tons of lip moisturizers, including many expensive glosses, lip &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;, you name it.  This one from the Dermstore came as a surprise sample along with something else I ordered from them.  Well, bless you, Dermstore - this Lip Quench is IT!  It&#x27;s colorless, scentless and very smooth, goes on easily and although it isn&#x27;t super thick it stays on nearly all day.  I&#x27;ve can really attest to this, since I swim laps for nearly an hour weekday mornings.  I&#x27;ve been applying the Lip Quench before leaving home, and when I&#x27;m out of the pool my lips are still nice and moist to the point that I don&#x27;t need to redo anything except put on a bit of lip stick if I want to.  And that&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s unique about it - you can apply lip stick on top of a thin coat without any worries of it creeping over the lip line.  I already ordered another tube - one for home, one for my purse as I don&#x27;t want to leave home without it!</li>
            <li> This gloss is created by dermatiologists. The color is amazing and it actually improved the softness of my lips after only one tube!</li>
            <li> Love this lip quencher....use it every night!</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry lips, and I can never wear matte lipsticks. I got this as a freebee and put it on last night roughly an hour before I went to bed. It has a nice guava scent. It&#x27;s thick, but it&#x27;s not sticky. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling. In the morning, I could still feel it on my lips! How surprising!! Hopefully after using it for longer, my chapped lips will be healed (or I&#x27;ll try lipstick under/over this).</li>
            <li> this is the best lip treatment I have ever found</li>
            <li> this is the best product I have ever used for dry lips.  It lasts all night.  When I wake up...iti&#x27;s still on.</li>
            <li> Great product, but way overpriced!</li>
            <li> Love this lip Quencher!  However, wasn&#x27;t shipped they dermstore.  Always looked forward to free samples.  I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not the same product I used prior. I don&#x27;t believe this is the real &amp;#34;Dermstore Lip Quench 8g / 0.21...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works great, I used it as a cheaper alternative to the Sephora &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; lipbalm that costs more than double.. only complaint is the smell &amp; I wish it was completely clear. Some might like the smell.. its a sweet fruity smell.. but had something off about it.</li>
            <li> Ah, Dermstore.... I love you guys, but the Lip Quench Lip Treatment irks me to no end. It has a cult following so not everyone feels the way I do about it but personally I find it to be gunky and sticky. It doesn&#x27;t stick to the wet portions of your lips so you can feel where it isn&#x27;t applied; what I call &amp;#34;the waxy tectonic lip plate&amp;#34;. It does make my lips soft, but it irritates me too much to make it my first choice. I have somehow managed to accumulate a few tubes and I&#x27;ll use them because I have them, but I&#x27;d never go out and buy it.</li>
            <li> This is the very best lip protection ever. A little bit goes a long way, lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I received this as a freebee when I ordered another product. Now I&#x27;m addicted. I only gave it 4 stars because I think $12 is a bit much for lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it moisturizes perfectly and actually makes your lips look plumper. It&#x27;s also got a slight shimmer to it.</li>
