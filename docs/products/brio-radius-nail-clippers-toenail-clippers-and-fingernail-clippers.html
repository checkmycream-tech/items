            <li>I love that there are built in nail files underneath the handle of both clippers.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend these nail clippers to anyone looking for a great quality set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I am always looking for a good set that my husband will like sooo much that he will keep track of them.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, sturdy and all around excellent!</li>
            <li>It works fine for both toenails and fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Lucky find!</li>
            <li>These clippers are sturdy and provide a precise cut.</li>
            <li>They have an easy grip, lever, and an nail file built right in for easy nail care.</li>
            <li>These clippers are awesome, no more struggling with flimsy clippers that struggle to work on toe nails.</li>
            <li>With these Brio clippers, I know that I’ll have my fingers positioned correctly every time to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>These arrived last week and after the first use I am happy with my decision.</li>
            <li>It is a very fine grain file, nice for polishing edges and quickly taking care of a rough spot here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work well &amp; are better then the old cheap ones.</li>
            <li>High quality item, has worked nicely thus far.</li>
            <li>When I seen these I opted for them right away.</li>
            <li>Unique air-cooled chassis that won&#x27;t overheat when clipping at high speeds.</li>
            <li>With severe arthritis, I was worried if I would be able to handle them well enough.  </li>
            <li>This is worth it so much.</li>
            <li>I would liken these to flying first class rather than coach.</li>
            <li>In my house, nail clippers are one of those essential tools that always seems to run away and hide when you need it the most.  </li>
            <li>Having used lots of different nail clippers over the years, I can say with confidence that these are top quality.  </li>
            <li>To finally have clippers that doesn&#x27;t wreck my nails each time I use them, that actually cut my nails without splintering/cracking my nails, and most importantly, a nail clipper that doesn&#x27;t fall apart in my hands - which has happened twice with cheap clippers and was the reason I finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They seem very well-made.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, and maybe you too can stop wondering if there is a nail clipper monster in your house</li>
            <li>These are high quality clippers.  </li>
            <li>but I miss the little under-nail cleaner thing most clippers have.</li>
            <li>I find that this makes them extra comfortable to use, and also ensures that my fingers are placed close to the end, where I’m going to get the best cutting motion by pushing down.  </li>
            <li>Sharp blade produced clean cut.</li>
            <li>I bought these nailclippers to replace an old one that was wearing out after decades of use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a file like my old one did</li>
            <li>Seems to be made of high quality material that will last.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the cutting surface is sharp and even - it does a great job of trimming and shaping my nails with minimal force and without leaving behind jagged edges.  </li>
            <li>These are very solid and not cheaply made at all they are made out of very durable stainless steel to last a lifetime.</li>

            <li> think the feature on these that really sets them apart from my other nail clippers, though is the shape and design of the handle (the portion that you push down in order to operate the clippers).  </li>

            <li> Sometimes when I’m in a hurry with my other clippers, I end up putting my fingers closer to the cutting portion, and then when I push down it isn’t nearly as effective.  </li>
            <li> Tough stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Quality construction but leaves rough edges on my daughters fingernails.</li>
            <li> Tried them out and they seem to have thin, very sharp edges that just snip through the nail without much pressure.</li>
            <li> Durable and sharp.</li>
            <li> Well-made clippers, and extremely sharp as advertised.</li>
            <li> I thought was silly to spend so much for a nail clipper when I get them for a $1 at a department store</li>
            <li> choppy, uneven cuts.</li>
            <li> They are also a little hard to get under the nail.</li>
            <li> However, they aren&#x27;t curved enough for me and always end up cutting my skin when I get to the edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know about your house, but my house seems to eat nail clippers, like the dryer eats socks!! They just disappear and are nowhere to be found! So I am always looking for a good set that my husband will like sooo much that he will keep track of them.  Well I have finally found the perfect set to do that!!! These Brio Radius Nail Clippers are amazing!!! They are very sharp and cut very nicely, and I love the sleek design, and they just fit your hands so perfectly, that you are sure to get the perfect cut for your nails. They don&#x27;t slip from your hands like lower quality clippers do.  I highly recommend these, and maybe you too can stop wondering if there is a nail clipper monster in your house too!&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> I bought these nailclippers to replace an old one that was wearing out after decades of use.  I really only use the smaller one of this set.  It works fine for both toenails and fingernails.  They seem very well-made.  It doesn&#x27;t have a file like my old one did and I would appreciate having that feature.</li>
            <li> Great pair of nail clippers Very sturdy in construction. I&#x27;m going to buy 3 more sets for my wife and kids. Hopefully they will stealing mine then.</li>
            <li> Everything, as advertised.  With severe arthritis, I was worried if I would be able to handle them well enough.  Flying colors!!!!  Great job!!!!</li>
            <li> I like quality items that do the job well. I needed to replace a pair of clippers lost on vacation. These arrived last week and after the first use I am happy with my decision. Sharp blade produced clean cut. Seems to be made of high quality material that will last.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp, well made, and solid. However, they aren&#x27;t curved enough for me and always end up cutting my skin when I get to the edge of the nail. They are also a little hard to get under the nail.</li>
            <li> Literally the last pair of clippers you will need to buy, unless you lose them.  These clippers are awesome, no more struggling with flimsy clippers that struggle to work on toe nails.</li>
            <li> I thought was silly to spend so much for a nail clipper when I get them for a $1 at a department store but no. This is worth it so much. To finally have clippers that doesn&#x27;t wreck my nails each time I use them, that actually cut my nails without splintering/cracking my nails, and most importantly, a nail clipper that doesn&#x27;t fall apart in my hands - which has happened twice with cheap clippers and was the reason I finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like these. They work perfectly, they look nice, and I would totally buy again but I have a feeling that I finally won&#x27;t need to buy another nail clipper for a long time.</li>
            <li> Really nice fingernail clippers, very pleased with purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Lucky find! These clippers are sturdy and provide a precise cut. Nice design with the built in file.</li>
            <li> Sharp, sturdy and all around excellent!</li>
            <li> Good set &#x3D; good price</li>
            <li> they work well and are compact</li>
            <li> These are high quality clippers.  Sharp and solidly built.  Tough stainless steel. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, but I miss the little under-nail cleaner thing most clippers have.</li>
            <li> choppy, uneven cuts. Would have returned but missed the cut-off</li>
            <li> Quality nail trimmers. Nice design. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!! Best-ever clippers. Where have these been all my life? Tried them out and they seem to have thin, very sharp edges that just snip through the nail without much pressure. They are not at all like the drugstore brands. I would liken these to flying first class rather than coach. Must have item.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok...not as awesome as I thought they would be but definitely an improvement over the $2 nail clippers.</li>
            <li> In my house, nail clippers are one of those essential tools that always seems to run away and hide when you need it the most.  I feel like I need to stock pairs all over the house to make sure there will be one handy, so I was really happy to be able to order this Brio set through a promotion in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.  Having used lots of different nail clippers over the years, I can say with confidence that these are top quality.  Most importantly, the cutting surface is sharp and even - it does a great job of trimming and shaping my nails with minimal force and without leaving behind jagged edges.  I love that there are built in nail files underneath the handle of both clippers.  If you look at my photos, that blue oval is the nail file!  It is a very fine grain file, nice for polishing edges and quickly taking care of a rough spot here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the feature on these that really sets them apart from my other nail clippers, though is the shape and design of the handle (the portion that you push down in order to operate the clippers).  I hardly noticed at first that the end tip of this handle is slightly bent upwards with an oval shaped hole  - it seems like a very minor detail.  Once I tried the clippers, though, I realized how great this design is.  The bend and hole provides a specific spot to rest my fingers while I am using them.  I find that this makes them extra comfortable to use, and also ensures that my fingers are placed close to the end, where I’m going to get the best cutting motion by pushing down.  Sometimes when I’m in a hurry with my other clippers, I end up putting my fingers closer to the cutting portion, and then when I push down it isn’t nearly as effective.  With these Brio clippers, I know that I’ll have my fingers positioned correctly every time to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Durable and sharp. Satisfied</li>
            <li> High quality item, has worked nicely thus far. Unique air-cooled chassis that won&#x27;t overheat when clipping at high speeds.</li>
            <li> These work well &amp; are better then the old cheap ones.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned/used!!!</li>
            <li> Quality construction but leaves rough edges on my daughters fingernails.</li>
            <li> Well-made clippers, and extremely sharp as advertised. The nail file under the rotating lever is a nice touch. I&#x27;m ordering an extra pair to keep in my car for nail emergencies.</li>
            <li> My family is always losing nail clippers all the time. When I seen these I opted for them right away. These are very solid and not cheaply made at all they are made out of very durable stainless steel to last a lifetime. They have an easy grip, lever, and an nail file built right in for easy nail care. The nail file part, has a blue protectve covering that needs to be peeled off before use. These clippers provide a nice clean cut with support precision from  quality made blades. I would highly recommend these nail clippers to anyone looking for a great quality set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at a discounted price, however, all thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
