            <li>Good value!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been working beautifully from day one.</li>

            <li>Great Mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on very nicely too.</li>
            <li>So, I was happy to see I could get my favorite mascara of Avon&#x27;s through Amazon!  </li>
            <li>This is good mascara.</li>
            <li>with one or two light coats of this, I feel like it is close to perfect.  </li>
            <li>Also does a good job of not clumping your eyelashes all together.</li>
            <li>Never clumps, good price.</li>
            <li>but the reviews led me to believe this stuff was exceptional</li>
            <li>Glad others have had good luck, but I can&#x27;t see how this stuff would be good for anything but goopy halloween eyes.</li>

            <li>This stays put all day and does not smudge, but doesn&#x27;t gunk up my lashes like most waterproof mascaras.</li>
            <li>It takes some scrubbing and maybe losing an eyelash or two in the process. :)</li>
            <li>Love it better than store bought brands that cost twice the money</li>
            <li>I have used cheaper mascara that worked much better than this Avon.  </li>
            <li>and I sure don&#x27;t want to miss out if they stop selling it</li>

            <li>br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t do anything special like make lashes look longer or thicker.</li>
            <li>Why is it I go by good reviews, and what I end up with seems like a completely different product.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can wash it off with gentle face cleaner instead of makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, and sent quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Wash-off waterproof is exactly what it sounds like!</li>
            <li>So glad I rediscovered this old favourite.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara better than any other brand of ever tried.</li>
            <li>Comes right off in a steamy shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive, so I need something that removes easily without using a &amp;#34;remover.&amp;#34;  For a while, l could not find it in the Avon books, so ordered it online.  </li>
            <li>The product goes on sparingly so you can build exactly the right amount of lash.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with soap and does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims...  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I cleaned an old brush from another brand and as soon as I apply I immediately brush it out with the clean brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use them, but Mary Kay cosmetics seems to get a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all dry and brittle, nor does it end up on my top lid.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I really should have insisted on a refund.</li>
            <li>This seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>Expected better.</li>
            <li>Really water resistant and really washable with just soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Avon.</li>
            <li>Today is my first day to use this new mascara .</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, and comes off easily, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years, and have tried many other brands, none can compare.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to mascara!  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clump and really makes your lashes long and full</li>
            <li>I really think this was probably a very old product that should have been trashed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The other brands that are waterproof don&#x27;t wash off as easy.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t cried off, I wear contacts and it&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
            <li>For a while there, it was difficult to find through Avon, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you want full long lashes don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of brown mascara normally but</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and makes my lashes dark and</li>
            <li>The color is a nice black that doesn&#x27;t look flat.</li>
            <li>No clumps, very natural looking.</li>
            <li>But, unless it is on sale, I can usually find a better price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day &amp; little or no smudging &amp; comes off easily when I wash my face &amp; rub clear water with a cloth along the eyelash area or make up remover.</li>
            <li>Other waterproof mascaras can break off an eye lash or two as they seem harder to remove, I have use this since I was a young women &amp; I am now MUCH older..... and still love it.</li>
            <li>I removed one star because my eyes were watering today and the mascara flaked off under the bottom lashes and a little above the top lashes.  </li>
            <li>; for the rest of the day/weekend.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Amazon Prime, instead of directly from Avon, because I needed it sooner than Avon could get it to me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stay on my lashes nearly as well as the Avon product at fractions of the price.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive, which you would expect because the tube is not very big.  </li>
            <li>of easily with a basic makeup remover/ washes off with face wash...seems to come off in little pieces&lt;</li>
            <li>so I am going to order a few more and just hope they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>This is my new daily mascara.</li>
            <li>Always come back to it when tempted to try something new.</li>
            <li>Thick, but not goopy, comes off easy with makeup remover or soap and water.</li>
            <li>Super affordable, lightweight so you don&#x27;t feel like your lashes are really heavy</li>
            <li>So, I thought I would try the black mascara because the price is right</li>
            <li>I got a new tube but the product must have been old because it was dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly all of the mascara&#x27;s offered by AVON and this is the only one I will use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true to many reviews but at least it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>

            <li> For a while there, it was difficult to find through Avon, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you want full long lashes don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of brown mascara normally but</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and makes my lashes dark and</li>
            <li> The color is a nice black that doesn&#x27;t look flat.</li>
            <li> No clumps, very natural looking.</li>
            <li> But, unless it is on sale, I can usually find a better price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all day &amp; little or no smudging &amp; comes off easily when I wash my face &amp; rub clear water with a cloth along the eyelash area or make up remover.</li>
            <li> Other waterproof mascaras can break off an eye lash or two as they seem harder to remove, I have use this since I was a young women &amp; I am now MUCH older..... and still love it.</li>
            <li> I removed one star because my eyes were watering today and the mascara flaked off under the bottom lashes and a little above the top lashes.  </li>
            <li> ; for the rest of the day/weekend.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Amazon Prime, instead of directly from Avon, because I needed it sooner than Avon could get it to me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay on my lashes nearly as well as the Avon product at fractions of the price.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive, which you would expect because the tube is not very big.  </li>
            <li> of easily with a basic makeup remover/ washes off with face wash...seems to come off in little pieces&lt;</li>
            <li> so I am going to order a few more and just hope they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> This is my new daily mascara.</li>
            <li> Always come back to it when tempted to try something new.</li>
            <li> Thick, but not goopy, comes off easy with makeup remover or soap and water.</li>
            <li> Super affordable, lightweight so you don&#x27;t feel like your lashes are really heavy</li>
            <li> So, I thought I would try the black mascara because the price is right</li>
            <li> I got a new tube but the product must have been old because it was dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly all of the mascara&#x27;s offered by AVON and this is the only one I will use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true to many reviews but at least it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also adds very little to your own eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> and it stays on, though it may flake a bit - depends how long you&#x27;re in the water.</li>
            <li> I prefer waterproof mascaras since I get teary-eyed more often than I&#x27;d like to admit, but I hate the normal struggle of washing it off.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews saying how well it did not leave black circles under eyes, particularly from women who have that problem with other brands.</li>
            <li> It was just to dry to get on and did not give me any depth to my lashes.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t run and when I dry my face</li>
            <li> I use the black most often, but I am a little sad to see that is my only option.  </li>
            <li> I like the navy one as well, but Amazon only has the black.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long this is suppose to last</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes if you cry or get wet, and it washes off with face wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I was expected</li>
            <li> This mascara performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> ALL other mascaras smudge on my brow ridge because I have deep-set eyes.</li>
            <li> It would be nicer if it were applying a thicker coat, my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I did not return it since it was not worth the cost of the return.</li>
            <li> I can live with this small issue because today for the first time in ages no dark circles under my eyes ,usually by noon I look terrible.</li>
            <li> It does seem to take a little time to get it on your lashes</li>
            <li> It does come off with water,  but takes a little work and smears abit; I prefer to use an eye make up remover.  </li>
            <li> It left dark circled under my eyes, and was difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Does not easily smudge or run, like some wash-offs do.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to have enough time for it to dry even IF you can get it just on your lashes.</li>
            <li> But finally I realized it was mainly the brush that I hated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t smudge, by the end of the day I usually have a smudge underneath my bottom eyelashes...</li>
            <li> No more yanked out eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Dry, terrible - - total waste.  </li>
            <li> I hated this stuff when I first got it.</li>
            <li> There are no good reasons to ever stop using this mascara again.</li>
            <li> I moved from Florida to Colorado a year ago, and I&#x27;m shocked and saddened to learn that there are no Avon reps in the entire state of Colorado!  </li>
            <li> I tend to have watery eyes, so this is probably not a good choice for me after all.  </li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes hard and crunchy!</li>
            <li> Disappointed it was rather dry.</li>
            <li> It totally dried out within a couple months. :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> something was wrong with this batch.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It is just unfortunate that Avon is not carrying it now!</li>
            <li> and I is very uncomfortable!&#x27;&#x27;Would take 1 star off if I could.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this mascara.</li>
            <li> That was so stupid!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts and stays on pretty good.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Thick, but not goopy, comes off easy with makeup remover or soap and water. So far it hasn&#x27;t cried off, I wear contacts and it&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews saying how well it did not leave black circles under eyes, particularly from women who have that problem with other brands. It left dark circled under my eyes, and was difficult to remove.  I have no problem withthe seller, who shipped quickly; the price was also good.</li>
            <li> This is good mascara. Performs as expected. Does not easily smudge or run, like some wash-offs do. UPDATE: It totally dried out within a couple months. :(</li>
            <li> This is my new daily mascara. ALL other mascaras smudge on my brow ridge because I have deep-set eyes. This stays put all day and does not smudge, but doesn&#x27;t gunk up my lashes like most waterproof mascaras. Comes right off in a steamy shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very nicely too. No clumping at all. Probably not the best for someone looking for an ultra-thickening, false-eyelash look, but it layers very nicely without clumping so you could totally go to town with it.</li>
            <li> This is okay, but I&#x27;ve discovered it isn&#x27;t that easy to wash off. It takes some scrubbing and maybe losing an eyelash or two in the process. :)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara. It doesn&#x27;t get all dry and brittle, nor does it end up on my top lid. I have medium oily skin and that was always a problem with Maybelline Great Lash - Waterproof. The color is a nice black that doesn&#x27;t look flat. I recommended this to my sister.</li>
            <li> This stuff is runny and clumpy.  It is impossible to have enough time for it to dry even IF you can get it just on your lashes. Why is it I go by good reviews, and what I end up with seems like a completely different product.  Glad others have had good luck, but I can&#x27;t see how this stuff would be good for anything but goopy halloween eyes.</li>
            <li> If you want full long lashes don&#x27;t buy this. Not impressed!</li>
            <li> rubs off- disappears-</li>
            <li> Wish they still made Brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for my daughter - she&#x27;s a competitive dancer - and she needed something that stayed on all day (no flaking, no smearing), but came off easily. This was a 2-pack when I bought it: one for me, one for her. She&#x27;s only 8; but she likes that she can wash it off, and not have &amp;#34;racoon eyes&amp;#34; for the rest of the day/weekend.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Amazon Prime, instead of directly from Avon, because I needed it sooner than Avon could get it to me.</li>
            <li> No clumps, very natural looking. Bonus: no smudge or smear, and...no pick ax needed to remove, just soap and water. No more yanked out eyelashes! So glad I rediscovered this old favourite.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to mascara!  I really love it and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or irritate my eyes!  I am really pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I prefer my Clinique mascara since it glides on more smoothly, but the price was right on the Avon version.</li>
            <li> This mascara washes off fairly easily with just soap and water.  It would be nicer if it were applying a thicker coat, my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, is inexpensive, and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Love it better than store bought brands that cost twice the money</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, and have tried many other brands, none can compare. You don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes if you cry or get wet, and it washes off with face wash. The other brands that are waterproof don&#x27;t wash off as easy.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for probably 15 years. At one point, I got delusional and thought I was fancy enough for Lancôme mascara at $30 a tube. That was so stupid! It didn&#x27;t stay on my lashes nearly as well as the Avon product at fractions of the price. I prefer waterproof mascaras since I get teary-eyed more often than I&#x27;d like to admit, but I hate the normal struggle of washing it off. Wash-off waterproof is exactly what it sounds like! There are no good reasons to ever stop using this mascara again.</li>
            <li> Dry, terrible - - total waste.  I really think this was probably a very old product that should have been trashed.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, and comes off easily, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this mascara. I got a new tube but the product must have been old because it was dry. I could not get any on my lashes. I would never recommend it. I did not return it since it was not worth the cost of the return. I have used cheaper mascara that worked much better than this Avon.  Either this was out dated or something was wrong with this batch. It was just to dry to get on and did not give me any depth to my lashes. I really should have insisted on a refund. Would not buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Today is my first day to use this new mascara . It does seem to take a little time to get it on your lashes it just doesn&#x27;t show up , you have to build it up and keep going over your lashes. I can live with this small issue because today for the first time in ages no dark circles under my eyes ,usually by noon I look terrible. I&#x27;ve already ordered another to keep in my purse and I sure don&#x27;t want to miss out if they stop selling it so I am going to order a few more and just hope they don&#x27;t dry out. All this time I thought it was my eye liner since I wasn&#x27;t putting mascara on my bottom lashes. I guess it just smears or something from my top lashes. I am and will reorder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for an every day use. And I like it (especially on raining days!). It&#x27;s like I was expected</li>
            <li> Yuck! This gets all over my lids when applying! After it dries, it also flakes. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true to many reviews but at least it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. I&#x27;ll stick with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t flake or come off, but when you wash your face with any cleanser or soap,  it melts away.  Great for contact lense wearers!</li>
            <li> Good value!  It does the job.</li>
            <li> This is awesome mascara. I have tried tons of mascara and this is a top favorite of mine. Super affordable, lightweight so you don&#x27;t feel like your lashes are really heavy it lasts all day doesn&#x27;t clump and really makes your lashes long and full</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes hard and crunchy!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It leaves no blank marks under your eyes and does not come off until you wash it off.  The idea that I don&#x27;t have to go searching for an Avon salesperson makes it even better!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great wash off but waterproof mascara. It stays on all day &amp; little or no smudging &amp; comes off easily when I wash my face &amp; rub clear water with a cloth along the eyelash area or make up remover. Other waterproof mascaras can break off an eye lash or two as they seem harder to remove, I have use this since I was a young women &amp; I am now MUCH older..... and still love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, have been using this product for years. It is just unfortunate that Avon is not carrying it now!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite mascara out of any I have ever tried!  I always by waterproof mascara.  This one is great because if I get it on my hands it comes right off with soap and water.  Now I am just hoping that it is never discontinued!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t smudge, by the end of the day I usually have a smudge underneath my bottom eyelashes...sooo annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*No smudge at end of day&lt;br /&gt;*comes of easily with a basic makeup remover/ washes off with face wash...seems to come off in little pieces&lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t do anything special like make lashes look longer or thicker. But it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I&#x27;m probably gonna use it mostly as a bottom lash mascara along side something that makes my top lashes look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used, period, and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I hated this stuff when I first got it. I thought I would just throw it away. But finally I realized it was mainly the brush that I hated. It would basically just create 4-5 giant globs of lashes all stuck together! I cleaned an old brush from another brand and as soon as I apply I immediately brush it out with the clean brush. This seems to work really well. It is waterproof, I&#x27;ve never had problems with it running but the reviews led me to believe this stuff was exceptional and it&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of mascara, and by far, Avon&#x27;s wash-off waterproof mascara is my favorite!  I moved from Florida to Colorado a year ago, and I&#x27;m shocked and saddened to learn that there are no Avon reps in the entire state of Colorado!  Only Mary Kay, and those products are more expensive.  So, I was happy to see I could get my favorite mascara of Avon&#x27;s through Amazon!  I use the black most often, but I am a little sad to see that is my only option.  I know they also have brown and navy colors for that mascara, too.  I like the navy one as well, but Amazon only has the black.  I&#x27;ll take it, though!</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive, so I need something that removes easily without using a &amp;#34;remover.&amp;#34;  For a while, l could not find it in the Avon books, so ordered it online.  Price is about the same.</li>
            <li> I did not like this. Made my lashes brittle and spikey.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Great Mascara.  Has not yet flaked off or worn off under my eyes (huge deal for me).  I am a fan of brown mascara normally but with one or two light coats of this, I feel like it is close to perfect.  Washes off easily with soap and does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run or make your lashes sticky when you cry! Washes off with regular cleanser.  Glad I found this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  It does exactly what it claims...  It washes off easily without smudging on my face while I&#x27;m wearing it.  It goes on easily and makes my lashes dark and the length I prefer. For a while there, it was difficult to find through Avon, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Avon seems to be releasing it again.  But, unless it is on sale, I can usually find a better price on Amazon.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> No smudge, no clump, waterproof indeed yet washes off when I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about 3 months now. Not sure how long this is suppose to last but it&#x27;s been working beautifully from day one. I will definitely be purchasing this again when needed.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead 5 because the brush doesn&#x27;t work too well but the mascara does not come off during the day but comes off easily with mascara remover&lt;br /&gt;Adding some more review for this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Does not last all day and I find it falls into my eyes after the end of the day and I is very uncomfortable!&#x27;&#x27;Would take 1 star off if I could.</li>
            <li> This mascara performs as expected.  It is waterproof and washes off easily with soap and water.  Unfortunately, it also adds very little to your own eye lashes.  Even so, I will continue to buy this product because it removes with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I only tried it twice and I like it - looks clean and no clump</li>
            <li> Expected better. Disappointed it was rather dry.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I have been using it for many years.  It stays on all day and is easy to wash-off at night.</li>
            <li> Love the mascara...my favorite!!!  And quick shipping!  :  )</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I&#x27;ve used it for years, tried others and I keep coming back.</li>
            <li> Works well, comes off easy, without scrubbing eyelashes off. Also does a good job of not clumping your eyelashes all together.</li>
            <li> I have bought this again and again and again for years.  A contact lense wearer.  I&#x27;ve had some waterproof mascaras that WON&amp;#34;t come off unless you pull your eye lashes out!  This is not like that.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, and sent quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly all of the mascara&#x27;s offered by AVON and this is the only one I will use.  I don&#x27;t like big, bulky brushes and this one is smaller.  I have used this for years, and despite trying several others, I always come back to it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara better than any other brand of ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and this mascara gives me the cover I like without any irritation.  I love that I can wash it off with gentle face cleaner instead of makeup remover.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara, good coverage and waterproof</li>
            <li> The only mascara i use. Always come back to it when tempted to try something new. Really water resistant and really washable with just soap and water.  Never clumps, good price. Thanks Avon. Please never discontinue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years, based on ratings from ivillage. It goes on smooth and lasts all day, with no \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;.  It does come off with water,  but takes a little work and smears abit; I prefer to use an eye make up remover.  I do use it when going into a pool if I don&#x27;t have water proof mascara with me. and it doesn&#x27;t run and when I dry my face I pat instead of rub and it stays on, though it may flake a bit - depends how long you&#x27;re in the water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use them, but Mary Kay cosmetics seems to get a lot of good reviews. So, I thought I would try the black mascara because the price is right and it came with Prime shipping. I love it! I love the wand, it does not cake like a lot of cheap mascaras do. The product goes on sparingly so you can build exactly the right amount of lash. It has a very easy to grip handle, too. I like the container. I am happy with it!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a non-clumping waterproof mascara that goes on easily and covers well.  It was very inexpensive, which you would expect because the tube is not very big.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/31/13:  I removed one star because my eyes were watering today and the mascara flaked off under the bottom lashes and a little above the top lashes.  I tend to have watery eyes, so this is probably not a good choice for me after all.  If you have dry eyes, it should be a perfect fit.  I like everything else about the mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my second buy of this mascara. I love it. Holds up well in the shower, but comes off if i wash off with cloth. Thanks a lot! Will be coming back.</li>
