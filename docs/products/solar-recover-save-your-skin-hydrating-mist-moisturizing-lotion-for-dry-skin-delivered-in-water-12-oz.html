            <li>So excited!!!</li>
            <li>Ever since i was introduced to this by a friend who&#x27;s got fair skin like me, it&#x27;s been a necessity each summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely fair, and in spite of tons of sunscreen I got a severe burn while river rafting.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it would work, but it felt good.</li>
            <li>(it worked excellently releiving the burn, and it healed better and faster than I&#x27;ve ever experienced), but I&#x27;ve been using it for an allover body spritz for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>Been looking for a good sunburn relief spray since Avon stopped making theirs.</li>
            <li>or if it helps but feels good when sprayed on.</li>
            <li>Smells good and cools the skin.</li>
            <li>Its scent is good.</li>
            <li>THis is a great product, it hydrates the skin, is easy to apply and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on after a shower or even just before bed, it also smells great :)</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing and seems to soothe.</li>
            <li>Also to be used as a face toner; not at all greasy yet very refreshing.</li>
            <li>it helps you from peeling and it smells very refreshing</li>
            <li>Excellent product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>smells like lovely lavender!</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>safe for kids.</li>
            <li>I love this product, been using it for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>She had bought it in Destin, FL at a Speciality store and paid a lot more than the Amazon Price.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and how it feels.</li>
            <li>Love this product-I always Solar Recover after I come in from the pool or lake.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product that I use after getting some sun.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;).</li>
            <li>but I love it now.</li>
            <li>That was many years ago, and we still use this today&lt;</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s all natural and a good price!</li>
            <li>Love it, feels great, refreshing and leaves skin soft and hydrated after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li>It also left a cooling tingle that I found very pleasant.</li>
            <li>This product really does soothe your skin if you are burned, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>During a trip to Panama City Beach, FL this spring my fair Michigan skin got pretty sunburned.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and really works!</li>
            <li>even if you don&#x27;t use this for sunburn, it is just so refreshing for your skin and love that it dries so quickly with no residue!</li>
            <li>The ease of use in spraying is clutch, considering touching my own skin to rub in aloe is like rubbing a fresh bruise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important factors to me in any product of this type</li>
            <li>It always takes the red out of the burn faster and it&#x27;s incredibly soothing.</li>
            <li>I discovered this light refreshing spray while combing the shops in Passe Grille, Florida.</li>
            <li>It turned my burn into a tan &amp; stopped me from peeling which is extremely unusual for my fair skin type.</li>
            <li>Love this product and goes down as one of the best purchases I have ever made!</li>
            <li>Smells very nice and natural but didn&#x27;t do the wonders for my skin and sunburn that I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this really is an incredibly product!</li>
            <li>burns easily</li>
            <li>/breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly &amp; sprayed it on immediately.</li>
            <li>I had a severe sunburn and this helped me heal very quickly without scarring.  </li>
            <li>This spray has made winter easy to deal with the dryness</li>
            <li>easily bring taken care of by</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, not at all sticky and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine to me, almost like an apple sauce.  </li>
            <li>Now, I use this for a couple days after sun exposure or if I feel any itching, and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>I really cannot explain how much I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of the best kept secret for after-sun.  </li>
            <li>Amazon had great price &amp; arrived next day using prime membership!</li>
            <li>It instantly cooled and relieved my skin...and its great even if you don&#x27;t have a sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works as described to reduce peeling for sunburn, but works great as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is really great stuff especially for living in the desert.</li>
            <li>No aloe available.</li>
            <li>It smelled great and left my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I am now home and am using this as my daily moisturizer my skin feels great</li>
            <li>it sprays on lightly and there is no rubbing involved.</li>
            <li>This is so great to use for getting to your back.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to us a few years ago as the perfect answer to sunburn relief</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought two - one for myself and one for my sister.  </li>
            <li>Great product for basic skin care.</li>
            <li>feels so good on my skin, sunburn/red skin clear  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good maintenance moisturizer in the summer, but not a heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
            <li>normal use of suncreen during the day and save your skin after showering.&lt;br /&gt;it works great for too much sun and decreases redness.  </li>
            <li>I did like that it was a spray bottle though as it makes application quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I am an olive skinned person that tans easily and quickly and don&#x27;t burn often.  </li>
            <li>Best product I use on a daily basis and cannot live without this stuff anymore.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product based on claims and reviews</li>
            <li>This spray is WORTH the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see it now on line</li>
            <li>I originally found this about 5 years ago on the Jersey shore and have used it ever since.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth the bargain !</li>
            <li>This kind of burn needs to stay as moist as possible and between the ease of use and efficacy, I&#x27;ve been able to achieve that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing, smells incredible and provides so much hydration for your skin that you won&#x27;t peel if you use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>Such a pleasant scent when applied on my face.</li>
            <li>and I love using it as a daily moisturizer because its so quick to spray on and smells nice without being over powering.</li>
            <li>and he was right!  </li>
            <li>they ask for the blue bottle of smell good stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soothing and cool</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for post-sun-exposure and have noticed it really helps the redness fade and prevents peeling.</li>
            <li>Anytime I&#x27;m out in the sun much, which I love to be</li>
            <li>If it were just a touch more it would be to much though.</li>
            <li>Smells medicated but not a bad odor.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the place we were staying had Save Your Skin stowed in its medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>After vacation I was super burnt.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, but we didn&#x27;t notice anything particularly hydrating about it.  </li>
            <li>used this after a mild burn in the sun.</li>
            <li>Tremendous Summertime product and it works to alleviate the pain of sunburn.</li>
            <li>I also started using it after my dermatologist  did PDT (blue light therapy) for my acne, which leaves your skin really red afterward and it was incredible.</li>
            <li>in its favor, it is not greasy and the smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>If you keep it in the refrigerator and spray on your face and body, you feel cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>And in dry environments, it just feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>I originally got my first bottle from a tanning salon 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>This was the first year in my life that I didn&#x27;t peal!</li>
            <li>Really gives you relief!!</li>
            <li>Items purchased were exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Smells great and does a good job of cooling down hot skin after a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have bought this time and time again, I am a red head with blue eyes and very fair skin-</li>
            <li>I have not yet woken up with a tan like the creator states, however I rarely tan.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>certainly worth the wait for the shipping</li>
            <li>This spray is very refreshing to spray on your skin after a long day in the sun!</li>
            <li>I spray it on right after showering.</li>
            <li>I sprayed some on and experienced quick cooling and relief; my skin was good as new in a few days, with minimal peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the magic ingredient is, perhaps the lavender, but it simply works great.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for this product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting light and refreshing based on other customer reviews.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at a surf shop the day after I got &amp;#34;torched&amp;#34; at the beach.  </li>
            <li>I use this every night and my skin thanks me for it!</li>
            <li>I burnt to a crisp day 1 on a cruise in the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li>i feel that hot feeling you do when you are burnt.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I know I will be ordering more of these blue bottles soon!</li>
            <li>it kept our skin healthy during a recent weekend sail to ocracoke and no one peeled.  </li>
            <li>I love Solar Recover, I found it several years ago when I was at the beach in Florida.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I could tell because a part of my skin that I missed was a lot more red than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Try sticking it in the fridge and then spray it on your sunburn!</li>
            <li>It works really well!  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves Solar Recover!</li>
            <li>Every year when I went back to the beach I had to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave without my supply for the year.</li>
            <li>First came across it in a surf shop on Coronado Island when visiting the Hotel Del and the kiddos got sunburned at the beach.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this while on vacation in Glen Arbor, MI.  </li>
            <li>My daughter gave me my first bottle after I tried hers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily the magic potion it claims to be</li>
            <li>My whole family got burned and this stuff helped cool off the burn as well as maintain our tan without too much peeling.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on our dogs after swimming and to help prevent hot spots</li>
            <li>I also used this on my finger when I toughed a hot pan</li>
            <li>This stuff really works on sunburns!  </li>
            <li>my whole life!</li>
            <li>(dare I say &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My first review was a one star and that it was stinky.</li>
            <li>First time I ever used this product was when I got burnt to a crisp in Nagshead.</li>
            <li>stuff is so good that I use it as an everyday toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it smells good and it provides a little bit of temporary relief.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and have not used it long enough to say much more.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the miracle spray I was lead to believe by other users, but it feels and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting the  fruity smell that most after sun products have, but if the product worked I could easily get past the smell.  </li>
            <li>This product makes it easy to quickly spray yourself down in the morning or after a shower to feel fresh and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best product to use when you get a little too much sun!</li>
            <li>I recently was at the beach in Florida with my sisters and they tried the product and loved it, so much they bought some at a local store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has kind of an odd earthy smell that makes me want to shower again just to wash it off.  </li>
            <li>Solar Recovery absorbs into the skin rather quickly and leaves skin with a soft hydrated feeling..not</li>
            <li>also love in a Minnesota, which has a really dry winter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a cream or lotion to the mist, with misting there is a certain amount of product loss.</li>
            <li>It did nothing to stop my skin from peeling and it certainly did not make my skin tan.</li>
            <li>Also I used it on my nephew and he complained about the herbal smell which is very strong!</li>
            <li>Makes old skin feel soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>So gentle that even if it gets in my eyes it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>Now anytime any of  our friends get too much sun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks guys.</li>
            <li>I had gotten too much sun even using sunscreen, I used this product and could not believe the results.  </li>
            <li>recently enlisted for Prime (free shipping) on Amazon, so I ordered a bottle and received it in two days.  </li>
            <li>I even used to use real aloe from the plant</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>This product REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was really expecting some moisture properties in this, not even close.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really does help after a day of too much sun.</li>
            <li>Besides the smell of the product which I really didn&#x27;t care for, I couldn&#x27;t tell that it moisturized at all.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well without chemicals...</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works when you&#x27;re sun-burned.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Solar Recover!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but if your really really burned you will still peel.</li>
            <li>My husband got too much Sun</li>
            <li>I am dutch decent, which means I am white and burn easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even nice to use after showers everyday.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about &amp;#34;Solar Recover.&amp;#34;  I first bought a bottle when vacationing down in Pensacola, FL.  </li>
            <li>i have really dry and sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t moisture skin at all, but it&#x27;s super fresh and smells as heaven, fresh minty, greeny, lavendery odor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has an amazing smell and will set my makeup and tame frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for other people</li>
            <li>The other plus is that you can use it as many times as you want.</li>
            <li>the scent is refreshing and the mist is extremely healing.</li>
            <li>We get stung several timesin a season, and never get too excited because we have this product on the trucks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a light treatment mist to allow the essential oils to penetrate and bring down inflammation.</li>
            <li>Even if your skin is not really burned but you&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot, it is very refreshing and adds moisture back in to your skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely pale skin and burn very easily.</li>
            <li>will now keep a bottle of this in my kitchen and send a bottle to school with my college kid to keep near the first aid kit.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cool my skin off, it didn&#x27;t moisturizer or heal it, and it definitely didn&#x27;t keep me from peeling.  </li>
            <li>I got too much sun in our first day in Hawaii and got a burn which usually then gets a heat rash with more sun...</li>
            <li>The only reason I took off 1 star is that while the burns faded, my skin still had that &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; feeling, but not nearly as bad.</li>
            <li>I got burnt down in the florida keys, and after spraying this all over me my sunburn was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Smells decent, it is herbal but not pungent or stinky.</li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday in the summer to keep my skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as you sunburn and skin relief for the summer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff if you are in the sun at all.</li>
            <li>it was amazing in recovering my burnt skin, turning that awful red to tan, softening my skin and best of all I never peeled!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and really helped with healing sunburned skin.</li>
            <li>I sprayed this on every 30 minutes until I went to bed, then immediately when I woke up, and a few more times before heading out for the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hugely addictive, skin is fresh like after a sea breeze.</li>
            <li>Spray it on frequently throughout the day, and especially when you get out of the shower an you will get quick relief from the sunburn you got at the beach.</li>
            <li>so I can cool off after the dry desert air.  </li>
            <li>I live in &amp; also use a spray on my face-pre moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I live in the Northwest.</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I drive a convertible and live in the sun.</li>
            <li>Burnt my feet to a crisp last summer on an impromptu walk on the boardwalk.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much daily.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a little strong</li>
            <li>I cant say enough positive about this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale and burning easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff was a huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care what anyone says about natural remedies, this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I misted myself frequently, maybe every 5-10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I figured what the heck, the aloe wasn&#x27;t doing its job fast enough</li>
            <li>The all natural ingredients alleviate the burning sensation almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t completely cure the burn overnight, it took the pain away and by two days after my burn was gone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just an old bottle</li>
            <li>I only received it toward the tail end of the burn, but it&#x27;s really helped with some of the pain and itching.</li>
            <li>The places it was sprayed that were very burned were definitely healing.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>its completely bogus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my 1 year old and there were no side effects.</li>
            <li>Its all natural and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li>It both helps with the heat and pain of the sunburn but also offers moisturizing relief.  </li>
            <li>It totally relieves sun burn sting as well as just really hydrating your skin after days in the sun.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly even if not recovering from too much sun exposure.</li>
            <li>It is natural too.</li>
            <li>Was really looking for something different.</li>
            <li>One of the best things you&#x27;ll notice about this product and the whole Solar Recover product line is that there are absolutely zero bad ingredients!!</li>
            <li>My more minor sunburns on my legs had disappeared completely without any trace, just a slight tan.</li>
            <li>It worked amazing to bring down the swelling, redness, and pain in less than 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I used this product a couple times a day or when I felt hot or dry.</li>
            <li>SInce we don&#x27;t use it much in the winter, we really know warmer months are here when we start to smell the Solar Recover on each other (wife and I)!!</li>
            <li>I used it regularly and had to buy a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i instead bought a dry almond oil spray, which is VERY hydrating</li>
            <li>we thought it was worth a try, but we tossed it in favor off what we were using previously.  </li>
            <li>The blisters stopped forming, went away, and I barely peeled -</li>
            <li>The places it was sprayed that weren&#x27;t EXTRA CRISPY were so soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Taste fresh, the summer after the trouble will not burn.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the damage was already done so I wasn&#x27;t able to test it on a brand new burn</li>
            <li>I spent the day on the beach without reapplying any sunscreen, and needless to say I looked like a bright red lobster!</li>
            <li>The shop owner sprayed her down very well, it removed a lot of the heat immediately.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to help with some serious sunburn while I was on vacation.  </li>
            <li>I think for someone who is not as sensitive to the sun and so dry skinned</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how or why it works, but I used to peel every time i got a little too much sun.</li>
            <li>I do still peel after a couple of weeks if it&#x27;s a bad sunburn but for the most part I really like it.</li>
            <li>It soothes the sting of a bad burn away and it  is chemical free so it does not irritate all ready sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, I still buy it in the winter to mist on my face for hydration after being in the cold wind and it works very well as just an all-purpose light moisturizer.</li>

            <li> So excited!!!</li>
            <li> Ever since i was introduced to this by a friend who&#x27;s got fair skin like me, it&#x27;s been a necessity each summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair, and in spite of tons of sunscreen I got a severe burn while river rafting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if it would work, but it felt good.</li>
            <li> (it worked excellently releiving the burn, and it healed better and faster than I&#x27;ve ever experienced), but I&#x27;ve been using it for an allover body spritz for more than a year.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for a good sunburn relief spray since Avon stopped making theirs.</li>
            <li> or if it helps but feels good when sprayed on.</li>
            <li> Smells good and cools the skin.</li>
            <li> Its scent is good.</li>
            <li> THis is a great product, it hydrates the skin, is easy to apply and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Love love love!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on after a shower or even just before bed, it also smells great :)</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and seems to soothe.</li>
            <li> Also to be used as a face toner; not at all greasy yet very refreshing.</li>
            <li> it helps you from peeling and it smells very refreshing</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> It felt cool, my skin never peeled, and it has a wonderful fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> so you can easily mist wherever!  </li>
            <li> I add my own lemon or grapefruit essential oil for a delicious scented after bath spray.  </li>
            <li> Bought my first bottle after I read a great review in a mag</li>
            <li> Love it and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> It is not a spray moisturizer, it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s service is very thoughtful, have email</li>

            <li> It really moisturizes the skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> When I went online to purchase more on the website, the shipping and handling cost more than the product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>

            <li> So glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> i love this product...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to use after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> safe for kids.</li>
            <li> I love this product, been using it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> She had bought it in Destin, FL at a Speciality store and paid a lot more than the Amazon Price.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and how it feels.</li>
            <li> Love this product-I always Solar Recover after I come in from the pool or lake.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product that I use after getting some sun.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> but I love it now.</li>
            <li> That was many years ago, and we still use this today&lt;</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s all natural and a good price!</li>
            <li> Love it, feels great, refreshing and leaves skin soft and hydrated after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li> It also left a cooling tingle that I found very pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product really does soothe your skin if you are burned, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> During a trip to Panama City Beach, FL this spring my fair Michigan skin got pretty sunburned.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and really works!</li>
            <li> even if you don&#x27;t use this for sunburn, it is just so refreshing for your skin and love that it dries so quickly with no residue!</li>
            <li> The ease of use in spraying is clutch, considering touching my own skin to rub in aloe is like rubbing a fresh bruise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important factors to me in any product of this type</li>
            <li> It always takes the red out of the burn faster and it&#x27;s incredibly soothing.</li>
            <li> I discovered this light refreshing spray while combing the shops in Passe Grille, Florida.</li>
            <li> It turned my burn into a tan &amp; stopped me from peeling which is extremely unusual for my fair skin type.</li>
            <li> Love this product and goes down as one of the best purchases I have ever made!</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and natural but didn&#x27;t do the wonders for my skin and sunburn that I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this really is an incredibly product!</li>
            <li> burns easily</li>
            <li> /breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly &amp; sprayed it on immediately.</li>
            <li> I had a severe sunburn and this helped me heal very quickly without scarring.  </li>
            <li> This spray has made winter easy to deal with the dryness</li>
            <li> easily bring taken care of by</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, not at all sticky and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine to me, almost like an apple sauce.  </li>
            <li> Now, I use this for a couple days after sun exposure or if I feel any itching, and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> I really cannot explain how much I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of the best kept secret for after-sun.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had great price &amp; arrived next day using prime membership!</li>
            <li> It instantly cooled and relieved my skin...and its great even if you don&#x27;t have a sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works as described to reduce peeling for sunburn, but works great as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff especially for living in the desert.</li>
            <li> No aloe available.</li>
            <li> It smelled great and left my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I am now home and am using this as my daily moisturizer my skin feels great</li>
            <li> it sprays on lightly and there is no rubbing involved.</li>
            <li> This is so great to use for getting to your back.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to us a few years ago as the perfect answer to sunburn relief</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought two - one for myself and one for my sister.  </li>
            <li> Great product for basic skin care.</li>
            <li> feels so good on my skin, sunburn/red skin clear  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good maintenance moisturizer in the summer, but not a heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
            <li> normal use of suncreen during the day and save your skin after showering.&lt;br /&gt;it works great for too much sun and decreases redness.  </li>
            <li> I did like that it was a spray bottle though as it makes application quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I am an olive skinned person that tans easily and quickly and don&#x27;t burn often.  </li>
            <li> Best product I use on a daily basis and cannot live without this stuff anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product based on claims and reviews</li>
            <li> This spray is WORTH the money!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see it now on line</li>
            <li> I originally found this about 5 years ago on the Jersey shore and have used it ever since.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth the bargain !</li>
            <li> This kind of burn needs to stay as moist as possible and between the ease of use and efficacy, I&#x27;ve been able to achieve that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing, smells incredible and provides so much hydration for your skin that you won&#x27;t peel if you use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> Such a pleasant scent when applied on my face.</li>
            <li> and I love using it as a daily moisturizer because its so quick to spray on and smells nice without being over powering.</li>
            <li> and he was right!  </li>
            <li> they ask for the blue bottle of smell good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soothing and cool</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for post-sun-exposure and have noticed it really helps the redness fade and prevents peeling.</li>
            <li> Anytime I&#x27;m out in the sun much, which I love to be</li>
            <li> If it were just a touch more it would be to much though.</li>
            <li> Smells medicated but not a bad odor.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the place we were staying had Save Your Skin stowed in its medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> After vacation I was super burnt.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but we didn&#x27;t notice anything particularly hydrating about it.  </li>
            <li> used this after a mild burn in the sun.</li>
            <li> Tremendous Summertime product and it works to alleviate the pain of sunburn.</li>
            <li> I also started using it after my dermatologist  did PDT (blue light therapy) for my acne, which leaves your skin really red afterward and it was incredible.</li>
            <li> in its favor, it is not greasy and the smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> If you keep it in the refrigerator and spray on your face and body, you feel cool and fresh.</li>
            <li> And in dry environments, it just feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> I originally got my first bottle from a tanning salon 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> This was the first year in my life that I didn&#x27;t peal!</li>
            <li> Really gives you relief!!</li>
            <li> Items purchased were exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Smells great and does a good job of cooling down hot skin after a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have bought this time and time again, I am a red head with blue eyes and very fair skin-</li>
            <li> I have not yet woken up with a tan like the creator states, however I rarely tan.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> certainly worth the wait for the shipping</li>
            <li> This spray is very refreshing to spray on your skin after a long day in the sun!</li>
            <li> I spray it on right after showering.</li>
            <li> I sprayed some on and experienced quick cooling and relief; my skin was good as new in a few days, with minimal peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the magic ingredient is, perhaps the lavender, but it simply works great.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for this product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting light and refreshing based on other customer reviews.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at a surf shop the day after I got &amp;#34;torched&amp;#34; at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I use this every night and my skin thanks me for it!</li>
            <li> I burnt to a crisp day 1 on a cruise in the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li> i feel that hot feeling you do when you are burnt.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I know I will be ordering more of these blue bottles soon!</li>
            <li> it kept our skin healthy during a recent weekend sail to ocracoke and no one peeled.  </li>
            <li> I love Solar Recover, I found it several years ago when I was at the beach in Florida.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I could tell because a part of my skin that I missed was a lot more red than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Try sticking it in the fridge and then spray it on your sunburn!</li>
            <li> It works really well!  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves Solar Recover!</li>
            <li> Every year when I went back to the beach I had to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave without my supply for the year.</li>
            <li> First came across it in a surf shop on Coronado Island when visiting the Hotel Del and the kiddos got sunburned at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered this while on vacation in Glen Arbor, MI.  </li>
            <li> My daughter gave me my first bottle after I tried hers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily the magic potion it claims to be</li>
            <li> My whole family got burned and this stuff helped cool off the burn as well as maintain our tan without too much peeling.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on our dogs after swimming and to help prevent hot spots</li>
            <li> I also used this on my finger when I toughed a hot pan</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on sunburns!  </li>
            <li> my whole life!</li>
            <li> (dare I say &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My first review was a one star and that it was stinky.</li>
            <li> First time I ever used this product was when I got burnt to a crisp in Nagshead.</li>
            <li> stuff is so good that I use it as an everyday toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, it smells good and it provides a little bit of temporary relief.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and have not used it long enough to say much more.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the miracle spray I was lead to believe by other users, but it feels and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting the  fruity smell that most after sun products have, but if the product worked I could easily get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> This product makes it easy to quickly spray yourself down in the morning or after a shower to feel fresh and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best product to use when you get a little too much sun!</li>
            <li> I recently was at the beach in Florida with my sisters and they tried the product and loved it, so much they bought some at a local store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has kind of an odd earthy smell that makes me want to shower again just to wash it off.  </li>
            <li> Solar Recovery absorbs into the skin rather quickly and leaves skin with a soft hydrated feeling..not</li>
            <li> also love in a Minnesota, which has a really dry winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a cream or lotion to the mist, with misting there is a certain amount of product loss.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to stop my skin from peeling and it certainly did not make my skin tan.</li>
            <li> Also I used it on my nephew and he complained about the herbal smell which is very strong!</li>
            <li> Makes old skin feel soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> So gentle that even if it gets in my eyes it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Now anytime any of  our friends get too much sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thanks guys.</li>
            <li> I had gotten too much sun even using sunscreen, I used this product and could not believe the results.  </li>
            <li> recently enlisted for Prime (free shipping) on Amazon, so I ordered a bottle and received it in two days.  </li>
            <li> I even used to use real aloe from the plant</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was really expecting some moisture properties in this, not even close.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really does help after a day of too much sun.</li>
            <li> Besides the smell of the product which I really didn&#x27;t care for, I couldn&#x27;t tell that it moisturized at all.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well without chemicals...</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works when you&#x27;re sun-burned.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Solar Recover!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but if your really really burned you will still peel.</li>
            <li> My husband got too much Sun</li>
            <li> I am dutch decent, which means I am white and burn easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even nice to use after showers everyday.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about &amp;#34;Solar Recover.&amp;#34;  I first bought a bottle when vacationing down in Pensacola, FL.  </li>
            <li> i have really dry and sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t moisture skin at all, but it&#x27;s super fresh and smells as heaven, fresh minty, greeny, lavendery odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has an amazing smell and will set my makeup and tame frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for other people</li>
            <li> The other plus is that you can use it as many times as you want.</li>
            <li> the scent is refreshing and the mist is extremely healing.</li>
            <li> We get stung several timesin a season, and never get too excited because we have this product on the trucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a light treatment mist to allow the essential oils to penetrate and bring down inflammation.</li>
            <li> Even if your skin is not really burned but you&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot, it is very refreshing and adds moisture back in to your skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale skin and burn very easily.</li>
            <li> will now keep a bottle of this in my kitchen and send a bottle to school with my college kid to keep near the first aid kit.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cool my skin off, it didn&#x27;t moisturizer or heal it, and it definitely didn&#x27;t keep me from peeling.  </li>
            <li> I got too much sun in our first day in Hawaii and got a burn which usually then gets a heat rash with more sun...</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off 1 star is that while the burns faded, my skin still had that &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; feeling, but not nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> I got burnt down in the florida keys, and after spraying this all over me my sunburn was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> Smells decent, it is herbal but not pungent or stinky.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday in the summer to keep my skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as you sunburn and skin relief for the summer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff if you are in the sun at all.</li>
            <li> it was amazing in recovering my burnt skin, turning that awful red to tan, softening my skin and best of all I never peeled!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and really helped with healing sunburned skin.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on every 30 minutes until I went to bed, then immediately when I woke up, and a few more times before heading out for the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hugely addictive, skin is fresh like after a sea breeze.</li>
            <li> Spray it on frequently throughout the day, and especially when you get out of the shower an you will get quick relief from the sunburn you got at the beach.</li>
            <li> so I can cool off after the dry desert air.  </li>
            <li> I live in &amp; also use a spray on my face-pre moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I live in the Northwest.</li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I drive a convertible and live in the sun.</li>
            <li> Burnt my feet to a crisp last summer on an impromptu walk on the boardwalk.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much daily.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little strong</li>
            <li> I cant say enough positive about this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and burning easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff was a huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care what anyone says about natural remedies, this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I misted myself frequently, maybe every 5-10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I figured what the heck, the aloe wasn&#x27;t doing its job fast enough</li>
            <li> The all natural ingredients alleviate the burning sensation almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t completely cure the burn overnight, it took the pain away and by two days after my burn was gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just an old bottle</li>
            <li> I only received it toward the tail end of the burn, but it&#x27;s really helped with some of the pain and itching.</li>
            <li> The places it was sprayed that were very burned were definitely healing.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> its completely bogus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my 1 year old and there were no side effects.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li> It both helps with the heat and pain of the sunburn but also offers moisturizing relief.  </li>
            <li> It totally relieves sun burn sting as well as just really hydrating your skin after days in the sun.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly even if not recovering from too much sun exposure.</li>
            <li> It is natural too.</li>
            <li> Was really looking for something different.</li>
            <li> One of the best things you&#x27;ll notice about this product and the whole Solar Recover product line is that there are absolutely zero bad ingredients!!</li>
            <li> My more minor sunburns on my legs had disappeared completely without any trace, just a slight tan.</li>
            <li> It worked amazing to bring down the swelling, redness, and pain in less than 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I used this product a couple times a day or when I felt hot or dry.</li>
            <li> SInce we don&#x27;t use it much in the winter, we really know warmer months are here when we start to smell the Solar Recover on each other (wife and I)!!</li>
            <li> I used it regularly and had to buy a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i instead bought a dry almond oil spray, which is VERY hydrating</li>
            <li> we thought it was worth a try, but we tossed it in favor off what we were using previously.  </li>
            <li> The blisters stopped forming, went away, and I barely peeled -</li>
            <li> The places it was sprayed that weren&#x27;t EXTRA CRISPY were so soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Taste fresh, the summer after the trouble will not burn.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the damage was already done so I wasn&#x27;t able to test it on a brand new burn</li>
            <li> I spent the day on the beach without reapplying any sunscreen, and needless to say I looked like a bright red lobster!</li>
            <li> The shop owner sprayed her down very well, it removed a lot of the heat immediately.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to help with some serious sunburn while I was on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I think for someone who is not as sensitive to the sun and so dry skinned</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how or why it works, but I used to peel every time i got a little too much sun.</li>
            <li> I do still peel after a couple of weeks if it&#x27;s a bad sunburn but for the most part I really like it.</li>
            <li> It soothes the sting of a bad burn away and it  is chemical free so it does not irritate all ready sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, I still buy it in the winter to mist on my face for hydration after being in the cold wind and it works very well as just an all-purpose light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> started using it for some pretty bad overexposure to strong sun</li>
            <li> I normally suffer for a few days with itchy and burning skin after a sunburn.</li>
            <li> It really does prevent the dreaded peeling if you get a little pink.</li>
            <li> With it I typically turn from burned to tan within 24 hours with frequent applications.</li>
            <li> Left my skin looking flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> Coming from a pale natural red head who burns within 15 minutes of being in the sun, this stuff does WONDERS for taking the heat and sting out.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after reading all of the positive reviews, but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t do as it claimed for me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first ingredient is water and that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like- watered down lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for everyday use!</li>
            <li> I use it religiously when i get burnt or even pink.</li>
            <li> I use it every day all year long.  </li>
            <li> Saturday received, waiting for is always so long.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> and I have recently purchased this scrub and 2 other Solar recover products.</li>
            <li> It works to keep my back along with other parts of my body moisturized.  </li>
            <li> That was a very long time ago &amp; by god</li>
            <li> I started using the spray to deal with my dry skin and the very long winter.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on parched, dry skin.</li>
            <li> But worse than that I did peel some which is very unusual for me.  </li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re like me, using a tub of lotion is not an area of interest nor carrying around tubes of lotion in your limited pocket space.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking cracked, bleeding skin dry!  </li>
            <li> Kind of disappointing :/</li>
            <li> The next day, there was little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> I used it when I visited Florida and got a little burned and have been using it ever since on my 3rd bottle this summer.</li>
            <li> I live in PA and the skeeters and no see&#x27;ems are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> We were introduced to Solar Recover when my grown daughter spent a day at the beach using spray on sunblock.</li>
            <li> We bought this at the coast a few years back to use on my daughters sun burn.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, several times a day.</li>
            <li> I also peeled terribly a few days later even though I continued to use it!  </li>
            <li> And in a few days my skin did not peel, wasn&#x27;t red, and</li>
            <li> I spent $15 on this</li>
            <li> this summer i spent time in the texas heat-houston, california-san diego and eastern oregon.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and night now as a moisture mist on my face and prior to cosmetic application.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky or greasy like aloe or other after-sun products.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty desperate for something to cool my angry and thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> It felt like i was spraying myself with water that smelled like lavender and other earthy scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and anyone who uses it usually buys it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like OFF and other chemical laden products and you should reapply on occasion.</li>
            <li> I always think it is a little too expensive but the truth is that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Now I have a tan where I was very pink</li>
            <li> Healed a bad sunburn in under a day...far better than aloe in my opinion and it is soothing to the skin without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> but it definitely helped calm a bad burn.</li>
            <li> I used it after going to the river and got a bit burnt, nothing bad and used this right away and multiple times a day afterwards.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty bad sunburn after a trip to the beach last week</li>
            <li> The scent is TRUE lavender, not the unpleasant attempts to duplicate .  </li>
            <li> It leaves no residue behind, just soft skin.</li>
            <li> the smell is very distinct, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Cools my burn down immediately and helps in recovery.</li>
            <li> … I spray down immediately afterward….</li>
            <li> Originally my aunt gave me her bottle after I got a particularly bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically burn</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased this product in a Surf Shop in Seal Beach, Ca.</li>
            <li> , I was half a week into my sunburn when I discovered this.</li>
            <li> My entire chest and back was red and painful.</li>
            <li> and I use a little less.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I hit the beach... but also during those drying, hotter months as I feel like sometimes my skin needs a little boost.</li>
            <li> I flaked a little bit.</li>
            <li> For a little added moisture, spray the Save</li>
            <li> Anytime I need a little pick me up during the day</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll spritz a little on my face and decollete.  </li>
            <li> Started using it after a bad sunburn in Jamaica and found I didn&#x27;t peel nearly as much as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> also, we found the pump spray difficult  to use, especially with wet hands, or with hands with some of this product on them.  </li>
            <li> I still had to use lotion after the spray dried to moisturize my skin and to help cover the smell of the Solar Recovery spray.  </li>
            <li> Used this everyday and never peeled once.</li>
            <li> so it never feels heavy on your skin.  </li>
            <li> And, I still use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use this as a year round moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The next day I woke up and my worst burns had faded into a golden tan, with just a touch of pink!</li>
            <li> We have a pool at our house and friends come over and end up getting pretty bad sunburns.</li>
            <li> End result was bad peeling on my back and chest, will not be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for years ever since we found it in a small shop in PCB FL.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure how reviewers can say that this helped prolong their tan and prevented peeling.</li>
            <li> I use this year round as a toner on my face before I moisturize!</li>
            <li> Not sure how</li>
            <li> Usually stock up at the beach!</li>
            <li> Experience told me that this would be blistering and be a deep, painful peel.</li>
            <li> I painfully walked into the local store and they told me to try Solar Recover.</li>
            <li> So did a little search for it and found it again!!!</li>
            <li> I got a pretty terrible sunburn at the beach and someone there suggested I get this stuff.</li>
            <li> The caps on two of the bottles were broken.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted to the smell.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen failed and I needed relief, and did not want to have peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a serious, painful burn in 3 years because of this.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find anywhere!!</li>
            <li> I got burned in Florida at the water park and immediately came to condo, took a cold shower and applied this product.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Everything else I have ever used on a burn makes my skin itch like mad.</li>
            <li> My wife got a bad sunburn one year and women at the beach told us to try it, we have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> but my burned skin held on longer giving making it not so painful when it did peel.</li>
            <li> (who doesn&#x27;t hate peeling?!), but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and have never been disappointed</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be a repeat purchases.  :(</li>
            <li> And forget about painful skin problems!</li>
            <li> I discovered this while on vacation after receiving a terrible sun burn.</li>
            <li> I got a particularly nasty sunburn after one day sunbathing in the Outer Banks.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Got a horrible sunburn on vacation and my sister came home from shopping at one of the beach stores with this</li>
            <li> It has an olive oil base with lavender, calendula etc!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> Saved me from a really miserable</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This spray has saved me from sun poisoning and itchy, flaky skin for 4 years now. Ever since i was introduced to this by a friend who&#x27;s got fair skin like me, it&#x27;s been a necessity each summer. Haven&#x27;t had a serious, painful burn in 3 years because of this. Swear by it!</li>
            <li> Great product for Florida sun I live in &amp; also use a spray on my face-pre moisturizer.Love it! Amazon had great price &amp; arrived next day using prime membership! Five stars Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Love this on my skin!!! Have been using it for years and keeps my skin moisturized and smells lovely!!</li>
            <li> BEST SUNBURN STUFF EVER!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  I bought my first bottle at a surf shop the day after I got &amp;#34;torched&amp;#34; at the beach.  It instantly cooled and relieved my skin...and its great even if you don&#x27;t have a sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to never run out :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beach Bum Bran</li>
            <li> Cools my burn down immediately and helps in recovery. So gentle that even if it gets in my eyes it doesn&#x27;t matter. Love the smell also. Such a pleasant scent when applied on my face. Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this while on vacation after receiving a terrible sun burn. I applied this repeatedly and I never pealed! This was 4 years ago and I never travel without it. This is a must have item. I tell everyone I can about it.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and my skin thanks me for it!</li>
            <li> I cant say enough positive about this.  I am dutch decent, which means I am white and burn easy.  I burnt to a crisp day 1 on a cruise in the Caribbean.  Guy in the local store recommended this.  and he was right!  Big time!  It prevented peeling until we got back, soothed it while we were out.  And in dry environments, it just feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I originally got my first bottle from a tanning salon 4 years ago. I use it religiously when i get burnt or even pink. I putit on everytime i feel that hot feeling you do when you are burnt. With it I typically turn from burned to tan within 24 hours with frequent applications. I never peel when i use it combined with lotion. Smells decent, it is herbal but not pungent or stinky. I havent had any issues with the container or spray nozzle it comes with.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say I don&#x27;t like the smell.  I was expecting light and refreshing based on other customer reviews.  It&#x27;s has kind of an odd earthy smell that makes me want to shower again just to wash it off.  I guess I was expecting the  fruity smell that most after sun products have, but if the product worked I could easily get past the smell.  I couldn&#x27;t tell the spray did anything for my skin.  I don&#x27;t typically burn so I just used it in place of after sun lotion.  I still had to use lotion after the spray dried to moisturize my skin and to help cover the smell of the Solar Recovery spray.  My husband did get sunburned.  He tried the spray, but couldn&#x27;t tell it did anything for his sunburn.  It didn&#x27;t help the burning feeling or take any of the redness away.</li>
            <li> Coming from a pale natural red head who burns within 15 minutes of being in the sun, this stuff does WONDERS for taking the heat and sting out. I spend all summer on the water and can&#x27;t wait to not be in pain on vacations anymore!! 😀 smells like lovely lavender!</li>
            <li> Discovered Solor Recover in the Outer Banks SC, 8 of us Shared the Bottle and Love it!</li>
            <li> We were introduced to Solar Recover when my grown daughter spent a day at the beach using spray on sunblock. She was so sunburnt that she was running fever and had water blisters (even on her face).  We went to a local surf shop,  they recommended Solar Recover. The shop owner sprayed her down very well, it removed a lot of the heat immediately. We have been using Solar Recovery ever since. This spray works great even on wind burnt skin. I used it in Mexico along with Aloe Gator waterproof sun block and enjoyed 7 days in the sun/water</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I have been using it for years. My wife got a bad sunburn one year and women at the beach told us to try it, we have been using it ever since. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Wonderful help for sunburned skin! We use a lot of it in the summer.  Even if your skin is not really burned but you&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot, it is very refreshing and adds moisture back in to your skin.We&#x27;ve been using it for years ever since we found it in a small shop in PCB FL.</li>
            <li> I buy 2 bottles of Solar Recover every year while vacationing at a beach resort.  I add my own lemon or grapefruit essential oil for a delicious scented after bath spray.  I use it every day all year long.  Very refreshing.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> We have been using Solar Recover for years.  We had gone to Florida one Summer and saw it in a surf shop claiming to relieve sunburn pain and peeling. It delivers. Spray it on frequently throughout the day, and especially when you get out of the shower an you will get quick relief from the sunburn you got at the beach. The only regret you will have about buying Solar Recover is that you only bought one bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it every day, to moisturize the skin.  You don&#x27;t have to have sunburn to use this wonderfully scented spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep one one every room.  Love it, and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> great product.  Makes old skin feel soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Don&#x27;t care what anyone says about natural remedies, this stuff works. Burnt my feet to a crisp last summer on an impromptu walk on the boardwalk. Used this everyday and never peeled once. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE for anyone who has any type of sunburn. I always have an extra bottle. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> We bought this at the coast a few years back to use on my daughters sun burn. Now anytime any of  our friends get too much sun they ask for the blue bottle of smell good stuff. We love it. It feels great on your skin with or with out a sun burn and smells great. The bottle has lasted us for two years and we just bought another one. I am so happy I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I hit the beach... but also during those drying, hotter months as I feel like sometimes my skin needs a little boost. I spray it on after a shower or even just before bed, it also smells great :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing spray! I bought this at Coastal Casuals in Pier Park in Panama City Beach, FL. The lady working noticed my sunburn and said that she recommends it to all customers. She sprayed it on my shoulders. It&#x27;s so soothing and cool and it even smells amazing. I have recommended it to many of my friends after noticing their sunburns too. I know I will be ordering more of these blue bottles soon!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. Smells great and does a good job of cooling down hot skin after a long day in the sun. Not sticky or greasy like aloe or other after-sun products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it really works. I&#x27;m extremely fair, and in spite of tons of sunscreen I got a severe burn while river rafting. Experience told me that this would be blistering and be a deep, painful peel. I misted myself frequently, maybe every 5-10 minutes or so. I didn&#x27;t know if it would work, but it felt good. The blisters stopped forming, went away, and I barely peeled - I flaked a little bit. For me, that was a miracle.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviewers not like it because of it not being &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; enough... It is not a spray moisturizer, it&#x27;s very light and you don&#x27;t feel any oily residue. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a light treatment mist to allow the essential oils to penetrate and bring down inflammation. If you need more moisture, I&#x27;d suggest a couple rounds of this mist and then put moisturizer on top.&lt;br /&gt; I also use it to help soothe my itchy winter skin as well as to set my makeup.</li>
            <li> Yay it&#x27;s here!  So glad I found this on Amazon!  I had bought it years ago while on vacation in the Outer Banks and haven&#x27;t seen it since.  Works and smells great!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I had quite a sunburn on my shoulders and arms. Applied this product after my shower. I normally suffer for a few days with itchy and burning skin after a sunburn. However, I had no itching or burning at all after applying Solar Recovery.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there isn&#x27;t a greasy feeling with this product. Solar Recovery absorbs into the skin rather quickly and leaves skin with a soft hydrated feeling..not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience turning brown over night as the creator of this product states, but I also did not peel.&lt;br /&gt;The most important factors to me in any product of this type is;&lt;br /&gt;1) Not Greasy&lt;br /&gt;2) Keeps my skin from stinging after sunburn&lt;br /&gt;3) Keeps my skin from itching after sunburn&lt;br /&gt;4) Keeps my skin from peeling.&lt;br /&gt;This product does all of that and more.&lt;br /&gt;Case in point;&lt;br /&gt;I burned my finger rather severely while cooking.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product immediately after the burn and sprayed my finger with it every five minutes or so for about thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I also iced my finger in-between sprays. My burn healed quicker than ever and I have no blister and no callused skin at the burn site.&lt;br /&gt;I will now keep a bottle of this in my kitchen and send a bottle to school with my college kid to keep near the first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle when on vacation in St. John USVI last month.  As I write this review, I am tending to a sunburn I received today in NY.  This stuff is wonderful at soothing my skin!  I love the smell, how well it soaks into my skin, and how it takes the burn/sting out of my skin. I have not yet woken up with a tan like the creator states, however I rarely tan.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a freckled, strawberry-blonde who spends a lot of time in the lakes and on the intercostal waterways of North Carolina and I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it.  It takes the sting out of a sunburn and I don&#x27;t know how but it seems to make it heal faster.  it kept our skin healthy during a recent weekend sail to ocracoke and no one peeled.  the lavender smell is wonderful.  just LOVE it.  thanks guys.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it almost everyday in the summer to keep my skin fresh and smooth. Great scent, very neutral for both men and women. Works as described to reduce peeling for sunburn, but works great as a daily moisturizer. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love Solar Recover, I found it several years ago when I was at the beach in Florida.  I had gotten too much sun even using sunscreen, I used this product and could not believe the results.  The burn healed in record time!  The product has a herbal smell, very pleasant.  I recently was at the beach in Florida with my sisters and they tried the product and loved it, so much they bought some at a local store.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Started using it after a bad sunburn in Jamaica and found I didn&#x27;t peel nearly as much as I would have expected. I mostly use it for post-sun-exposure and have noticed it really helps the redness fade and prevents peeling. I like the way it feels - kind of like spraying scented water on your face - not at all sticky and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I have very fair skin- burns easily/breaks out easily. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I also started using it after my dermatologist  did PDT (blue light therapy) for my acne, which leaves your skin really red afterward and it was incredible. Helped with the pain and stinging after the laser treatment.</li>
            <li> I got a particularly nasty sunburn after one day sunbathing in the Outer Banks. Luckily, the place we were staying had Save Your Skin stowed in its medicine cabinet. I figured what the heck, the aloe wasn&#x27;t doing its job fast enough and I was pretty desperate for something to cool my angry and thirsty skin. I sprayed some on and experienced quick cooling and relief; my skin was good as new in a few days, with minimal peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so good that I use it as an everyday toner and moisturizer. Love the lavender/botanical scent, too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  It does what it says.  Don&#x27;t go to the beach without it.</li>
            <li> My second bottle, great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff especially for living in the desert. It really moisturizes the skin and smells great. I would say anyone who is out in the sun needs this.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! I got burned in Florida at the water park and immediately came to condo, took a cold shower and applied this product. No aloe available. Applied multiple times through day and night, but woke the next morning with no pain, no redness (already tanning) and no peeling. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased this product in a Surf Shop in Seal Beach, Ca. when visiting my son. He is a surfer and uses it every day. I live in the Northwest. When I went online to purchase more on the website, the shipping and handling cost more than the product!&lt;br /&gt;I recently enlisted for Prime (free shipping) on Amazon, so I ordered a bottle and received it in two days.  I really love this hydrating mist. It is great for after being in the sun. I also use it daily as an aftershave. It has a relaxing lavender scent. I recommend this product for anyone!!</li>
            <li> THis is a great product, it hydrates the skin, is easy to apply and smells great.  I use it everyday, several times a day.</li>
            <li> Love it, feels great, refreshing and leaves skin soft and hydrated after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after reading all of the positive reviews, but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t do as it claimed for me.  I got a pretty bad sunburn after a trip to the beach last week so I sprayed this on religiously. The next day, there was little to no improvement. I also peeled terribly a few days later even though I continued to use it!  On a positive note, it smells good and it provides a little bit of temporary relief.  I&#x27;m glad it works for other people, I just wish it did the same for me.</li>
            <li> Solar Recover is absolutely by far the BEST after sun spray anyone could ever use. We have a pool at our house and friends come over and end up getting pretty bad sunburns. I bring out the spray, and by the next day, their burn is gone and their skin tan. I found this spray back in 2012 in Sanibel, Florida and have used it ever since. Love this product and goes down as one of the best purchases I have ever made!</li>
            <li> Always the perfect prescription for sunburn</li>
            <li> I love this product! Originally my aunt gave me her bottle after I got a particularly bad sunburn. When I saw how well it worked I used it regularly and had to buy a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the most effective after sun product I have ever tried and I am thrilled that I can purchase it through Amazon. During a trip to Panama City Beach, FL this spring my fair Michigan skin got pretty sunburned. A sales person at the Costal Casuals store in Pier Park recommended this product. It worked so great I bought several bottles. The all natural ingredients alleviate the burning sensation almost immediately. Unlike aloe it&#x27;s light, not at all sticky and absorbs easily into the skin. Although it didn&#x27;t completely cure the burn overnight, it took the pain away and by two days after my burn was gone. And I didn&#x27;t peel - which is amazing!  I&#x27;m recommending it to all of my fair skinned, burn too easily friends.</li>
            <li> Great product and skin rehydrator!  Love it and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> It really works! This took the red out of my sunburn over night. I eventually peeled a week later but that may have been because I used the product a day after the initial sunburning. Smells medicated but not a bad odor. I have personally recommended this to my friends and family already. I will be a life time user!</li>
            <li> A great product! Nice scent, with outstanding hydrating qualities. I&#x27;d prefer a cream or lotion to the mist, with misting there is a certain amount of product loss.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWSOME!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on sunburn skin!! The ones with low stars either don&#x27;t have sunburn or don&#x27;t use it enough. After vacation I was super burnt. I used this product a couple times a day or when I felt hot or dry. And in a few days my skin did not peel, wasn&#x27;t red, and just tan! I would recommend to everyone!! Yes it feels like lavender water but I swear keep using it and you will see and feel a difference! plus it&#x27;s all natural and a good price! I&#x27;ll never go on vacation without it. I even used to use real aloe from the plant and I swear this works even better just keep using it!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product to use when you get a little too much sun!</li>
            <li> Feels great on your skin !&#x27;</li>
            <li> I took this with me to the beach and used it in conjunction with unburn lidocaine lotion. Unfortunately the first ingredient is water and that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like- watered down lotion. I was really excited to try this product based on claims and reviews (who doesn&#x27;t hate peeling?!), but was not impressed. It did have a cooking sensation that was short lived with or without a sunburn. I think for someone who is not as sensitive to the sun and so dry skinned it may work. Also I used it on my nephew and he complained about the herbal smell which is very strong!</li>
            <li> I got burnt down in the florida keys, and after spraying this all over me my sunburn was noticeably better. I could tell because a part of my skin that I missed was a lot more red than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Try sticking it in the fridge and then spray it on your sunburn! It feels wonderful! I use it all the time now, even when I&#x27;m not in the sun! Smells great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just an old bottle but it didn&#x27;t really work for me. I have a friend that love it and swears by it but I did not get the same results. Kind of disappointing :/</li>
            <li> It works really well!  I was had a sunburn on my back from not knowing my sunscreen expired.  I sprayed this on every 30 minutes until I went to bed, then immediately when I woke up, and a few more times before heading out for the day.  It worked wonders and kept the itch from a healing sunburn away.  I also did not peel at all from it.  I love that it&#x27;s light, not greasy, and smells great.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty terrible sunburn at the beach and someone there suggested I get this stuff. I only received it toward the tail end of the burn, but it&#x27;s really helped with some of the pain and itching. Glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! We bought in Panama City Beach at the mall. It works better than aloe. Aloe burns sometimes when you put it on, but this stuff soothes the burn so well. And it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I always think it is a little too expensive but the truth is that it is worth it. It works wonderfully on sunburnt skin. It soothes the sting of a bad burn away and it  is chemical free so it does not irritate all ready sensitive skin. Everything else I have ever used on a burn makes my skin itch like mad. And all though I now do my best to avoid over exposure to sun - when it does happen I know I can use this product and find relief.&lt;br /&gt;It also has an amazing smell and will set my makeup and tame frizzy hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I found Solar Recover again! I love this stuff! Took a trip to Florida one year and got severely sun burned. One of the locals had Solar Recover in their shop and recommended it. It smelled great and left my skin feeling refreshed. Brought the bottle home with me and continued to use it for my burn. Eventually I ran out of it but kept the bottle for some reason. Looked around my home area (Illinois) but no one stocks it. So did a little search for it and found it again!!! So excited!!! I will continue to use this as long as they sell it! My whole family loves Solar Recover!</li>
            <li> This spray is WORTH the money! It takes the sting out of sunburns and I have not peeled from a sunburn in over a year!</li>
            <li> Great product and seller timely delivered</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Great smell, calms and heals skin and lightly moisturizes. A++</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works.  Definitely a 5 star product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I have ordered.  This stuff is amazing at taking the burn out of your sunburn and prevent peeling.  Something to keep on hand - as friends love it too.</li>
            <li> In a haze of sun poisoning- delirium, I purchased and overnight shipped this and another product.  I was literally burned  (still recovering almost 2 weeks later) on the entire front of my body.  The ease of use in spraying is clutch, considering touching my own skin to rub in aloe is like rubbing a fresh bruise.  The smell is fine to me, almost like an apple sauce.  The places it was sprayed that weren&#x27;t EXTRA CRISPY were so soft.  The places it was sprayed that were very burned were definitely healing.  This kind of burn needs to stay as moist as possible and between the ease of use and efficacy, I&#x27;ve been able to achieve that.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!!!!  It is wonderful!!  Skin feels amazing!  I have even used it on my hair and it works nice!</li>
            <li> I purchased this while traveling in the islands... it was amazing in recovering my burnt skin, turning that awful red to tan, softening my skin and best of all I never peeled!  I am now home and am using this as my daily moisturizer my skin feels great and there is no left over residue so it never feels heavy on your skin.  I really cannot explain how much I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Saturday received, waiting for is always so long. Amazon&#x27;s service is very thoughtful, have email reminder.&lt;br /&gt;Taste fresh, the summer after the trouble will not burn.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the skin and hands down the best product to apply to your skin after a day in the sun. Once you start using this product, you won&#x27;t want to use anything else. For a little added moisture, spray the Save Your Skin Hydrating Mist and then add their Vitamin C &amp; E  Moisturizing Face &amp; Body Cream to the spray. You&#x27;ll love it!! One of the best things you&#x27;ll notice about this product and the whole Solar Recover product line is that there are absolutely zero bad ingredients!! Very hard to find anywhere!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I used it when I visited Florida and got a little burned and have been using it ever since on my 3rd bottle this summer. It smells good and works great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Great product.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and seems to soothe. We used it out camping and swimming this summer, and I plan on keeping it as part of our outdoor arsenal!</li>
            <li> Best spray I have ever used for sunburns. It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Really great! Feels wonderful on burned skin and prevented me from being too sore when I accidentally got too much sun on my shoulders. Did not peel. Product smells like lavender is is heavenly!</li>
            <li> Just got this product in the mail.  Love the smell and have not used it long enough to say much more.</li>
            <li> feels so good on my skin, sunburn/red skin clear  wow</li>
            <li> This is a must have for me!  I am Irish, and fair-skinned.  Anytime I&#x27;m out in the sun much, which I love to be… I spray down immediately afterward…. it is so soothing, and the smell is addicting.  SInce we don&#x27;t use it much in the winter, we really know warmer months are here when we start to smell the Solar Recover on each other (wife and I)!!</li>
            <li> this spray smells awesome and is very cooling and soothing for sun burned skin. certainly worth the wait for the shipping</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but we didn&#x27;t notice anything particularly hydrating about it.  also, we found the pump spray difficult  to use, especially with wet hands, or with hands with some of this product on them.  we thought it was worth a try, but we tossed it in favor off what we were using previously.  in its favor, it is not greasy and the smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I don&#x27;t understand how or why it works, but I used to peel every time i got a little too much sun. Now, I use this for a couple days after sun exposure or if I feel any itching, and I&#x27;m fine. This is an essential to have during the summer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it for some pretty bad overexposure to strong sun (it worked excellently releiving the burn, and it healed better and faster than I&#x27;ve ever experienced), but I&#x27;ve been using it for an allover body spritz for more than a year.  Anytime someone is over at my house, they douse themselves with it when they visit the washroom! It smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> so basically this product is like spraying yourself with water. i have skin that tends to be on the dryer side, thought this may help retain moisture after being in the sun. uh NOPE! It felt like i was spraying myself with water that smelled like lavender and other earthy scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was really expecting some moisture properties in this, not even close. Im not sure how reviewers can say that this helped prolong their tan and prevented peeling. its completely bogus. I fell for the phony reviews and now its going back.&lt;br /&gt;i instead bought a dry almond oil spray, which is VERY hydrating and it actually has oil in it. i dont this has an essential oil in it at all. just fragrance</li>
            <li> I used it after going to the river and got a bit burnt, nothing bad and used this right away and multiple times a day afterwards. I like it&#x27;s made with oils and it natural, but it felt like my skin was just not absorbing it, rather it evaporated off my skin before it got a chance to suck it up. End result was bad peeling on my back and chest, will not be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I had gotten sunburned  after working in my yard. I received it very quickly &amp; sprayed it on immediately. It turned my burn into a tan &amp; stopped me from peeling which is extremely unusual for my fair skin type. Stopped the itching as well. It has a nice scent to it. If it were just a touch more it would be to much though. Been looking for a good sunburn relief spray since Avon stopped making theirs. That was a very long time ago &amp; by god I think I have finally found it. Thank you very much for this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use for sunburn. It&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> love this product, tried it in Sanibel, FL and had to have it handy all the time!  even if you don&#x27;t use this for sunburn, it is just so refreshing for your skin and love that it dries so quickly with no residue!</li>
            <li> I am in the sun a lot. I use this with burns. It relieves the pain and I have had no peeling. Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Bought my first bottle after I read a great review in a mag and I love it!  I tan but can peel but never do with this.  I use liberally to save the tan AND because it smells and feels so good!</li>
            <li> love it.  used for years.  After the sun my teens look to spray their sunburn and or tan.  Smells great</li>
            <li> I use this year round as a toner on my face before I moisturize!</li>
            <li> I read about this stuff and figured I had to try it.  Let me tell you, it works.  I had a severe sunburn and this helped me heal very quickly without scarring.  And, I still use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I like that it sprays on lightly and there is no rubbing involved. The other plus is that you can use it as many times as you want. I&#x27;ve used it on my 1 year old and there were no side effects. He puts his arm out to be sprayed with more. The smell might be something that people don&#x27;t like but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> used this after a mild burn in the sun. the scent is refreshing and the mist is extremely healing. did not want to share it at the beach house.</li>
            <li> I purchased Solar recover spray during a beach vacation 3 years ago. It really works!! Every year when I went back to the beach I had to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave without my supply for the year. I was so excited to see it now on line and I have recently purchased this scrub and 2 other Solar recover products. You will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> This spray is very refreshing to spray on your skin after a long day in the sun!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Healed a bad sunburn in under a day...far better than aloe in my opinion and it is soothing to the skin without feeling heavy. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This stuff was a huge waste of money.  I spent $15 on this and it&#x27;s total garbage.  It didn&#x27;t cool my skin off, it didn&#x27;t moisturizer or heal it, and it definitely didn&#x27;t keep me from peeling.  I have used Insurance gel from California Tan for years and it actually works.  Save your money and don&#x27;t throw it away on this product.</li>
            <li> Great for sunburns or just moisturize after laying in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this Hydrating Mist.  First came across it in a surf shop on Coronado Island when visiting the Hotel Del and the kiddos got sunburned at the beach.  Soothed and healed their sunburns with no peeling later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it as a daily moisturizer refresher for my face.  Its all natural and smells heavenly.  Anytime I need a little pick me up during the day, I&#x27;ll spritz a little on my face and decollete.  I also use it as a &amp;#34;setting mist&amp;#34; for my mineral makeup.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how or why it works but it does. This was the first year in my life that I didn&#x27;t peal! Also my face never tans, just gets red and fades but It actually made me tan! Thanks to my sister Mary for telling me about this great product! At first I wasn&#x27;t real thrilled with the fragrance but once it is on your skin for a minute you can&#x27;t even smell it!</li>
            <li> This product really does soothe your skin if you are burned, and smells amazing! I even use it when I&#x27;m not burned just because it feels good and smells great! Also, their hair care product is great too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s kind of the best kept secret for after-sun.  It&#x27;s soothing, smells incredible and provides so much hydration for your skin that you won&#x27;t peel if you use it regularly.  Redness turns to tan within 24 hours on me and I use it for several days after to ensure I stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work, but again the sunburn was severe!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing how well it works over any aloe vera product !</li>
            <li> I first discovered this while on vacation in Glen Arbor, MI.  Was amazed at how effective this was for my sunburn.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is so great to use for getting to your back.  I never could moisturize my back until this spray came along.  It works to keep my back along with other parts of my body moisturized.  The fragrance is a little strong but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin that burns easy this is a must! I spray it on after every afternoon I spend in the sun. I have not had it miraculously cure a sunburn overnight but it does sooth it and makes my skin feel more hydrated. This is my third bottle and anyone who uses it usually buys it. By the way... smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years. It always takes the red out of the burn faster and it&#x27;s incredibly soothing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.I Use it daily.</li>
            <li> Stuff is magical. Have used it for years and have never been disappointed</li>
            <li> Usually stock up at the beach! Very happy to be able to purchase here! I use this as a year round moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice And soothing.</li>
            <li> Got a horrible sunburn on vacation and my sister came home from shopping at one of the beach stores with this and I used it. Within an hour my pain was almost gone and the red patches were almost gone. It is seriously amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my upcoming trip to Puerto Rico, however I started using it right away because it smells so good! I spray it on right after showering. It leaves no residue behind, just soft skin. Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This product really is incredible. I have extremely pale skin and burn very easily. I spent the day on the beach without reapplying any sunscreen, and needless to say I looked like a bright red lobster! My entire chest and back was red and painful. I sprayed Solar Recover all over my burns- the smell is very distinct, but not in a bad way. Kind of like the smell of cloves? It also left a cooling tingle that I found very pleasant. The next day I woke up and my worst burns had faded into a golden tan, with just a touch of pink! My more minor sunburns on my legs had disappeared completely without any trace, just a slight tan. It was incredible! The only reason I took off 1 star is that while the burns faded, my skin still had that &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; feeling, but not nearly as bad. Other than that, this really is an incredibly product!</li>
            <li> Tremendous Summertime product and it works to alleviate the pain of sunburn.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me my first bottle after I tried hers.  The scent is TRUE lavender, not the unpleasant attempts to duplicate .  They spray hydrates (winter and summer) without greasiness or staining.  The spray works well in either hand so you can easily mist wherever!  Excellent product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. I&#x27;m pale and burning easily. After working in the garden all day and getting a sunburn on my shoulders and back I sprayed it on multiple times. It did nothing to stop my skin from peeling and it certainly did not make my skin tan.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what is said.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on parched, dry skin. I keep mine in fridge so I can cool off after the dry desert air.  So nice!!</li>
            <li> We have tried this product before.  It was recommended to us a few years ago as the perfect answer to sunburn relief AND it is.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  It both helps with the heat and pain of the sunburn but also offers moisturizing relief.  I highly recommend this product as you sunburn and skin relief for the summer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My husband&#x27;s mother and father used to use this back when they lived in Mexico and it worked wonders back then.  This product 100% helps improve your skin&#x27;s appearance after sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really gives you relief!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it. It really does help after a day of too much sun.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better for sunburns or razor burn.  I love the way my skin is after using.</li>
            <li> This skin mister is great after being in the sun all day.  It is also great to use after a shower.  I liked it so much that I bought two - one for myself and one for my sister.  Plus, it has a calming scent.</li>
            <li> I discovered this light refreshing spray while combing the shops in Passe Grille, Florida. It&#x27;s all natural and really helped with healing sunburned skin. But there is another benefit. It tends to keep bugs away. I live in PA and the skeeters and no see&#x27;ems are ridiculous. but If I put this on before going out, they tend to avoid me. It&#x27;s not like OFF and other chemical laden products and you should reapply on occasion. But it&#x27;s not going poison to your system either. i am a customer for life and so happy Amazon sells this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily the magic potion it claims to be but it definitely helped calm a bad burn. Unfortunately, the damage was already done so I wasn&#x27;t able to test it on a brand new burn, I was half a week into my sunburn when I discovered this. I did find that I had to do multiple applications during the day as unlike a lotion the oils don&#x27;t necessarily stay on your skin for several hours. I did like that it was a spray bottle though as it makes application quick and easy. Definitely a good maintenance moisturizer in the summer, but not a heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Solar Recover products are amazing! You can be sunburned at the end of the day and apply Solar Recover and not only is the burn gone the next day, you will NOT peel! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get through a summer with out it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and really works! I do still peel after a couple of weeks if it&#x27;s a bad sunburn but for the most part I really like it.</li>
            <li> I originally found this about 5 years ago on the Jersey shore and have used it ever since. It totally relieves sun burn sting as well as just really hydrating your skin after days in the sun. Just bought several to give to all my friends. So glad Amazon carries it. Best product!!</li>
            <li> i love this product...the smell is so nice and i even use it on my hair!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about &amp;#34;Solar Recover.&amp;#34;  I first bought a bottle when vacationing down in Pensacola, FL.  My whole family got burned and this stuff helped cool off the burn as well as maintain our tan without too much peeling.  I grab this before the aloe now.  I&#x27;m not sure what the magic ingredient is, perhaps the lavender, but it simply works great.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the miracle spray I was lead to believe by other users, but it feels and smells nice.  It&#x27;s refreshing to use after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Someone had bought it for me in Florida. Now I can find it on Amazon. Wonderful product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will not go to the beach without this product.  normal use of suncreen during the day and save your skin after showering.&lt;br /&gt;it works great for too much sun and decreases redness.  smells great too!!  safe for kids.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it twice a day on my face before I apply my moisturizer. Makes it spread evenly and I use a little less.</li>
            <li> Great for use after tanning.</li>
            <li> I love this product, been using it for quite some time. It smell amazing and soothes my skin plus help the skin recover from sunburns. Also to be used as a face toner; not at all greasy yet very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the rave reviews. I am an olive skinned person that tans easily and quickly and don&#x27;t burn often.  I took Solar Recover to Mexico to use after sun.  Besides the smell of the product which I really didn&#x27;t care for, I couldn&#x27;t tell that it moisturized at all.  But worse than that I did peel some which is very unusual for me.  I won&#x27;t be a repeat purchases.  :(</li>
            <li> This product not only saves your skin from sunburn and the peeling that follows, it helps you hang on to your tan longer!  amazing!</li>
            <li> The best thing EVER when you have a sunburn. It smells of lavender and it heals your skin overnight.</li>
            <li> Best product I use on a daily basis and cannot live without this stuff anymore.  Highly recommend this stuff if you are in the sun at all.</li>
            <li> I got too much sun in our first day in Hawaii and got a burn which usually then gets a heat rash with more sun... I bought the spray and sprayed all evening and next morning the burn had come around and was just turning into a tan ... No heat rash either .. It moisturizes very well without chemicals... Saved me on my vacation... I use it at home now too. Love the product!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I use it pretty much daily.  I&#x27;m a 4-5 time customer.</li>
            <li> Found this product at the beach 10 years ago. I drive a convertible and live in the sun. No burn or stinging skin ever! In fact FYI to all you fighters if cancer.... If you use the vitamin creme made by Zausner... You will have no skin breaks or irritation to your radiation site! I used the cream every day after radiation.... I had no skin issues!! My icogolust banged on the machine saying &amp;#34;Is this thing on?&amp;#34; He could not believe the condition of my skin. Don&#x27;t use the products they give out in the hospital... Order the Zausner vitamin A and E cream.... It has an olive oil base with lavender, calendula etc! These products are the bomb! Try it and you will be a believer too! And tell any one you know going thru radiation to get the cream... And forget about painful skin problems!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Non-greasy with pleasing essential oil fragrance. I use it regularly even if not recovering from too much sun exposure. Great product for basic skin care.</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Our whole family uses it. I even use it on our dogs after swimming and to help prevent hot spots</li>
            <li> I found this product from a friend when we were in Florida.  She had bought it in Destin, FL at a Speciality store and paid a lot more than the Amazon Price.  You spray this on a burn and it is gone by the next morning.  We used her all of Solar Recover and I bought her some and me 2 bottles when we got home for our next trip!  I also used this on my finger when I toughed a hot pan and it also worked on my burn the same way!</li>
            <li> Works great for after sun and sunburns.  Takes the sunburn away over night.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  It helps with sunburn and it smells so nice!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works when you&#x27;re sun-burned. It is natural too. I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner every time I wash my face before I put on my moisturizer.  I love how it smells and how it feels. I highly recommend Solar Recover! I even take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> This is perfect when one can&#x27;t tolerate someone rubbing a product over the sunburned or irritated skin.  I can spray it over my back by myself and don&#x27;t need someone to help.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and really does help with sunburns.  However, I still buy it in the winter to mist on my face for hydration after being in the cold wind and it works very well as just an all-purpose light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Left my skin looking flaky and dry. The smell is horrible. Was really looking for something different.</li>
            <li> Love this product-I always Solar Recover after I come in from the pool or lake. If you are burned, this will provide instant relief!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on sunburns!  Spray it on and it not only takes away the burn, but it turned the burned skin into tanned skin (even after it peeled).  And, it smells fabulous!!  I have actually used it as a cologne!</li>
            <li> Best post sun care I&#x27;ve ever used! Lived on the beach my whole life! You use this...you won&#x27;t peal! Promise!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product that I use after getting some sun. it helps you from peeling and it smells very refreshing</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! have not peeled from a sunburn since I started using this a couple of years ago!</li>
            <li> i truly think this product helped. this summer i spent time in the texas heat-houston, california-san diego and eastern oregon. i am fair skin and do not tan easily. even with the use of sunblock my face often and tends to peel. i used this product generously throughout the day after my sun exposure and for several days after. i am happy to say i did not peel once...so very happy to have gone a summer without my nose or forehead peeling. thank you solar recovery!! &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> Great product. We have been using it for years. We did have an issue with the delivery. The caps on two of the bottles were broken. The bottles were always in perfect condition when I ordered directly from Solar Recovery</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and natural but didn&#x27;t do the wonders for my skin and sunburn that I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Every time I spray this on my skin I feel like I am in a spa.  I initially got it because it was recommended by a friend after a day out in the sun.  Sunscreen failed and I needed relief, and did not want to have peeling skin.  Got on prime so it came two days later.  It felt cool, my skin never peeled, and it has a wonderful fresh scent.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have bought this time and time again, I am a red head with blue eyes and very fair skin- this keeps me from peeling and actually gives me some color (dare I say &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;).  I will never go without this on any vacation and I love using it as a daily moisturizer because its so quick to spray on and smells nice without being over powering.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Not sure how or if it helps but feels good when sprayed on.</li>
            <li> Items purchased were exactly as described! Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> We were introduced to this product two years ago in Ventura Beach CA. Excellent product and works every time!!</li>
            <li> Great for sunburn. Smells good and cools the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a amazing product. It&#x27;s my 3rd bottle I&#x27;ve bought and won&#x27;t be my last. I never take a trip to the beach without it. It really does prevent the dreaded peeling if you get a little pink. I have peeled when I got too red but my burned skin held on longer giving making it not so painful when it did peel.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. Great product, very light and easy to apply. Soothes burned skin immediately and helps prevent peeling but if your really really burned you will still peel. It&#x27;s even nice to use after showers everyday.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me this item. If you keep it in the refrigerator and spray on your face and body, you feel cool and fresh. Its scent is good. The moisture doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Believe the reviews. And not just for sunburn, which it miraculously vanquishes. It&#x27;s great for maintaining your tan and keeping your skin happy. This stuff is magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Purchased and started using this product on vacation in Hilton Head Island, SC. Used it to soothe my families Sun drenched skin after being on the beach all day.  It helped to soothe our skin.  I also had some ant bites on my foot and it helped to soothe them as well.  I use this product everyday and night now as a moisture mist on my face and prior to cosmetic application.  It feels so good on my skin!</li>
            <li> My first review was a one star and that it was stinky. I forgot to throw it away. My husband got too much Sun and so did I and we used. Now I have a tan where I was very pink and I&#x27;m addicted to the smell. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this but I love it now. I guess it takes getting used to.</li>
            <li> Solar Recover is awesome product!</li>
            <li> i have really dry and sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t moisture skin at all, but it&#x27;s super fresh and smells as heaven, fresh minty, greeny, lavendery odor. As there is no moisture i&#x27;m using it as a skin toner after cleanser or make up remover morning and night. It&#x27;s hugely addictive, skin is fresh like after a sea breeze. One bottle lasts one year double day use on skinface. It&#x27;s really worth the bargain !</li>
            <li> First time I ever used this product was when I got burnt to a crisp in Nagshead. I painfully walked into the local store and they told me to try Solar Recover. It saved my vacation, and skin!  That was many years ago, and we still use this today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Like the fact it is not greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all means get the sting recover product.  You would not believe how instantly the sting is gone. We get stung several timesin a season, and never get too excited because we have this product on the trucks.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to help with some serious sunburn while I was on vacation.  It worked amazing to bring down the swelling, redness, and pain in less than 24 hours.  Saved me from a really miserable vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love in a Minnesota, which has a really dry winter.  I&#x27;m talking cracked, bleeding skin dry!  I started using the spray to deal with my dry skin and the very long winter.  This spray has made winter easy to deal with the dryness easily bring taken care of by the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, if you&#x27;re like me, using a tub of lotion is not an area of interest nor carrying around tubes of lotion in your limited pocket space.  This product makes it easy to quickly spray yourself down in the morning or after a shower to feel fresh and moisturized all day.  I highly recommend this product for everyday use!</li>
