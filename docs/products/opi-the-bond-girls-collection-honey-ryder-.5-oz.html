            <li>It stays on well and has become my favorite go to, and I have many to choose from.</li>
            <li>More of a mellow gold color than I was expecting,  </li>

            <li>The texture still shows, but the top is smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I like that it is glittery, but it does seem to chip easily and</li>

            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of sheen and shimmer from the gold to bring attention without looking gaudy.</li>
            <li>Soft gold color, formular is nice and this polish is a nice accent with any other color but can certainly stand alone.  </li>

            <li>and I love all the sand polishes with their rough looking texture.</li>

            <li> Never tried liquid sand......it is Fantastic.  Ladies with no time will love that it dries quickly.  It adds pizazz to your fingertips.  I rub my finger on it constantly because it is so textured it doe not seem like nail polish at all.  The have many other colors in the OPI brand.  Everyone that loves to change colors often must try liquid sand.  The look is automatically dressy and classy!!  I received so many compliments I had to buy my own bottle.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like texture polish but I do like this one. However, since I like a glassy top, I do wear a good topcoat over this. The texture still shows, but the top is smooth to the touch. Very pretty. Very pleased with seller, well wrapped and timely delivery.</li>
