            <li>So he&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Good product for constipation.</li>
            <li>The original is wonderful stuff.  </li>
            <li>We love and will always get this product</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>Since I have diverticulosis and it stretches out my Cohen to prevent the folds from festering, AND BECOMING INFECTED.</li>
            <li>It is as fine as fine can be.</li>
            <li>Not like the good old days and nights, when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>Some people may not like the texture, but a teaspoon is a small price to pay for a happy digestive system :)</li>
            <li>However, as a pregnant woman who suddenly needs some extra help to get the job done, this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is great for dogs who have a hard time going.</li>
            <li>People should be aware that the product as shown at</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really concerned what you&#x27;re putting in your body and don&#x27;t already know what sucrose is, you should use your browser to look up sucrose.</li>
            <li>It cost too much.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the other products.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other fiber product!  </li>
            <li>I can only find the flavored stuff - orange to be exact.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is NOT the same as the original coarse milled Metamucil.  </li>
            <li>I happened to be sensitive to citric acid</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in grocery or drug stores, because it seems everyone else prefers the flavored and/or smooth stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for the original plain coarse unsweetened flavorless Metamucil, this is not it.</li>
            <li>and so does my Old English Sheepdog!</li>
            <li>It is hard to find the original</li>
            <li>Sadly, this product only seems to be available online now -- and is very pricey.</li>

            <li> Sadly, this product only seems to be available online now -- and is very pricey.</li>
            <li> I add Metamucil to oatmeal or any other cereal each morning and find that it is enough fiber to keep me regular.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> non flavored is getting harder to find</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing, but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is in no way like the &amp;#34;Metamucil coarse milled texture&amp;#34; of just a very few years ago.</li>
            <li> I cannot see from the label in the ad if it contains sugar, but that is the only ingredient I wish to avoid and it is so far impossible to find in local pharmacies, markets or health stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only writing because I see some people complaint about</li>
            <li> I put it in half prune juice, half cran-grape, and it still affects the flavor.</li>
            <li> I mix maybe half a teaspoon in with about 4 oz. of juice and within an hour</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost half sugar.</li>
            <li> I wanted plain, unflavored unsweetened pysllium and this wasn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, and I personally hate that.</li>
            <li> This container has a small amount of sugar, so diabetics will need to keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find at the stores.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find without aspertame</li>
            <li> I keep trying to find Metamucil that has no flavorings or artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to avoid sugar and artificial sweeteners, so this is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be disappointed when you look at the label and see the sugar content in the nutrition facts.</li>
            <li> The taste is just awful.</li>
            <li> In water it turns into a disgusting gelatinous mass.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My fault but I thought it would be a larger container for the price</li>
            <li> I wanted plain, unflavored unsweetened pysllium and this wasn&#x27;t it.  The ingredients should have been listed. I returned it.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the other products.  The original is wonderful stuff.  It is hard to find at the stores.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product only seems to be available online now -- and is very pricey. There is no equivalent in the drugstores, so I am ordering it online and also mixing it with a similar drug store version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find unflavored Metamucil in the stores anymore.  I can only find the flavored stuff - orange to be exact.  I happened to be sensitive to citric acid and I&#x27;m not fond of orange.  I add Metamucil to oatmeal or any other cereal each morning and find that it is enough fiber to keep me regular.  This container has a small amount of sugar, so diabetics will need to keep that in mind.  Some people may not like the texture, but a teaspoon is a small price to pay for a happy digestive system :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only writing because I see some people complaint about there&#x27;s not supposed to be sugar in it. The ingredients list sucrose. If you&#x27;re really concerned what you&#x27;re putting in your body and don&#x27;t already know what sucrose is, you should use your browser to look up sucrose. Actually, basically anything ending in &#x27;ose is a sugar. Sucrose... Is a scientific name for table sugar. So don&#x27;t be disappointed when you look at the label and see the sugar content in the nutrition facts.</li>
            <li> non flavored is getting harder to find</li>
            <li> We love and will always get this product</li>
            <li> This morning spoonful in my OJ is a must for inner health. I cannot see from the label in the ad if it contains sugar, but that is the only ingredient I wish to avoid and it is so far impossible to find in local pharmacies, markets or health stores.</li>
            <li> I use this product from a recommendation from my Dr. Since I have diverticulosis and it stretches out my Cohen to prevent the folds from festering, AND BECOMING INFECTED.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and prefers it to all the flavored or smoother textured Metamucils.  It&#x27;s hard to find in grocery or drug stores, because it seems everyone else prefers the flavored and/or smooth stuff.  So he&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> The taste is just awful. I don&#x27;t know how people drink this in water. I put it in half prune juice, half cran-grape, and it still affects the flavor. However, as a pregnant woman who suddenly needs some extra help to get the job done, this works perfectly. I mix maybe half a teaspoon in with about 4 oz. of juice and within an hour I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Good product for constipation.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find the original but I love it and so does my Old English Sheepdog! It is great for dogs who have a hard time going. Try it and see.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other fiber product!  I depend on it. I use it daily and wouldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> Over priced! Know question it&#x27;s over priced. It cost too much. Not like the good old days and nights, when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> This picture does not match the actual item. I ordered this and was shipped the flavored version made with sugar.</li>
            <li> Works well for replacing any fiber content not in-taken in food.</li>
            <li> This is in no way like the &amp;#34;Metamucil coarse milled texture&amp;#34; of just a very few years ago. It is as fine as fine can be. In water it turns into a disgusting gelatinous mass.</li>
            <li> People should be aware that the product as shown at&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFZ1AI/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;is not what they send. The picture shows a sugarless product, but I ordered this twice and received&lt;br /&gt;a product with sugar both times --here is a picture of what I received as sold by a different seller&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Metamucil-Original-Texture-72-doses-Container/dp/B00AUSI1X0/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0QFNRE0VGMNYX4WFZQKZ  THIS Has sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my experience is not to trust this seller as they did not send what they showed on their product page.&lt;br /&gt;The picture definitely does not mention sugar. (of course you could argue that they never explicitly say that&lt;br /&gt;there is no sugar, but look at the picture.</li>
            <li> You have to take a bunch of this twice a day to get the desired results. Try a bit of OJ and and a lot of water.</li>
            <li> I keep trying to find Metamucil that has no flavorings or artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS SUGAR!! If you are looking for the original plain coarse unsweetened flavorless Metamucil, this is not it. This has 3 grams of sugar per 7 gram dose, which is a rounded teaspoon. It&#x27;s sweet, and I personally hate that. I&#x27;m trying to avoid sugar and artificial sweeteners, so this is not acceptable. It&#x27;s almost half sugar.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time. It is difficult to find without aspertame</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is NOT the same as the original coarse milled Metamucil.  It&#x27;s better than nothing, but I am disappointed.</li>
