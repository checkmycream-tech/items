            <li>Love this stuff, the best self &#x27; tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not as good a product as the Olay touch of sun</li>
            <li>Altho its a good idea</li>
            <li>No steaks, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Definitely a pleasant smell, but it is a very very light tan</li>

            <li>The scent is light and pleasant not over powering like some tanners.  </li>
            <li>ok - nothing great or special -</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin.  </li>
            <li>The more applications, the more tanning.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I find this brand works better than the others I find in stores.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Also,  after I apply it i go through and rub it in one more to make sure it&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li>Overall this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>It smells ok</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li>I bought it at Target a couple of years ago &amp; have not found it anywhere since looking ok Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this...use it every day.</li>
            <li>This product is better than most.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both use this year around for we are in shorts most of the year.</li>
            <li>I love Nivea lotion</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and doesn&#x27;t turn my creases orange or brown.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and can handle the smell, it does give a beautiful glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>Never orange, just a nice golden glow.</li>
            <li>the smell is pretty nice too.  </li>
            <li>Application is smooth and the product dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It gives your skin a light tan...</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it is not a &amp;#34;fake-orange&amp;#34; color, but looks like a genuine tan.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I really loved the color that developed when using this lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and the color is mild.</li>
            <li>This is the only self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used that has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and would be fine using the lotion for dark skin tones.</li>
            <li>Jergens is far too strong and floral.</li>
            <li>However, true to form, the moisturizing effects of the lotion were just as good as the usual</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed for just about 3 weeks, leading up to my wedding, and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love that it actually moisturizes too!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to not have ghostly white legs</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using most tanning products because my skin looks orange, not natural.</li>
            <li>nice gradual tan without the mess</li>
            <li>Adds a little color to your skin which is nice.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This gradual tanner really works for me.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works to keep a tan.</li>
            <li>This product is very creamy and has a lite tint.</li>
            <li>The results are reasonable.</li>
            <li>If you use it every day your skin will start looking tanned and glowing and very hydrated.</li>
            <li>Very natural and pretty.</li>
            <li>I think I started to get a little bit more tan but couldn&#x27;t really tell.  </li>
            <li>Great fake tan.</li>
            <li>And, for what it&#x27;s worth, this is probably the best-smelling (relatively speaking) tanning lotion I&#x27;ve encountered so far.</li>
            <li>Adds very natural looking color to your legs.</li>
            <li>It also makes a improved difference in my very white legs after the first application.</li>
            <li>(maybe mine rubs off on other things quickly or something).</li>
            <li>Nivea is one of only a few personal care brands I stay loyal to, so when I saw that they made a gradual tanning lotion, I was excited.</li>
            <li>I would not say the color is necessarily natural</li>
            <li>I also developed a rash all over my body from using it, so I had to discontinue use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pale and it&#x27;s hard for me to get a beautiful and natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>The first few times, I used it right after a shower and my legs felt wet and sticky for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I am very pale, and with this product, I have seen a significant change in the color of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I usually use the Vaseline tanning body lotion, but found that never really gave my legs color, no matter how many days (weeks)</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several weeks and it does build natural looking gradual color.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice on my skin and dosen&#x27;t have any weird odors.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, if you rub too hard in the shower it gets splotchy, other then that it was good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long though, unless you use it every single day, and the smell really got to me because it lingered all day.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is just a very subdued tanning scent - not nearly as overwhelming as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The tan doesn&#x27;t last for as long as you might think</li>
            <li> The smell is strange but it goes away as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> My husband usually refers to me as a ghost in the summer but ever since I&#x27;ve used this he compliments my skin on how naturally tan i look.</li>
            <li> I have very pale and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely suggest using this on completely dried off skin.</li>
            <li> This product is not very selft tanning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad smelling, less expensive than other self tanning products, and is a moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li> but like other reviews does smell a little like fake tanner, but its not bad, deff doable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe my skin and the tanning element in the lotion just don&#x27;t go well together, because I read reviews by other people saying this stuff worked quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that after the to 7 days,  I can start applying it every other day to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> However you do need to keep applying it every other day or it no longer makes you look tan</li>
            <li> I usually mix equal parts of Nivea moisturizer &amp; this Tanner together works like a charm.</li>
            <li> When it comes of, its not so noticeable as with a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> Good lotion didn&#x27;t turn that awful orange color.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not super orange.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t notice a big difference just a subtle color.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even make it half way through the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few days to build up the color</li>
            <li> I bought this three weeks ago and used it everyday for about 5 days.  </li>
            <li> However if you are putting it on everyday that&#x27;s not practical.</li>
            <li> No strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> so no more sun</li>
            <li> Whenever I have used self tanners in the past,  I&#x27;ve ended up mixing them with lotion just because they were so drying!  </li>
            <li> The smell seams to get worse as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has no sun screen.</li>
            <li> The issue I have with it is it stinks.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This gradual tanner really works for me. I just use it on my legs and see results within 2 hours. The more applications, the more tanning. Not bad smelling, less expensive than other self tanning products, and is a moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li> love it. It gives your skin a light tan... thats what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin.  This lotion leaves me with a nice color.  I don&#x27;t get that orange look. It takes a few days to build up the color and if I skip a day or two it&#x27;s gone.  It feels nice on my skin and dosen&#x27;t have any weird odors.</li>
            <li> I have very pale and sensitive skin. Jergens and othet gradual tanners always make me itch.  Nivea sun kissed radiance is amazing!  Smell is pleasant and mild. Hydrates and perfect tan color. My husband usually refers to me as a ghost in the summer but ever since I&#x27;ve used this he compliments my skin on how naturally tan i look.</li>
            <li> WORKS REAL GOOD, RECD MANY COMPLIMENTS, MANYTHOUGHT THAT I LAID IN THE SUN, I CAN&#x27;T....REAL HAPPY WITH IT !!</li>
            <li> Not as good a product as the Olay touch of sun</li>
            <li> Nivea is one of only a few personal care brands I stay loyal to, so when I saw that they made a gradual tanning lotion, I was excited. I used it exactly as directed for just about 3 weeks, leading up to my wedding, and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin tone.

            <li> This lotion really works to keep a tan. No strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Definitely a pleasant smell, but it is a very very light tan</li>
            <li> I bought this three weeks ago and used it everyday for about 5 days.  I think I started to get a little bit more tan but couldn&#x27;t really tell.  It smells good and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> nice gradual tan without the mess</li>
            <li> Great fake tan. Had skin cancer so no more sun but like to wear skirts all summer so this works well. Unfortunately, it has no sun screen.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Adds very natural looking color to your legs. Doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and doesn&#x27;t turn my creases orange or brown. I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that. The tan doesn&#x27;t last for as long as you might think (maybe mine rubs off on other things quickly or something). The first few times, I used it right after a shower and my legs felt wet and sticky for the rest of the day. Definitely suggest using this on completely dried off skin.</li>
            <li> The tanner worked, I saw results and I was great. I would recommend it to anyone with pail to medium skin.</li>
            <li> Works well, I do not like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The smell is strange but it goes away as the day goes on. And if I put it on at night the smell is gone in the morning. It&#x27;s the only sunless tanner that doesn&#x27;t leave streaks that I&#x27;ve tried. I would not say the color is necessarily natural but it&#x27;s definitely not super orange. I have some application tips too.  It says to exfoliate before using it. However if you are putting it on everyday that&#x27;s not practical. I&#x27;ve found that if I wash my body twice that gives me an even surface to apply the product. Also,  after I apply it i go through and rub it in one more to make sure it&#x27;s even. I&#x27;ve also found that after the to 7 days,  I can start applying it every other day to maintain the color. I love that it actually moisturizes too! Whenever I have used self tanners in the past,  I&#x27;ve ended up mixing them with lotion just because they were so drying!  Overall this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> It goes on really nice and if you rub it in like lotion it doesn&#x27;t streak. Altho its a good idea to ovoid heals and knees and elbows when applying for the 2nd or 3rd time. It smells ok but like other reviews does smell a little like fake tanner, but its not bad, deff doable. It also makes a improved difference in my very white legs after the first application. However you do need to keep applying it every other day or it no longer makes you look tan</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several weeks and it does build natural looking gradual color.  Application is smooth and the product dries very quickly.  The scent is light and pleasant not over powering like some tanners.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy and has a lite tint. Very nice!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Vaseline tanning body lotion, but found that never really gave my legs color, no matter how many days (weeks) I applied it.  Since using Nivea, I actually look like I have tan legs!  I am so pleased to not have ghostly white legs anymore!&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is pretty nice too.  I will only use this from now on.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite self tanner. I bought it at Target a couple of years ago &amp; have not found it anywhere since looking ok Amazon. This is the only self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used that has a pleasant fragrance. I usually mix equal parts of Nivea moisturizer &amp; this Tanner together works like a charm. Never orange, just a nice golden glow.</li>
            <li> ok - nothing great or special -</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and would be fine using the lotion for dark skin tones.</li>
            <li> Love this...use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, the best self &#x27; tanner I&#x27;ve tried. No steaks, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. You don&#x27;t notice a big difference just a subtle color.</li>
            <li> This product is better than most.  It smells nice and applies smoothly.  The results are reasonable. m</li>
            <li> Good lotion didn&#x27;t turn that awful orange color. It does take a bit to notice a change but I like that it gradually starts to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I&#x27;m very pale and it&#x27;s hard for me to get a beautiful and natural looking tan.  I don&#x27;t like using most tanning products because my skin looks orange, not natural. But this lotion is very nice. If you use it every day your skin will start looking tanned and glowing and very hydrated. When it comes of, its not so noticeable as with a lot of other products. And it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. The smell is strong and the color is mild. It takes a lot of coats to make any color appear.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer as well as keeping that light summer glow. My wife and I both use this year around for we are in shorts most of the year.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with the oil in it. Adds a little color to your skin which is nice.</li>
            <li> The lotion works like it is supposed to.  The issue I have with it is it stinks.  The smell seams to get worse as the day goes on.  I couldn&#x27;t even make it half way through the bottle.  I just gave up.  I love Nivea lotion but this was not for me.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, if you rub too hard in the shower it gets splotchy, other then that it was good.</li>
            <li> Works great! I am very pale, and with this product, I have seen a significant change in the color of my skin tone. Thankfully, it is not a &amp;#34;fake-orange&amp;#34; color, but looks like a genuine tan. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is not very selft tanning.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this 5 days you can see a different tone on your body.&lt;br /&gt;but it isn&#x27;t work if you want  a color the next day.</li>
            <li> I really loved the color that developed when using this lotion. Very natural and pretty. Doesn&#x27;t last very long though, unless you use it every single day, and the smell really got to me because it lingered all day.  I also developed a rash all over my body from using it, so I had to discontinue use.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and can handle the smell, it does give a beautiful glow to your skin.</li>
