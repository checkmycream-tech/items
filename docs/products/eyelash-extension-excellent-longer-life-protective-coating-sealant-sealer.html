    <ol>
            <li>Everyone should have this product its great for your eye lash extensions!</li>
            <li>And its a great price !</li>
            <li>but if you shake the brush before applying&lt;br /&gt;it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good eyelash extension mascara on here</li>
            <li>Everything is great quality and they ship your order very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest way to keep your lashes clean and fresh looking between fills.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been using my own (better) brush.</li>
            <li>Immediately her eyelashes responded and grew nice and didnt fall out as easily.</li>
            <li>I love ordering from iLash Store.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s more &#x27;oily&#x27;</li>
            <li>, my thought when I purchased was it was more like a &#x27;adhesive/glue&#x27; consistency.</li>
            <li>This stuff is clear it works great</li>
            <li>My client who I got this for had eyelashes that would come out so easy and</li>
            <li>I stopped using it 2 weeks after receiving it &amp; have a full bottle that I will never use &amp; will just toss in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Now at three weeks my lashes look like they could last another couple of days and still look good.  </li>
            <li>Its worth the cost and when you pay so much for lashes this is really worth it to keep them looking nice longer.</li>
            <li>The technician also noticed that it&#x27;s causing my natural eyelashes to grow, which is an unexpected but happy bonus.</li>
            <li>The idea for this product is excellent, but I&#x27;m still making my decision if it&#x27;s actually making my extentions last longer...</li>
            <li>Overall, it is nice to have something to clean out my lashes with</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Went back to my old sealant and lashes are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I received this last night and tried it right away and really liked the way it separated my eyelashes and made them darker and longer looking.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look great - the extensions last for a good long time - and the brush cleans and separates the individual lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this was the right product.</li>
            <li>However, normal day-to-day use doesn&#x27;t load the brush so much that it&#x27;s even able to slobber into your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first got my eye lash extensions</li>
            <li>This product seems to do exactly what was described in the description.  </li>
            <li>I lost more than 70% of my extensions while using this.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using lash extensions for several months</li>
            <li>but I am not too certain on it.</li>
            <li>The liquid in it is nice, it helps my lashes look a little cleaner and gets rid of some of the crud that accumulates after a nap/sleeping</li>
            <li>I have had lash extensions now for several months due to my own falling out and this product has really helped in between fills.</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes me more obsessed with brushing them hence, losing more lashes.</li>
            <li>and I coat the top and underside of my lashes pretty thick with it.  </li>
            <li>I get complimented on how well I&#x27;ve maintained them when I go back to the salon, and could easily go three weeks (possibly four)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how to wear eye shadow with my new lash extensions</li>
            <li>My lash extensions last much longer with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I go 3 weeks, sometimes a little more, between fills, and I believe it&#x27;s due to this sealant.</li>
            <li>the product i received was not yellow like the picture but a clear liquid</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it does anything other than damped your lashes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> There was really no longer life in my lashes after applying this item</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to a recommendation from a coworker.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it actually extends the life of my lashes...</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because its NOT worth your money.  </li>
            <li> Not worth my 18 bucks</li>
            <li> It actually seems difficult to get so much in your eyes that it stings/burns, but if you do manage to make an excessive drip, it will hurt!</li>
            <li> I had tried the diamond sealant but it is black and it tends to run and get black all over under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> this product might extend for another week in a half, for me.</li>
            <li> even if you do mess up</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little oily</li>
            <li> The product is sort of watery and hard to tell if it&#x27;s working yet on my lashes?</li>
            <li> her eyelashes grew so slow.</li>
            <li> im afraid to use it because it might have oil in it and that will make your extensions come off!</li>
            <li> and I hated when the powder would get all over the lashes and make them look that color.</li>
            <li> the brush is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Havent noticed any difference though still hoping. It actually pulled one of my silk eye lashes out.</li>
            <li> i was not sent the product in the picture! the product i received was not yellow like the picture but a clear liquid im afraid to use it because it might have oil in it and that will make your extensions come off!</li>
            <li> For me this lash sealant actually removed my lashes didn&#x27;t make them longer wearing like I had hoped.  I stopped using it 2 weeks after receiving it &amp; have a full bottle that I will never use &amp; will just toss in the trash.  Went back to my old sealant and lashes are great.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have this product its great for your eye lash extensions! And its a great price ! I swear by this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was the right product. It was labeled Essence.</li>
            <li> I love ordering from iLash Store. Everything is great quality and they ship your order very quickly. I will keep ordering from them.</li>
            <li> I go 3 weeks, sometimes a little more, between fills, and I believe it&#x27;s due to this sealant. My eyelashes look great - the extensions last for a good long time - and the brush cleans and separates the individual lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only ever gotten it in my eyes once. It actually seems difficult to get so much in your eyes that it stings/burns, but if you do manage to make an excessive drip, it will hurt! However, normal day-to-day use doesn&#x27;t load the brush so much that it&#x27;s even able to slobber into your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain went away within 10 minutes, and my eye was a bit watery. It didn&#x27;t stay red for a long time, though, so even if you do mess up it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to get pinkeye or something.</li>
            <li> When I first got my eye lash extensions this product was a life saver for keeping them from getting all sideways</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to a recommendation from a coworker. Before this, I was only using soap and water. The liquid in it is nice, it helps my lashes look a little cleaner and gets rid of some of the crud that accumulates after a nap/sleeping buuut the brush is awful. It is not fine toothed enough to separate my individual eyelash extensions so I&#x27;ve been using my own (better) brush. I am not sure if it actually extends the life of my lashes...I feel like it makes me more obsessed with brushing them hence, losing more lashes. I have been searching for a good eyelash extension mascara on here so if anyone finds something legit..please let me know! Overall, it is nice to have something to clean out my lashes with but I am not too certain on it.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because its NOT worth your money.  It doesnt extend the life of your lashes, it makes your eyes burn.  Not worth my 18 bucks</li>
            <li> This product seems to do exactly what was described in the description.  I have had lash extensions now for several months due to my own falling out and this product has really helped in between fills.</li>
            <li> My lash extensions last much longer with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little oily but if you shake the brush before applying&lt;br /&gt;it does a great job.</li>
            <li> My client who I got this for had eyelashes that would come out so easy and her eyelashes grew so slow. Immediately her eyelashes responded and grew nice and didnt fall out as easily. If clients are going to spend the money for eyelashes this is a resonable priced serum to help keep their investment.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my eyelash extensions. I get complimented on how well I&#x27;ve maintained them when I go back to the salon, and could easily go three weeks (possibly four) instead of two between appointments. The technician also noticed that it&#x27;s causing my natural eyelashes to grow, which is an unexpected but happy bonus.</li>
            <li> product name is sealant, but product picture is essence,(realized after i got the product)I wanted sealant not essence. It will be pain in the neck to return the item and cost more,,,so i want them to advertise and sell  correct product !!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it does anything other than damped your lashes so you can style them.  I started using just a dry brush, seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> it covered my extensions with a white coat. ( like dandruff)&lt;br /&gt;not recommended.  I lost more than 70% of my extensions while using this.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using lash extensions for several months and I can tell this product wont work at all, never had a similar experience</li>
            <li> I received this last night and tried it right away and really liked the way it separated my eyelashes and made them darker and longer looking.</li>
            <li> I have lash extentios and before I started using this product my lashes, at three weeks, looked like a train wreck.  I had tried the diamond sealant but it is black and it tends to run and get black all over under your eyes.  This stuff is clear it works great I use it about every third day and I coat the top and underside of my lashes pretty thick with it.  Now at three weeks my lashes look like they could last another couple of days and still look good.  Its worth the cost and when you pay so much for lashes this is really worth it to keep them looking nice longer.</li>
            <li> The product is sort of watery and hard to tell if it&#x27;s working yet on my lashes?</li>
            <li> There was really no longer life in my lashes after applying this item</li>
            <li> This is the greatest way to keep your lashes clean and fresh looking between fills. I didn&#x27;t know how to wear eye shadow with my new lash extensions and I hated when the powder would get all over the lashes and make them look that color. This sealant I apply after my eyeshadow and it smooths and cleans off the eye shadow dust and color. It helps the lashes to look prettier and \\&quot;combed\\&quot; out. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> The idea for this product is excellent, but I&#x27;m still making my decision if it&#x27;s actually making my extentions last longer... I&#x27;ve only had about a week now.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s more &#x27;oily&#x27; (it reminds me of cooking oil) then what I thought it would be, my thought when I purchased was it was more like a &#x27;adhesive/glue&#x27; consistency. I do use every night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issues with my extentions lasting longer than 2 weeks, because of how I like them to look &amp; this product might extend for another week in a half, for me. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
