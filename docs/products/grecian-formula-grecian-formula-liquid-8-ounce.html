    <ol>
            <li>I put it in once or twice a week and it stays perfect.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>Stuff works great!</li>
            <li>I would say its the best in the market.</li>
            <li>And it arrived quickly in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>oh my yes the price went up but is stall a very good buy</li>
            <li>Good Stuff!</li>
            <li>Might be the hair or my mega great</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a Walmart fan, but this time I think they win.</li>
            <li>think it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>This product met my expectations, and the price was good as well.</li>
            <li>The packaging and product arrived in good shape.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the product is great, been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of Grecian Formula for years and liked the idea of taking out gray gradually, even leaving some in.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you wash your hands good after applying and rubbing into scalp.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this very often, but when I do, it does a very good job of hiding the gray.</li>
            <li>Plus the price was very cheap.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe companies like this one still is legally able to put these toxic chemicals like lead acetate in hair products and get away with it to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients from packaging: Water, Propylene Glycol, SD Alcohol 40, Ammonium Chloride, Sulfur, Panthenol, Lead Acetate, Acetic Acid, Fragrance, Octoxynol-9, Denatonium Benzoate.</li>
            <li>Works very gradually, which is great.  </li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks, gray is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li>Cosmetic surgery would also help but costs a lot more.  </li>
            <li>My hair was gray for many years</li>
            <li>The liquid bottle is better to apply and maintain.</li>
            <li>They should have offered me $10, then I would have been satisfied.</li>
            <li>Any more than that it doesn&#x27;t do well.  </li>
            <li>I was mostly salt and pepper colored hair.</li>
            <li>The product certainly is outstanding.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it makes me look.</li>
            <li>get my wife to apply it because she can make sure no spots are missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I would have seen better results</li>
            <li>Long-time Barry White fan, and this is worthy  of his  best work.</li>
            <li>it is easy to  purchase</li>
            <li>Works well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it can be handling easy way like water and change my hair</li>
            <li>Gray hair does not become my youthful appearance and this product works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>An important note of caution:</li>
            <li>buty you can try to qualify for free</li>
            <li>I have used the Grecian Formula liquid for several years, and am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Why not make that option available in the US???</li>
            <li>And unlike hair dye, which i&#x27;ve tried before, this is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product - the natural gray/dark color you get is good.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, was in a coma and woke with mega gray of which I did not have.  </li>
            <li>I still have a fair amount of gray, but now my overall hair has a darker tint to it which makes me look the way i did 5 years</li>
            <li>I apply some on the back and top of my head, mostly avoiding the silvery peak and temples.  </li>
            <li>You will still have some grey here and there, but that is good.</li>
            <li>Love the natural, gradual results!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine using this on a regular basis, which what the instructions say you have to do for the product to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>So much better than dye and worrying about roots being a different color than hair</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Some itchy scalp, mostly in winter months when skin is dry.  </li>
            <li>These are two large bottles of 8 oz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall i would say this is an awesome way to turn back time and make yourself look a little younger.</li>
            <li>It really works without a lot of fuss and bother.  </li>
            <li>But so far, it worth the amount paid.</li>
            <li>thanks to the service of Amazon  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product for delivery to an APO address, and it showed up in a week, which is fast.  </li>
            <li>Really wanted to use this.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if other people noticed more gray after using this product.</li>
            <li>It gives me color, but doesn&#x27;t look fake--I still have significant, but controlled grey.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product with high expectations but saw no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks more natural than conventional hair colors</li>
            <li>Grayest right after a haircut (I wear mine short).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy for dyed hair to stain shirt collars, so wear dark colored shirts if you can.</li>
            <li>I now have a new source for Grecian Formula.  </li>
            <li>Have to use daily for consistent results.  </li>
            <li>My hair has gone very gray over the last few years, and i was looking for a way to improve the ratio of pepper in my mostly salt and almost no pepper</li>
            <li>For men who want to ease the transition from young to old, especially those whose brown hair didn&#x27;t turn silvery but rather just a dull white, Grecian Formula is great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural color all these years.</li>
            <li>I just tried Grecian Formula for two weeks and know has an almost natural color.</li>
            <li>If you do the natural oils and stuff prevent it from working.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and have been using Grecian Formula for 2 months.</li>
            <li>I now apply Grecian 2-3 times a week and it keeps the natural color.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to sulfur smell</li>
            <li>Apparently there are other ways of making this that don&#x27;t involve a known poison than can be absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>This price beats local retail stores far and away.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants to be less gray...</li>
            <li>I had actually smelled it before (probably in a room with some other older guy who was using it), and wondered what the heck it was.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Lets me keep a little grey, but not too much.</li>
            <li> So until Grecian (or somebody else) comes up with a less pungent product, I guess I&#x27;ll be growing old the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t have that much gray hair to begin with, an average observer would be hard pressed to tell anything changed, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> And even I&#x27;ve forgotten how grey I used to be!</li>
            <li> It had half the amount, because it was slightly open, and the plastic it was in, also.</li>
            <li> colour  white to black</li>
            <li> hair is black, short, with gray hairs scattered throughout.  </li>
            <li> I applied Grecian Formula daily after work for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> The price, other than shipping, was actually less than I have spent for the same product off the shelf in the States.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it does linger, especially on a hot summer day if you&#x27;re sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I went totally gray 15 years ago and this product has kept my dark brown almost black hair</li>
            <li> It was not worth the trouble, sending it back, boxing it, etc.</li>
            <li> Lead(II) acetate is used as a mordant in textile printing and dyeing, as a drier in paints and varnishes, and in preparing other lead compounds.</li>
            <li> So by allowing the formula to work slowly your friends and coworkers won&#x27;t realize you&#x27;re actually coloring your hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only it smells horrible, I seem to have more gray after just three weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> It does make a slight difference in my hair color but after I started using a comb in hair dye</li>
            <li> but I am very active and I have to wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> I imagine things would have gotten a little ripe</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but nothing out there comes close to getting natural un-dyed-look results.</li>
            <li> Now I have a half dozen bottles gathering dust!</li>
            <li> Using hair dye is too much trouble and very messy, this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you wear your hair short - i.e. a crewcut, Grecian is sort of difficult to use because it takes a while for the hair to take on color</li>
            <li> It smells disgusting, and they recommend you don&#x27;t wash your hair more than once per week when using.  </li>
            <li> Not a great product as they say in the commercials, or any other advertisement, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, those of us who use this are doing so to hid the grey anyway, so if you eliminate all of it, it will it will look fake.  </li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> I not at least rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works slowly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the lead is such a serious danger; hair dye is dangerous anyway.</li>
            <li> It is subtle in how it removes gray hair but doesn&#x27;t leavre an artificial appearance.</li>
            <li> Just AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the smell of this stuff is AWFUL...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product may work, but I just can&#x27;t stomach the smell, nor can I stomach the idea of annoying others in my vicinity!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought a bottle and the instructions says wash your hair every week but I am very active and I have to wash my hair everyday.  So maybe that is why the product has not worked for me.  Not only it smells horrible, I seem to have more gray after just three weeks of using it. I wonder if other people noticed more gray after using this product.</li>
            <li> This products contains a recognized toxic compound called lead acetate. Lead(II) acetate is used as a mordant in textile printing and dyeing, as a drier in paints and varnishes, and in preparing other lead compounds. The compound is linked to cancer, developmental/reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, allergies/immunotoxicity, organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), occupational hazards, etc. It looks like all these hazards has the potential to be detrimental to our health and well-being. I cannot believe companies like this one still is legally able to put these toxic chemicals like lead acetate in hair products and get away with it to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients from packaging: Water, Propylene Glycol, SD Alcohol 40, Ammonium Chloride, Sulfur, Panthenol, Lead Acetate, Acetic Acid, Fragrance, Octoxynol-9, Denatonium Benzoate.</li>
            <li> 1. The liquid is easier to use than the cream - Youthair. But the cream is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you wear your hair short - i.e. a crewcut, Grecian is sort of difficult to use because it takes a while for the hair to take on color&lt;br /&gt;3. It looks more natural than conventional hair colors&lt;br /&gt;4. I don&#x27;t think the lead is such a serious danger; hair dye is dangerous anyway. Wash your hands a lot if you use it.&lt;br /&gt;5. Overall, a good product - the natural gray/dark color you get is good.</li>
            <li> Works very gradually, which is great.  Took a month before I realized it was working.  Have to use daily for consistent results.  Grayest right after a haircut (I wear mine short).  After about 3 weeks, gray is mostly gone.  Coming with a comb after application seems to improve results.  Some itchy scalp, mostly in winter months when skin is dry.  Love the natural, gradual results!</li>
            <li> I have used this products foe a couple years. It is subtle in how it removes gray hair but doesn&#x27;t leavre an artificial appearance.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations, and the price was good as well.</li>
            <li> I used this by the gallon because I must wash my hair evey day! It does make a slight difference in my hair color but after I started using a comb in hair dye I discovered it wasn&#x27;t compatable with this. Now I have a half dozen bottles gathering dust!</li>
            <li> I went totally gray 15 years ago and this product has kept my dark brown almost black hair it&#x27;s natural color all these years. I put it in once or twice a week and it stays perfect. So much better than dye and worrying about roots being a different color than hair</li>
            <li> Looks like a copper-colored hat. Sucks.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 2 days, I threw it out (and I bought 4 bottles of it).  It smells disgusting, and they recommend you don&#x27;t wash your hair more than once per week when using.  Just AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> Cosmetic surgery would also help but costs a lot more.  For men who want to ease the transition from young to old, especially those whose brown hair didn&#x27;t turn silvery but rather just a dull white, Grecian Formula is great.  An important note of caution: it&#x27;s easy for dyed hair to stain shirt collars, so wear dark colored shirts if you can.</li>
            <li> It really works without a lot of fuss and bother.  Using hair dye is too much trouble and very messy, this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair was gray for many years and I never tried to dye it. I just tried Grecian Formula for two weeks and know has an almost natural color. I am only concerned, for any possible side effects for the lead ingredient in the formula. But so far, it worth the amount paid.</li>
            <li> Not a great product as they say in the commercials, or any other advertisement, but it does work. The liquid bottle is better to apply and maintain.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, was in a coma and woke with mega gray of which I did not have.  Years later I thought what the heck and tried it and it dose work! I just used it for 5 days and had a girl at work ask me out for a drink. Might be the hair or my mega great looks--(LOL) but I know that it helped. I will use it weekly to maintain my part semi gray, not looking for 18 nor 65.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was leaking in the box. It had half the amount, because it was slightly open, and the plastic it was in, also. I called Cust service, and was offered $5 off. If I would have sent it back, I would have had to pay the postage. It was not worth the trouble, sending it back, boxing it, etc. So I took it. They should have offered me $10, then I would have been satisfied.</li>
            <li> Walmart sells 4 oz bottles online for $5.99. Shipping is .99 buty you can try to qualify for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;That said, the product is great, been using it for many years. It is expensive, but nothing out there comes close to getting natural un-dyed-look results. Which is why you so often see it all alone on the supermarket shelves...it has no competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a Walmart fan, but this time I think they win. Hope this helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this very often, but when I do, it does a very good job of hiding the gray.</li>
            <li> oh my yes the price went up but is stall a very good buy and  I&lt;br /&gt;  think it works great for me.  thanks to the service of Amazon  it is easy to  purchase</li>
            <li> The key to Grecian Formula is to learn how it effects your hair.  It is a conditioner and darkens your hair.  I only shampoo my hair twice a week.  Any more than that it doesn&#x27;t do well.  After I wash my hair I then apply the formula.  I only apply it after I wash it.  If you do the natural oils and stuff prevent it from working.  It works slowly.  After a month you will suddenly notice your hair darker. You will still have some grey here and there, but that is good. Let&#x27;s face it, those of us who use this are doing so to hid the grey anyway, so if you eliminate all of it, it will it will look fake.  So by allowing the formula to work slowly your friends and coworkers won&#x27;t realize you&#x27;re actually coloring your hair.  I have been using this since 2008.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Works well, and is easy to use. Don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Would recommend to anyone who wants to be less gray...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for delivery to an APO address, and it showed up in a week, which is fast.  The packaging and product arrived in good shape.  The price, other than shipping, was actually less than I have spent for the same product off the shelf in the States.  I have used the Grecian Formula liquid for several years, and am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I used &amp;#34;grecian formula&amp;#34; over the 10 years&lt;br /&gt;it can be handling easy way like water and change my hair colour  white to black</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for me.  I apply some on the back and top of my head, mostly avoiding the silvery peak and temples.  It gives me color, but doesn&#x27;t look fake--I still have significant, but controlled grey.  And even I&#x27;ve forgotten how grey I used to be!</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have been using Grecian Formula for 2 months. I was mostly salt and pepper colored hair. I shampoo my hair every day so the results took about a month for me to notice. I now apply Grecian 2-3 times a week and it keeps the natural color. I am sensitive to sulfur smell but I don&#x27;t  find the smell in Grecian objectionable. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lets me keep a little grey, but not too much. This price beats local retail stores far and away. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am about to turn ninety years of age and don&#x27;t relish the idea of that physical condition - so I try to present a physical appearance that pleases me. The product certainly is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Before using this I checked Amazon for product reviews, Lead Acetate? Apparently there are other ways of making this that don&#x27;t involve a known poison than can be absorbed through the skin. In Canada and Europe they use bismuth citrate instead of Lead in their product. Why not make that option available in the US??? Really wanted to use this. Probably it affects some people immediately, some people over time, and others not at all but why take that chance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> My hair has gone very gray over the last few years, and i was looking for a way to improve the ratio of pepper in my mostly salt and almost no pepper hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the bomb. By the third application there was a noticeable difference and i love the way it makes me look. I still have a fair amount of gray, but now my overall hair has a darker tint to it which makes me look the way i did 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get my wife to apply it because she can make sure no spots are missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i would say this is an awesome way to turn back time and make yourself look a little younger. And unlike hair dye, which i&#x27;ve tried before, this is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high expectations but saw no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is black, short, with gray hairs scattered throughout.  I applied Grecian Formula daily after work for a little over a month.  In the mornings, I would rinse my hair for about 10 seconds but would only shampoo once a week as per the instructions.  Maybe I would have seen better results had I not daily rinsed my hair, but I work out, run, work in the yard...I imagine things would have gotten a little ripe had I not at least rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grecian Formula does have a smell to it.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it does linger, especially on a hot summer day if you&#x27;re sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the Lead Acetate, and the caution regarding washing hands thoroughly after each use, I would&#x27;ve recommend the product if it worked, but it didn&#x27;t.  What did work was the Just for Men Shampoo in Hair color.  I got my wife to apply it...waited 5 minutes...washed it out...done.  Because I didn&#x27;t have that much gray hair to begin with, an average observer would be hard pressed to tell anything changed, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Gray hair does not become my youthful appearance and this product works just fine for me. Have been using Grecian Formula for about twenty years.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great! I would say its the best in the market. Plus the price was very cheap. Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> But at a lower price.  These are two large bottles of 8 oz. each and are in the retail packaging.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.  I now have a new source for Grecian Formula.  And it arrived quickly in perfect shape.  And just to clarify, this is two 8 ounce bottles for a total of 16 ounces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of Grecian Formula for years and liked the idea of taking out gray gradually, even leaving some in.  So I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell of this stuff is AWFUL... and it stays with you (and those around you!) all day.  I had actually smelled it before (probably in a room with some other older guy who was using it), and wondered what the heck it was.  Well, now I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product may work, but I just can&#x27;t stomach the smell, nor can I stomach the idea of annoying others in my vicinity!  I can&#x27;t imagine using this on a regular basis, which what the instructions say you have to do for the product to be effective.  So until Grecian (or somebody else) comes up with a less pungent product, I guess I&#x27;ll be growing old the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Make sure that you wash your hands good after applying and rubbing into scalp. I have purchased numerous times/</li>
            <li> Long-time Barry White fan, and this is worthy  of his  best work. Clealy would reccomend virtually any of his work.</li>
