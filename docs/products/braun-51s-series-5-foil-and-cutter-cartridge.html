            <li>Fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced often.</li>

            <li>I find the product excellent, easy to install, and that it renews the razor substantially.</li>
            <li>Nice replacement for my Braun.</li>
            <li>It works great for about a week or so but then quickly wears out.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there was a better replacement unit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s name and a much better shave.</li>
            <li>Just 10 more words to go.</li>
            <li>This item was purchased many years ago and want off my screen.</li>
            <li>Product must have been ok, otherwise I would have given it 1 star.</li>
            <li>Shippement arrived on time and cummincation from vendor was outstanding.</li>
            <li>The foil seems to make my beard stand up better and the blade is sharper, faster and smoother than the original.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as the original components.</li>
            <li>I bought this foil and cutter set as a replacement for the original one that came with the Braun 360 Electric Shaver.   </li>
            <li>Clean shave.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, great item.</li>
            <li>The Braun does a good job, and they state the foil and cutter should last 12-18 months.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend says the shave he gets with the replacement is as smooth and clean as when he first bought the shaver.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly after order.</li>
            <li>IT ALSO PRETTY SMOOTH</li>
            <li>I often shave every other day since retiring and it is nice to have an electric razor than can handle a two day growth!</li>
            <li>My husband has used several Braun shavers for many years and just loves this model!</li>
            <li>This foil and cutter blade is much nicer than what came with the razor originally.  </li>
            <li>Stock up on the good foils while you can from other sellers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works like new, easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>Might go back to the old one since it is just as good as the one I just purchased.</li>
            <li>Very good shaver for my tough whisker.</li>
            <li>Now only 5 more words.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I reality, it is more like 6 months of daily use.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ll be ordering it again very soon.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because of online reviews from [...] which was highly rated at the time.</li>
            <li>&quot; it is rather the normal 5 Series foil.</li>
            <li>Works just right when placed in its proper place.</li>
            <li>I put one in my Activator 8781 and it fits and works like new.</li>
            <li>Smoother, quicker shave when the cutter is new.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this is the only product available for replacing worn out shaver heads.</li>
            <li>all had the same flaws- underpowered, wear out quickly, and cause ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;the reason for my choosing braun is their major design difference that solve these problems:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old ones.  </li>
            <li>The difference is the 360 Complete as a varied hole pattern on the foil which gives it</li>
            <li>It takes a little time to adjust some of the features, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>The foil delivered has round holes in a straight line pattern like the older 5 Series and current 3 Series.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised to see several of the low rankings of this item.</li>

            <li> one month passed, the product still was on the way, and I am not sure if I can recieve the product finally.....</li>
            <li> This foil and cutter blade is much nicer than what came with the razor originally.

            <li> This is the correct part but Braun has changed it.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old ones.  Might go back to the old one since it is just as good as the one I just purchased.</li>

            <li> This is being sold as a Series 360 Foil &amp; Cutter set.  Actually, it is a Series 5 Foil and does not look like the picture.  Instead of having irregularly shaped holes for the hair to go through it has circular holes.  For me, the result was irritated skin and a rougher shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Braun discontinued the model that is advertised, but the seller needs to update the information so you don&#x27;t feel like you got the bait and switch.  What you receive is model 51S, its junk.  Stock up on the good foils while you can from other sellers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Buy the 30B that is sold for the 4000/7000 series instead.  I put one in my Activator 8781 and it fits and works like new.</li>
            <li> Item was what I expected. A lot cheaper online than in store price !!! I would def buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Although this item is listed as \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; it is rather the normal 5 Series foil. The difference is the 360 Complete as a varied hole pattern on the foil which gives it it&#x27;s name and a much better shave. The foil delivered has round holes in a straight line pattern like the older 5 Series and current 3 Series. This difference should be noted in the description.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the original components.</li>
            <li> I bought this foil and cutter set as a replacement for the original one that came with the Braun 360 Electric Shaver.   My boyfriend says the shave he gets with the replacement is as smooth and clean as when he first bought the shaver. No problems.</li>
            <li> Works just right when placed in its proper place. Just 10 more words to go. Now only 5 more words. DONE.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of online reviews from [...] which was highly rated at the time. Very good shaver for my tough whisker. I used this for almost 2 years before I needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> ITS NOT THE SAME AS ORGINAL FOIL BUT IT STILL GIVES A CLOSE EVEN SHAVE FOR ME IT ALSO PRETTY SMOOTH</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for my Braun. Fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced often. Stick with the brand name on this.</li>
            <li> Works like new, easy to replace.  I have found I need to replace the foil and cutter about every 8-10 months.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased many years ago and want off my screen. Product must have been ok, otherwise I would have given it 1 star. Great product, I think??</li>
            <li> Restores the shaving experience that I get with Braun</li>
            <li> Braun shavers and replacement cutters and screens are the best on the market.Shippement arrived on time and cummincation from vendor was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I change the cutter &amp; cuting head about every 10 to 12 months. You can see &amp; feel the difference as the cutter wears down over time.</li>
            <li> seond time I&#x27;ve ordered this...we have had the shaver for 8 years and it still does the job its suppose to do...</li>
            <li> Clean shave. But what I need is a magnifying mirrow that stands six feet tall. Then I can see what I am doing.</li>
            <li> When i bought my braun, i had several electric razors before, from the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; to the 20.00 specials on tv. all had the same flaws- underpowered, wear out quickly, and cause ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;the reason for my choosing braun is their major design difference that solve these problems:&lt;br /&gt;1) normal foil cutters are stamped w round holes. braun designed a foil with a &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sunburst&amp;#34; foil holes. this allows the hair- no matter what direction- to fall into the cutter without pulling, tearing. THIS IS A ROUND HOLE INFERIOR SUBSTITUTE.&lt;br /&gt;2) their blade design is set with a curve into a 90 degree angle with the skin- cutting, not tearing. also this blade wears longer as it is not constantly being dragged against the back of the foil at a 90 degree angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS AN INFERIOR SUBSTITUTE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote braun to complain and all they said is &#x27; sorry, design changes&#x27;. that is not true.</li>
            <li> Essential parts for your Braun electric razor.  These need replacing about every 18 months.  Smoother, quicker shave when the cutter is new.  Arrived quickly after order.</li>
            <li> Just what was needed.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works as expected, great item.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Came, works, shaved.</li>
            <li> The Braun does a good job, and they state the foil and cutter should last 12-18 months.  I reality, it is more like 6 months of daily use.  The foil tends to develop a hole, which makes it uncomfortable.  It would be nice if there was a better replacement unit.</li>
            <li> Affordable and exactly what I was looking for.  In fact, I&#x27;ll be ordering it again very soon.</li>
