    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the best thing I have used to heal my lips.</li>
            <li>I use it at bedtime and my lips look and feel great in the a.m.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how great it is.</li>
            <li>Also is great  on chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Great product at great price.</li>
            <li>It work as advertised and was happy with the products.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 4 years and love it!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>You will want to make sure you have it with you every where you go!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.  </li>
            <li>My lips are more biggest now.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>Make sure to use the replenish tube 1st and apply around the mouth/lips.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>The renewal product worked better than the lip plumper</li>
            <li>I have used this product new and it works great...</li>
            <li>I love it and think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Plumping action was fair.</li>
            <li>It really works with the fine lines around my lips!  </li>
            <li>Well, on the good side, it small and handy to be kept in the handbag.</li>
            <li>I must say, cheaper products work quickly but temporary.</li>
            <li>Okay... it is moisture but as far as making lips plumper...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s worth a try for others.</li>
            <li>Perhaps those who said it did nothing for them already had some volume to their lips, but mine have thinned greatly over the past decade.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product over the last several years and been happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I used to have pretty lips</li>
            <li>It just takes consistent use of the product and doesn&#x27;t have an immediate effect.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s first use.  </li>
            <li>Next I apply a lipstain, and finally apply the top coat, which does tend to wear away fairly quickly, but also makes your lips feel moist as well as plump.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Be cautious when twisting so too much of the product does&#x27;t get pushed out.</li>
            <li>Use it as frequent as possible I love it.</li>
            <li>I looked at other reviews before buying and plenty of people said the product didn&#x27;t work, cheaper products are better.</li>
            <li>Also the first tube is completely finished.  </li>
            <li>I do not see it doing any of that to my particular lips.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product is not going to make you look like a blowfish but makes a more subtle and natural improvement (which is exactly what I wanted)!</li>
            <li>I first purchased it from my dermatologist for double the cost.  </li>
            <li>This really worked to make my mouth look like it did when I was younger.</li>
            <li>It keeps the lips moist and plump with a natural color.</li>
            <li>Product was old with an insert from 2011.</li>
            <li>Might not be for someone who wants people to notice a big difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a two-step system, so I tend to put the first step on, give it time to sink in a little while getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>The SkinMedica LipPlump system works unexpectedly well for me; it definitely adds volume to my lips, and its effects seem to last when used daily.</li>

            <li> It makes you lips really soft and it plumps them up without any stinging sensation like you get with other plumpers..  </li>

            <li> The effect is gradual rather than dramatic.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> My lips are more biggest now.&lt;br /&gt;Is the perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;I wanna buy a lot of this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks skin medica for this product!&lt;br /&gt;Im from Argentina</li>
            <li> Okay... it is moisture but as far as making lips plumper... I do not see it doing any of that to my particular lips.  Sooooooo if you have an extra $20 bill laying around you might want to purchase it otherwise just dab some olive oil on your lips for moisture.</li>
            <li> I looked at other reviews before buying and plenty of people said the product didn&#x27;t work, cheaper products are better. I must say, cheaper products work quickly but temporary. I like this product because it appears to be filling in some small lines around my mouth. After using twice a day for a few weeks I can tell a difference. Make sure to use the replenish tube 1st and apply around the mouth/lips. Apply the 2nd step just to the lips.</li>
            <li> The SkinMedica LipPlump system works unexpectedly well for me; it definitely adds volume to my lips, and its effects seem to last when used daily. Yes, it sometimes makes your lips tingle a bit, which I imagine is why it works.    It&#x27;s a two-step system, so I tend to put the first step on, give it time to sink in a little while getting ready in the morning. Next I apply a lipstain, and finally apply the top coat, which does tend to wear away fairly quickly, but also makes your lips feel moist as well as plump.    Perhaps those who said it did nothing for them already had some volume to their lips, but mine have thinned greatly over the past decade. All I can say is it works for me when other produts haven&#x27;t, so I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s worth a try for others. [[ASIN:B0016LNMWU SkinMedica TNS LipPlump System]]</li>
            <li> I love this product! I first purchased it from my dermatologist for double the cost.  It really works with the fine lines around my lips!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used to have pretty lips but age has shrunk them. This really worked to make my mouth look like it did when I was younger. I love it and think it is worth the price. This product is not going to make you look like a blowfish but makes a more subtle and natural improvement (which is exactly what I wanted)!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and absolutely love it.  Living in AZ I used to have a dry lip problem.  No More.  It keeps the lips moist and plump with a natural color.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this stuff really works!  I could definitely see a difference after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! For $60.00 I basically got a lip gloss. I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions, nothing plumped up!!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.  It makes you lips really soft and it plumps them up without any stinging sensation like you get with other plumpers..  I use it at bedtime and my lips look and feel great in the a.m. You can also use the gloss any time for a boost.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the SkinMedica TNS LipPlump System 2 x 0.06, considering how expensive it was.  I had no noticeable difference after one month of use.  Also the first tube is completely finished.  That was sooner than I expected.  It was a waste of money and I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use it as frequent as possible I love it.</li>
            <li> Product was old with an insert from 2011. Plumping action was fair. I have used this product new and it works great...</li>
            <li> This product does work.  It just takes consistent use of the product and doesn&#x27;t have an immediate effect.  The effect is gradual rather than dramatic.  Might not be for someone who wants people to notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product over the last several years and been happy with it.  This time the tube stopped working within a week or two of it&#x27;s first use.  I don&#x27;t know if the tube is jammed or empty but I am not getting any product. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Lip gloss looks terrific when this product is applied after the lip plump. Be cautious when twisting so too much of the product does&#x27;t get pushed out. You will want to make sure you have it with you every where you go! That&#x27;s how great it is. Also is great  on chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have used to heal my lips.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 years and love it!! It actually makes your lips look younger, less lines and fuller. I can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> The renewal product worked better than the lip plumper, that did nothing .&lt;br /&gt;So for the money , I was not impressed</li>
            <li> It work as advertised and was happy with the products. Only setback on this product is that the amount is too little. Well, on the good side, it small and handy to be kept in the handbag.</li>
