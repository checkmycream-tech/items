            <li>I strongly recommend this product for anyone desiring shiny hair w/o having to pay a fortune for hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my salon d/c carrying the product, however I was able to find it on Amazon and have ordered 2 bottles which arrived ahead  of schedule and at an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, the smell is amazing and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, too shiny or greasy like some other products.  </li>
            <li>Love this product have been using for two years now and use about a bottle a year, but my hair in general is pretty healthy.</li>

            <li>It works great without weighing my hair down or making it oily.</li>
            <li>I could absolutely wear this as a body oil, but love very much what it does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>Far better than anything you can pick up at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>This is the best product on the market for those of us with thin hair that tends to frizz.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST KEPT SECRET FOR THE HAIR.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like a cheap body spray you might find at Victorias Secret, not a bad smell, just not natural or necessarily pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great on African American hair</li>
            <li>the product super fast.</li>
            <li>By using only a few drops at a time on either dry or damp hair, it gave a beautiful shine while at the same time giving off a very pleasant aroma which only got better as I finished the drying process.  </li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft, silky and light.</li>
            <li>What is even better is that Amazon&#x27;s price is $20 cheaper than our local beauty supply shore.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking and feeling so much silkier!</li>
            <li>This is a product that never fail to please....</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my hair that I made a call to the salon when I got back home to Iowa.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair incredibly soft, smooth, touchable, with no frizz or tangles.</li>
            <li>This serum may be OK for my hair, but the scent is so overwhelming that it&#x27;s hard to get over it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more a Dr. Bronners natural kind of girl, plus I have a sensitive sense of smell, and this product reminds me of other chemical scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the price is high on this product, it really is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>My hair now is super soft.</li>
            <li>This one is strong and musky, reminiscent of my grandmother&#x27;s perfume (Taboo).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never yet used too much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Keep it up alfaparf and thanks.</li>
            <li>My hair was still very freezy after I used it.</li>
            <li>My hair is not curly nor straight.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>And fast shipping</li>
            <li>I like the oil, but I may be using too much.</li>
            <li>They offered to mail it to me for about twice as much as it cost on Amazon!I still hesitated when I found it on Amazon because of the amount of product</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of this serum to add shine and smoothness to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I use so much of this product</li>
            <li>All other hair oils I&#x27;ve tried have had gentle, mostly herbal, scents.  </li>
            <li>Just let your hair dry naturally &amp; it comes out shiny &amp; healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this oil.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recomment it ot my coworkers and friends.</li>
            <li>leave your hair really soft at touch and ready to style or after style (just to put on the ends).  </li>
            <li>I my end up giving this a 5 star later once I get the amount right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not very loyal to hair products, but this is one product that I am re-ordering since I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my alfaparf serum</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product</li>
            <li>its the only thing that helps my crazy frizzy fly aways!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and The Alfaparf illuminating Serum is the only oil that works with keeping my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many many years...and is very difficult to find on regular stores.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>The smell is intense &amp; soapy, not light &amp; natural, not floral, herbal, spicy which I was hoping for based on the positive response to the scent.</li>
            <li>definitely make another purchase...and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and ive BARELY put a dent in it.</li>
            <li>I would use a very small amount on my ends for special occasions and it lasted me a for a couple of years.  </li>

            <li> What is even better is that Amazon&#x27;s price is $20 cheaper than our local beauty supply shore.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking and feeling so much silkier!</li>
            <li> This is a product that never fail to please....</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my hair that I made a call to the salon when I got back home to Iowa.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair incredibly soft, smooth, touchable, with no frizz or tangles.</li>
            <li> This serum may be OK for my hair, but the scent is so overwhelming that it&#x27;s hard to get over it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more a Dr. Bronners natural kind of girl, plus I have a sensitive sense of smell, and this product reminds me of other chemical scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the price is high on this product, it really is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and have been using it for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair now is super soft.</li>
            <li> This one is strong and musky, reminiscent of my grandmother&#x27;s perfume (Taboo).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never yet used too much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Keep it up alfaparf and thanks.</li>
            <li> My hair was still very freezy after I used it.</li>
            <li> My hair is not curly nor straight.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> And fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like the oil, but I may be using too much.</li>
            <li> They offered to mail it to me for about twice as much as it cost on Amazon!I still hesitated when I found it on Amazon because of the amount of product</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of this serum to add shine and smoothness to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I use so much of this product</li>
            <li> All other hair oils I&#x27;ve tried have had gentle, mostly herbal, scents.  </li>
            <li> Just let your hair dry naturally &amp; it comes out shiny &amp; healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this oil.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recomment it ot my coworkers and friends.</li>
            <li> leave your hair really soft at touch and ready to style or after style (just to put on the ends).  </li>
            <li> I my end up giving this a 5 star later once I get the amount right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not very loyal to hair products, but this is one product that I am re-ordering since I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my alfaparf serum</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product</li>
            <li> its the only thing that helps my crazy frizzy fly aways!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and The Alfaparf illuminating Serum is the only oil that works with keeping my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many many years...and is very difficult to find on regular stores.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The smell is intense &amp; soapy, not light &amp; natural, not floral, herbal, spicy which I was hoping for based on the positive response to the scent.</li>
            <li> definitely make another purchase...and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and ive BARELY put a dent in it.</li>
            <li> I would use a very small amount on my ends for special occasions and it lasted me a for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser cringes when I tell him I want a blowout and to straighten it with a flat iron (he loves my curly hair).  </li>
            <li> it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I started going to a new stylist a few months ago, and he uses this product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry &amp; it&#x27;s totally not necessary to blow dry when using this.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have found that works for me, others weigh my hair down and make it look flat.</li>
            <li> For the record, I&#x27;ve used argan oil, as well as other hair oils prior to trying this one.  </li>
            <li> I use it on damp hair and on dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair just after I style it and before my hair spray.  </li>
            <li> You can apply it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I also use it wet if I am going to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> ADDS SHINE, BODY AND CAN BE USED ON WET OR DRY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> As same as at the hairdressers, but costs much less.</li>
            <li> Several years ago my hair stylist recommended this product after I complained that my hair lacks shine shortly after I wash it at home.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Following my stylist&#x27;s directions, I use one or two pumps of Cristalli Liquidi on my wet hair, which adds thickness and texture.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve dried and flat-ironed my hair, I use some wax to piece out my hair, and then follow it up (as my last step) with one or two pumps of the Cristalli Liquidi again to add shine and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, except spent a ton in salons for it.</li>
            <li> I then add a small amount of pomade to my wet hair (I&#x27;m currently using D:Fi), and blow it dry.  </li>
            <li> I may give away my other one.  </li>
            <li> but you only use a small amount</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that weigh your hair down and make it greasy, this serum gives you a lightweight shine that lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s half the price of other hair treatments.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve sworn they&#x27;d weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down your hairstyle but gives it movement.</li>
            <li> Does not weight my hair down or grease it.</li>
            <li> Because of my thick long curls I wash every other to 2 days apart</li>
            <li> It does not  weigh hair down and does not leave a  greasy heavy residue....</li>
            <li> I use it year round, helps with humidity.  </li>
            <li> I had it in my mailbox within just a few days.</li>
            <li> But anyway i just take a few drops and put it in towel dried hair</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair tame and manageble!  </li>
            <li> And even when my hair is dry ill put it in.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> I have seriously curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product &amp; upset I spent $20.00 on it.</li>
            <li> It smells somewhat artificial.</li>
            <li> bottle has lasted me about four months, which isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product out there for shine and frizz control and smells great</li>
            <li> Even if it did nothing else, it makes your hair smell wonderful!!!! Love the Semi di lino hair care line!! Great on African American hair</li>
            <li> I love this product, the smell is amazing and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, too shiny or greasy like some other products.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product actually works!!! It leaves hair soft, silky and light.The smell is wonderfully intoxicating!!! (in a good way). It does not  weigh hair down and does not leave a  greasy heavy residue.... Nirmala</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. This is the HG for my hair! It smells wonderful, it makes my hair soft and shiny and manageable. I recommended it to all of my friends and they love it also!</li>
            <li> My wife says this is the best hair treatment she has ever used. Keeps her hair moist, bouncy. I like it because it&#x27;s half the price of other hair treatments. What is even better is that Amazon&#x27;s price is $20 cheaper than our local beauty supply shore.</li>
            <li> I paid an excellent price for excellent delivery time and received an excellent product.  I bought one bottle ten years ago and could not find another salon who sold it.  I always got compliments on how shiny my hair was and how i smelled \\&quot;yummy\\&quot;.  I would use a very small amount on my ends for special occasions and it lasted me a for a couple of years.  I am so happy I found it!!</li>
            <li> This is great for fine hair that needs smoothing. I use it year round, helps with humidity.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> I started going to a new stylist a few months ago, and he uses this product on my hair.  The first time he used it, I loved it so much that I had to buy it!  I have a short, textured style, and this adds both texture and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following my stylist&#x27;s directions, I use one or two pumps of Cristalli Liquidi on my wet hair, which adds thickness and texture. I then add a small amount of pomade to my wet hair (I&#x27;m currently using D:Fi), and blow it dry.  After I&#x27;ve dried and flat-ironed my hair, I use some wax to piece out my hair, and then follow it up (as my last step) with one or two pumps of the Cristalli Liquidi again to add shine and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first get it, experiment a bit to make sure that you&#x27;re using the right amount for your hair type and style.  I was worried that using the amount that my stylist recommended would leave my short hair greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price is high on this product, it really is worth it.  I tend to use a lot of it (3-4 pumps a day), and the smaller .54 oz. bottle has lasted me about four months, which isn&#x27;t too bad.  I&#x27;m usually not very loyal to hair products, but this is one product that I am re-ordering since I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this product at a salon and was amazed at how great it made my hair feel, so I had to order more. I&#x27;m African-American and have relaxed hair. It adds shine to my hair and makes it feel silky and smooth. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this is definitely one of THE BEST! The scent is a bit strong, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I keep jumping around with hair products, looking for the new best thing.  I am reordering this one, so I can have one at work as well, in case I need extra smoothing.  I had another highly rated oil, then saw good reviews for this product.  Glad I did.  I may give away my other one.  I use it on damp hair and on dry.  My hair is blonde, so I just started using the oils in the last year or so.  I would&#x27;ve sworn they&#x27;d weigh my hair down.  Start off with a light application.  You can always add more.  I&#x27;ve never yet used too much.  It leaves my hair looking and feeling so much silkier!</li>
            <li> Works fine, timely delivery . Thanks</li>
            <li> Not only does this product make my hair shiny and take away the frizz; the smell I get compliments on all the time!</li>
            <li> I love this product it is expensive but well worth it I can&#x27;t go without I&#x27;m glad I found it again!!! Leaves hair smelling nice and shiny without being sticky or greasy!</li>
            <li> If you want to grow healthy hair- find this and use it. Simple as that.  Keep it up alfaparf and thanks.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product &amp; upset I spent $20.00 on it. My hair was still very freezy after I used it. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on my hair.  It keeps it smooth.  You can apply it wet or dry.  I use it on dry hair just after I style it and before my hair spray.  I also use it wet if I am going to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and The Alfaparf illuminating Serum is the only oil that works with keeping my hair from frizzing.  It feels so very nice and I highly recommend this oil.  I love it and have been using it for a very long time.  Ordering it through Amazon was a breeze.  I had it in my mailbox within just a few days.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair. Leaves a soft shine.. love it! Use after you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you like shinny locks. Smells great and helps the styling last a bit longer.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is one that I have used for quite some time to add beautiful luster and exceptional shine. It is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.  My hair is not curly nor straight.  Its wavy.  This makes your hair look remarkably shinier and it is great on frizzy hair especially when you blow dry it and or use the Chi product.   Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair and need a very light product to give some body and shine. I have used this for years, except spent a ton in salons for it. Found it here at an incredible price. Smells incredible too. This is the only one I have found that works for me, others weigh my hair down and make it look flat. Also adds wonderful shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> This serum is so nice! It works great without weighing my hair down or making it oily. It works best on the ends of damp hair with another leave in conditioner applied to the whole strand. I don&#x27;t blow dry &amp; it&#x27;s totally not necessary to blow dry when using this. Just let your hair dry naturally &amp; it comes out shiny &amp; healthy looking. The smell is intense &amp; soapy, not light &amp; natural, not floral, herbal, spicy which I was hoping for based on the positive response to the scent. It smells somewhat artificial. Kind of like a cheap body spray you might find at Victorias Secret, not a bad smell, just not natural or necessarily pleasant. It may smell nice to someone who likes using a lot of products tho. I&#x27;m more a Dr. Bronners natural kind of girl, plus I have a sensitive sense of smell, and this product reminds me of other chemical scents. That said, the way it makes my hair look - awesome! - is far more important &amp; I&#x27;ll probably order it again as it is honestly the best performing serum I have ever used. Far better than anything you can pick up at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> Smells so great! My former hairdresser used this and recommended it.  I bought some from her and when mine ran out I bought another one on Amazon.  Just love the smell and it makes my hair shiny and smooth.  I use it on my hands too.....just heavenly.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.  Keeps my hair tame and manageble!  I have used this for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Just received my shipment and tried out the hair oil this morning.  For the record, I&#x27;ve used argan oil, as well as other hair oils prior to trying this one.  This serum may be OK for my hair, but the scent is so overwhelming that it&#x27;s hard to get over it.  All other hair oils I&#x27;ve tried have had gentle, mostly herbal, scents.  This one is strong and musky, reminiscent of my grandmother&#x27;s perfume (Taboo).  Yikes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many many years...and is very difficult to find on regular stores.&lt;br /&gt;After use this your hair shines and with control-frizz. leave your hair really soft at touch and ready to style or after style (just to put on the ends).  great smell.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a product that never fail to please....it adds shine and luster to my hair and helps&lt;br /&gt;Tremendously with humidity friz</li>
            <li> I been using this product like 10 years or more. If doesn&#x27;t change. leave your hair shine,. soft, and the smell amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for those of us with thin hair that tends to frizz. Unlike other products that weigh your hair down and make it greasy, this serum gives you a lightweight shine that lasts for days. And the smell, oh the smell. Devine!! I love Alfaparf.</li>
            <li> Love this hair serum.  The smell is so good I use it for a perfume also.  Great for the hair.</li>
            <li> I have already recommended my family and friends . You are doing a great job Thanks again</li>
            <li> I have seriously curly hair!  My hairdresser cringes when I tell him I want a blowout and to straighten it with a flat iron (he loves my curly hair).  He used the Cristalli Liquidi product but I call it \\&quot;hair crack\\&quot; on my hair and since then I have been hooked!  I can not go without it!  Because of my thick long curls I wash every other to 2 days apart and it does not leave my hair greasy at all.  The scent of this product is FAB-U-LOUS!! I have tried so many products before but I am so very happy with this one.  Please do not stop making it!</li>
            <li> love this!!! I use it everyday!! Smells so good! Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Great product! And fast shipping</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST KEPT SECRET FOR THE HAIR.  ADDS SHINE, BODY AND CAN BE USED ON WET OR DRY HAIR.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> I love the Alfaparf products, and decided to order this serum based on the reviews. Could not wait to try it, and I love, love it, am so happy I made the purchase. I applied it to my hair, and it made such a difference....made my hair soo sooo soft, shiny and great smelling. Now, 6 hours later and my hair is still so soft and smells beautiful. I had read in one of the reviews, that she had purchased it for the fragrance, and I agree. I could absolutely wear this as a body oil, but love very much what it does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely make another purchase...and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product have been using for two years now and use about a bottle a year, but my hair in general is pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> I like the oil, but I may be using too much. My hair now is super soft. It does help the shine. I my end up giving this a 5 star later once I get the amount right. Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Several years ago my hair stylist recommended this product after I complained that my hair lacks shine shortly after I wash it at home.  I originally purchased this product at his salon and used it the next time I did my own hair.  By using only a few drops at a time on either dry or damp hair, it gave a beautiful shine while at the same time giving off a very pleasant aroma which only got better as I finished the drying process.  Unfortunately my salon d/c carrying the product, however I was able to find it on Amazon and have ordered 2 bottles which arrived ahead  of schedule and at an excellent price.  I strongly recommend this product for anyone desiring shiny hair w/o having to pay a fortune for hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> A hairdresser used this on my hair for my daughter&#x27;s weddding in Arizona-April 2011. I got so many compliments on my hair that I made a call to the salon when I got back home to Iowa.They offered to mail it to me for about twice as much as it cost on Amazon!I still hesitated when I found it on Amazon because of the amount of product but you only use a small amount -so it will last a long time.It adds a lot of shine and makes my hair look darker.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of this serum to add shine and smoothness to your hair.  It does not weigh down your hairstyle but gives it movement.</li>
            <li> This is THE most amazing anti-frizz end-mender serum ever. Just a tiny bit, 2 or 3 pumps, spread on your hands and to the ends of your hair. It makes my hair incredibly soft, smooth, touchable, with no frizz or tangles. Does not weight my hair down or grease it. And I have ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li> By far, one of the best serums available! Light, great shine and definition, tames frizz and clients love the scent! I call it my &amp;#34;miracle drops&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Keeps my hair shiny without frizz..  As same as at the hairdressers, but costs much less.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my alfaparf serum</li>
            <li> Nice scent that stays all day. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair. Very economical and I will continue using this. I highly recomment it ot my coworkers and friends.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have tried this before and loved it. I was excited when I found the item. AWESOME and smells unbelivable</li>
            <li> Love the product. Smells wonderful and makes Your hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Got the product super fast. Just love the product! love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair serum I have ever used. Fragrance is pleasant, purchased it on vacation in Italy the first time it lasted for years happy to find it on Amazon. Softens hair smooths flyaway&#x27;s and frizz. Holds up to humidity.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and smells like heaven...my hair always feels great when I use it :)</li>
            <li> To say this product is amazing is an understatement. I cannot live without this product and i dont know how i lived without it before. I sound like a commercial lol. But anyway i just take a few drops and put it in towel dried hair so it protects it from heat. And even when my hair is dry ill put it in. This version is better than the diamante with the shiney/sparkly things in it. I use so much of this product and ive BARELY put a dent in it. Try it you wont regret.</li>
            <li> Excellent product~!  I have been using this for years and always re-order.  its the only thing that helps my crazy frizzy fly aways!</li>
