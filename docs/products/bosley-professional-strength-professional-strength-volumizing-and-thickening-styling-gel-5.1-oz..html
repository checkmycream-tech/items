            <li>I&#x27;m happy I can purchase this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy and satisfied with Bosley Volumizing and Thickening Styling Gel</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Easy to style and work with and thickens hair up nice.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Perfectly described and received when expected!  </li>
            <li>works great for my short, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>there are far better products out there!</li>
            <li>Just the right consistency and holds sufficiently after styling.</li>
            <li>But not the best gel for heavy flat hair where you are trying to get volume.</li>
            <li>there are other products in the market that give a more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and full effect at comparable market pricing.</li>
            <li>Only used it once and hope as I continue using it my fine hair improves.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditionerok, but the thickening gel really does nothing.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, not much flaking, or residue in my hair.  </li>
            <li>The hair on the top of my head is even more thin.  </li>
            <li>Used only once so far, but it gives my hair more body</li>
            <li>Good gel if you want to slick your hair back for a tux event.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 years and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>Wrapping of product as well as shipping was very professionally done.  </li>
            <li>I would say if you want your hair to stay a certain way you don&#x27;t even need hair spray if your hair is short.  </li>
            <li>Even though paid less than the shipping fees for the product (special promotion),  </li>
            <li>I mix a tiny amount with the thickening mousse to give my fine thinning hair some volume and a little body.</li>
            <li>I have really thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Really, &amp;#34;a little dab will do &#x27;ya.&amp;#34;</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have really thin fine hair.  The hair on the top of my head is even more thin.  Using this product makes my hair look thicker with more body and helps me achieve a salon style that my stylist is unable to achieve. It does not thicken the hair it just makes it look fuller and easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> Perfectly described and received when expected!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Works well and does give you volume.</li>
            <li> Used only once so far, but it gives my hair more body</li>
            <li> Wrapping of product as well as shipping was very professionally done.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 years and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. I&#x27;m happy I can purchase this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not too thick and sticky.  Just the right consistency and holds sufficiently after styling.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s not too heavy for my thinning hair but gives it lots of body. I can actually forego wearing a  hairpiece when I go out.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Put some in your hair and turn on the hair dryer and your hair will volumize. Easy to style and work with and thickens hair up nice.</li>
            <li> I;ll have to see about the hair loss part of this, I&#x27;ll try another two months and see how it works</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditionerok, but the thickening gel really does nothing. I wouwouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Steven</li>
            <li> Worst gel I ever used.  Thin and watery and once I put a comb to it, its holding power disappeared.  I threw it out.  Wasted ten bucks.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and satisfied with Bosley Volumizing and Thickening Styling Gel</li>
            <li> I have only been using this every day for about 1 month along with the conditioner and thickening styling gel.  So far so good. I&#x27;m using it with henna black coloring as well as Rogaine. My hair feels fuller and thicker. I have been using Rogaine for about 1 year. This shampoo seems to be working well in combination. The shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling tingly and invigorated.  Losing very little if any hair and new growth is appearing on the balding area at the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> This hair gel is the strongest I have ever put on my hair.  I would say if you want your hair to stay a certain way you don&#x27;t even need hair spray if your hair is short.  I cannot find this product locally so Amazon is the place to go!</li>
            <li> Great product. Good quality. Good price</li>
            <li> ...very strange product it covers your head and leaves serious residue ,Im not buying this again...there are far better products out there!</li>

            <li> I mix a tiny amount with the thickening mousse to give my fine thinning hair some volume and a little body.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this helps</li>
            <li> Light weight for my thin hair, controls frizz.</li>
            <li> Goes on well.  Doesn&#x27;t give those too stiff hair results - and at same time gives the hair the body it needs.  Only used it once and hope as I continue using it my fine hair improves.</li>
            <li> Chose product since Bosley does hair implants and thought product would have same philosophy in &amp;#34;augmenting&amp;#34; hair on the scalp.  Even though paid less than the shipping fees for the product (special promotion),  there are other products in the market that give a more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and full effect at comparable market pricing.</li>
            <li> gel is not that thick. Good gel if you want to slick your hair back for a tux event. But not the best gel for heavy flat hair where you are trying to get volume.</li>
