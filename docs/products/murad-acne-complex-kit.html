            <li>Great for my acne problems.</li>
            <li>It feels great, but I am convinced that it lessens the effect of the treatment</li>
            <li>However, still happy with the product.</li>

            <li>Great products but strong.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very pleased with this product and was amazed I was able to get it for her online at a good price.</li>
            <li>and we will talk about the best BC to put me on.&lt;br /&gt;Using it day and night really helps.</li>
            <li>those were a nice addition.</li>
            <li>So far I am VERY impressed.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best skin care product I have ever used</li>
            <li>I ve been using this for 3 years now and its the best so far.  </li>
            <li>He likes this best, we have ordered this twice so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective right now</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I believe the alpha hydroxy in this regime is what probably is having the most effect</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It never got better.</li>
            <li>It produced more whiteheads, which I chalked up to the fact that it was trying to rid my face of impurities, which wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>yes because she&#x27;s is better</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>are way to many steps involved in using this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So pleased.</li>
            <li>Her skin felt nice and smooth and she could see her skin was clearing up</li>
            <li>I used Proactive before but Murad Acne Treatment Kit is a lot better and shows results in just a couple of days</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>However, this stuff is bottled magic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Murad because now I love my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed that using &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34; morning AND night was causing more irritation, and thus more breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better, feels better, and doesn&#x27;t create breakout inconsistency.</li>
            <li>However, I went on vacation and could not lug the precious liquid with me on the airplane</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>i feel they should/could have given you more wipes if they are going to suggest doing the routine twice a day</li>
            <li>it even tingles after you use the wipes and it feels so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>more acne is cropping up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy I finally found something.</li>
            <li>but it is a lot better than what it was.</li>
            <li>Plan on ordering this again for sure .</li>
            <li>The wash is so refreshing, and the moisturizer is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthier and I feel better about my appearance.</li>
            <li>I love the face wash and wipes the most...</li>
            <li>not so sure about the gel as it makes my face look like it&#x27;s dripping oil and the spot treatment</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not so sure whether I&#x27;ll buy it again or not.</li>
            <li>maybe it works better for you.</li>
            <li>I love this package &amp; I will being buying it over &amp; over for now on.</li>
            <li>It was great for a week, cleared my skin and made it feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that a variety of kits were available here on amazon.</li>
            <li>The facial wash is also really great along with the whole kit!!!!</li>
            <li>, you need to be aware of your own skin type.</li>
            <li>It is really worthy to recommend it to someone else because it is good quality and not very expensive too.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a huge difference with my acne though.</li>
            <li>I would suggest going with Cetaphil, and benzol peroxide cream and a light oil free moisturizer .</li>
            <li>She has been using it every day and her skin is really looking nice.</li>
            <li>Murad supposedly has a great reputation but this is the second product I purchase from them that does not work.</li>
            <li>so make sure to invest in a good scrub and facial mask if you&#x27;re using this product.</li>
            <li>Originally I found that I did not like this product.</li>
            <li>blemishes were reduced significantly in a week.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and packed securely.</li>
            <li>Made my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li>, I was just looking for a product that would keep my skin clean and keep the outbreaks at bay/</li>
            <li>Since there are many positive reviews here, my daughter decided to Murad.  </li>
            <li>I used it when I was younger and loved it.</li>
            <li>(the good kind, the normal dry, not flaky).</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t as oily as a many other types of skin, and I think this would be even better for more oily-skinned individuals.</li>
            <li>If this product didn&#x27;t contain a chemical that is linked to women&#x27;s diseases, I would have given this product 5 stars and been a loyal user for life.</li>
            <li>I started out with mild acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with mild acne all my life and now that I&#x27;m over 30</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over half a month and its been working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks for reading my review!!</li>
            <li>shipping was fast, will order again and again and again and again!!</li>
            <li>the first week you use it, you will feel your skin being cleaned!</li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;ve come to learn that I have more sensitive skin that thrives on moisture.</li>
            <li>My arsenal of skin products was not cutting it.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks I had nearly blemish free skin!</li>
            <li>That aside, it didn&#x27;t bring as good of results as I expected it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 1% salicylic acid, just strong enough to work, but not too strong that it burns or dries up your skin...</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like flat Sierra Mist or 7-UP soda.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I had spend hundreds of dollars trying to find the right products that would treat my skin issues.</li>
            <li>and I love this Murad line only thing to ever clear my skin cystic acne even better than prescriptions.</li>
            <li>I love how gentle it is and how soft my skin is now!</li>
            <li>arrived early which is good but its only a 3 day supply, it looks like a 30 day its not, its a rip off!  </li>
            <li>I love the product because I am of mix race and have a very funny acting skin.it works better than other product I have bought from  other companies and got from the doctor ,it  has met my expectations and more!!</li>
            <li>I still use most of the products daily.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first kit from the spa and eventually finished the products.</li>
            <li>Once purchasing this, I noticed that within the first three days, like the package claims, my breakouts improved.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel smooth, and it like makes it soft.</li>
            <li>It never cleared my face up, even for the first three days like some have said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I could find her something that actually seems to work.</li>
            <li>It finally started getting better after I stopped using it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have know so damn much about this topic!</li>
            <li>Love the product already seeing a difference in my facial complexion THANKS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Murad, so was hoping it would be better.</li>
            <li>Murad&#x27;s cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic is in the second step of this kit: the treatment gel.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t apply it everywhere because it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>After using it for a month I realized this really works!</li>
            <li>I guess I spoke too soon when I said I didn&#x27;t care for it at first...</li>
            <li>I love it and buying my 2nd kit!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what it was supposed to be</li>
            <li>First time I had ordered this kit with the face wipes...</li>
            <li>Within the first 3 days it DOES make a difference in your acne.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that they give you 15 wipes</li>
            <li>so dont use two wipes a day (since you will run out in the first week).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that they are smaller because they still are able to coat my face.  </li>
            <li>and at first I had breakouts for the first 4 days</li>
            <li>This started working the first week.</li>
            <li>If it worked extraordinarily well with controlling new breakouts then maybe I would have managed with the smell</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and breakouts are kept to a minimum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it works, and in my experience, it worked fast.</li>
            <li>When you use the lotion and the gel, it makes your face very shiny.</li>
            <li>It really irritates my skin, but salicylic acid does wonders for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping him and we noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>After i am done with the kit i will post another review to let everyone know how much it cleared up through the kit</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use much moisturizer</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to depend on your face type, but I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My face is much clearer though don&#x27;t expect all acne to go away.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the supply of this product lasts much longer than the box claims.</li>
            <li>I really like the wipes.</li>
            <li>I was a victim of adult onset acne and this is the only system that has given me such incredible and consistent results.</li>
            <li>I am on the 2nd week using it and am still seeing good results even though they aren&#x27;t as drastic as the results of the first few days.  </li>
            <li>It really does smooth your skin out, cleared my acne, and makes my face matte and dry</li>
            <li>but it is not bad enough for me to stop using the product.</li>
            <li>My murad products were sealed and brand new !</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what any acne sufferer is really looking for...to control new break outs.</li>
            <li>It costs less than Murad and you get sO much more for your dollar.</li>
            <li>and it works much better for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>My main concern right now is what if this stuff continues to make things worse or ceases to be effective?  </li>
            <li>The Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because the wipes are pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that switching moisturizers every once in a while can be helpful, as the skin invites new change with lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once my skin got used to Murad again, any new zits were gone in a day with the spot treatment.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t prevent new breakouts from emerging.</li>
            <li>Adult acne is so bad and this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the clear skin to price ratio I experienced with Proactiv+ was not what I had hoped.</li>
            <li>and I expected a lot more for such a pricey product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear!.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that I have been breaking out more than usual.  </li>
            <li>I started breaking up more than usual so out of recommendation, i ordered this kit.  </li>
            <li>The acne on my cheeks isn&#x27;t completely gone but is well on its way!</li>
            <li>I expected my skin to break out more and &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; when I first started using this, but after continuing to use this for a few months with no progress, I had to stop.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is gentle and not over drying, the gel is a little odd but works amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen my face so clear.</li>
            <li>My skin is now completely clear; it&#x27;s now been 3 weeks since I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it works to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>My acne didn&#x27;t clear up one bit, but at least I didn&#x27;t break out more.</li>
            <li>My face just feels natural.</li>
            <li>I was referred by the esthetician at the day spa near my home.</li>
            <li>Then my skin cleared up almost completely for about a month.  </li>
            <li>My 16 year old &#x27;s face has improved</li>
            <li>In about 4 weeks, my acne cleared up completely.</li>
            <li>My daughter was using acne.org and, while it was working, it wasn&#x27;t doing a complete job of getting rid of her acne.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that works for keeping my skin clear!!!</li>
            <li>When I first started using it my skin got really dry and broke out some, but as I continued using it the dryness went away</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really use the moisturizer much except around my eyes and throat area...and when the air is a little drier I use it all over.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the smell of the product could be better</li>
            <li>My skin never feels dry, irritated, or red when I use it and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>We have had a particularly stressful month though (death in the family), so it is not unexpected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 months, long enough to know if it really delivers on it&#x27;s promises.  </li>
            <li>I actually question the possibility of it being Elmer&#x27;s clear glue.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that I had the 3 day clear skin that the packaging suggests, but I definitely saw results in about two weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 37 year old woman with moderate acne.</li>
            <li>it barely helped my acne.</li>
            <li>I was warned that it would be worse before it got better.</li>
            <li>But sure enough it is slowly reverting back to the pesky severe acne that I&#x27;ve had since I was 13.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s gone back to acne.org and her face is finally starting to clear again after about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 days, my skin became much clearer, but it took about a week and a half to get the big zits to completely go away.</li>
            <li>My skin is still not completely, 100 % clear</li>
            <li>Instead, it dried my face out, so much so, that my face started peeling and cracking, on top of being red and broken out.</li>
            <li>Read other reviews of how fast it work, but I guess everyone is different with different situations.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>The only thing I would suggest is getting the Oil-Control Mattifier Moisturizer with SPF 15 to use instead of the moisturizer it comes with, it really helps cut down the oil.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> He likes this best, we have ordered this twice so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective right now</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I believe the alpha hydroxy in this regime is what probably is having the most effect</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It never got better.</li>
            <li> It produced more whiteheads, which I chalked up to the fact that it was trying to rid my face of impurities, which wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> yes because she&#x27;s is better</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> are way to many steps involved in using this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So pleased.</li>
            <li> Her skin felt nice and smooth and she could see her skin was clearing up</li>
            <li> I used Proactive before but Murad Acne Treatment Kit is a lot better and shows results in just a couple of days</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> However, this stuff is bottled magic.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Murad because now I love my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed that using &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34; morning AND night was causing more irritation, and thus more breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works better, feels better, and doesn&#x27;t create breakout inconsistency.</li>
            <li> However, I went on vacation and could not lug the precious liquid with me on the airplane</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> i feel they should/could have given you more wipes if they are going to suggest doing the routine twice a day</li>
            <li> it even tingles after you use the wipes and it feels so refreshing.  </li>
            <li> more acne is cropping up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I finally found something.</li>
            <li> but it is a lot better than what it was.</li>
            <li> Plan on ordering this again for sure .</li>
            <li> The wash is so refreshing, and the moisturizer is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier and I feel better about my appearance.</li>
            <li> I love the face wash and wipes the most...</li>
            <li> not so sure about the gel as it makes my face look like it&#x27;s dripping oil and the spot treatment</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not so sure whether I&#x27;ll buy it again or not.</li>
            <li> maybe it works better for you.</li>
            <li> I love this package &amp; I will being buying it over &amp; over for now on.</li>
            <li> It was great for a week, cleared my skin and made it feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that a variety of kits were available here on amazon.</li>
            <li> The facial wash is also really great along with the whole kit!!!!</li>
            <li> , you need to be aware of your own skin type.</li>
            <li> It is really worthy to recommend it to someone else because it is good quality and not very expensive too.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a huge difference with my acne though.</li>
            <li> I would suggest going with Cetaphil, and benzol peroxide cream and a light oil free moisturizer .</li>
            <li> She has been using it every day and her skin is really looking nice.</li>
            <li> Murad supposedly has a great reputation but this is the second product I purchase from them that does not work.</li>
            <li> so make sure to invest in a good scrub and facial mask if you&#x27;re using this product.</li>
            <li> Originally I found that I did not like this product.</li>
            <li> blemishes were reduced significantly in a week.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and packed securely.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li> , I was just looking for a product that would keep my skin clean and keep the outbreaks at bay/</li>
            <li> Since there are many positive reviews here, my daughter decided to Murad.  </li>
            <li> I used it when I was younger and loved it.</li>
            <li> (the good kind, the normal dry, not flaky).</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t as oily as a many other types of skin, and I think this would be even better for more oily-skinned individuals.</li>
            <li> If this product didn&#x27;t contain a chemical that is linked to women&#x27;s diseases, I would have given this product 5 stars and been a loyal user for life.</li>
            <li> I started out with mild acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with mild acne all my life and now that I&#x27;m over 30</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over half a month and its been working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks for reading my review!!</li>
            <li> shipping was fast, will order again and again and again and again!!</li>
            <li> the first week you use it, you will feel your skin being cleaned!</li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;ve come to learn that I have more sensitive skin that thrives on moisture.</li>
            <li> My arsenal of skin products was not cutting it.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks I had nearly blemish free skin!</li>
            <li> That aside, it didn&#x27;t bring as good of results as I expected it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1% salicylic acid, just strong enough to work, but not too strong that it burns or dries up your skin...</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like flat Sierra Mist or 7-UP soda.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I had spend hundreds of dollars trying to find the right products that would treat my skin issues.</li>
            <li> and I love this Murad line only thing to ever clear my skin cystic acne even better than prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I love how gentle it is and how soft my skin is now!</li>
            <li> arrived early which is good but its only a 3 day supply, it looks like a 30 day its not, its a rip off!  </li>
            <li> I love the product because I am of mix race and have a very funny acting skin.it works better than other product I have bought from  other companies and got from the doctor ,it  has met my expectations and more!!</li>
            <li> I still use most of the products daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first kit from the spa and eventually finished the products.</li>
            <li> Once purchasing this, I noticed that within the first three days, like the package claims, my breakouts improved.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel smooth, and it like makes it soft.</li>
            <li> It never cleared my face up, even for the first three days like some have said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I could find her something that actually seems to work.</li>
            <li> It finally started getting better after I stopped using it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have know so damn much about this topic!</li>
            <li> Love the product already seeing a difference in my facial complexion THANKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Murad, so was hoping it would be better.</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic is in the second step of this kit: the treatment gel.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t apply it everywhere because it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> After using it for a month I realized this really works!</li>
            <li> I guess I spoke too soon when I said I didn&#x27;t care for it at first...</li>
            <li> I love it and buying my 2nd kit!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what it was supposed to be</li>
            <li> First time I had ordered this kit with the face wipes...</li>
            <li> Within the first 3 days it DOES make a difference in your acne.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that they give you 15 wipes</li>
            <li> so dont use two wipes a day (since you will run out in the first week).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that they are smaller because they still are able to coat my face.  </li>
            <li> and at first I had breakouts for the first 4 days</li>
            <li> This started working the first week.</li>
            <li> If it worked extraordinarily well with controlling new breakouts then maybe I would have managed with the smell</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft and breakouts are kept to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it works, and in my experience, it worked fast.</li>
            <li> When you use the lotion and the gel, it makes your face very shiny.</li>
            <li> It really irritates my skin, but salicylic acid does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping him and we noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> After i am done with the kit i will post another review to let everyone know how much it cleared up through the kit</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use much moisturizer</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to depend on your face type, but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My face is much clearer though don&#x27;t expect all acne to go away.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the supply of this product lasts much longer than the box claims.</li>
            <li> I really like the wipes.</li>
            <li> I was a victim of adult onset acne and this is the only system that has given me such incredible and consistent results.</li>
            <li> I am on the 2nd week using it and am still seeing good results even though they aren&#x27;t as drastic as the results of the first few days.  </li>
            <li> It really does smooth your skin out, cleared my acne, and makes my face matte and dry</li>
            <li> but it is not bad enough for me to stop using the product.</li>
            <li> My murad products were sealed and brand new !</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what any acne sufferer is really looking for...to control new break outs.</li>
            <li> It costs less than Murad and you get sO much more for your dollar.</li>
            <li> and it works much better for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> My main concern right now is what if this stuff continues to make things worse or ceases to be effective?  </li>
            <li> The Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because the wipes are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that switching moisturizers every once in a while can be helpful, as the skin invites new change with lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once my skin got used to Murad again, any new zits were gone in a day with the spot treatment.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t prevent new breakouts from emerging.</li>
            <li> Adult acne is so bad and this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the clear skin to price ratio I experienced with Proactiv+ was not what I had hoped.</li>
            <li> and I expected a lot more for such a pricey product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clear!.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that I have been breaking out more than usual.  </li>
            <li> I started breaking up more than usual so out of recommendation, i ordered this kit.  </li>
            <li> The acne on my cheeks isn&#x27;t completely gone but is well on its way!</li>
            <li> I expected my skin to break out more and &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; when I first started using this, but after continuing to use this for a few months with no progress, I had to stop.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is gentle and not over drying, the gel is a little odd but works amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen my face so clear.</li>
            <li> My skin is now completely clear; it&#x27;s now been 3 weeks since I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it works to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> My acne didn&#x27;t clear up one bit, but at least I didn&#x27;t break out more.</li>
            <li> My face just feels natural.</li>
            <li> I was referred by the esthetician at the day spa near my home.</li>
            <li> Then my skin cleared up almost completely for about a month.  </li>
            <li> My 16 year old &#x27;s face has improved</li>
            <li> In about 4 weeks, my acne cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> My daughter was using acne.org and, while it was working, it wasn&#x27;t doing a complete job of getting rid of her acne.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for keeping my skin clear!!!</li>
            <li> When I first started using it my skin got really dry and broke out some, but as I continued using it the dryness went away</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really use the moisturizer much except around my eyes and throat area...and when the air is a little drier I use it all over.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell of the product could be better</li>
            <li> My skin never feels dry, irritated, or red when I use it and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> We have had a particularly stressful month though (death in the family), so it is not unexpected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 months, long enough to know if it really delivers on it&#x27;s promises.  </li>
            <li> I actually question the possibility of it being Elmer&#x27;s clear glue.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that I had the 3 day clear skin that the packaging suggests, but I definitely saw results in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old woman with moderate acne.</li>
            <li> it barely helped my acne.</li>
            <li> I was warned that it would be worse before it got better.</li>
            <li> But sure enough it is slowly reverting back to the pesky severe acne that I&#x27;ve had since I was 13.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s gone back to acne.org and her face is finally starting to clear again after about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 days, my skin became much clearer, but it took about a week and a half to get the big zits to completely go away.</li>
            <li> My skin is still not completely, 100 % clear</li>
            <li> Instead, it dried my face out, so much so, that my face started peeling and cracking, on top of being red and broken out.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews of how fast it work, but I guess everyone is different with different situations.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is getting the Oil-Control Mattifier Moisturizer with SPF 15 to use instead of the moisturizer it comes with, it really helps cut down the oil.</li>
            <li> It took a week and a half for my face to calm down after I stopped using Murad.</li>
            <li> but we saw no  major difference till the 2nd week of use .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t react well to constantly having acne fighting products such as salicylic acid working all day long.</li>
            <li> And despite using Paula&#x27;s Choice BHA 2% and Resist products when I got back home, my skin wouldjust not clear back up...until Murad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had difficulty with acne and my face is super sensitive and is a difficult one to treat.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how much improvement I have in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> If it helps, i have dry to normal skin with small pimples on my forehead/ T zone and recently was getting moderate sized red pimples on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear up everything over night, but it did cut down the number of break-outs and severity.  </li>
            <li> Both of these build the skin back up, and if you&#x27;re not aware, salicylic acid (it&#x27;s the organic active ingredient in murad) breaks down old skin so that new cells can form.</li>
            <li> The texture became very rough and bumpy, she started breaking out in large whiteheads and cysts, her dark patches started returning, and it caused her skin to become extremely oily.  </li>
            <li> The spot treatment didn&#x27;t do shit to clear up zits.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and after a few weeks of using, have not had any dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I tried Murad because of other products of theirs I&#x27;ve tried and after a couple of days of using these products I saw a big change.  </li>
            <li> but I tried not to worry based on other reviews I read prior to using product.</li>
            <li> The products do not make your face feel too dry or oily.</li>
            <li> however i just cut each wipe in half giving me 30 smaller wipes.  </li>
            <li> I have a little bit of it left</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month so big props to lasting this long when the containers are this small.</li>
            <li> Even the small sized containers last a long time.</li>
            <li> The answer is: not really.  </li>
            <li> I humbly went back to Murad and it still works!</li>
            <li> This has also been my experience with proactiv and other over the counter acne treatments; your skin just gets acclimated to it until it just is producing no effect at all.  </li>
            <li> and she has tried lots of other products.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after just a week or two it absolutely destroyed her skin!  </li>
            <li> In a day I could see results that I haven&#x27;t seen in other products.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the 30 day kit, thinking the other products in the line might boost the effectiveness of the clarifying cleanser.  </li>
            <li> She kept using it for another week after that because all the products claim they&#x27;ll make your face break out a little at first and then clear up, but it just got worse, horrifyingly worse.  </li>
            <li> I went through the expected &#x27;purging&#x27; process where you get a lot of little surface breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it contains Parabans.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it can be a bit drying</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser smells like a hospital ward and the mattifier smells like a very strong insect repellent.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gone down as if I had the pimple there for a few days now</li>
            <li> If you are someone like me looking for something less harsh that prescription topicals, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> and She see little difference in her skin.</li>
            <li> Not worth the smell!</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of product and</li>
            <li> If and when I get a break-out I put the spot treatment on and believe it or not, the pimple has gone down by morning!</li>
            <li> and it made my face worse and all red and itchy.</li>
            <li> product was definitely a waste of my $40</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s not suffering from dryness or the sunburned look some harsh products cause .</li>
            <li> waste of money.  </li>
            <li> just go to a dermatologist and don&#x27;t waste your money trust me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying or harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s only been a week the kit has made things worse.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Initially it did make my skin worse</li>
            <li> I think the size of the kit is usual for a trial of the product</li>
            <li> The gel is weird, and it made my face sticky and gross.</li>
            <li> It made my face break out horribly, I don&#x27;t even want people to see me most days.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients are so helpful, it&#x27;s frustrating that the company feels they have to include an endocrine disruptor in their otherwise &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> but my skin did dry out real bad in the first week</li>
            <li> Made my face peel and enhanced my dark marks extremely irritating to my skin</li>
            <li> It does diminish the breakouts but the marks that stay behind are really dark</li>
            <li> I mention this because I had previously tried Peter Thomas Roth and that treatment gel burned and dried up my skin so bad, I had cracked and peeling skin that I had never experienced before and required me to use some heavy duty moisturizer to counter the drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spot treatment is solid.</li>
            <li> At least mine was shiny and sticky.</li>
            <li> I know that the box states to give this kit at least 2wks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I expected my skin to break out more and &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; when I first started using this, but after continuing to use this for a few months with no progress, I had to stop.  My skin never looked so horrible.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I started using these products about 3 days ago. I am in my 30&#x27;s and I have acne all over my face. So far I am VERY impressed. Existing acne is clearing up and my face feels great! The products do not make your face feel too dry or oily. My face just feels natural. Can&#x27;t wait to see how much improvement I have in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Keeps my skin looking good and my acne under control. I love how gentle it is and how soft my skin is now!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have never seen my face so clear. I keep getting compliments and I get asked what I am using. I heard of Murad from a you tuber that swears by this product. Will be my daily regiment forever.</li>
            <li> I found this product by the infomercial years ago. I&#x27;ve had lots of problems with acne since I was a teenage and this kit was the ONLY thing that worked. I had tried every cream and medication and had no luck. This product cleared my skin and kept it that way. I still use most of the products daily.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very pleased with this product and was amazed I was able to get it for her online at a good price.</li>
            <li> Within a week a notice the difference with my face. Would recommend it to anyone with Acne problem. Product Works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it works, and in my experience, it worked fast. I have sensitive skin and after a few weeks of using, have not had any dryness or irritation. It has improved the texture of my skin, appearance and cleared blemishes. My only complaint about this product is that it contains Parabans. The other ingredients are so helpful, it&#x27;s frustrating that the company feels they have to include an endocrine disruptor in their otherwise &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product. After doing some research, I believe the alpha hydroxy in this regime is what probably is having the most effect so I&#x27;m going to order an alpha hydroxy product without Parabans next time. If this product didn&#x27;t contain a chemical that is linked to women&#x27;s diseases, I would have given this product 5 stars and been a loyal user for life.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away.  It didn&#x27;t clear up everything over night, but it did cut down the number of break-outs and severity.  The only thing I would suggest is getting the Oil-Control Mattifier Moisturizer with SPF 15 to use instead of the moisturizer it comes with, it really helps cut down the oil.</li>
            <li> It is good product and does not try out the skin. I would purchase it again. I think the size of the kit is usual for a trial of the product</li>
            <li> It is really worthy to recommend it to someone else because it is good quality and not very expensive too.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and packed securely. I was referred by the esthetician at the day spa near my home. I purchased my first kit from the spa and eventually finished the products. I refused to pay the price that I paid at the salon again. I was pleased to see that a variety of kits were available here on amazon. The murad system works and is my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been the miracle cure we were hoping for . . . . yet.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has been using it for about 3 weeks and her skin is a bit worse. We have had a particularly stressful month though (death in the family), so it is not unexpected.  We haven&#x27;t reordered yet - we are waiting to see if her skin improves as life gets calmer.&lt;br /&gt;Update to follow.  :)</li>
            <li> I used this product for my very bad breakouts i was having and it made my face worse and all red and itchy. product was definitely a waste of my $40</li>
            <li> I started out with mild acne. Once purchasing this, I noticed that within the first three days, like the package claims, my breakouts improved. After the three days, it got worse. I was warned that it would be worse before it got better. It never got better. Once in a while it would for about a day, clearing a bit, but in reality it only brought on larger cystic acne in its place. The cleanser is good. It smells kind of like flat Sierra Mist or 7-UP soda. The gel is weird, and it made my face sticky and gross. The spot treatment didn&#x27;t do shit to clear up zits. The lotion is good, though. It does make your skin feel smooth, and it like makes it soft. Not when you use it with the gel, though. When you use the lotion and the gel, it makes your face very shiny. At least mine was shiny and sticky. Weird smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with neutrogena 3 step acne cleansing set. It really does smooth your skin out, cleared my acne, and makes my face matte and dry (the good kind, the normal dry, not flaky). Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either. It costs less than Murad and you get sO much more for your dollar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying the company got this product to me in great time. With that being said, I used Murad to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, just as directed. It never cleared my face up, even for the first three days like some have said. It produced more whiteheads, which I chalked up to the fact that it was trying to rid my face of impurities, which wasn&#x27;t the case. Instead, it dried my face out, so much so, that my face started peeling and cracking, on top of being red and broken out. It took a week and a half for my face to calm down after I stopped using Murad. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and what didn&#x27;t work for me, might work for you. Murad was another disappointment for me, all you can do is try it for yourself and see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 months, long enough to know if it really delivers on it&#x27;s promises.  The answer is: not really.  I went through the expected &#x27;purging&#x27; process where you get a lot of little surface breakouts.  It took 3 weeks for that to start to clear up, though after two weeks the worst of it was over.  Then my skin cleared up almost completely for about a month.  But sure enough it is slowly reverting back to the pesky severe acne that I&#x27;ve had since I was 13.  This has also been my experience with proactiv and other over the counter acne treatments; your skin just gets acclimated to it until it just is producing no effect at all.  Murad is no different.</li>
            <li> This product works better than everything my daughter has tried! I would definitely recommend this to someone that is having problems with acne! Great product!</li>
            <li> My 16 year old &#x27;s face has improved but we saw no  major difference till the 2nd week of use . Will we buy it again yes because she&#x27;s is better and she&#x27;s not suffering from dryness or the sunburned look some harsh products cause .</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin has never been so clear!.  When I first started using it my skin got really dry and broke out some, but as I continued using it the dryness went away and my skin has never been clearer.  I&#x27;m definitely glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> My bf has acne prone skin. It was a pain in the butt making him follow all the steps, but this stuff works. If you are diligent and follow it all, it works!!!!</li>
            <li> Acne hasn&#x27;t cleared up after a month of continuous use. Breakouts are getting worse. The Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because the wipes are pretty decent. I&#x27;ll continue to use Proactive.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I had been using Proactive for several years and was very disappointed by ths product.  The smell of the clear glue like substance used in bottle #2 was awful. I actually question the possibility of it being Elmer&#x27;s clear glue.&lt;br /&gt;There are way to many steps involved in using this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be useless. I went to the drugstore and bought cetaphil and it works much better for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this seller! Product is in perfect condition. My murad products were sealed and brand new ! So pleased. Everything arrived on time and nothing was damaged! I haven&#x27;t used the acne stuff yet but I do recall using it before and I know it worked before, so I am crossing my fingers that it is able to help with my acne again !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now about a year and my skin has been nearly flawless ever since. Even the small sized containers last a long time. I&#x27;m very happy with it and glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best skin care product I have ever used and Ive been battling with acne for over 15 years. My skin is super soft and breakouts are kept to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I recently turned 40 and I noticed that I have been breaking out more than usual.  I decided to give Murad a try and the product works. It made my pimples look smaller. The only negative is that it can be a bit drying but I still use this product.</li>
            <li> I had my heart set on using Proactiv + and that it was going to be my savior from the acne that had overtaken my face. Unfortunately, the clear skin to price ratio I experienced with Proactiv+ was not what I had hoped. A co-worker suggested I try Murad. I won&#x27;t say that I had the 3 day clear skin that the packaging suggests, but I definitely saw results in about two weeks. In about 4 weeks, my acne cleared up completely. I am very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> I bough this as a gift for my sister who has problems with acne and she said that within a week she already saw results.  Her skin felt nice and smooth and she could see her skin was clearing up and she has tried lots of other products.  I&#x27;m glad I could find her something that actually seems to work.</li>
            <li> Uh, I hated this product. It made my face break out horribly, I don&#x27;t even want people to see me most days. It finally started getting better after I stopped using it but it&#x27;s going to be a while to repair the damage it&#x27;s done to my skin.</li>
            <li> It was great for a week, cleared my skin and made it feel very soft. Then it&#x27;s like it lost it&#x27;s power. I&#x27;m a 37 year old woman with moderate acne. I would suggest going with Cetaphil, and benzol peroxide cream and a light oil free moisturizer . This set is bogus.</li>
            <li> I love the product because I am of mix race and have a very funny acting skin.it works better than other product I have bought from  other companies and got from the doctor ,it  has met my expectations and more!! my daughter loves it so I bought her some as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thanks for reading my review!!</li>
            <li> I used Proactive before but Murad Acne Treatment Kit is a lot better and shows results in just a couple of days</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It the only thing that works for me.  I ve been using this for 3 years now and its the best so far.  Amazon sells it at the best price. Massage envy is expensive don&#x27;t buy it there,</li>
            <li> Great for my acne problems.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. I am a senior with acne. I&#x27;m going to see a Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Proactiv basically ruined my skin- when I started Murad I was very skeptical. However, this stuff is bottled magic. I love it. My skin never feels dry, irritated, or red when I use it and it does exactly what it says. I love Murad because now I love my skin.</li>
            <li> arrived early which is good but its only a 3 day supply, it looks like a 30 day its not, its a rip off!  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over half a month and its been working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you need to be aware of your own skin type. For me, I&#x27;ve come to learn that I have more sensitive skin that thrives on moisture. It doesn&#x27;t react well to constantly having acne fighting products such as salicylic acid working all day long. I noticed that using &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34; morning AND night was causing more irritation, and thus more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you notice the same result, use step 2 only at night. Use the same cleanser in the morning, but just skip to step three, or replace it with another moisturizer that works for you. Mine is as cerave PM and st ives skin renewing body lotion. Both of these build the skin back up, and if you&#x27;re not aware, salicylic acid (it&#x27;s the organic active ingredient in murad) breaks down old skin so that new cells can form. I&#x27;ve also noticed that switching moisturizers every once in a while can be helpful, as the skin invites new change with lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I didn&#x27;t have know so damn much about this topic! But that&#x27;s the way my genes are set up...and you just gotta play the hand you&#x27;re dealt. If you are someone like me looking for something less harsh that prescription topicals, give this one a try. It works better, feels better, and doesn&#x27;t create breakout inconsistency.</li>
            <li> My daughter was using acne.org and, while it was working, it wasn&#x27;t doing a complete job of getting rid of her acne.  Since there are many positive reviews here, my daughter decided to Murad.  Unfortunately, after just a week or two it absolutely destroyed her skin!  The texture became very rough and bumpy, she started breaking out in large whiteheads and cysts, her dark patches started returning, and it caused her skin to become extremely oily.  She kept using it for another week after that because all the products claim they&#x27;ll make your face break out a little at first and then clear up, but it just got worse, horrifyingly worse.  She&#x27;s gone back to acne.org and her face is finally starting to clear again after about two weeks.  We&#x27;re sticking with that from now on.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne my entire life. Once I received my package, I tried it immediately. In a day I could see results that I haven&#x27;t seen in other products. Will definitely buy again, and continue using.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for keeping my skin clear!!! I use it twice a day and my face always feels refreshed!</li>
            <li> i think this stuff works well especially for a teen</li>
            <li> waste of money.  Only comes with tiny tubes and does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product already seeing a difference in my facial complexion THANKS! shipping was fast, will order again and again and again and again!!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes the way her skin feels after she uses this, but her acne is still quite visible.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Murad, so was hoping it would be better.</li>
            <li> I use Murad for skin and I both that for my niece and She see little difference in her skin. now is only wait and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I luv murad ...and much more at a non spa price!</li>
            <li> I had used this about 10 years ago when I had really bad acne and it worked for me then. I started breaking out again this summer and couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. My arsenal of skin products was not cutting it. I humbly went back to Murad and it still works! Within 3 days, my skin became much clearer, but it took about a week and a half to get the big zits to completely go away. My skin is now completely clear; it&#x27;s now been 3 weeks since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is very nice and foamy. I always remove makeup with an oil cleanser before I use Murad&#x27;s cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic is in the second step of this kit: the treatment gel. It&#x27;s 1% salicylic acid, just strong enough to work, but not too strong that it burns or dries up your skin...I mention this because I had previously tried Peter Thomas Roth and that treatment gel burned and dried up my skin so bad, I had cracked and peeling skin that I had never experienced before and required me to use some heavy duty moisturizer to counter the drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spot treatment is solid. It works. Once my skin got used to Murad again, any new zits were gone in a day with the spot treatment. Just don&#x27;t apply it everywhere because it&#x27;s pretty drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use the moisturizer much except around my eyes and throat area...and when the air is a little drier I use it all over. It feels great, but I am convinced that it lessens the effect of the treatment gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try ProActive years ago and found that I don&#x27;t respond well to benzoyl peroxide. It really irritates my skin, but salicylic acid does wonders for me. And I tend to use Paula&#x27;s Choice beta hydroxy acid (which is salicylic acid) 2% daily and it works to keep my skin clear. However, I went on vacation and could not lug the precious liquid with me on the airplane so I ended up breaking out when I got back home a week later. And despite using Paula&#x27;s Choice BHA 2% and Resist products when I got back home, my skin wouldjust not clear back up...until Murad. Thank you for listening.</li>
            <li> Originally I found that I did not like this product. After using it for a month I realized this really works! I have tried it all and when I bought this I had just gone to see my OBGYN to see if we could get on BC for my acne as I thought it was hormonal. I told her about this product and she said to keep using it and if it didn&#x27;t work then I could come back and we will talk about the best BC to put me on.&lt;br /&gt;Using it day and night really helps. If and when I get a break-out I put the spot treatment on and believe it or not, the pimple has gone down by morning! I mean it&#x27;s still there but it&#x27;s gone down as if I had the pimple there for a few days now and it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way to healing. That is how great this stuff is! I guess I spoke too soon when I said I didn&#x27;t care for it at first... I just needed to keep using it and give it a chance. I love it and buying my 2nd kit!</li>
            <li> it barely helped my acne. just go to a dermatologist and don&#x27;t waste your money trust me.</li>
            <li> My son has been dealing with acne for some years. Went to dermatologist and epiduo made it worst, red, dry, and peeling. Found this on Internet and read reviews. He likes this best, we have ordered this twice so far. It&#x27;s really helping him and we noticed the difference. Happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I had spend hundreds of dollars trying to find the right products that would treat my skin issues. I was a victim of adult onset acne and this is the only system that has given me such incredible and consistent results. It&#x27;s not drying or harsh on skin. Within two weeks I had nearly blemish free skin!</li>
            <li> Did not cure her acne</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what it was supposed to be and I love this Murad line only thing to ever clear my skin cystic acne even better than prescriptions.</li>
            <li> First time I had ordered this kit with the face wipes... those were a nice addition. Made my face feel so clean. Wish the package was bigger!</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for me. It does take at least a month to see results depending on how bad your acne is. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great products but strong. Works good in controlling acne. The spot treatment did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> This did not include the wipes as the picture indicated, but the products do treat acne well.</li>
            <li> I started breaking up more than usual so out of recommendation, i ordered this kit.  I LOVE IT.  It says use twice a day, but i only use it once.  Within the first 3 days it DOES make a difference in your acne.  I am on the 2nd week using it and am still seeing good results even though they aren&#x27;t as drastic as the results of the first few days.  Be aware that they give you 15 wipes so dont use two wipes a day (since you will run out in the first week).  i feel they should/could have given you more wipes if they are going to suggest doing the routine twice a day however i just cut each wipe in half giving me 30 smaller wipes.  I don&#x27;t mind that they are smaller because they still are able to coat my face.  The facial wash is also really great along with the whole kit!!!! the first week you use it, you will feel your skin being cleaned! it even tingles after you use the wipes and it feels so refreshing.  After i am done with the kit i will post another review to let everyone know how much it cleared up through the kit but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;-jessie&lt;br /&gt;ps.  If it helps, i have dry to normal skin with small pimples on my forehead/ T zone and recently was getting moderate sized red pimples on my cheeks.  The acne on my cheeks isn&#x27;t completely gone but is well on its way! the ones on my forehead are clearing up slightly but mainly the big difference i see on my forehead is smoother skin and tighter poores.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my face at all. I&#x27;ve always had difficulty with acne and my face is super sensitive and is a difficult one to treat. Thought I would give it a try, too bad it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I like how Murad makes my face feel when I use the cleaning products. I LOVE the moisturizer!!! I have not noticed a huge difference with my acne though. I feel like my acne has stayed the same.</li>
            <li> I started out just using the Murad clarifying cleanser...it hit a plateau of effectiveness after about 2wks.  So I decided to try the 30 day kit, thinking the other products in the line might boost the effectiveness of the clarifying cleanser.  Though it&#x27;s only been a week the kit has made things worse.  I can feel pimples underneath my skin and more acne is cropping up.  I know that the box states to give this kit at least 2wks. and that I might not see effectiveness until a month of use and I will use the rest of the kit.  My main concern right now is what if this stuff continues to make things worse or ceases to be effective?  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective right now and I expected a lot more for such a pricey product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27yrs. of age and I know there is no such thing as a miracle cure fore acne, I was just looking for a product that would keep my skin clean and keep the outbreaks at bay/lessen the duration of outbreaks.  This product has not done so yet.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been fighting acne for years now, seeing a dermatologist. So someone told me to try Murad. Did not help at all. I am soo sick of spending a forturne on medicines and nothing seems to work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with mild acne all my life and now that I&#x27;m over 30 I was fed up.  I tried Murad because of other products of theirs I&#x27;ve tried and after a couple of days of using these products I saw a big change.  The cleanser is gentle and not over drying, the gel is a little odd but works amazing.  I don&#x27;t really use much moisturizer but I do like this one.  I&#x27;m very happy I finally found something.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing. I used it when I was younger and loved it. I feel like they changed the formula. My acne didn&#x27;t clear up one bit, but at least I didn&#x27;t break out more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to depend on your face type, but I really like this product. My face is much clearer though don&#x27;t expect all acne to go away. My skin isn&#x27;t as oily as a many other types of skin, and I think this would be even better for more oily-skinned individuals. However, still happy with the product. Oh, and the supply of this product lasts much longer than the box claims. If you use it sparingly, expect the pack to last anywhere from 9-11 months.</li>
            <li> Initially it did make my skin worse but I tried not to worry based on other reviews I read prior to using product. However I did stop applying product twice a day to applying once a day at night. About two weeks after using the majority of my acne cleared. My skin is still not completely, 100 % clear but it is a lot better than what it was.</li>
            <li> Murad Kit arrived on time and is working great for my 16 year olds face.  She has been using it every day and her skin is really looking nice.</li>
            <li> Works well. blemishes were reduced significantly in a week. I really like the wipes. Plan on ordering this again for sure .</li>
            <li> Murad supposedly has a great reputation but this is the second product I purchase from them that does not work. My son used it for 30 days, did not see results. There was still some left over so my daughter used it and it did not change anything for her either...I know she did not use the 30 days but still some sort of difference should have shown for my son! No more Murad for us!</li>
            <li> The wash is so refreshing, and the moisturizer is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small set, but would definitely order a Murad Acne kit again!</li>
            <li> Made my breakout much much worse</li>
            <li> Made my face peel and enhanced my dark marks extremely irritating to my skin and I used as directed so it sucks</li>
            <li> Read other reviews of how fast it work, but I guess everyone is different with different situations.&lt;br /&gt;Not saying it is bad, just working a bit slow.</li>
            <li> Although my skin feels soft after using this product, the fragrances are horrible!  The cleanser smells like a hospital ward and the mattifier smells like a very strong insect repellent. Not worth the smell!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and at first I had breakouts for the first 4 days then it cleared up. My skin looks healthier and I feel better about my appearance. My only complaint is the smell of the product could be better but it is not bad enough for me to stop using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month so big props to lasting this long when the containers are this small. Just a little bit of product and you&#x27;re good. That aside, it didn&#x27;t bring as good of results as I expected it. It does diminish the breakouts but the marks that stay behind are really dark and it doesn&#x27;t prevent new breakouts from emerging. That&#x27;s what any acne sufferer is really looking for...to control new break outs. I love the face wash and wipes the most...not so sure about the gel as it makes my face look like it&#x27;s dripping oil and the spot treatment is the smelling culprit....it almost smells like vomit. If it worked extraordinarily well with controlling new breakouts then maybe I would have managed with the smell but it&#x27;s not worth it. I have a little bit of it left and I&#x27;m not so sure whether I&#x27;ll buy it again or not. I didn&#x27;t get a purging state or anything but my skin did dry out real bad in the first week so make sure to invest in a good scrub and facial mask if you&#x27;re using this product. Maybe it&#x27;s about different skins...it&#x27;s not as expensive online as it is in stores so I guess you can give it a shot maybe it works better for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I was using proactive and it wasn&#x27;t doing anything for my acne. This started working the first week. I didn&#x27;t start having acne until my 30s. Adult acne is so bad and this stuff is great! It&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals. I love it! Wish I would&#x27;ve tried it sooner</li>
            <li> A requested gift to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Murad cleared up my skin within days! I love this package &amp; I will being buying it over &amp; over for now on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any progress almost and it&#x27;s been over 2 weeks; I&#x27;m sticking to it though and being patient.</li>
