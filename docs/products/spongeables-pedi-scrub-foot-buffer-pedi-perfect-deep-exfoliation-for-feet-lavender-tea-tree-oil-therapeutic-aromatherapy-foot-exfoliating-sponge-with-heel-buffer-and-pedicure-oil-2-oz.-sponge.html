            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again, but I&#x27;m happy with my cheap 1 time purchase.</li>

            <li>The lather lasted well beyond 20 uses, and the sponge is nice to use.</li>

            <li>Smells great, foams well and makes my feet super smooth!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong in August!  </li>
            <li>love, love, love this scrubber/buffer!  </li>
            <li>The smell was really strong when I took these out of the outer package!  </li>
            <li>Very nice daily treat for my feet and a great price.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and they last more than the 20 washes advertised which is great!</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>My feet are in pretty great shape to begin with, I take great care of them, so I wasn&#x27;t asking much from this buffer.</li>
            <li>I love these for my feet.</li>
            <li>The product is just ok.</li>
            <li>and she loves it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the citron scent, but the lavender tea tree  is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product its ingenious</li>
            <li>This thing is cute and it works.</li>
            <li>I love to use these to exfoliate my ankles, legs and arms.</li>
            <li>Friends who have received these as a gift have been pleased.</li>
            <li>and my feet are supple and crack free!  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite product and I give as gifts as part of &amp;#34;Teresa&#x27;s favorite items&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is much more than twenty washes.</li>
            <li>but this really is more like a dual sided sponge.  </li>
            <li>It lasts about a month if you make sure it&#x27;s stored upright on the nubs.</li>
            <li>this is the best product especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my feet feel rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>This is ok...</li>
            <li>Depending on your problem areas, it might be better suited for those areas rather than the feet, IMHO.)</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>I do body scrubs a couple of times a week but want to scrub my feet daily so having this on the shower rack is perfect.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s reusable :)  </li>
            <li>I love these to take care of them.</li>
            <li>Mine has lasted much more than 20 washes.</li>
            <li>Love this pedi scrub and use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>While it does NOT remove all my calluses, it does help to soften them so that my Emjoi callus remover works better.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>My feet have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I used it for way more than 20 times.  </li>
            <li>I needed to start taking better care of my feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have to keep feet clean and a bit softer but it certainly isn&#x27;t all I need to keep my feet in great shape.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and the lather is rich.</li>
            <li>One reviewer said it would be great as a gift I totally agree anyone would love you!</li>
            <li>My feet are in pretty good shape -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, I love it !!</li>
            <li>The soft side of the sponge feels great, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love these little scrubbers, they just feel so great and smell so good.</li>
            <li>I was really happy that even by the end of the day, my feet were still soft.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it makes it easy to get between my toes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy;</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so easy to keep in the shower and work well in getting the calluses off.  </li>
            <li>but this one wasn&#x27;t too strong)</li>
            <li>Once the pretty smell and good stuff is gone I like to use them as quick  </li>
            <li>Eco-friendly and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>A great product to keep in the shower &amp; use daily.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates and makes my feet smooth</li>
            <li>These are great to give your feet some extra attention.  </li>
            <li>I use this in the shower every day and it really helps to keep my heels looking nice.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect little scrubbers for foot maintenance!  </li>
            <li>No more flakiness, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>The nubs are great for a massage and to keep the sponge dry between uses.</li>
            <li>In regards to cleaning and making the feel smell and feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Enjoy very much!</li>
            <li>Nothing too special.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great to use in the shower to get my feet clean and use as a buffer for rough skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like you can get the same amount of clean with some soap and a good exfoliating loofa/ sponge.</li>
            <li>The product description is accurate and it is well worth trying.</li>
            <li>it actually feels good).</li>
            <li>15 or more uses- absolutely.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it for more than a month now and its still foaming up very well</li>
            <li>It smells very good and does make my feet soft, but does not scrub enough for me.</li>
            <li>As for the pedi scrub foot buffer, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, very soapy (hence the 20+ washes), and has a nice soothing smell.</li>
            <li>Awesome and long lasting</li>
            <li>and I felt a difference after just the first use!  </li>
            <li>The flower shape is easy to hold in the shower when it is wet and it fits nicely in a soap holder.  </li>
            <li>They last for many more washes than advertized, are a bargain and make great small gifts.</li>
            <li>Maybe, because I am used to harsher foot scrubs, I don&#x27;t feel this buffer does a great job sloughing away dead skin and smoothing my heels.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I can get my money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li>It scrubs off the dead skin around my heels and makes them feel soft; and it smells wonderful too.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, and it last for a while...</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Do be aware that as someone with sensitive skin I can&#x27;t handle this myself without gloves on as it irritates my hands [the feet seem fine]; so you may want to have someone give you a foot massage with this!</li>
            <li>There is a coating of moisture that seems to stay on your feet after cleaning them, it does not feel greasy or sticky, but just the right amount of moisture your feet need.</li>
            <li>I even like to sue it on my calves right before I shave to exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on lavender scent, and this is very mild (fortunately.)  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re long lasting, and make it easy and pleasant to keep my feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This does not remove rough spots, soften, smooth or at all improve the condition of your feet I have liked almost every other product I have ever tried better</li>
            <li>Much kinder to his hands than Comet sink-cleanser!</li>
            <li>It smells so pretty</li>
            <li>what I do use is more then enough.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a foot saver!  </li>
            <li>feet have been a consistent problem each winter.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find them on here in multiple packs instead of buying singles at WalMart.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would help my heals throughout the hot desert summer.  </li>
            <li>This year for the first time my heals started to crack.  </li>
            <li>The soap in the sponge should last a really long time which I&#x27;m happy about.</li>
            <li>These are great all year long but essential in the summer sandal wearing time.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell, and it is nice to scrub my feet with it, but it is not hard enough to remove calluses.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>This much well for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Skin becomes very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soap on one end and a buffer on the other.  </li>
            <li>They always last more then 20 washes, my guess is that I&#x27;m not lathering them as much, but</li>
            <li>My feet feel super soft.</li>
            <li>These keep your feet super soft and even my toes feel luxurious.</li>
            <li>Outstanding buffer, works well on extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li>Love this for my dry heels from going barefoot in So.</li>
            <li>Makes a great present for friends who are not familiar with this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slippery.</li>
            <li>, this has really helped, would order one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pedi-scrubs</li>
            <li>My daughter (20 years) really likes these.</li>
            <li>It made my skin more rough</li>
            <li>The sponge lathers really well.</li>
            <li>The underside is great to massage my tired dogs at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>That said I really like it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a softter version of the rough side of the sponge you may use in your sink.  </li>
            <li>My daughter tried one and now wants one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>These really work well</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was inexpensive and if it didn&#x27;t work, I wouldn&#x27;t be out much money.</li>
            <li>I much like.</li>
            <li>and it definitely helps keep the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>They have soap in them so they are very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Love these foot scrub buffer , feet feel like I&#x27;ve had a professional pedicure and would order again in the future.</li>
            <li>They last a long time and are not hard but still do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Be very careful - using it in the shower (which most of us would do) makes for a *very* slippery situation.  </li>
            <li>They were OK, not dry or irritated, just sort of the same as before.</li>
            <li>I am forever a loyal customer and am buying one for when this one finally gives out.  </li>
            <li>This sponge smells nice, but the buffer isn&#x27;t rough enough to remove foot callouses.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the great job it did on my poor, messed up feet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the high reviews that others gave it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love these little foot scrubber sponges.</li>
            <li>I love this little sponge.  </li>
            <li>I woild love this product if the smell was a little lighter</li>
            <li>Just enough lather and just the right amount of exfoliation for me.</li>
            <li>After a week, my feet are smooth, pink and soft!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I found it while looking for the new foot peel thing.  </li>
            <li>I live in NYC and in the summer time I use these at the end of the day to wash my feet.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes since using these, but I don&#x27;t use them very often so that could be why.  </li>
            <li>My feet felt immediately smoother after the first use, and daily use keeps callouses away!  </li>
            <li>One side has soap and the other a scrubbing surface to make the feet both clean and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels fantastic after use and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>and i love the rough side for the rough part of my feet.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth pink side for lather and white side for scrub.</li>
            <li>I wear flip flops nearly all year</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything for your feet but a very short term fix.</li>
            <li>They work well and keep my feet soft in between pedicures.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that my feet were dramatically exfoliated or soft after use.</li>
            <li>The scrubby side is not harsh at all but does have some exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li>It stays fresh in the shower; just wet, scrub and rinse.</li>
            <li>Once all the soap is gone, they aren&#x27;t quite as rough as I&#x27;d like (they get rather flimsy), but they smell terrific and are absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li>but I figured this would be nice for keeping up my exfoliating regime everyday instead of every other day with the scrub.</li>
            <li>You can use the rough side to smooth out rough skin.  </li>
            <li>I would definetly recommend this product for anyone with similar condition(s) to mine, or anybody who just wants a softer feel to the sole.</li>
            <li>The aroma is not overwhelming, I think it could use a little more really.  </li>
            <li>One side is smooth and the other is rough.  </li>
            <li>and I need something more tough to scrub the callouses off my feet.</li>

            <li> it keeps my feet and legs feeling great and smells good too.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant, doesn&#x27;t fall apart, and gets the job done.</li>

            <li> Great for my feet, my kids love using it</li>
            <li> It works nicely and smells good.  </li>

            <li> I love these things!  </li>
            <li> They smell great and are easy to grip onto in the shower.  </li>
            <li> After one use of this my feet felt amazing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again, but I&#x27;m happy with my cheap 1 time purchase.</li>
            <li> Because of how functional the exfoliant portion is and how nice it smells</li>
            <li> The lather lasted well beyond 20 uses, and the sponge is nice to use.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my feet seem to need a good scrub most days.</li>
            <li> Very nice, light scent and sorta skin softening.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the many positive reviews</li>
            <li> Smells great, foams well and makes my feet super smooth!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong in August!  </li>
            <li> love, love, love this scrubber/buffer!  </li>
            <li> The smell was really strong when I took these out of the outer package!  </li>
            <li> Very nice daily treat for my feet and a great price.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and they last more than the 20 washes advertised which is great!</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li> My feet are in pretty great shape to begin with, I take great care of them, so I wasn&#x27;t asking much from this buffer.</li>
            <li> I love these for my feet.</li>
            <li> The product is just ok.</li>
            <li> and she loves it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the citron scent, but the lavender tea tree  is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product its ingenious</li>
            <li> This thing is cute and it works.</li>
            <li> I love to use these to exfoliate my ankles, legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Friends who have received these as a gift have been pleased.</li>
            <li> and my feet are supple and crack free!  </li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite product and I give as gifts as part of &amp;#34;Teresa&#x27;s favorite items&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It is much more than twenty washes.</li>
            <li> but this really is more like a dual sided sponge.  </li>
            <li> It lasts about a month if you make sure it&#x27;s stored upright on the nubs.</li>
            <li> this is the best product especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my feet feel rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> This is ok...</li>
            <li> Depending on your problem areas, it might be better suited for those areas rather than the feet, IMHO.)</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> I do body scrubs a couple of times a week but want to scrub my feet daily so having this on the shower rack is perfect.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s reusable :)  </li>
            <li> I love these to take care of them.</li>
            <li> Mine has lasted much more than 20 washes.</li>
            <li> Love this pedi scrub and use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> While it does NOT remove all my calluses, it does help to soften them so that my Emjoi callus remover works better.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> My feet have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I used it for way more than 20 times.  </li>
            <li> I needed to start taking better care of my feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have to keep feet clean and a bit softer but it certainly isn&#x27;t all I need to keep my feet in great shape.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and the lather is rich.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said it would be great as a gift I totally agree anyone would love you!</li>
            <li> My feet are in pretty good shape -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, I love it !!</li>
            <li> The soft side of the sponge feels great, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love these little scrubbers, they just feel so great and smell so good.</li>
            <li> I was really happy that even by the end of the day, my feet were still soft.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> , it makes it easy to get between my toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so easy to keep in the shower and work well in getting the calluses off.  </li>
            <li> but this one wasn&#x27;t too strong)</li>
            <li> Once the pretty smell and good stuff is gone I like to use them as quick  </li>
            <li> Eco-friendly and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> A great product to keep in the shower &amp; use daily.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates and makes my feet smooth</li>
            <li> These are great to give your feet some extra attention.  </li>
            <li> I use this in the shower every day and it really helps to keep my heels looking nice.  </li>
            <li> These are perfect little scrubbers for foot maintenance!  </li>
            <li> No more flakiness, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> The nubs are great for a massage and to keep the sponge dry between uses.</li>
            <li> In regards to cleaning and making the feel smell and feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li> Enjoy very much!</li>
            <li> Nothing too special.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great to use in the shower to get my feet clean and use as a buffer for rough skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like you can get the same amount of clean with some soap and a good exfoliating loofa/ sponge.</li>
            <li> The product description is accurate and it is well worth trying.</li>
            <li> it actually feels good).</li>
            <li> 15 or more uses- absolutely.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it for more than a month now and its still foaming up very well</li>
            <li> It smells very good and does make my feet soft, but does not scrub enough for me.</li>
            <li> As for the pedi scrub foot buffer, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, very soapy (hence the 20+ washes), and has a nice soothing smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome and long lasting</li>
            <li> and I felt a difference after just the first use!  </li>
            <li> The flower shape is easy to hold in the shower when it is wet and it fits nicely in a soap holder.  </li>
            <li> They last for many more washes than advertized, are a bargain and make great small gifts.</li>
            <li> Maybe, because I am used to harsher foot scrubs, I don&#x27;t feel this buffer does a great job sloughing away dead skin and smoothing my heels.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I can get my money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li> It scrubs off the dead skin around my heels and makes them feel soft; and it smells wonderful too.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, and it last for a while...</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Do be aware that as someone with sensitive skin I can&#x27;t handle this myself without gloves on as it irritates my hands [the feet seem fine]; so you may want to have someone give you a foot massage with this!</li>
            <li> There is a coating of moisture that seems to stay on your feet after cleaning them, it does not feel greasy or sticky, but just the right amount of moisture your feet need.</li>
            <li> I even like to sue it on my calves right before I shave to exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on lavender scent, and this is very mild (fortunately.)  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long lasting, and make it easy and pleasant to keep my feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> This does not remove rough spots, soften, smooth or at all improve the condition of your feet I have liked almost every other product I have ever tried better</li>
            <li> Much kinder to his hands than Comet sink-cleanser!</li>
            <li> It smells so pretty</li>
            <li> what I do use is more then enough.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a foot saver!  </li>
            <li> feet have been a consistent problem each winter.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad to find them on here in multiple packs instead of buying singles at WalMart.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would help my heals throughout the hot desert summer.  </li>
            <li> This year for the first time my heals started to crack.  </li>
            <li> The soap in the sponge should last a really long time which I&#x27;m happy about.</li>
            <li> These are great all year long but essential in the summer sandal wearing time.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell, and it is nice to scrub my feet with it, but it is not hard enough to remove calluses.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> This much well for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Skin becomes very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soap on one end and a buffer on the other.  </li>
            <li> They always last more then 20 washes, my guess is that I&#x27;m not lathering them as much, but</li>
            <li> My feet feel super soft.</li>
            <li> These keep your feet super soft and even my toes feel luxurious.</li>
            <li> Outstanding buffer, works well on extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li> Love this for my dry heels from going barefoot in So.</li>
            <li> Makes a great present for friends who are not familiar with this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slippery.</li>
            <li> , this has really helped, would order one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pedi-scrubs</li>
            <li> My daughter (20 years) really likes these.</li>
            <li> It made my skin more rough</li>
            <li> The sponge lathers really well.</li>
            <li> The underside is great to massage my tired dogs at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> That said I really like it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like a softter version of the rough side of the sponge you may use in your sink.  </li>
            <li> My daughter tried one and now wants one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These really work well</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was inexpensive and if it didn&#x27;t work, I wouldn&#x27;t be out much money.</li>
            <li> I much like.</li>
            <li> and it definitely helps keep the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> They have soap in them so they are very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Love these foot scrub buffer , feet feel like I&#x27;ve had a professional pedicure and would order again in the future.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and are not hard but still do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful - using it in the shower (which most of us would do) makes for a *very* slippery situation.  </li>
            <li> They were OK, not dry or irritated, just sort of the same as before.</li>
            <li> I am forever a loyal customer and am buying one for when this one finally gives out.  </li>
            <li> This sponge smells nice, but the buffer isn&#x27;t rough enough to remove foot callouses.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the great job it did on my poor, messed up feet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the high reviews that others gave it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love these little foot scrubber sponges.</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge.  </li>
            <li> I woild love this product if the smell was a little lighter</li>
            <li> Just enough lather and just the right amount of exfoliation for me.</li>
            <li> After a week, my feet are smooth, pink and soft!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I found it while looking for the new foot peel thing.  </li>
            <li> I live in NYC and in the summer time I use these at the end of the day to wash my feet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes since using these, but I don&#x27;t use them very often so that could be why.  </li>
            <li> My feet felt immediately smoother after the first use, and daily use keeps callouses away!  </li>
            <li> One side has soap and the other a scrubbing surface to make the feet both clean and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels fantastic after use and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> and i love the rough side for the rough part of my feet.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth pink side for lather and white side for scrub.</li>
            <li> I wear flip flops nearly all year</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything for your feet but a very short term fix.</li>
            <li> They work well and keep my feet soft in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that my feet were dramatically exfoliated or soft after use.</li>
            <li> The scrubby side is not harsh at all but does have some exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li> It stays fresh in the shower; just wet, scrub and rinse.</li>
            <li> Once all the soap is gone, they aren&#x27;t quite as rough as I&#x27;d like (they get rather flimsy), but they smell terrific and are absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> but I figured this would be nice for keeping up my exfoliating regime everyday instead of every other day with the scrub.</li>
            <li> You can use the rough side to smooth out rough skin.  </li>
            <li> I would definetly recommend this product for anyone with similar condition(s) to mine, or anybody who just wants a softer feel to the sole.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not overwhelming, I think it could use a little more really.  </li>
            <li> One side is smooth and the other is rough.  </li>
            <li> and I need something more tough to scrub the callouses off my feet.</li>
            <li> After a long winter I only had to use my Peti Scrub Foot Buffer a few times and my feet were ready for sandals .....</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> What a bargain, especially if you compare it to the litany of products it replaces and how long it lasts!  </li>
            <li> last a very long time and soothes my feet&#x60;</li>
            <li> As I get older I find that my heels are very hard to keep soft.  </li>
            <li> In other words, a day or two later my feet feel the same as they did before using this.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim, turns out that they actually work, for whatever reason my feet get rough and calus</li>
            <li> I have been using it every time in the shower and have not really noticed a big change.</li>
            <li> I buy this and other spongeable products regularly.</li>
            <li> Just keep it dry (like you would a loofah or buff puff) between uses.</li>
            <li> The scrub side is not too abrasive but does the trick on dry, hardened skin.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my elbows and tops of my hands when they tend to get too dry.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry feet</li>
            <li> I like this sponge even though the rough side isn&#x27;t rough enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the green Pedi Scrubs at Walmart all the time, but apparently they don&#x27;t carry them anymore!</li>
            <li> You wet the sponge and rub your foot with the pink side.</li>
            <li> I still only use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> The soapy side softens and the scrubby side gets rid of rough skin.  </li>
            <li> I had been trying to get rid of some rough skin on my feet for a while.  </li>
            <li> This is not a great exfoliator, but it&#x27;s a decent sponge for foot-cleaning once it softens up.  </li>
            <li> Even though I do weekly because get ugly heels, this makes it so easy to do.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t last longer and are a little stiff initially due to the soap portion.</li>
            <li> It still let me down.</li>
            <li> (soak my feet for a half hour before using it, and soak for another half hour after).</li>
            <li> every shower I just scrub each foot with this buffer (which lasts longer than it says) for about half a minute on each foot.  </li>
            <li> If you have calluses that are thick, consider a callus remover and then keep dry cracked heels and calluses controlled with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do anything other than use this product a few times a week!  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this item locally in the past, but have been unable to find it recently.  </li>
            <li> The soap part melts away and you just toss away the little scrubber when that happens.</li>
            <li> and it really cleans our dirty feet</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few years now.</li>
            <li> U can get quite a few uses out of one sponge.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to take off any dead skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this everyday</li>
            <li> It is about half the size!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very hard sponge on one side and the other side is a nylon-type loofa, loaded with skin softeners.  </li>
            <li> It is a two sided spongy thing that has a thick lathering soap part on one size and a thin scrubby part on the other.</li>
            <li> When it says 20 + washes I pictured 20 thin little scrubs, that&#x27;s not what they mean.  </li>
            <li> I use scrub, foot files, and thick foot butter on them all the time -</li>
            <li> I got this based on reviews and after using it three times, I&#x27;m not very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good foot</li>
            <li> It starts out very hard</li>
            <li> It tickles really bad when scrubbing with this rough side of the sponge</li>
            <li> My feet weren&#x27;t in the worst shape by any means, but my heels get a little rough.  </li>
            <li> Why be selfish, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical when it comes to purchasing things online</li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Skin flaking off ur feet is hella annoying.</li>
            <li> and it gets worst during the winter months.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love! Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I love these for my feet. I gave a &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; colored one to my brother to keep at the garage sink to help get the grease out of the creases in his hands when he&#x27;s been &amp;#34;wrenching&amp;#34;!  Much kinder to his hands than Comet sink-cleanser!</li>
            <li> last a very long time and soothes my feet&#x60;</li>
            <li> I always keep one on my shower and use it every day.  One side has soap and the other a scrubbing surface to make the feet both clean and smoother.  A must have for anyone!</li>
            <li> This is not a great exfoliator, but it&#x27;s a decent sponge for foot-cleaning once it softens up.  It&#x27;s very slippery.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I wear flip flops nearly all year and I have battled with cracking heels forever) After one use of this my feet felt amazing. It is so easy to use. You wet the sponge and rub your foot with the pink side. Then you flip it over and scrub your foot with the white side (the white side is like a scrub pad but not too rough even for sensitive skin it actually feels good). I highly recommend getting this. One reviewer said it would be great as a gift I totally agree anyone would love you!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the high reviews that others gave it. The product is just ok. It doesn&#x27;t really do anything for your feet but a very short term fix. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim, turns out that they actually work, for whatever reason my feet get rough and calus, this has really helped, would order one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pedi-scrubs</li>
            <li> My daughter (20 years) really likes these. Great exfoliater, without drying skin.</li>
            <li> Did not work like I wanted.  It made my skin more rough then it already was to begin with, but it did remove some of the skin.</li>
            <li> It smells so pretty and i love the rough side for the rough part of my feet. No more flakiness, which is awesome.Skin flaking off ur feet is hella annoying. Also, it lasted well over 20 washes. Probably about 40+ and it&#x27;s just now running out of soap. I bought it for my mom too and she loves it :)</li>
            <li> I love these little foot scrubber sponges. They&#x27;re great to use in the shower to get my feet clean and use as a buffer for rough skin. The scent is pleasant as well. They last awhile too so I feel like I can get my money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Spongeables Pedi Scrubs for about 2 years now and I swear by them. I&#x27;ve tried the citron scent, but the lavender tea tree  is my favorite. I like the flower shape, it makes it easy to get between my toes. They always last more then 20 washes, my guess is that I&#x27;m not lathering them as much, but what I do use is more then enough. I use them in conjunction with Earth Therapeutics foot lotion, made with tea tree and peppermint oil. My feet feel super soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product its ingenious</li>
            <li> Love these things!  My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t last longer and are a little stiff initially due to the soap portion.</li>
            <li> The product is alright. Nothing too special. I feel like you can get the same amount of clean with some soap and a good exfoliating loofa/ sponge. I have been using it every time in the shower and have not really noticed a big change. The sponge lathers really well. However, I probably will not be reordering this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes since using these, but I don&#x27;t use them very often so that could be why.  However, on one use my feet do look and feel softer; it just isn&#x27;t a permanent change.  In other words, a day or two later my feet feel the same as they did before using this.  Because of how functional the exfoliant portion is and how nice it smells I&#x27;m rating it at 4 stars.  Do be aware that as someone with sensitive skin I can&#x27;t handle this myself without gloves on as it irritates my hands [the feet seem fine]; so you may want to have someone give you a foot massage with this!</li>
            <li> This thing is cute and it works. Doesn&#x27;t seem to get gross from being in the shower. I don&#x27;t know what else to say?</li>
            <li> I used to buy the green Pedi Scrubs at Walmart all the time, but apparently they don&#x27;t carry them anymore! I love to use these to exfoliate my ankles, legs and arms. Once all the soap is gone, they aren&#x27;t quite as rough as I&#x27;d like (they get rather flimsy), but they smell terrific and are absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is great product. exfoliates and cleans as promised. Eco-friendly and cruelty free. I buy this and other spongeable products regularly. Friends who have received these as a gift have been pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells great, foams well and makes my feet super smooth! I love it!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  my second one was purchased in Feb of &#x27;14 and it&#x27;s still going strong in August!  I&#x27;m ordering another one now just because I&#x27;m thinking about it.  Absolutely a foot saver!  I still only use it a few times a week and my feet are supple and crack free!  The underside is great to massage my tired dogs at the end of the day.  I&#x27;m going to give these out at Xmas this year, too.  Why be selfish, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet have been a consistent problem each winter.  Every September I would stock up on the scrubs, ointments, lotions and potions.  I swear just to keep the problem under control would be a daily ritual lasting 15-20 minutes.  Then I found this product!  I found it while looking for the new foot peel thing.  Eternally grateful I got this instead of the gross peel!  After a week, my feet are smooth, pink and soft!  I don&#x27;t do anything other than use this product a few times a week!  I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks and it shows no sign of giving out yet!  What a bargain, especially if you compare it to the litany of products it replaces and how long it lasts!  I am forever a loyal customer and am buying one for when this one finally gives out.  I hope I&#x27;m still around to crack it open. Oh well, if not, I&#x27;ll leave it in my will.</li>
            <li> These are the best scrubbers I have found. I have been using these for a few years now. I was so glad to find them on here in multiple packs instead of buying singles at WalMart. They work well and keep my feet soft in between pedicures. The scent is nice and they last more than the 20 washes advertised which is great! It does take a wash or two before they soften up but that is not a problem for me. It stays fresh in the shower; just wet, scrub and rinse. I use them daily. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> SSSHHHH....don&#x27;t let them know that the package says 20+ washes, but that is WAY OFF....I&#x27;ve been using it since summer on my size 7 feet and it is now November and I can just start feeling the &amp;#34;soap bar&amp;#34; is getting tiny in the middle...so I&#x27;ll ask Santa for another one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Meh, that is my review.</li>
            <li> This sponge smells nice, but the buffer isn&#x27;t rough enough to remove foot callouses. I&#x27;ll use this up but won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> Also have a stock in my bathroom.  This is my all time favorite product and I give as gifts as part of &amp;#34;Teresa&#x27;s favorite items&amp;#34;.  Everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the number of washes fool you. It is much more than twenty washes. These keep your feet super soft and even my toes feel luxurious. Just enough lather and just the right amount of exfoliation for me.</li>
            <li> These soap-infused foot buffers are the best thing that ever happened to my feet.  I bought one on impulse at my local drugstore, and am now such a fan that I now have them delivered by subscription through Amazon.  They&#x27;re long lasting, and make it easy and pleasant to keep my feet smooth and soft.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly. Its great to use between pedicure.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a week now and I felt a difference after just the first use!  My feet weren&#x27;t in the worst shape by any means, but my heels get a little rough.  I was really happy that even by the end of the day, my feet were still soft.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> The soapy side softens and the scrubby side gets rid of rough skin.  A great product to keep in the shower &amp; use daily. Just keep it dry (like you would a loofah or buff puff) between uses.</li>
            <li> When it says 20 + washes I pictured 20 thin little scrubs, that&#x27;s not what they mean.  It is one scrub you use 20 times. That said I really like it.  One side is smooth and the other is rough.  You can use the rough side to smooth out rough skin.  It works nicely and smells good.  So I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, got lots of uses</li>
            <li> I got this based on reviews and after using it three times, I&#x27;m not very happy with the purchase.  It lathers up (there is a definite fragrance but this one wasn&#x27;t too strong) but this really is more like a dual sided sponge.  It&#x27;s not a good foot buffer-- it&#x27;s more like a softter version of the rough side of the sponge you may use in your sink.  It hasn&#x27;t made my feet any softer.</li>
            <li> These things are AMAZING! I found one in Kroger years ago, and have kept one in the shower since.</li>
            <li> It works great. My feet are always achy and sore. When I used it noticed relief immediately. Enjoy very much!</li>
            <li> Spongeables are the best foot scrubbers Ive ever used! They last a long time. U can get quite a few uses out of one sponge.</li>
            <li> Packaged to look like it was bigger!!!  It is about half the size!</li>
            <li> Great for heels that need work.  Even though I do weekly because get ugly heels, this makes it so easy to do.  I highly recommend, I love it !!</li>
            <li> These are great for your feet. 15 or more uses- absolutely.  Greay buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my heels, and keeping my feet from cracking. I have not had any problems with my heels since buying these. My daughter tried one and now wants one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Great for my feet, my kids love using it and it really cleans our dirty feet well esp. during the summer months when we are barefoot or in flip flops.</li>
            <li> Awesome and long lasting</li>
            <li> The fragrance is delightful and this sponge is easy to use and store! The nubs are great for a massage and to keep the sponge dry between uses. Silky smooth pink side for lather and white side for scrub. If you have calluses that are thick, consider a callus remover and then keep dry cracked heels and calluses controlled with this product. It lasts about a month if you make sure it&#x27;s stored upright on the nubs. This will be addend to my favorites . . . great find and just what I wanted! The product description is accurate and it is well worth trying.</li>
            <li> this is the best product especially for traveling.  the entire family uses them now. so convenient. and they smell great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It exfoliates and makes my feet smooth</li>
            <li> Love these. I live in NYC and in the summer time I use these at the end of the day to wash my feet. Very nice, light scent and sorta skin softening.</li>
            <li> I love these things!  The aroma is not overwhelming, I think it could use a little more really.  Skin feels fantastic after use and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item locally in the past, but have been unable to find it recently.  I was SO happy to see it on Amazon.  I love this product, it makes my feet feel rejuvenated.  It scrubs off the dead skin around my heels and makes them feel soft; and it smells wonderful too.  Thank you Amazon for selling it!!  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Outstanding buffer, works well on extremely dry feet.  I was so impressed with the Spongeables, I ordered six more.  Product does last for 20+ washes.  Would recommend this scrub foot buffer to others.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and it is nice to scrub my feet with it, but it is not hard enough to remove calluses.&lt;br /&gt;To me it feels like I am only washing my feet.</li>
            <li> These are best used in combo with the ped egg in regards to exfoliating your heels and callouses... In regards to cleaning and making the feel smell and feel squeaky clean it does the trick!!!</li>
            <li> This is ok...It&#x27;s a very hard sponge on one side and the other side is a nylon-type loofa, loaded with skin softeners.  Be very careful - using it in the shower (which most of us would do) makes for a *very* slippery situation.  I&#x27;m not big on lavender scent, and this is very mild (fortunately.)  I&#x27;ll continue to use this until it&#x27;s used up, but will resort to regular pumice scrubber - I like a rougher exfoliation method, and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended!) for me.  (As some noted, you can use this on knees, elbows, legs and arms - Depending on your problem areas, it might be better suited for those areas rather than the feet, IMHO.)</li>
            <li> its okay. it doesnt scrub enough...it does smell great though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would help my heals throughout the hot desert summer.  This year for the first time my heals started to crack.  These are great to give your feet some extra attention.  They smell great and are easy to grip onto in the shower.  Mine lasted for about 4 weeks.  There is a coating of moisture that seems to stay on your feet after cleaning them, it does not feel greasy or sticky, but just the right amount of moisture your feet need.</li>
            <li> Would make a great gift/stocking stuffer. The lather lasted well beyond 20 uses, and the sponge is nice to use. Not too scratchy so you could use on legs and arms, too. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge.  As I get older I find that my heels are very hard to keep soft.  I use this in the shower every day and it really helps to keep my heels looking nice.  It starts out very hard (I think because of all of the soap embedded in the sponge) but that soon softens up.  The scrub side is not too abrasive but does the trick on dry, hardened skin.  I even like to sue it on my calves right before I shave to exfoliate the skin.  The flower shape is easy to hold in the shower when it is wet and it fits nicely in a soap holder.  Very nice daily treat for my feet and a great price.</li>
            <li> I love these little scrubbers, they just feel so great and smell so good. Once the pretty smell and good stuff is gone I like to use them as quick  refresh scrubs during the week.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, and it last for a while... my problem is that I thought that is gonna make my skin softer.</li>
            <li> These really work well</li>
            <li> Good way to pamper your feet you deserve it.</li>
            <li> This is convenient to have in the shower. I do body scrubs a couple of times a week but want to scrub my feet daily so having this on the shower rack is perfect.</li>
            <li> I like this sponge even though the rough side isn&#x27;t rough enough for my liking. My feet aren&#x27;t too bad but I still wanted the scrub to be a bit rougher to work away the rougher spots on the bottom of my feet. It tickles really bad when scrubbing with this rough side of the sponge but I push myself through it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to take off any dead skin but I&#x27;m hoping with time I&#x27;ll notice my feet are softer. The soap in the sponge should last a really long time which I&#x27;m happy about. The soft side of the sponge feels great, I love it. Over all I&#x27;m pretty happy. I&#x27;ve only used it twice (soak my feet for a half hour before using it, and soak for another half hour after). I think it&#x27;ll make my feet softer eventually. I like the soap in the sponge and I like that it&#x27;s reusable :)  So I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again, but I&#x27;m happy with my cheap 1 time purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift about a year ago. I used it and  decided to treat myself again with  the Lavender foot buffer. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Its a very good idea, however, i have working womans feet and I need something more tough to scrub the callouses off my feet. It smells very good and does make my feet soft, but does not scrub enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer-s and those that received them as gifts loved them.  Great price for benefit.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my feet seem to need a good scrub most days. I love these to take care of them. Mine has lasted much more than 20 washes. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Lathers very well, good fragrance and works great!  I even use it on my elbows and tops of my hands when they tend to get too dry.</li>
            <li> Love these foot scrub buffer , feet feel like I&#x27;ve had a professional pedicure and would order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this pedi scrub and use it in the shower.  It has a nice soap on one end and a buffer on the other.  While it does NOT remove all my calluses, it does help to soften them so that my Emjoi callus remover works better.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the many positive reviews so I purchased this Pedi Scrub Foot Buffer and ... I am not as impressed with it as most seem to be. It is a two sided spongy thing that has a thick lathering soap part on one size and a thin scrubby part on the other. The soap part melts away and you just toss away the little scrubber when that happens. My feet are in pretty good shape - I use scrub, foot files, and thick foot butter on them all the time - but I figured this would be nice for keeping up my exfoliating regime everyday instead of every other day with the scrub. I didn&#x27;t find that my feet were dramatically exfoliated or soft after use. They were OK, not dry or irritated, just sort of the same as before. I was expecting more. The scent is nice and the lather is rich. The scrubby side is not harsh at all but does have some exfoliating properties. Maybe, because I am used to harsher foot scrubs, I don&#x27;t feel this buffer does a great job sloughing away dead skin and smoothing my heels. It&#x27;s nice to have to keep feet clean and a bit softer but it certainly isn&#x27;t all I need to keep my feet in great shape. I still use my scrub and foot file. This is just an add on that I probably won&#x27;t repurchase because I don&#x27;t see the reason to. It&#x27;s just...OK.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was inexpensive and if it didn&#x27;t work, I wouldn&#x27;t be out much money. I was pleasantly surprised by the great job it did on my poor, messed up feet. It smells pleasant, doesn&#x27;t fall apart, and gets the job done. I am one happy girl!</li>
            <li> I much like. This much well for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Skin becomes very soft and smooth. Possible recommend my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> My feet have never looked better.  After a long winter I only had to use my Peti Scrub Foot Buffer a few times and my feet were ready for sandals ..... I used it for way more than 20 times.  Makes a great present for friends who are not familiar with this product.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I needed to start taking better care of my feet. I spend all day on them and don&#x27;t massage or moisturize enough. I&#x27;ve started using this everyday and it definitely helps keep the skin smooth. It smells wonderful. The price is great. I think I just might subscribe myself to these.</li>
            <li> These are perfect little scrubbers for foot maintenance!  These are great all year long but essential in the summer sandal wearing time.  They last a long time and are not hard but still do a good job.  They have soap in them so they are very convenient.  Don&#x27;t tell but my husband like them as well.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this scrubber/buffer!  it keeps my feet and legs feeling great and smells good too.  i&#x27;ve used it for more than a month now and its still foaming up very well</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed. My feet are in pretty great shape to begin with, I take great care of them, so I wasn&#x27;t asking much from this buffer. It still let me down. This does not remove rough spots, soften, smooth or at all improve the condition of your feet I have liked almost every other product I have ever tried better that this one. SO disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love this for my dry heels from going barefoot in So. California.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this foot buffer.  I had been trying to get rid of some rough skin on my feet for a while.  I used a sanding paddle and foot scrubs, but none of them work as well as this.  It&#x27;s so easy; every shower I just scrub each foot with this buffer (which lasts longer than it says) for about half a minute on each foot.  What a difference!  My feet felt immediately smoother after the first use, and daily use keeps callouses away!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Man..let me tell you about this stuff! I&#x27;m very skeptical when it comes to purchasing things online but the reviews for this persuaded me to try it for myself. I&#x27;ve bought this item twice already and both times I was happy with the product. I have naturally dry feet and it gets worst during the winter months. My feet requires constant exfoliating and moisturizing, and that&#x27;s time consuming. I exfoliate with a foot file once a week, use the pedi scrub daily in the shower, massage my feet with essential oils and seal with cotton socks. That&#x27;s what works best for me so that&#x27;s my &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;. As for the pedi scrub foot buffer, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, very soapy (hence the 20+ washes), and has a nice soothing smell. I would definetly recommend this product for anyone with similar condition(s) to mine, or anybody who just wants a softer feel to the sole.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Pedi scrubs for years.  They&#x27;re so easy to keep in the shower and work well in getting the calluses off.  I like them especially in the summer when I wear sandals and need to have non-cracked, smoother, and nicer looking feet.  They last for many more washes than advertized, are a bargain and make great small gifts.</li>
            <li> The smell was really strong when I took these out of the outer package!  I woild love this product if the smell was a little lighter</li>
