            <li> waiting for some of those freckles to disappear haven&#x27;t used long enough, I guess I have use about two weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> Smaller bottle then expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi and as a lot of the posts say, you&#x27;re face gets dry around your nose and mouth.  </li>
            <li> If you are goring through the Obagi Nu Derm process of peeling, then your face probably feels burned, very dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> The negative side in ordering from an Amazon dealer is that I received old, discolored Obagi.</li>
            <li> Not a very well known brand, but it works for me.  </li>
            <li> wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth what they are charging!</li>
            <li> so spot-free and firm - the answer is Obagi!</li>
            <li> This seems really thick to me.  </li>

            <li> Obagi is always a great product. I use this lotion when I am using Retin A that really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I received the product about a week ago. I really can&#x27;t say if it is working 100% just yet.</li>
            <li> it was whta i want, completely sealed and new!! itis the second time i bought them, the cream it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, and have been using it for several years.  It is not greasy &amp; my makeup goes over it very smoothly.</li>
            <li> This seems really thick to me.  I can still feel it sitting on top if my skin hours later and I end up washing it off.  I have heard such wonderful things about this line of product but this one just isn&#x27;t for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the rest of obagi for 4 years. Great product, does the job without making your face look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> one of the best products, according to my wife.</li>
            <li> Good but not great.  Certainly not worth what they are charging!</li>
            <li> Not a very well known brand, but it works for me.  I buy it regularly on the net, saving money.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Does what it claims. My skin is softer and smoother. I like it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> works real well on my senior skin for the sun rays and dryness. I use it daily. wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> This was not what I thought it was going to be. I needed Obagi clear #3.</li>
            <li> Saved me from the brutality of the Retinol 1.0 + Blender. If you are goring through the Obagi Nu Derm process of peeling, then your face probably feels burned, very dry and irritated. This is your super man in a moisturizer format.</li>
            <li> Did not do what it promised to do.&lt;br /&gt;Obagi is such a wondeful product but this one was a huge disappoinment over all!!!!</li>
            <li> This item completes my obagi regime.  My skin tended to over dry with my regime but Action now moisturizers it.  I will be back</li>

            <li> I love Obagi&#x27;s system. I am sixty-six years old and have been using Obagi faithfully for five years. People often ask how I keep my complection so spot-free and firm - the answer is Obagi! The negative side in ordering from an Amazon dealer is that I received old, discolored Obagi. If I were to order Obagi from an Amazon dealer again, I would need to know the age of the product.</li>
            <li> This obagi products is a new item for me. I have just started using it but I love the way if feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> OK. Smaller bottle then expected.  Fast shipping in excellent condition.</li>
