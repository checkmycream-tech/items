    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This thing is great!</li>
            <li>Adjustability is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Very good night splint.</li>
            <li>but work very good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product seems well manufactured and the material is good,</li>
            <li>Its been a month and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;d check with a doc before buying this device again even though I thought it was effective.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact it had tread on the bottom</li>
            <li>I used this boot after shots for plantar faciitis and it was very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you remove it before walking.)</li>
            <li>I mostly use it now while I&#x27;m watching tv</li>
            <li>/&gt;it basically mostly took care of it after two weeks of wearing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it still got me over the hump and almost completely better.</li>
            <li>(Directions provided about fitting so be sure to read those to start out well.)  </li>
            <li>Sure I&#x27;m probably on the skinny side for a man, but I don&#x27;t see how many (most?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;No reason to pay more for something like this</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine any splint would work any better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product, considering the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Also, the padding is nice, but gets really hot on my foot.</li>
            <li>But both worked fine</li>
            <li>It is HUGE on my size 7.5 foot.  </li>
            <li>and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Light and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Could not get comfortable.</li>
            <li>women could get comfortable in this</li>
            <li>These are comfortable with or without socks.</li>
            <li>When I wear them I&#x27;m pain free in the morning,</li>
            <li>it fits fine, but you have to work to get it fit the right way.  </li>
            <li>These were a little fiddly to fit the first time but once adjusted they have worked great!</li>
            <li>Having used it for several weeks now, I&#x27;d say it is more than pretty good - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>gave 4 stars because despite the size, it is comfortable, well constructed, and extremely economical.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t seem to find that sweet spot.</li>
            <li>My feet have improved greatly, but I had to put them away for a while due to hand surgery.</li>
            <li>wear it whenever I sleep, and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>; type worked fine - - it is light weight and very comfortable (well as comfortable as can be expected having your foot strapped in so it can&#x27;t move!).  </li>
            <li>but  some what useful.</li>
            <li>Maybe if one&#x27;s leg is huge, and feet are fat with cankles, this might fit better,  but for an average sized 7.5 foot, it is way too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable, I can sleep with it on, and the adjustments are obvious and effective.</li>
            <li>I ordered two different night splints and this one was much better.  </li>
            <li>This is my second &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; boot and you can&#x27;t find a better one for the money.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product &amp;</li>
            <li>Literally the first night changed my view of this product.</li>
            <li>This was so much easier to use and more comfortable than other splints I tried.  </li>
            <li>The tread on the bottom allows you to walk around the house for short periods and the straps were easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I do have to take it off some nights, but not because it hurts, but just because I&#x27;m not use to a large shoe on my foot in bed.  </li>
            <li>than I expected (okay, yes, it looks exactly like the picture; haha).</li>
            <li>(You can&#x27;t really walk in it though.  </li>
            <li>It really does help keep the pain to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>very bulky--</li>
            <li>this really helped my plantar fasciitis.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The velcro straps that allow for flexion adjustment are very helpful as well.  </li>
            <li>But if you had to use it for an extended period, it should stand up to the use very well.</li>
            <li>- - my foot moves around more in the other one but it still works - -</li>
            <li>I think it holds the heel down well and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The main issue was that it did not adjust sufficiently for me.</li>
            <li>I can walk around, right after getting out of bed in the morning, without pain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m female, and wear a size 7 1/2 shoe.</li>
            <li>okay not easy to walk with on</li>
            <li>This brace keeps it in moderate dorsal flexion without compromising circulation or being too hot.</li>
            <li>But if you have Plantar Fasciitis and need something to keep your foot in place enough to get rid of the morning heal pain without being too confining and hot, go with an Ankle Dns Dorsal Night Splint.  </li>
            <li>The other one felt less confining and not as hot since it is more &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even so it still helped out a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, the ball of my foot developed a blister because my foot would rub against it.</li>
            <li>and so i stopped before my plantar fasciitis was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I chose this unit because it was one of the less expensive and looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have plantar fasciitis, but an ankle which has not recovered will from major injury, and often cannot sleep if sheets or blankets keep it in plantar flexion.  </li>
            <li>Every strap is at its smallest setting, and the shoe extends 2 full inches past my longest toe.  </li>
            <li>I think the key would be to get the straps snug but not tight.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s minor, even with only two buckles they still support my foot in the right position and I wake up in the morning with so much less heel</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also bigger, bulkier and harder</li>
            <li> This should have been bought long ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit big, as my foot doesn&#x27;t go to the end of the toe section of the splint, but that doesn&#x27;t make the quality of relief any less.</li>
            <li> That interferes with the strap getting tight enough and also leaves the bundle somewhat misshapen.</li>
            <li> Turns out I had a partially torn achilles&#x27;</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> ( I have it in both heels) to help me determine if I like one over the other.</li>
            <li> Also, if you cinch it up tight, you have a lot of loose strap (with velcro on it) hanging off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I sometimes manage to kick one of the buckles unlocked.</li>
            <li> I will probably sell it down the road and try something else.</li>
            <li> But I have determined that this one is a little bit &amp;#34;hotter&amp;#34; than the other one</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to, and I did wake up in a LOT less PAIN.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to--</li>
            <li> It has helped a little but the problem is my heel slips</li>
            <li> The only way for it to flex enough is to make the straps so tight my foot goes numb.</li>
            <li> so the boot and the exercises I was doing was actually making the problem worse.</li>
            <li> the few nights I did sleep with it on the pain of the plantar fasciitis</li>
            <li> Angle will be 90 degrees or less (not more).  </li>
            <li> Even once the straps are the correct length, the fasteners are not easy to click in.</li>
            <li> was noticeable less in the morning, but I find it hard to get asleep with that thing on.  </li>
            <li> have also determined that I dont have to have a splint that is strapped on very tight for this to work</li>
            <li> I can walk with very little pain in the morning.</li>
            <li> , I just HATE getting hot at night.</li>
            <li> I feel like I had a hard time keeping my foot aligned, but I think that is just me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i found that since my leg was so tight, i couldn&#x27;t get it fully flexed, and so my foot would go numb when i was asleep, due to the strap that goes over the foot.</li>
            <li> I try to strap that thing on as tight as I can without cutting off circulation, it doesn&#x27;t hold the heel down.  </li>
            <li> Seriously??</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to have things tight or uncomfortable for it to work.</li>
            <li> Maybe I bought the wrong size or something, but I tried it for a few nights and I have to take it off about halfway through the night.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a matter of choosing which one is worse: the pain or the splint.</li>
            <li> when I don&#x27;t its painful for a few hours when I get up.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little annoying to have a boot on in bed</li>
            <li> Straps were painful after a while.</li>
            <li> I have terrible Plantar Fasciitis.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have terrible Plantar Fasciitis.  I ordered two different night splints and this one was much better.  It held my foot in place and I even wore it while sitting on the couch. (You can&#x27;t really walk in it though.  Make sure you remove it before walking.) I think it holds the heel down well and is very comfortable.  I do have to take it off some nights, but not because it hurts, but just because I&#x27;m not use to a large shoe on my foot in bed.  My PF is improving and the nights that I wear it all night I can walk with very little pain in the morning.</li>
            <li> I try to strap that thing on as tight as I can without cutting off circulation, it doesn&#x27;t hold the heel down.  Maybe I bought the wrong size or something, but I tried it for a few nights and I have to take it off about halfway through the night.  Also, the padding is nice, but gets really hot on my foot. That does not help at all. I will probably sell it down the road and try something else.</li>
            <li> After several weeks I am still trying to get the straps adjusted so that I do not wake up with pain in my instep (presumably from too-tight straps) in the middle of the night, or PF pain in my heel when I get up in the morning (presumably from not-tight-enough straps.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for 30 minutes. The problem was I thought I had tendonitis. Turns out I had a partially torn achilles&#x27; so the boot and the exercises I was doing was actually making the problem worse. I am now in my fifth week of wearing a walking boot 24/7. I think I&#x27;ve avoided surgery but I think I&#x27;d check with a doc before buying this device again even though I thought it was effective.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! It really does help keep the pain to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it whenever I sleep, and it has helped tremendously. I can walk around, right after getting out of bed in the morning, without pain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m female, and wear a size 7 1/2 shoe. I got the &#x27;medium&#x27; size. It&#x27;s a bit big, as my foot doesn&#x27;t go to the end of the toe section of the splint, but that doesn&#x27;t make the quality of relief any less. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The item is just what you see in the picture.  it fits fine, but you have to work to get it fit the right way.  I found it very uncomfortable to sleep, because if you fit it tight, it stops circulation, and if you fit it lose, it doesn&#x27;t work.  the few nights I did sleep with it on the pain of the plantar fasciitis was noticeable less in the morning, but I find it hard to get asleep with that thing on.  I mostly use it now while I&#x27;m watching tv and it helps some. Otherwise, the product seems well manufactured and the material is good, so all in all it&#x27;s a good product, considering the price is very reasonable.  I guess it&#x27;s a matter of choosing which one is worse: the pain or the splint.</li>
            <li> okay not easy to walk with on</li>
            <li> I bought 2--one for each foot. Takes a little getting used to--very bulky-- but they WORK! My feet have improved greatly, but I had to put them away for a while due to hand surgery. (I don&#x27;t want  to sleep with both my hand and feet in traction)&lt;br /&gt;I will resume in about 4 weeks, I suspect. Will let you know when/if I&#x27;m cured.</li>
            <li> It is HUGE on my size 7.5 foot.  Every strap is at its smallest setting, and the shoe extends 2 full inches past my longest toe.  Maybe if one&#x27;s leg is huge, and feet are fat with cankles, this might fit better,  but for an average sized 7.5 foot, it is way too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a 4th strap over the ball of the foot or toes, but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because despite the size, it is comfortable, well constructed, and extremely economical. I don&#x27;t have plantar fasciitis, but an ankle which has not recovered will from major injury, and often cannot sleep if sheets or blankets keep it in plantar flexion.  This brace keeps it in moderate dorsal flexion without compromising circulation or being too hot.</li>
            <li> This contraption does work and provides relief -- that is if you don&#x27;t put your back out putting it on.  Even once the straps are the correct length, the fasteners are not easy to click in.</li>
            <li> this really helped my plantar fasciitis.&lt;br /&gt;it basically mostly took care of it after two weeks of wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;that was after i had tried stretching a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a couple of nagging things about it though.&lt;br /&gt;i found that since my leg was so tight, i couldn&#x27;t get it fully flexed, and so my foot would go numb when i was asleep, due to the strap that goes over the foot. and i&#x27;d end up taking it off sometime in the middle of the night in my sleep. even so it still helped out a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, the ball of my foot developed a blister because my foot would rub against it. and so i stopped before my plantar fasciitis was completely gone. but it still got me over the hump and almost completely better.</li>
            <li> It has helped a little but the problem is my heel slips so I don&#x27;t get enough flex. The only way for it to flex enough is to make the straps so tight my foot goes numb.</li>
            <li> Very good night splint. Works well</li>
            <li> got rid of my feet problems</li>
            <li> I used this boot after shots for plantar faciitis and it was very comfortable.  The tread on the bottom allows you to walk around the house for short periods and the straps were easy to use.  This is my second &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; boot and you can&#x27;t find a better one for the money.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but  some what useful. Went to the doctor and he recommended that I continue using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased two different types of &amp;#34;splints&amp;#34; for my Plantar Fasciitis - - this one and the Ankle Dns Dorsal Night Splint. I have been wearing each on alternating feet each night ( I have it in both heels) to help me determine if I like one over the other. They both do the job - - I wake up with NO PAIN in my heels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;boot&amp;#34; type worked fine - - it is light weight and very comfortable (well as comfortable as can be expected having your foot strapped in so it can&#x27;t move!).  But I have determined that this one is a little bit &amp;#34;hotter&amp;#34; than the other one and I also occasionally have an issue where one of these straps unhooks during the night. So I have decided not to use this one any longer.  The other one felt less confining and not as hot since it is more &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also determined that I dont have to have a splint that is strapped on very tight for this to work - - my foot moves around more in the other one but it still works - - I have no pain in my heals in the morning. So if you have an issue where you need to keep your foot from moving during the night, get this boot. It will do that and it is comfortable. But if you have Plantar Fasciitis and need something to keep your foot in place enough to get rid of the morning heal pain without being too confining and hot, go with an Ankle Dns Dorsal Night Splint.  But both worked fine, I just HATE getting hot at night.</li>
            <li> This was so much easier to use and more comfortable than other splints I tried.  It looks cumbersome but it isn&#x27;t at all.  I liked the fact it had tread on the bottom so I could walk on it if I had to.  Adjustability is excellent.  Light and comfortable.  Eased up my Plantar Fasciitis.</li>
            <li> The splint works as it should.  I&#x27;m still adjusting the tightness of the straps as the middle strap still limits the blood flow to my foot in the middle of the night.  (Directions provided about fitting so be sure to read those to start out well.)  I also experience this with ski boots &amp; roller blades so could just be me).  The buckles on the 3 attachment straps are invaluable in this process as they allow trying various levels of \\&quot;tightness\\&quot; without having to start out all over again every night.  The velcro straps that allow for flexion adjustment are very helpful as well.  Angle will be 90 degrees or less (not more).  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product &amp; it&#x27;s flexibility to conform.  I&#x27;m using it to help treat plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Could not get comfortable. Straps were painful after a while. The main issue was that it did not adjust sufficiently for me. I&#x27;m a tall man, but on the slim side and the straps pass through pads that bunch up as you cinch in the strap. That interferes with the strap getting tight enough and also leaves the bundle somewhat misshapen. I think the key would be to get the straps snug but not tight. I couldn&#x27;t seem to find that sweet spot. Sure I&#x27;m probably on the skinny side for a man, but I don&#x27;t see how many (most?) women could get comfortable in this and it&#x27;s billed as one-size-fits-all. Also, if you cinch it up tight, you have a lot of loose strap (with velcro on it) hanging off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also bigger, bulkier and harder than I expected (okay, yes, it looks exactly like the picture; haha). Just not something that goes well inside your bed clothes. I&#x27;ll be looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I chose this unit because it was one of the less expensive and looked pretty good. Having used it for several weeks now, I&#x27;d say it is more than pretty good - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable, I can sleep with it on, and the adjustments are obvious and effective. Every adjustment is held by Velcro, so once made they stay put. This is a well-designed, well-made appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No reason to pay more for something like this that you&#x27;ll (I hope) use only a short time. But if you had to use it for an extended period, it should stand up to the use very well.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this for me and told me to get it from Amazon, fits well and suits my needs.</li>
            <li> Asolutely the only way to go when one has a recently fallen arch!  This &amp;#34;beastie&amp;#34; keeps the ankle folded while one sleeps.</li>
            <li> These were a little fiddly to fit the first time but once adjusted they have worked great! Yes, it&#x27;s a little annoying to have a boot on in bed but I can&#x27;t imagine any splint would work any better. These are comfortable with or without socks. My only complaint is I sometimes manage to kick one of the buckles unlocked. But that&#x27;s minor, even with only two buckles they still support my foot in the right position and I wake up in the morning with so much less heel pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note: this picture appears to show 4 straps... My splint only has three straps but they get the job done.)</li>
            <li> I feel like I had a hard time keeping my foot aligned, but I think that is just me. I felt I should keep my heel to the very back and I do not think that is the correct way to wear it. It does come with specific instructions. Does what it is supposed to, and I did wake up in a LOT less PAIN. Talked to my podiatrist...they wanted ~ $250.00 for this? Seriously?? I say look at the model your podiatrist carries then look on line. Your healthcare dollars at work.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  You don&#x27;t have to have things tight or uncomfortable for it to work.</li>
            <li> I was thinking I was buying a pair :S.&lt;br /&gt;This offert just send you one. but work very good. 90 degree</li>
            <li> Its been a month and the results are amazing. When I wear them I&#x27;m pain free in the morning, when I don&#x27;t its painful for a few hours when I get up. I got 2 so both arches would benefit and they exceeded my expectations. Literally the first night changed my view of this product. This should have been bought long ago so don&#x27;t wait like I did.</li>
