            <li>and it has been a huge confidence and ego booster.</li>

            <li>I felt that I couldn&#x27;t develop a meaningful personal relationship and intimacy as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to satisfy a woman sexually.</li>
            <li>Enter Super Dragon 6000.</li>
            <li>but if you receive oral, first lightly rinse your member off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, this product has completely changed my sex life for the better</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>one cannot use this product right before intercourse&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is very good and fast acting only 5 min</li>
            <li>arrived super fast</li>
            <li>It was first time I tried.</li>
            <li>we definitely will b buying more</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time...</li>
            <li>and I was ready for fun</li>
            <li>OK ppl, I&#x27;ve used a lot of long delay stuff</li>
            <li>But really works.</li>
            <li>It really does what it supposes to do.</li>
            <li>thanks .</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work for me.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I used</li>
            <li>Just do not use too much.</li>
            <li>I think if you are looking for something to help you control how fast you have an orgasm or some sort of training, using this product and hen</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for me as the reviews .</li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>* is real .</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>you put it on  ,,highly recommend</li>
            <li>I did 3 sprays the 1st time and we were looking for some lube after a little more than an hour.</li>
            <li>How much of this is due to a &#x27;placebo effect&#x27; I don&#x27;t know, but you can be sure that I&#x27;m going to be using it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come off in the vagina as long as you rub it in and let it get absorbed.</li>
            <li>Use that time for some caress and don&#x27;t rush it last more than hour and half.</li>
            <li>I would say it makes you last much longer.</li>
            <li>I usually use three spray shots (front, back, top).</li>
            <li>I spray on the top of the shaft and use my fingers to spread it at the base of the head (after pulling back the foreskin) since I personally feel that is the most sensitive region of my penis.</li>
            <li>I usually use 2 sprays&#x27; worth.</li>
            <li>Although small worth the money.</li>

            <li> Its not worth it.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because I did experience a slight difference in sensitivity</li>

            <li> it burns and makes you a little</li>

            <li> I was skeptical but after using a couple times I am now a believer.</li>
            <li> I messed up and didn&#x27;t wait 5 or 10 minutes to let it soak in and numb me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you wipe off the excess liquid so that your parter does not taste or get numb with it.</li>
            <li> It makes penis numb with no sensation.</li>
            <li> Not saying this is a bad product, but it did not work for me.</li>

            <li> Of late, I&#x27;ve been suffering from poor performance. Blame it on a long period of involuntary celibacy and excessive viewing of porn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My confidence was shot because I couldn&#x27;t last long at all. I felt that I couldn&#x27;t develop a meaningful personal relationship and intimacy as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to satisfy a woman sexually. Enter Super Dragon 6000. This thing has dramatically improved my sex life. My lasting time has gone from less than a minute to several minutes now. How much of this is due to a &#x27;placebo effect&#x27; I don&#x27;t know, but you can be sure that I&#x27;m going to be using it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important: apply 15-20 minutes before you expect to penetrate. Otherwise the product won&#x27;t be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application tips based on experience:&lt;br /&gt;I apply to an erect or semi-erect penis. Basically, when I start making out and feel an erection, I excuse myself to the bathroom and apply this. I usually use 2 sprays&#x27; worth. I spray on the top of the shaft and use my fingers to spread it at the base of the head (after pulling back the foreskin) since I personally feel that is the most sensitive region of my penis. I can feel it working almost immediately since it causes my penis to go flaccid. I then go back to making out and pleasuring my woman before I engage in penetrative intercourse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are:&lt;br /&gt;a) one cannot use this product right before intercourse&lt;br /&gt;b) I&#x27;m unsure if receiving oral sex is a good idea since it might cause a numbness in partner&#x27;s mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this product has completely changed my sex life for the better and it has been a huge confidence and ego booster.</li>
            <li> Since I have tried this my endurance has gone from 15 minutes to at least 40...usually an hour with 3 sprays.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend didn&#x27;t know what hit her.&lt;br /&gt;Also arrived super fast</li>
            <li> You want to stay hard and last longer?? This product is highly recommended. Product was delivered early then expected.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work better.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It is 12ml bottle, the size of a thumb. Although small worth the money. Shipped from china. It took two weeks. I was a little skeptical at first. But really works. If this brand doesnt work, try stud 100. Both work great to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!!! Start with just 1 spray and see how it works. I did 3 sprays the 1st time and we were looking for some lube after a little more than an hour. Now I use 1 spray and rub it into the head of my member and bring my wife to 2-3 climaxes in an hour or so. Brought me from 5-10 minutes to a good 45-60 minutes!!! I like to rub it on and wait 10 minutes and then wash it off otherwise she goes a little numb. My climaxes are like an explosion!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It takes care of business.</li>
            <li> This product is scam.</li>
            <li> It really does what it supposes to do.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> i loved it the first time i used it . thanks .</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work for me. It just didn&#x27;t. I gave it one star because I did experience a slight difference in sensitivity but it was short lived. No matter how much I used I just didn&#x27;t get the effect advertised.</li>
            <li> Working good so far dosent effect my body yet</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Lasts a couple hours after  you put it on  ,,highly recommend</li>
            <li> I loved it, I will difinitley buy it again It works great... Make sure don&#x27;t spray more than two.</li>
            <li> Worked the first time but not really anymore &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Works great. Just do not use too much. Start off with a little and add as u need.</li>
            <li> It was first time I tried. Not work. Not working at all.</li>
            <li> 4 stars since no intructions. Numbs your package well. I messed up and didn&#x27;t wait 5 or 10 minutes to let it soak in and numb me. Was gonna say it was a gimmick but nope it works like it should.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after using a couple times I am now a believer. Apply 2 sprays (1 on top and 1 on bottom of your wiener) rub in then wait 5-10 minutes till your wiener feels a little numb and you are good to go. Definitely helps one to last longer so your lady friend can cum twice, then goodnight :). Doesn&#x27;t diminish how great sex feels or orgasm. Doesn&#x27;t come off in the vagina as long as you rub it in and let it get absorbed. No instructions came with the bottle i got but if you receive oral, first lightly rinse your member off. My wife said I tasted like soap. Also do not let product go into your urethra (read:pee-hole) it burns and makes you a little too numb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also another website advertises this product contains  L-Arginine but was not listed anywhere on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and much love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-DUSTYxXxHUEVOS</li>
            <li> item worked great for my guy we definitely will b buying more</li>
            <li> Works great, just don&#x27;t over do it with the sprays you will last forever.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff. It was shipped from China and took two weeks to be delivered but it was worth the wait. I usually use three spray shots (front, back, top). If your penis is not hypersensitive, you will need one shot only. This product won&#x27;t make you lose your erection. I would recommend that you wipe off the excess liquid so that your parter does not taste or get numb with it. I would say it makes you last much longer. I think if you are looking for something to help you control how fast you have an orgasm or some sort of training, using this product and hen reducing how much you use as time goes by, will be of good help. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time...afterwards my partner looked at me and said. &amp;#34;You are the greatest man I have ever known&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s safe to say this product is a success.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it allows me to perform like a porn star. Won&#x27;t have sex w/out it. I love it.</li>
            <li> This product works like charm, 2 sprays and wait for 15 mn or plus you will enjoy period</li>
            <li> Not that much its fake</li>
            <li> Works awesome couple of sprays and wait like 10 minutes then your having sex like a porn star</li>
            <li> This product is very good and fast acting only 5 min and I was ready for fun I lasted about 45 min to an hour lobed every minute of it! Would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This product work perfect.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it. It makes penis numb with no sensation. Its better to have without applying anything. Not recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me as the reviews .</li>
            <li> OK ppl, I&#x27;ve used a lot of long delay stuff but this is the real deal. My girl always cum twice and I&#x27;m in charge. When applied, wait 15 to 20min before u put the car in the garage. Use that time for some caress and don&#x27;t rush it last more than hour and half. This s*** is real .</li>
            <li> I love the shipped faster</li>
