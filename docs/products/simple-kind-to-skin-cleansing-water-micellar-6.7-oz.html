            <li>It lathers so nicely, and is foamy yet creamy.</li>

            <li>I probably will not repurchase, and I need to find better foaming face washes.</li>
            <li>This foaming cleanser is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It works like magic and does not sting my eyes.</li>
            <li>have their moisturizer- love that too</li>
            <li>when you pump it, it will actually shoot at a 80-90 degree angle, so in nearly perfect projectile.</li>

            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>better experience with Murad Pomegranate Cleanser</li>
            <li>It s ok for the price.</li>
            <li>Great, gentle.</li>
            <li>A MUCH better price point than the Bliss I was using with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I guess I just need something that it more geared toward preventing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love all 3.</li>
            <li>I have to say I love this skin care line</li>
            <li>I will be a continued customer. :)</li>
            <li>I FELL IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>Always love this cleanser</li>
            <li>I had a really sensitive face and have struggled since I was 12 (19 now) to find a great cleanser, and I can honestly say this does this job.</li>
            <li>I just love this foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>foaming cleanser is my favorite of the bunch.</li>
            <li>I like it because the lather is the richest, sort of creamy, most luxurious cleanser</li>
            <li>I love the foam....</li>
            <li>It took me many years to find a product that worked, and this seems to be it.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li>You can really get a great lather and it&#x27;s easy to divide it over your face.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Great cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel really clean but for some reason I was breaking out more when I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>I first tried this face wash when I borrowed it from someone else, and I liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, gentle, and even is clearing my face up!</li>
            <li>The foaming works fine, but I am not at all a fan of the scent or lack thereof.</li>
            <li>There is pretty much no scent, which is great because I feel like scented cleansers always make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>For less than $6, thats an awesome deal.    </li>
            <li>Cheap face wash.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found this product on Amazon since my local Target stopped carrying this product.</li>
            <li>Light scent, and not overly-drying on your skin</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Simple foaming cleanser is great stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it helped with my acne, but it felt nice.</li>
            <li>I have great results with the simple products.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle and effective with no breakouts or irritation from switching over.</li>
            <li>I have stubborn skin pore wise and the first use my pores were so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>It did do a good job of keeping my skin clear of oil, however.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich foam</li>
            <li>I LOVE this face wash so much!</li>
            <li>Originally, I got a sample size of this cleanser.</li>
            <li>but it leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Greasy, smelly, and does not seem like you are clean after using it.</li>
            <li>and it makes it feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling and smelling clean</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get the right amount of cleanser.</li>
            <li>I noticed this at wal mart and saw that it labeled &amp;#34;sensitive skin experts&amp;#34; and they were right!</li>
            <li>it leaves my face feeling fresh, clean, and oil free.</li>
            <li>The price is decent and you wont regret it! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this face wash needs two pumps (or one pump/wash, then another) if my face is really greasy, but for most folks I would imagine one pump/wash is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B00K4PLC30 Sweet Almond Oil - Molivera Organics 16 oz. ]]</li>
            <li>Just enough lather to feel good without all the parabens and sulfates (the foaming agent in this cleaner is plant derived, I looked it up)</li>
            <li>All I can really say is that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love that its very foamy</li>
            <li>The cleanser itself is basic, which I see as a good thing.</li>
            <li>However, it just wasn&#x27;t the right fit for me.</li>
            <li>Just fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>This line of products make my face fill so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It feels once, cleansing and mild.</li>
            <li>, It goes on quickly and comes off even quicker.</li>
            <li>Been using the whole Simple line for about a year now and am a happy customer.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my face feeling very soft!</li>
            <li>I really like the simple skin care line because it&#x27;s very kind to my skin.</li>
            <li>After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I also loved how long this bottle lasts!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very foamy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The foam is easy to use and gentle for her skin.</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser everyday now and have noticed a great reduction of blackheads.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>The smell is admittedly kind of chemically, which I didn&#x27;t expect from the Simple line of products.</li>
            <li>I love how well this product works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>If you are prone to breakouts this stuff is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is nice and gentle, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This was really nice when my face was super dry.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it may be right for you.</li>
            <li>is so clean and soft after love it highly recommend thank you</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have used Clinique since it came out in the late sixties - but this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I have always had extremely oily skin ever since I could remember and this product has controlled it exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well and makes my hands really soft. :)</li>
            <li>It actually feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is also VERY GENTLE on the skin.</li>
            <li>I very much recommend this product to any one in search of a face cleanser that gets the job done like it claims.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on face and seems to get the grime off in an effortless manner.</li>
            <li>Fine on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I found that if you dilute it by pouring distilled water into a half full bottle of this, its a lot less abrasive and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>You really only need 1 pump, 2 at max, and you should be able to wash both your face and neck.</li>
            <li>and like I said, has pretty much no scent!</li>
            <li>love simple, but wish I could return this product.</li>
            <li>One puff is more than enough to thoroughly cleanse my face.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first wash.</li>
            <li>like it seem, but it makes my face feel funny</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel quite right when I try to rinse it off, and it&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive face and leave it feeling clean without over drying it :) will purchase it again  when I run out along with the simple toner and moisturizer</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to finish my clean &amp; clear toner first.</li>
            <li>So natural and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive even to any kind of unscented soaps and having trouble, but this cleanser is fine somehow.</li>
            <li>It did take me awhile to realize the problem was this foaming face wash.&lt;br /&gt;After switching back to the refreshing gel cleanser for the last two days, I again notice a Huge improvement.</li>
            <li>I started using Simple&#x27;s refreshing face wash gel, smoothing facial scrub, and hydrating light moisturizer two years ago.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn or dry my skin out more.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and a little goes a long way, which is something I am most impressed about with the Simple line of products that I have tried already</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that gets oily, so I need a product that will gently clean my skin and actually leave it feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Love this product not harsh on my skin, less breakouts, however it did not come with the clear top u see in the description, but i will buy again.</li>
            <li>Works great but not as an everyday facial wash (for myself).</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards but fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Gentle, but gets all the makeup and dirt-of-the-day off my face.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Gentle, fragrance-free foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is very foamy and creamy and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and takes off make up well.  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>I used this with one of those cheap spinning facial brushes.</li>
            <li>ought this because so many facial cleansers burn my sensitive eyes, so I thought &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; would be gentle.</li>
            <li>Really removes makeup.</li>
            <li>Its reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>When it comes in touch with water is foams very well.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.  </li>
            <li>this was very abrasive to my oily skin.</li>
            <li>The foam really gets into your pore.</li>
            <li>- it is much lighter than traditional moisturizers and more natural and does not clog up my pores.  </li>
            <li>I was bragging so much abt how soft and clean my face felt, and her acne has diminished considerably.</li>
            <li>I also really like how two pumps gives such a rich lather.</li>
            <li>You only need one pump to clean your whole face</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I am trying to be a little more aware of what I am putting on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and cleans your skin thoroughly without being harsh.</li>
            <li>I will go back to cream cleansers which so far has been the only kind that works.</li>
            <li>Kind of pointless.</li>
            <li>first t felt like it was either leaving a film, or drying my skin out completely, or both.</li>
            <li>Although in general it does foam up and seems very gentle, it absolutely did not remove make up.</li>
            <li>I love the simple facial line!</li>
            <li>Decent for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any age group.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all high quality stuff at and irresistible cost</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, minimally-scented facial cleanser that leaves your skin clean and feeling soft with none of that astringent tightness you can get with other cleansers, you will really enjoy this.</li>
            <li>A single pump provides all the rich lather you&#x27;ll need to wash your face and neck.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin, gets the job done</li>
            <li>I decided to try this face wash out because everything else I seemed to try either made my already combination skin more oily or dried me out to the point that I&#x27;m applying moisturizers during the day.</li>
            <li>This product works as promised and I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my normal cleanser</li>
            <li>The normal shipping rate came in two days.</li>
            <li>I saw this new product at the grocery store and it was on sale</li>
            <li>Where I live, humidity is almost always 80-90%</li>
            <li>(I live in Florida).  </li>
            <li>I bought this in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond a few months ago in an attempt to try more natural skincare ingredients.</li>
            <li>The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve outgrown them for the most part, and when they do come, they are few and far between).</li>
            <li>B00K7HVHYE HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a powerful Superfruit Anti-Oxidant complex!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had red, sensitive skin that was combination and never could find the right skin care that wasn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly (pun intended!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I recently picked up this product from my local Wal-Mart after realizing they were out of my regular refreshing face wash gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Biore foaming cleanser that is not anywhere near as rich in lather and leaves my skin feeling much different than the Simple foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>The Simple Foaming Cleanser, Simple Soothing Facial Toner, Simple Soothing Eye Balm, Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, Simple Soothing Facial Scrub are gentle, effective, and do not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY SOFT NOT HARSH INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>Soon after finishing my Biore I thought I would try Simple Facial Cleanser due to the fact that it claimed it was gentle on the skin and didn&#x27;t have as many chemicals.</li>
            <li>My skin is always glowing after I use this product, and feels so clean without making my face red or dry.</li>
            <li>The cotton comes out clear as day.</li>
            <li>But it could just be that my sensitive, combination skin just doesn&#x27;t react well to foam cleansers.</li>
            <li>, I purchased a 5 Oz tube of this stuff on Amazon and completely changed my skin regiment.    </li>
            <li>(I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I went from being the girl in her early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>SO FAR FOR ME</li>
            <li>Seem to be just as sensitive as Skin Effects, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Not much to report otherwise (although to me the latter statement is already a big deal- stronger cleansers, over-dry and sensitize skin, thus causing irritation and stripping of protective layers making it more prone to breakouts), with and exception that the dispenser&#x27;s design is lacking.</li>
            <li>really soft on the skin</li>
            <li>Even my 14 year old sister loves it and helps with her acne.</li>
            <li>The foam is instant to use &amp; much easier to rinse off.</li>
            <li>I use this soap twice a day on my sensitive skin with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter cannot use it because it irritates her skin.</li>
            <li>This works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>no heavy made up eyes; so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20-year old with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This product works wonders with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A few days later I was so in love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the other Simple product lines and have had no issues: enjoyed the moisturizer and face scrub--no smells and left my skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually started to breakout like I did in high school</li>
            <li>I do not break out, and at the same time, I feel like it is strong enough to take the whole days residue and make up off with very little effort.</li>
            <li>Lately, I had been researching the benefits of using a natural cleanser like baking soda but still wanted something easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>1oz.]] which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put a tiny dab of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my sensitive dry skin, but gets all my makeup (even mascara) off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched back to my old cleanser and the breakouts have stopped.</li>
            <li>Switched to this after Mary Kay discontinued Basic Skin Care that I&#x27;d used for 20 years for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It cleanse very well but it does feel a little drying afterwards, not completely tight, but I need to put on lotion ASAP.  </li>
            <li>And this exfoliates way better than expensive natural oil soap.</li>
            <li>dried it out completely, and made it very flakey.</li>
            <li>My skin is not oily, and it does not dry me out.</li>
            <li>It does nor irritate or dry out my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, just wish it had a little higher SPF)</li>
            <li>I really like this and other Simple products.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading many positive reviews, but unfortunately I was one of the few this product wasn&#x27;t meant for.</li>

            <li> It lathers so nicely, and is foamy yet creamy.</li>

            <li> I probably will not repurchase, and I need to find better foaming face washes.</li>
            <li> This foaming cleanser is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It works like magic and does not sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> have their moisturizer- love that too</li>
            <li> when you pump it, it will actually shoot at a 80-90 degree angle, so in nearly perfect projectile.</li>

            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> better experience with Murad Pomegranate Cleanser</li>
            <li> It s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Great, gentle.</li>
            <li> A MUCH better price point than the Bliss I was using with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I guess I just need something that it more geared toward preventing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all 3.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this skin care line</li>
            <li> I will be a continued customer. :)</li>
            <li> I FELL IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> Always love this cleanser</li>
            <li> I had a really sensitive face and have struggled since I was 12 (19 now) to find a great cleanser, and I can honestly say this does this job.</li>
            <li> I just love this foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> foaming cleanser is my favorite of the bunch.</li>
            <li> I like it because the lather is the richest, sort of creamy, most luxurious cleanser</li>
            <li> I love the foam....</li>
            <li> It took me many years to find a product that worked, and this seems to be it.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You can really get a great lather and it&#x27;s easy to divide it over your face.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It made my face feel really clean but for some reason I was breaking out more when I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I first tried this face wash when I borrowed it from someone else, and I liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, gentle, and even is clearing my face up!</li>
            <li> The foaming works fine, but I am not at all a fan of the scent or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> There is pretty much no scent, which is great because I feel like scented cleansers always make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> For less than $6, thats an awesome deal.    </li>
            <li> Cheap face wash.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found this product on Amazon since my local Target stopped carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Light scent, and not overly-drying on your skin</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Simple foaming cleanser is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it helped with my acne, but it felt nice.</li>
            <li> I have great results with the simple products.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle and effective with no breakouts or irritation from switching over.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn skin pore wise and the first use my pores were so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> It did do a good job of keeping my skin clear of oil, however.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich foam</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash so much!</li>
            <li> Originally, I got a sample size of this cleanser.</li>
            <li> but it leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Greasy, smelly, and does not seem like you are clean after using it.</li>
            <li> and it makes it feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling and smelling clean</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to get the right amount of cleanser.</li>
            <li> I noticed this at wal mart and saw that it labeled &amp;#34;sensitive skin experts&amp;#34; and they were right!</li>
            <li> it leaves my face feeling fresh, clean, and oil free.</li>
            <li> The price is decent and you wont regret it! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this face wash needs two pumps (or one pump/wash, then another) if my face is really greasy, but for most folks I would imagine one pump/wash is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B00K4PLC30 Sweet Almond Oil - Molivera Organics 16 oz. ]]</li>
            <li> Just enough lather to feel good without all the parabens and sulfates (the foaming agent in this cleaner is plant derived, I looked it up)</li>
            <li> All I can really say is that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love that its very foamy</li>
            <li> The cleanser itself is basic, which I see as a good thing.</li>
            <li> However, it just wasn&#x27;t the right fit for me.</li>
            <li> Just fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> This line of products make my face fill so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It feels once, cleansing and mild.</li>
            <li> , It goes on quickly and comes off even quicker.</li>
            <li> Been using the whole Simple line for about a year now and am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my face feeling very soft!</li>
            <li> I really like the simple skin care line because it&#x27;s very kind to my skin.</li>
            <li> After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I also loved how long this bottle lasts!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very foamy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The foam is easy to use and gentle for her skin.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser everyday now and have noticed a great reduction of blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> The smell is admittedly kind of chemically, which I didn&#x27;t expect from the Simple line of products.</li>
            <li> I love how well this product works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to breakouts this stuff is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is nice and gentle, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This was really nice when my face was super dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it may be right for you.</li>
            <li> is so clean and soft after love it highly recommend thank you</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used Clinique since it came out in the late sixties - but this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely oily skin ever since I could remember and this product has controlled it exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very well and makes my hands really soft. :)</li>
            <li> It actually feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is also VERY GENTLE on the skin.</li>
            <li> I very much recommend this product to any one in search of a face cleanser that gets the job done like it claims.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on face and seems to get the grime off in an effortless manner.</li>
            <li> Fine on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I found that if you dilute it by pouring distilled water into a half full bottle of this, its a lot less abrasive and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> You really only need 1 pump, 2 at max, and you should be able to wash both your face and neck.</li>
            <li> and like I said, has pretty much no scent!</li>
            <li> love simple, but wish I could return this product.</li>
            <li> One puff is more than enough to thoroughly cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first wash.</li>
            <li> like it seem, but it makes my face feel funny</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel quite right when I try to rinse it off, and it&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive face and leave it feeling clean without over drying it :) will purchase it again  when I run out along with the simple toner and moisturizer</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to finish my clean &amp; clear toner first.</li>
            <li> So natural and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive even to any kind of unscented soaps and having trouble, but this cleanser is fine somehow.</li>
            <li> It did take me awhile to realize the problem was this foaming face wash.&lt;br /&gt;After switching back to the refreshing gel cleanser for the last two days, I again notice a Huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I started using Simple&#x27;s refreshing face wash gel, smoothing facial scrub, and hydrating light moisturizer two years ago.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn or dry my skin out more.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and a little goes a long way, which is something I am most impressed about with the Simple line of products that I have tried already</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that gets oily, so I need a product that will gently clean my skin and actually leave it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product not harsh on my skin, less breakouts, however it did not come with the clear top u see in the description, but i will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great but not as an everyday facial wash (for myself).</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards but fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but gets all the makeup and dirt-of-the-day off my face.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Gentle, fragrance-free foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is very foamy and creamy and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and takes off make up well.  </li>
            <li> It is so gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I used this with one of those cheap spinning facial brushes.</li>
            <li> ought this because so many facial cleansers burn my sensitive eyes, so I thought &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; would be gentle.</li>
            <li> Really removes makeup.</li>
            <li> Its reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> When it comes in touch with water is foams very well.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.  </li>
            <li> this was very abrasive to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> The foam really gets into your pore.</li>
            <li> - it is much lighter than traditional moisturizers and more natural and does not clog up my pores.  </li>
            <li> I was bragging so much abt how soft and clean my face felt, and her acne has diminished considerably.</li>
            <li> I also really like how two pumps gives such a rich lather.</li>
            <li> You only need one pump to clean your whole face</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I am trying to be a little more aware of what I am putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and cleans your skin thoroughly without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I will go back to cream cleansers which so far has been the only kind that works.</li>
            <li> Kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> first t felt like it was either leaving a film, or drying my skin out completely, or both.</li>
            <li> Although in general it does foam up and seems very gentle, it absolutely did not remove make up.</li>
            <li> I love the simple facial line!</li>
            <li> Decent for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for any age group.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all high quality stuff at and irresistible cost</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, minimally-scented facial cleanser that leaves your skin clean and feeling soft with none of that astringent tightness you can get with other cleansers, you will really enjoy this.</li>
            <li> A single pump provides all the rich lather you&#x27;ll need to wash your face and neck.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin, gets the job done</li>
            <li> I decided to try this face wash out because everything else I seemed to try either made my already combination skin more oily or dried me out to the point that I&#x27;m applying moisturizers during the day.</li>
            <li> This product works as promised and I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my normal cleanser</li>
            <li> The normal shipping rate came in two days.</li>
            <li> I saw this new product at the grocery store and it was on sale</li>
            <li> Where I live, humidity is almost always 80-90%</li>
            <li> (I live in Florida).  </li>
            <li> I bought this in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond a few months ago in an attempt to try more natural skincare ingredients.</li>
            <li> The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve outgrown them for the most part, and when they do come, they are few and far between).</li>
            <li> B00K7HVHYE HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a powerful Superfruit Anti-Oxidant complex!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had red, sensitive skin that was combination and never could find the right skin care that wasn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly (pun intended!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I recently picked up this product from my local Wal-Mart after realizing they were out of my regular refreshing face wash gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Biore foaming cleanser that is not anywhere near as rich in lather and leaves my skin feeling much different than the Simple foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> The Simple Foaming Cleanser, Simple Soothing Facial Toner, Simple Soothing Eye Balm, Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, Simple Soothing Facial Scrub are gentle, effective, and do not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY SOFT NOT HARSH INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> Soon after finishing my Biore I thought I would try Simple Facial Cleanser due to the fact that it claimed it was gentle on the skin and didn&#x27;t have as many chemicals.</li>
            <li> My skin is always glowing after I use this product, and feels so clean without making my face red or dry.</li>
            <li> The cotton comes out clear as day.</li>
            <li> But it could just be that my sensitive, combination skin just doesn&#x27;t react well to foam cleansers.</li>

            <li> really soft on the skin</li>
            <li> Even my 14 year old sister loves it and helps with her acne.</li>
            <li> The foam is instant to use &amp; much easier to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I use this soap twice a day on my sensitive skin with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter cannot use it because it irritates her skin.</li>

            <li> A few days later I was so in love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other Simple product lines and have had no issues: enjoyed the moisturizer and face scrub--no smells and left my skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually started to breakout like I did in high school</li>
            <li> I do not break out, and at the same time, I feel like it is strong enough to take the whole days residue and make up off with very little effort.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched back to my old cleanser and the breakouts have stopped.</li>
            <li> Switched to this after Mary Kay discontinued Basic Skin Care that I&#x27;d used for 20 years for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It cleanse very well but it does feel a little drying afterwards, not completely tight, but I need to put on lotion ASAP.  </li>
            <li> And this exfoliates way better than expensive natural oil soap.</li>
            <li> dried it out completely, and made it very flakey.</li>

            <li> I have an oily T zone and sensitive skin and a lot of other products make me break out, but not this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am almost out this cleanser now and will be purchasing a new one, but the bottle lasted me almost half a year.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable - despite the bottle being small, it comes out as foam which actually lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Very unfortunate as I liked the Simple product line.</li>

            <li> I suffer from horrible eczema on my hands  so this face wash is great as it does not agitate my hands.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my face without irritating it.</li>

            <li> I had this for few month now, and once in a while</li>
            <li> but I use it twice a day everyday because my makeup clogs my pores and my face gets oily.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome for my acne-prone and sensitive skin. Gentle, but gets all the makeup and dirt-of-the-day off my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It has a very light pleasant smell, but not like perfume. It foams very nicely and gets make up off. I love that it is all natural. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A mild foaming cleanser that does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! So natural and clean feeling. I have very sensitive skin and it works great! (it does not take off eye liner or mascara so i use something else for that)</li>
            <li> I like the cleanser. The foam is kinda of thick so you only need one pump. It feels good washing your face with it as well. I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation but I do recommend following up with a moisturizer if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I find that the plunger gets stuck down after a while, when I still have 1/2 of the product left. Fixing this requires removal of the plunger and the cover assembly, flushing it with lots of water and reassembling. Then the same thing happens later on. If this could be designed so this wouldn&#x27;t happen, the product would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Gentle, fragrance-free foaming cleanser. I didn&#x27;t find it too drying for my combination skin, but it&#x27;s not moisturizing. A good, affordable option for any skincare routine. And it seemed to last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this is a safer or gentler alternative. It has all the same harmful chemicals as other face products. Read the ingredients. Green washing at its finest.</li>
            <li> This simple forming cleanser is wounderfull it cleans even eye make up without burning my face is so clean and soft after love it highly recommend thank you</li>
            <li> best cleaner for a very low price</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used Clinique since it came out in the late sixties - but this is an excellent product. So, I will be buying this from now on and saving lots of bucks!!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from horrible eczema on my hands  so this face wash is great as it does not agitate my hands. It is very foamy and creamy and gets the job done. Very good for people with any skin, especially sensitive.</li>
            <li> I saw this new product at the grocery store and it was on sale so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m very pleased and have been buying it ever since. I&#x27;ve been using since it came out. It&#x27;s a rich foam and there&#x27;s plenty in 1 pump of the dispenser to wash your entire face and neck. One bottle lasts me a while and I use it twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I have combination skin where the dry parts are so dry they peel and the oily parts are so oily I could fry an egg. This cleanser helps balance my skin out so it&#x27;s even all over. I also use the Simple daily moisturizer in the winter. I&#x27;d like to try the toner too but I&#x27;m going to finish my clean &amp; clear toner first.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin!!!!!! I have spent countless amounts of money on products trying to find one that works. Finally with this product has worked!! MY friend was also having sensitivity issues and she tried it and it is working for her too. Try this product you will not be sorry. Remember to always rinse well with cold water after using any cleansing product!!</li>
            <li> Cheap face wash. The foaming works fine, but I am not at all a fan of the scent or lack thereof. The smell is admittedly kind of chemically, which I didn&#x27;t expect from the Simple line of products. I probably will not repurchase, and I need to find better foaming face washes.</li>
            <li> I love how well this product works for my sensitive skin. It is gentle and it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and takes off make up well.  It&#x27;s one of the few cleansers that don&#x27;t irritate my eyes and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite face wash. I have sensitive skin that gets oily, so I need a product that will gently clean my skin and actually leave it feeling clean. This does everything I ask for. It did take my skin about a week to adjust to this face wash, but since then my skin is looking good and feels great. I am so happy that I found this product on Amazon since my local Target stopped carrying this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond a few months ago in an attempt to try more natural skincare ingredients. Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for my skin. It made my face feel really clean but for some reason I was breaking out more when I use this cleanser. But it could just be that my sensitive, combination skin just doesn&#x27;t react well to foam cleansers. I will go back to cream cleansers which so far has been the only kind that works. This does make a good hand wash, though. It lathers up very well and makes my hands really soft. :)</li>
            <li> this face wash is just awesome. I have stubborn skin pore wise and the first use my pores were so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> I first tried this face wash when I borrowed it from someone else, and I liked it. Light scent, and not overly-drying on your skin but it leaves you feeling clean. Where I live, humidity is almost always 80-90% so my face gets greasy if I&#x27;m not in AC. I&#x27;ve found this face wash needs two pumps (or one pump/wash, then another) if my face is really greasy, but for most folks I would imagine one pump/wash is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty happy with this. The price is reasonable - despite the bottle being small, it comes out as foam which actually lasts a while. I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle and no problems with the dispenser, which another reviewer had mentioned.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this face wash out because everything else I seemed to try either made my already combination skin more oily or dried me out to the point that I&#x27;m applying moisturizers during the day. My doctor also said that a foaming wash for combination to oily skin works best. This foaming cleanser is fantastic! My skin is not oily, and it does not dry me out. My face doesn&#x27;t even feel tight after I wash it off. It actually feels very smooth. I also loved how long this bottle lasts! You really only need 1 pump, 2 at max, and you should be able to wash both your face and neck. I would definitely recommend buying if you are truly looking for a cleanser that works!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash so much! Originally, I got a sample size of this cleanser. A few days later I was so in love, I purchased a 5 Oz tube of this stuff on Amazon and completely changed my skin regiment.    Just a little bit of this product goes a long way. I use one pump of the cleanser once a day usually in the evenings to remove the daily dirt and makeup off my face. It works like magic and does not sting my eyes. There is pretty much no scent, which is great because I feel like scented cleansers always make my skin break out. I am almost out this cleanser now and will be purchasing a new one, but the bottle lasted me almost half a year. For less than $6, thats an awesome deal.    I have an oily T zone and sensitive skin and a lot of other products make me break out, but not this cleanser. It is so gentle on the skin and like I said, has pretty much no scent! It lathers so nicely, and is foamy yet creamy. My skin is always glowing after I use this product, and feels so clean without making my face red or dry. I feel like my blackheads have definitely diminished as well.    The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products. I used to spend A LOT of money on skin care products and expensive moisturizes - none ever helped. So I gave up and figured if I can&#x27;t make it better with expensive cleansers, why bother spending money on them.    Now, my regiment is as follows and works for me:  In the morning I use the [[ASIN:B00K3YFW9M St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub, 6 Oz.]].. Every other day I use the scrub together with the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]] (I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks. Instead of moisturizer I apply [[ASIN:B00EXPY7NY Elta MD UV Shield SPF 45 Oil-Free 8 oz.]] which helps my skin stay protected from the harmful UV rays all day long without clogging my pores or running down my face when it&#x27;s humid (I live in Florida).  In the evening I use this cleanser and then apply a thin layer of [[ASIN:B00K7HVHYE HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a powerful Superfruit Anti-Oxidant complex! 1oz.]] which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put a tiny dab of [[ASIN:B00K4PLC30 Sweet Almond Oil - Molivera Organics 16 oz. ]] - it is much lighter than traditional moisturizers and more natural and does not clog up my pores.  This regiment has done a world of difference for my face, and I hope if someone decides to give it a try - it will help you as well.</li>
            <li> I used this with one of those cheap spinning facial brushes. It&#x27;s gentle and feels nice on the skin. Just enough lather to feel good without all the parabens and sulfates (the foaming agent in this cleaner is plant derived, I looked it up)</li>
            <li> A very simple cleaner that doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my face or leave it feeling bone dry....  Doesn&#x27;t take a lot in order to cover/clean entire face (certainly not 2 whole pumps that the directions indicate)- will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also have their moisturizer- love that too, just wish it had a little higher SPF)</li>
            <li> Simple was my breakthrough when it comes to skin care. I started using Simple&#x27;s refreshing face wash gel, smoothing facial scrub, and hydrating light moisturizer two years ago. These products have worked miracles on my skin! I went from being the girl in her early 20&#x27;s that was too embarassed to go out because of problematic breakouts, to being complemented on my beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I recently picked up this product from my local Wal-Mart after realizing they were out of my regular refreshing face wash gel. Within two days of using this foaming cleanser a large, painful, cystic pimple sprouted on my chin... then the side of my face, and my forehead, my nose, my mouth, my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve gone back to being too embarassed to leave the house. It did take me awhile to realize the problem was this foaming face wash.&lt;br /&gt;After switching back to the refreshing gel cleanser for the last two days, I again notice a Huge improvement. I can tell my skin is on the up and up, and getting back in balance.&lt;br /&gt;I love simple, but wish I could return this product. It&#x27;s clearly (pun intended!) not for me!</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT. IT IS VERY SOFT NOT HARSH INGREDIENTS. SO FAR FOR ME IT WORKS. I WILL KEEP TRYING IT.</li>
            <li> Seem to be just as sensitive as Skin Effects, which is what I was looking for. I do not break out, and at the same time, I feel like it is strong enough to take the whole days residue and make up off with very little effort. Not much to report otherwise (although to me the latter statement is already a big deal- stronger cleansers, over-dry and sensitize skin, thus causing irritation and stripping of protective layers making it more prone to breakouts), with and exception that the dispenser&#x27;s design is lacking. Not sure who designed it, but certainly not a &amp;#34;user&amp;#34;. The spout opening is at 90%, so when you pump it, it will actually shoot at a 80-90 degree angle, so in nearly perfect projectile. That is, it wont pump into your hand, but past it and into the sink. I had this for few month now, and once in a while I keep forgetting and miss the foam. LOL If you pump, cup the dispenser with your hand, don&#x27;t expect it to fall into it. It wont.</li>
            <li> Simple foaming cleanser is great stuff. My daughter loves it! If you are prone to breakouts this stuff is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Greasy, smelly, and does not seem like you are clean after using it. Thumbs down! Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the simple facial line! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive face and leave it feeling clean without over drying it :) will purchase it again  when I run out along with the simple toner and moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser foams nice and rinses well.</li>
            <li> I really like the simple skin care line because it&#x27;s very kind to my skin. I use this cleanser everyday now and have noticed a great reduction of blackheads. I also really like how two pumps gives such a rich lather. I recommend it to anyone with oily skin (such as myself) and to those who struggle with blackheads.</li>
            <li> This product has become my favorite face wash. really soft on the skin and it makes it feel really clean. Even my 14 year old sister loves it and helps with her acne.</li>
            <li> Very gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. One puff is more than enough to thoroughly cleanse my face. It does nor irritate or dry out my very sensitive skin. The foam is instant to use &amp; much easier to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I use this soap twice a day on my sensitive skin with my Clarisonic. It feels once, cleansing and mild. My 13 year old daughter cannot use it because it irritates her skin. I personally give it 5 stars but because of my daughter dropped it to 4.</li>
            <li> I think this is being discontinued and it&#x27;s the best cleanser</li>
            <li> It works perfect on my sensitive skin.It&#x27;s very foamy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser and does not irritate the eyes, foams nicely and rinses easily.  Leaves your face feeling and smelling clean</li>
            <li> ought this because so many facial cleansers burn my sensitive eyes, so I thought &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; would be gentle. It&#x27;s not...it burns my eyes terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better experience with Murad Pomegranate Cleanser</li>
            <li> It s ok for the price. Although I preffer Aveeno or Biore, anyway it does the work and it&#x27;s not greasy on the face.</li>
            <li> This helped my skin greatly.  Cleanses face without drying or stickyness.  Just fresh and clean.  Has none of the &amp;#34;acne ingredients to avoid&amp;#34; and I do notice the difference.  Skin has cleared up adding this to my rotation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle. Best cleanser yet. Really removes makeup. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or drawn. I use use it daily.</li>
            <li> Love the foam! Only need one pump per wash.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is nice and gentle, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I also like the Simple night cream, and Simple facial moisturizer with sunscreen.  These products are an example of quality products that aren&#x27;t over-priced.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  It seemed to leave a film.  I have very sensitive skin and it made my skin feel sticky.</li>
            <li> Great, gentle. My face looks more even after each use!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!! Gentle enough for my sensitive dry skin, but gets all my makeup (even mascara) off. Lasts a very long time since it&#x27;s the foaming soap. You only need one pump to clean your whole face well.</li>
            <li> After using several different kinds of facial cleansers/scrub such as clean&amp;clear, neutrogena etc. I bought the cleanser and the facial scrub. I use the cleanser in the morning when I wake up and before I got to bed, this includes the facial scrub. It says to use 2-3 times a day but I use it twice a day everyday because my makeup clogs my pores and my face gets oily. I had very small pimples on my cheeks and zits on my forehead, after about 2 weeks, my face cleared up. I love how it leaves my face feeling very soft! I recommend!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and cleans your skin thoroughly without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I really like this and other Simple products. Good price and quality. Fine on my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way. A MUCH better price point than the Bliss I was using with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Works great but not as an everyday facial wash (for myself). It really dried my skin out, but did the job as far as cleansing goes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I am trying to be a little more aware of what I am putting on my skin. I recently decided to cancel my Proactiv subscription because the repairing lotion actually BLEACHED my sheets. So I decided to try out Simple since I was already using their under eye serum. All I can really say is that it&#x27;s okay. It washes my makeup off and it cleans my face...so that&#x27;s great. However, if you have acne prone skin I can&#x27;t say that it may be right for you. At least it wasn&#x27;t for me. I actually started to breakout like I did in high school and I mean ALL over. There isn&#x27;t a spot on my face that hasn&#x27;t been affected. I guess I just need something that it more geared toward preventing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do-clean. However, it just wasn&#x27;t the right fit for me. Everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I used to use Signature A foaming cleanser until I could no longer justify the expense. I was worried about finding a product that was inexpensive but worked without drying my skin out and causing a horrible breakout. Lately, I had been researching the benefits of using a natural cleanser like baking soda but still wanted something easy to use in the shower. Then I found this on Amazon and gave it a go. I am so pleased with the product! It is not drying and I&#x27;ve noticed that the little white bumps I had under my eyes and around my nose are gone. My son is also using the wash and has noticed the blackheads on his nose are almost gone. I&#x27;ll be putting this on auto delivery next month. Highly recommend for any age group. I&#x27;m 54, my son is 25 and it works for the two of us.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many positive reviews, but unfortunately I was one of the few this product wasn&#x27;t meant for. As soon as I started using it, I started getting pimples on my cheek and forehead. I&#x27;ve since switched back to my old cleanser and the breakouts have stopped. It did do a good job of keeping my skin clear of oil, however.</li>
            <li> Love this product not harsh on my skin, less breakouts, however it did not come with the clear top u see in the description, but i will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was really nice when my face was super dry. It didn&#x27;t burn or dry my skin out more. I don&#x27;t know how much it helped with my acne, but it felt nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It foams we&#x27;ll and it not drying</li>
            <li> I take this with me everywhere. Developing acne at 35, it took a lot of time (2 years), and a lot of money to find something that works. Usually I buy this local, but had to find something to add five dollars to my purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CLEANSER! I purchased this, the toner, and the gel moisturizer. I absolutely love all 3. I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had red, sensitive skin that was combination and never could find the right skin care that wasn&#x27;t too pricey. I tried proactiv, neutrogena, etc. NOTHING WORKED!! I noticed this at wal mart and saw that it labeled &amp;#34;sensitive skin experts&amp;#34; and they were right! It&#x27;s amazing. I noticed a difference after the first wash. No irritation, redness, or oily/dry skin. It&#x27;s perfect and my go to face wash. The cleansing wipes are also very good. I have to say I love this skin care line and it&#x27;s so affordable. I will be a continued customer. :)</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena face cleanser but that was garbage. Afterwards, I used Biore which was great. Soon after finishing my Biore I thought I would try Simple Facial Cleanser due to the fact that it claimed it was gentle on the skin and didn&#x27;t have as many chemicals. I used it as a soon as I received it through mail. I FELL IN LOVE with this product. Keep in mind I have always had extremely oily skin ever since I could remember and this product has controlled it exceptionally well. I love that its very foamy and you only need 1 pump to cleanse your entire face. It is also VERY GENTLE on the skin. I very much recommend this product to any one in search of a face cleanser that gets the job done like it claims. Give it a try. The price is decent and you wont regret it! :)</li>
            <li> Always love this cleanser</li>
            <li> Decent for it&#x27;s price. Removes foundation make up without feeling harsh or drying. However, you should always moisturize after washing your face.</li>
            <li> like it seem, but it makes my face feel funny</li>
            <li> I had a really sensitive face and have struggled since I was 12 (19 now) to find a great cleanser, and I can honestly say this does this job. It&#x27;s effective, gentle, and even is clearing my face up!</li>
            <li> Although in general it does foam up and seems very gentle, it absolutely did not remove make up. Even if I washed my eye area three or four times with the stuff to make it won&#x27;t come off. Kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it burns my eyes. I have very sensitive eyes and I was looking for something that would burn less.</li>
            <li> After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  The “Simple” product line was the answer.  The Simple Foaming Cleanser, Simple Soothing Facial Toner, Simple Soothing Eye Balm, Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, Simple Soothing Facial Scrub are gentle, effective, and do not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Its reasonably priced.  It cleans my face well.  I was breaking out from other face washes.  Using product has decreased the breakout.  I am so glad I bought 2!  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! Works great!</li>
            <li> This product works as promised and I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li> The gel worked better for me but great brand!</li>
            <li> Target was out of my usually cleanser (Neutrogena Naturals face wash) so I bought this because the product line seemed to catwe to my combination/sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first t felt like it was either leaving a film, or drying my skin out completely, or both. It felt like I was washing my face with Dial Soap or something. I started getting pimples here and there (I&#x27;m 33 so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve outgrown them for the most part, and when they do come, they are few and far between). Now my whole face is covered in painful red pimples, some in places I&#x27;ve never had them before, like all around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foaming cleanser definitely is not the product I thought it was. It doesn&#x27;t feel quite right when I try to rinse it off, and it&#x27;s very drying. I&#x27;m staying home as much as possible until my skin clears up (it hasn&#x27;t looked like this since puberty). Definitely not recommending this to anyone, and going back to my usual product immediately!</li>
            <li> the best product for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have MCS(Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t cause any trouble! Thank God! I&#x27;m really sensitive even to any kind of unscented soaps and having trouble, but this cleanser is fine somehow. And this exfoliates way better than expensive natural oil soap. So it seems like it has some kind of chemicals(Please read the description.) but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!</li>
            <li> I just love this foaming cleanser. It has a great dispenser so it&#x27;s easy to get the right amount of cleanser. When it comes in touch with water is foams very well. You can really get a great lather and it&#x27;s easy to divide it over your face. I like to use it with my facial brush in the morning. It really cleans my face without irritating it. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards but fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a very good face wash. It takes good care of my skin. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I like the ease of this foaming cleanser, It goes on quickly and comes off even quicker. I like it.</li>
            <li> This works well on my sensitive skin. Did not irritate or dry out my skin. Easy to wash off. Hard to find in stores-- so I ordered it. Lasts a long time .</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of this foaming cleanser but I still can&#x27;t get used to the smell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a user of several Simple products. I use the face scrub, this foaming cleanser and the face cleansing gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foaming cleanser is my favorite of the bunch. I like it because the lather is the richest, sort of creamy, most luxurious cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used a Biore foaming cleanser that is not anywhere near as rich in lather and leaves my skin feeling much different than the Simple foaming cleanser. I like both for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, minimally-scented facial cleanser that leaves your skin clean and feeling soft with none of that astringent tightness you can get with other cleansers, you will really enjoy this. A single pump provides all the rich lather you&#x27;ll need to wash your face and neck. This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin, gets the job done</li>
            <li> I switched to this about 6 months ago. I love the foam....it leaves my face feeling fresh, clean, and oil free.</li>
            <li> I happened to come across this product by coincidence and oh wow, what a great coincidence that was! Tis product is the ONLY face cleaner that strips away all make up with just two pumps. I would always need a toner to remove all of that residue that always lingers after washing. Not with this product! The cotton comes out clear as day. My daughter started to use it bc I was bragging so much abt how soft and clean my face felt, and her acne has diminished considerably. Great product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> It helped my blackhead and acne.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this.  She really likes it.  The foam is easy to use and gentle for her skin. She also does not have any moisture problems.</li>
            <li> Mine came without a cap which is pretty annoying. The cleanser itself is basic, which I see as a good thing. Washes your face with or overdrying and that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> It cleanse very well but it does feel a little drying afterwards, not completely tight, but I need to put on lotion ASAP.  I have sensitive combination skin, dry on the cheek but oily T-zone w/ black and white heads, I can see this is a great cleanser for summer but I won&#x27;t use it for winter time.</li>
            <li> This line of products make my face fill so clean and fresh. I have great results with the simple products.</li>
            <li> this was very abrasive to my oily skin. dried it out completely, and made it very flakey. I found that if you dilute it by pouring distilled water into a half full bottle of this, its a lot less abrasive and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I buy these two at a type. Use it on my face and body. The foam really gets into your pore. Great stuff and cheaper here than in the store.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and a little goes a long way, which is something I am most impressed about with the Simple line of products that I have tried already it&#x27;s all high quality stuff at and irresistible cost</li>
            <li> Switched to this after Mary Kay discontinued Basic Skin Care that I&#x27;d used for 20 years for my sensitive skin. This product is gentle and effective with no breakouts or irritation from switching over. Been using the whole Simple line for about a year now and am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on face and seems to get the grime off in an effortless manner. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup so there&#x27;s not a lot of makeup to remove. ex: mascara no heavy made up eyes; so keep that in mind. Id say this is working out for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20-year old with acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve kept it in order with my acne medication and well-developed skin care regimen. I ran out of my normal cleanser so I decided to give the Simple foam cleanser a try. I&#x27;ve used the other Simple product lines and have had no issues: enjoyed the moisturizer and face scrub--no smells and left my skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this foam cleanser for 2 weeks gave me horrible and giant pimples on my chin! They started to popping up on the chin, then on my forehead, and on the side of my temple. They lasted on my face for about a week. I stopped using the cleanser immediately, and the pimple started to die down. Very unfortunate as I liked the Simple product line.</li>
            <li> The normal shipping rate came in two days. This product works wonders with my sensitive skin. It took me many years to find a product that worked, and this seems to be it.</li>
