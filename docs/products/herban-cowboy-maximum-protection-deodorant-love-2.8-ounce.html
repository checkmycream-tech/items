            <li>Honestly I am always paranoid I stink and this stuff works!</li>
            <li>The smell of it itself, isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I would have hoped for.</li>
            <li>Wonderful,  light scent.</li>
            <li>smells good, just not for what i need.</li>
            <li>It keeps me odor free all day, and it has a BEAUTIFUL fragrance!  </li>
            <li>quick delivery from seller was excellent.</li>

            <li>however, it does smell good on its own.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the LOVE!!!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>I purchased everything I could find and I also tried making my own and that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>kindly remember...</li>
            <li>My husband loves the Forest kind</li>
            <li>Her friend ended up loving it too and ordered it for herself.  </li>
            <li>I thought ok, maybe it is because I have to put it on right after the shower for best results.</li>
            <li>I love (LOVE!)</li>
            <li>Baby powder would have been more effective.</li>
            <li>And this has been the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Im not into fragrances or strong smells either, so its surprising Im satisfied with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I recently started using this Herban Cowboy LOVE, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>this product is okay.</li>
            <li>i love the smell.</li>
            <li>sure if the person who says they come out of</li>
            <li>Love both of those as well.</li>
            <li>I love this most of the time.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to those who don&#x27;t like most frangranty smells of popular deodorants or just aren&#x27;t that much of a fragrant person either.</li>
            <li>This smells like Nina Ricci&#x27;s &amp;#34;L&#x27;air du Temps&amp;#34;, and quite strongly, might I add.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great, the coverage is great especially for an all natural product!</li>
            <li>Hot Yoga smelling amazing just doesn&#x27;t sweat or what, because once i start to sweat, this deodorant like evaporates or something because it doesn&#x27;t stop the sweaty smell nor does it mask it.</li>
            <li>This is just an undoubtedly wonderful smell, no one can resist loving this smell, seriously.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at whole foods and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>and he smells fantastic.....</li>
            <li>That was great, but I wanted to try a different scent.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this deodorant for my 11 year old daughter...</li>
            <li>BUT this one really does work!!!  </li>
            <li>Love is my favorite my far!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a safer alternative to regular deodorants, and it&#x27;s nice not having any discoloring from the aluminum in antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>The key is to find the one that neutralizes odor most effectively.</li>
            <li>Luckily for now I am a at home mom</li>
            <li>It also feels very silky, glides easily.</li>
            <li>so much I am willing to try anything!</li>
            <li>It was fresh and not too perfume-y.</li>
            <li>But it was worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the fact that I was sweating, I just didn&#x27;t like the fact that I didn&#x27;t smell fresh...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more natural.</li>
            <li>I love natural deodorant and have tried many, loved the look of this and thought I would give it a try, especially since it is a clear deodorant, with the hope that it wouldn&#x27;t leave white streaks on my shirts.</li>
            <li>And it works really well!</li>
            <li>and I do not even sweat that much!</li>
            <li>Blossom second :)</li>
            <li>It was pretty meh.</li>
            <li>I ended up just going with a potassium alum crystal (an ingredient already in this) and it works much better without all the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>I practice hot power yoga...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants over the years, and this by far the winner in terms of quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this deodorant on I got funky, and fast.</li>
            <li>I bought my first stick at whole foods in blossom scent.</li>
            <li>so I had plenty of time to figure out what really worked.</li>
            <li>Deodorant not antiperspirant, so expect wetness to still occur, but it&#x27;ll just smell much nicer with this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot, but it is somewhat agitating that once I start to, I no longer smell like the product, but again, they are not an antiperspirant</li>
            <li>I just bought this deodorant today at whole foods for $6.99.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this is even legal to be on the market.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t really bank that you will.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this...and other reviewer...</li>
            <li>Long lasting smells nice</li>
            <li>I even tried twice more thinking it should get better, but unfortunately, it did not.  </li>
            <li>I wore it for a week, but was really self conscious about how I smelled the whole time.</li>
            <li>For a natural deodorant, this has way too much perfume.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this deodorant because my husband uses the Herban Cowboy for men and has had good results, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the same.</li>
            <li>right next to your breasts?</li>
            <li>So far, it lasts for about 12 hours before I feel like I need to use any more, but that is usually long enough anyways.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of other naturals brands in the past that I did not find to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>But I am very very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both Wild and Blossom....</li>
            <li>I did not like this smell at all, nothing natural about it.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try a natural approach to deodorant.  </li>
            <li>any natural deodorant (without aluminum) won&#x27;t stop you from sweating.</li>
            <li>It was a little costly, considering I normally pay around $4.00 for regular deodorants, but the thought of using something totally natural and with a beautiful fragrance outweighed the cost (I paid $8.99 at a local small health food store that carried it.)</li>
            <li>you effectively are rubbing dangerous poisons right next to your breasts when you use aluminum based antiperspirants....</li>
            <li>Needs reapplying in the summer, but not other months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only natural and non antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that helps.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that worked.</li>
            <li>Nearly after only 30 minutes of putting on the Herban Cowboy Maximum Protection Deodorant, I had to rush back home to get my reliable deodorant because this was NOT working.  </li>

            <li> I think it is something about the gel that just makes me stink because I have had the same results with other natural gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> but it just doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li> being in the military i am constantly wearing body armor over 25lbs so that could be the case.</li>
            <li> I immediately put it on in the car and literally 5 minutes later I was already soaking wet in sweat--</li>
            <li> I have tried many different deodorants and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it a complete negative review, but I can say that as a SoCal girl who is active, this offered no odor protection for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not potent enough for when I hit the gym.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand, do not like it.</li>
            <li> I do not want my baby sucking that down while feeding.</li>
            <li> and it made me have a slight rash.</li>
            <li> if you want antiperspirant you have to mess with aluminum....</li>
            <li> Therefore, I went home, took a shower, dried off and then applied this deodorant again as directed.</li>
            <li> I have been using natural deodorant for about 8 months, so it wasn&#x27;t my body getting used to not having aluminum or other artificial ingredients to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> I like that I can feel the thin layer staying put on my skin unlike salt sprays or other options I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> even when playing three 40 minute games of hard basketball in August.</li>
            <li> When I purchased mine, I had also purchased for my brother and my husband the Herban Cowboy for men, I was disappointed that they also were in the same situation, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter stated that my underarms smell worse with it on.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this deodorant does not have any chemicals that are bad for you and allows you to still sweat without smelling bad.</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t hate on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cuts through the worst pubescent odors...</li>

            <li> First let me say that I LOVED the smell. It was fresh and not too perfume-y. I was so excited to try this deodorant because my husband uses the Herban Cowboy for men and has had good results, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the same. The first day I used this deodorant on I got funky, and fast. I have been using natural deodorant for about 8 months, so it wasn&#x27;t my body getting used to not having aluminum or other artificial ingredients to mask the smell. I think it is something about the gel that just makes me stink because I have had the same results with other natural gel deodorants. If Herban Cowboy came out with a &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; deodorant in stick form I would buy it instantly. Great company and would love to support them.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have been on a search for a while now to find a woman&#x27;s deodorant that is NOT antiperspirant and it is such a challenge to find.  For my husband it is not a problem to find them, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a man!  I recently started using this Herban Cowboy LOVE, and it smells great!  So far, it lasts for about 12 hours before I feel like I need to use any more, but that is usually long enough anyways.  I like the fact that this deodorant does not have any chemicals that are bad for you and allows you to still sweat without smelling bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at whole foods and LOVE it! I am a breast feeding mama and did not want my baby being so close to all the chemicals in the deodorant I was using! Honestly I am always paranoid I stink and this stuff works! Luckily for now I am a at home mom so I had plenty of time to figure out what really worked. I purchased everything I could find and I also tried making my own and that didn&#x27;t work either. So for me this stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After some research I found this product does have aluminum which means for me it is just like the commercial bought stuff. I do not want my baby sucking that down while feeding. I did notice the blossom sent did not have it I like this produce so much I am willing to try anything!</li>
            <li> Wonderful,  light scent. And it works really well! I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants over the years, and this by far the winner in terms of quality and effectiveness. It also feels very silky, glides easily. Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> smells great! quick delivery from seller was excellent. Deodorant not antiperspirant, so expect wetness to still occur, but it&#x27;ll just smell much nicer with this deodorant.  Love that it&#x27;s a safer alternative to regular deodorants, and it&#x27;s nice not having any discoloring from the aluminum in antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> this product is okay. i love the smell. but it just doesnt last too long. being in the military i am constantly wearing body armor over 25lbs so that could be the case. smells good, just not for what i need. so if your using this to go to the gym, or play a sport i would not reccomend.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on total effectiveness for me so stay tuned - however, it does smell good on its own.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smells nice</li>
            <li> This WILL NOT stop you from sweating lol, not everyone realizes its JUST a deodorant not an antiperspirant. I wanted to give it 4 stars because of this, but they don&#x27;t market it out to be a sweat stopper, so I can&#x27;t hold it against them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell absolutely wonderful, I&#x27;d just describe it as a flowery/fruity/fresh combination. Im not into fragrances or strong smells either, so its surprising Im satisfied with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if the person who says they come out of Hot Yoga smelling amazing just doesn&#x27;t sweat or what, because once i start to sweat, this deodorant like evaporates or something because it doesn&#x27;t stop the sweaty smell nor does it mask it. I don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot, but it is somewhat agitating that once I start to, I no longer smell like the product, but again, they are not an antiperspirant so i can&#x27;t hate on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great smell. I would not say the smell will last all day--perhaps if you combine it with an odorless antiperspirant? I like it a lot! I would recommend to those who don&#x27;t like most frangranty smells of popular deodorants or just aren&#x27;t that much of a fragrant person either. This is just an undoubtedly wonderful smell, no one can resist loving this smell, seriously.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this...and other reviewer...kindly remember...this is a deodorant...it is not antiperspirant....if you want antiperspirant you have to mess with aluminum....meaning: you have to rub aluminum on your lymph nodes....right next to your breasts? you effectively are rubbing dangerous poisons right next to your breasts when you use aluminum based antiperspirants....so NO....I do not want to use antiperspirants....but this smells delicious...I will tell you....it will not make you stop sweating..... but it will help with odor. that&#x27;s what deodorant does. This is a wonderful product that smells amazing. please make a perfume for this...or some great body creme!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this deodorant today at whole foods for $6.99. I immediately put it on in the car and literally 5 minutes later I was already soaking wet in sweat-- and I do not even sweat that much! I thought ok, maybe it is because I have to put it on right after the shower for best results. Therefore, I went home, took a shower, dried off and then applied this deodorant again as directed. Thirty minutes later, I had already sweated through the underarms of my shirt. IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL! Baby powder would have been more effective. I am in the process of requesting a refund for this product. I have no idea how this is even legal to be on the market. I have tried many different deodorants and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the coverage is great especially for an all natural product! I&#x27;ve struggled to find one that works and I think this may be a winner!</li>
            <li> Love this deoderant!!! Smells fantastic and it works!!!</li>
            <li> Scent is a bit manly (it is for a girl...) and it made me have a slight rash. But I am very very sensitive. So don&#x27;t really bank that you will. My husband loves the Forest kind and he smells fantastic.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both Wild and Blossom....Love is my favorite my far! Blossom second :)</li>
            <li> I love natural deodorant and have tried many, loved the look of this and thought I would give it a try, especially since it is a clear deodorant, with the hope that it wouldn&#x27;t leave white streaks on my shirts. Nearly after only 30 minutes of putting on the Herban Cowboy Maximum Protection Deodorant, I had to rush back home to get my reliable deodorant because this was NOT working.  I even tried twice more thinking it should get better, but unfortunately, it did not.  When I purchased mine, I had also purchased for my brother and my husband the Herban Cowboy for men, I was disappointed that they also were in the same situation, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only natural and non antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that helps. It doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat but it keeps the BO at bay for the day. I like that I can feel the thin layer staying put on my skin unlike salt sprays or other options I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is great and reminds me of my Mark Jacobs Daisy perfume.</li>
            <li> This smells like Nina Ricci&#x27;s &amp;#34;L&#x27;air du Temps&amp;#34;, and quite strongly, might I add.  I did not like this smell at all, nothing natural about it. For a natural deodorant, this has way too much perfume. Otherwise, performs well.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my fianc&amp;eacute;, she loves it.  Her friend ended up loving it too and ordered it for herself.  I use the &amp;#34;Wild&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Dusk&amp;#34; scents for myself.  Love both of those as well.</li>
            <li> It was pretty meh. I like the smell initially but it seems to amplify my funk and does nothing to reduce odor. I ended up just going with a potassium alum crystal (an ingredient already in this) and it works much better without all the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that worked. I bought my first stick at whole foods in blossom scent. That was great, but I wanted to try a different scent. I love (LOVE!) this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this most of the time. It&#x27;s not potent enough for when I hit the gym.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the LOVE!!!!  I don&#x27;t sweat under my arms so I decided to try a natural approach to deodorant.  I have tried a couple of other naturals brands in the past that I did not find to be very effective.  BUT this one really does work!!!  It keeps me odor free all day, and it has a BEAUTIFUL fragrance!  I am so impressed with Herban Cowboy!  It was a little costly, considering I normally pay around $4.00 for regular deodorants, but the thought of using something totally natural and with a beautiful fragrance outweighed the cost (I paid $8.99 at a local small health food store that carried it.) Next time I&#x27;ll order it from Amazon.  But it was worth it to me.  THANK YOU, Herban Cowboy!  I&#x27;m totally impressed and I smell so nice !!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! This is not an antiperspirant... any natural deodorant (without aluminum) won&#x27;t stop you from sweating. The key is to find the one that neutralizes odor most effectively. And this has been the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I practice hot power yoga...I&#x27;m talking over 100 degrees, clothing soaked through with sweat, and I still smelled like flowers afterwards. No lie.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this deodorant for my 11 year old daughter...cuts through the worst pubescent odors...even when playing three 40 minute games of hard basketball in August.</li>
            <li> So I bought this because I am trying to eliminate aluminum from my deodorant. A friend of mine who lives in Maine loves this. I on the other hand, do not like it. I can&#x27;t give it a complete negative review, but I can say that as a SoCal girl who is active, this offered no odor protection for me. The smell of it itself, isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I would have hoped for. I wore it for a week, but was really self conscious about how I smelled the whole time. My oldest daughter stated that my underarms smell worse with it on. I didn&#x27;t mind the fact that I was sweating, I just didn&#x27;t like the fact that I didn&#x27;t smell fresh...</li>
            <li> After several trials and stinky errors, this is the only &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; deodorant that works for me. Needs reapplying in the summer, but not other months. Best part is it NEVER marks up your clothes.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s more natural. Works well keeping you from getting stinky! It is not an antiperspirant.</li>
