            <li>The price was OUTSTANDING, and I was happy about every aspect of the transaction!</li>
            <li>Good job</li>

            <li>I wish I had gotten it sooner, but am thrilled at the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>I always felt self-conscious about my thinning hair, but not any more, thanks to Joan Rivers Great Hair Day!  </li>
            <li>COVERS EASILY AND STAYS WHERE YOU PUT IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this !</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more confident and is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I have also found that longer hair covers the thinning front better and that the powder gives BODY to my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Returned order for a quick refund so service was good.</li>
            <li>Liked it, easy to use</li>
            <li>- I love it -</li>
            <li>I have had thinning hair for many many years.</li>
            <li>- I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work as well as the Brunette shade, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the salt and pepper color as my hair is almost white, but it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Joan I love the salt and pepper although at times it crumbles in the container</li>
            <li>Be sure to wear a towel around your neck to catch the &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34; powder</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for providing great sellers with reasonably priced products.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product in several shades for over 2 years now and it&#x27;s the greatest.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d do better with a pal putting it on for me.</li>
            <li>It actually works great!</li>
            <li>When applied correctly -- which takes some time, skill, and a better brush than the one that it comes with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple products for thinning hair, but this products works THE BEST.  </li>
            <li>but you do need to make sure scalp is dry to best effect.  </li>
            <li>Joan Rivers&#x27; salt &amp; pepper is a medium gray with no red in it, perfect for light brown hair that is graying.</li>
            <li>After many years of looking for ways to camouflage my thinning hair (especially on top and towards front), I am THRILLED to have found a perfect product that not only eliminates the thin spots, but it thickens the hair as well.  </li>
            <li>stays in, makes me feel more comfortable to let the wind blow, if you will</li>
            <li>So, let Amazon hook you and your crop up right away!!</li>
            <li>This product covers my bald spots, due to age, wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and covers thinning areas and makes your hair seem fuller.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>months later... am still really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This color will also work for those with light brown hair.  </li>
            <li>However, it does not give body the way Toppik does, so maybe I should take away one star, but I&#x27;m so happy to finally have the right color</li>
            <li>So, I use a large makeup brush and that works better for me.  </li>
            <li>As a woman with PCOS, my hair has been thinning for some time, and none of the remedies like Rogaine or special shampoos worked for me.</li>
            <li>Shop around for the best price -- even with a quantity discount at the official site, you&#x27;ll likely do better from an Amazon affiliate or other online store.</li>
            <li>I am starting to get thinner in the back of my head, this for me (the salt and pepper was perfect).</li>
            <li>Had been packaged well and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde highlights - the &#x27;blonde&#x27; color works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>I AM GETTING :) WOULD HIGHLY  </li>
            <li>The quick and easy application of this product makes me appear to have the full head of hair I enjoyed in my younger years.</li>
            <li>I sent for my first order in brunette and was Amazed!</li>
            <li>My hair is really thinning on top and is really noticeable..  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t look like you painted your scalp, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>I am however, ordering the salt &amp; pepper hoping it will look more natural as the gray gets dominent.</li>
            <li>I think i could have done as well with the right color eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>and it is just right for my hair.</li>
            <li>It blends well, is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and is not messy.  </li>
            <li>I tried formulating my own fill-in powder, which met with mixed results -- decent coverage but no staying power.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The color is much to dark...more &amp;#34;pepper&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>My gray is actually more white and is made muddy looking by this shade.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it was nearly worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase, especially at the price I paid</li>
            <li>But it did exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>With thinning hair and areas of the scalp that shine, this product fills in those areas and helps the hair look fuller and more like when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly bald on top of my scalp in front, but I have plenty of hair all over the rest of my head, so the baldness in front is very apparent.</li>
            <li>:  the fine powder tends to get all over the bathroom sink and other surfaces, so be prepared to take a damp cloth and wipe bathroom surfaces quickly after use.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks much fuller.</li>
            <li>and i really like it alot.</li>
            <li>But if you have salt &amp; pepper, or light brown with no red in it, you are stuck.</li>
            <li>Joan Rivers really out did herself with this product-</li>
            <li>THANKS JOAN from the bottom of my heart.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>The product also arrived damaged, but the vendor was very cooperative and offered a refund.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Had to use a thinner brush than supplied, but it worked really well.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY HELPS THE BALD SPOTS</li>
            <li>It was a bargain for what it does, but I don&#x27;t like the compact lid because it comes loose to easily.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s SO natural looking, unlike other products that cost so much more.  </li>
            <li>My friends say it looks natural unless they peer very closely at my roots, and who does that?</li>
            <li>This is a great product I buy this for my mother who has very thin hair in the front  </li>
            <li>I looks very natural -</li>
            <li>JR&#x27;s GHD really masks my bare scalp and makes my remaining hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>I still wear it as usual, but it looks so much better now.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>For the first time in a long time, I wasnt so conscious of the fact that my scalp was shining through.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try Joan River&#x27;s day fill powder and - WOW</li>
            <li>I have been embarrassed by a balding spot in the very front of my hair for several years before I found this product.</li>
            <li>It works, and it is so natural looking</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist says it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>Not messy at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product keeps the &amp;#34;scalp shine&amp;#34; down, but I really don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with because it seems to put too much on at once.  </li>
            <li>I began Great Hair Day after consulting a beautician about my hair and discovering that even very expensive shampoo DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li>This product lasts such a long time as you don&#x27;t need much to cover the exposed scalp areas.  </li>
            <li>I am an aging woman with lots of issues about my looks and now, the thin hair on top is not an issue.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t shine through my thin mostly white/some gray hair.  </li>
            <li>It has completely changed the way I feel every single day about how I look.</li>
            <li>The dark grey of the powder tends to tone down some of the white hair, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works and hides the spot if you need to hide a little thinning  area.</li>
            <li>This product really makes my hair look fuller - I am in my late 50&#x27;s and starting to grey and this product really works well for me though it is a darker grey</li>

            <li> It was a bargain for what it does, but I don&#x27;t like the compact lid because it comes loose to easily.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s SO natural looking, unlike other products that cost so much more.  </li>
            <li> My friends say it looks natural unless they peer very closely at my roots, and who does that?</li>
            <li> This is a great product I buy this for my mother who has very thin hair in the front  </li>
            <li> I looks very natural -</li>
            <li> JR&#x27;s GHD really masks my bare scalp and makes my remaining hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> I still wear it as usual, but it looks so much better now.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> For the first time in a long time, I wasnt so conscious of the fact that my scalp was shining through.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try Joan River&#x27;s day fill powder and - WOW</li>
            <li> I have been embarrassed by a balding spot in the very front of my hair for several years before I found this product.</li>
            <li> It works, and it is so natural looking</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist says it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> Not messy at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product keeps the &amp;#34;scalp shine&amp;#34; down, but I really don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with because it seems to put too much on at once.  </li>
            <li> I began Great Hair Day after consulting a beautician about my hair and discovering that even very expensive shampoo DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> This product lasts such a long time as you don&#x27;t need much to cover the exposed scalp areas.  </li>
            <li> I am an aging woman with lots of issues about my looks and now, the thin hair on top is not an issue.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t shine through my thin mostly white/some gray hair.  </li>
            <li> It has completely changed the way I feel every single day about how I look.</li>
            <li> The dark grey of the powder tends to tone down some of the white hair, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works and hides the spot if you need to hide a little thinning  area.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my hair look fuller - I am in my late 50&#x27;s and starting to grey and this product really works well for me though it is a darker grey</li>
            <li> , I was very disappointed, got my money back, but would have rather had&lt;br /&gt;the product, it was a great price, can&#x27;t find a decent price on the product when I can find it</li>
            <li> I previously ordered another color and now salt and pepper, but they seem similar colors and my hair doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and reordered however, the product does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The last two orders were unusable as the powder was dry and flaky and did not stick at all.  </li>
            <li> The product lasts a long time between applications (several days), doesn&#x27;t rub or wear off, and each compact lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not completely gray and this product helps fill in the gaps that thinning has caused.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Joan for giving us back our dignity after menopause tries to steal it.</li>
            <li> I have a family history of bald spots for women, mine is large, this is the only product that works, it is very hard to find,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> (I wear a baseball cap the rest of the time) and over a year later I&#x27;ve only used up half of the product.</li>
            <li> even my daughter who would most definitely tell me if it looked bad said if I hadn&#x27;t told her she wouldn&#x27;t know what i had done, and even after I told her what the product was</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin hair on the top of my head which I especially hate when I&#x27;m caught in a photo - light shining off the top of your head makes it look even worse...</li>
            <li> but there was a little bit of a learning curve, apply to back of head via mirror.  </li>
            <li> I would get so frustrated trying to cover up the pink scalp area on top of my head to no avail.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks, but you don&#x27;t have to accept everything.  </li>
            <li> one of the packages I ordered was empty</li>
            <li> This works to disguise my pink scalp</li>
            <li> It works well to cover the pink of my bald spots.  </li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve tried have flacked off, onto my face and into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> But other than that no one can tell I use it.</li>
            <li> I used it to fill in and color my grey and black eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I am letting my hair grow out to it&#x27;s natual White/gray--a rather ugly process from dark brown, and have still been using the brunette powder and it looks fine.  </li>
            <li> Only negative</li>
            <li> The product said it was for white or gray hair, but it made my scalp just look dirty (white hair), so if you too have white hair, I would pass on this product.  </li>
            <li> It works amazing, do not be afraid to try it!!</li>
            <li> Also, If I shake a little Toppik (dark brown) over this lighter JR color, it adds the little body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin hair, but have lost a lot of hair lately due to age, especially on the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> Like many \\&quot;older\\&quot; ladies, I was shocked to realize my hair was falling out!</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> I really like Toppik fiber hair cover, but the colors are awful - unless you have jet black or really dark brown hair, or red auburn.</li>
            <li> I was even in the audience at a local tv show and when the cameras caught me no \\&quot;poor bald lady\\&quot; look !  </li>
            <li> I considered a wig but never liked wearing one.</li>
            <li> buying it this way was easiery and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Despite this, several people have complemented me on my hair and are shocked when I tell them &#x27;I&#x27;m practically bald,&#x27; and use this powder to cover the bald spots.  </li>
            <li> No more snorts and snarls for me-- when I look in the mirror at my crop of hair!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Problem was, wrong color sent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> have been using this product for 3 years and it works as well as advertised. buying it this way was easiery and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin hair on the top of my head which I especially hate when I&#x27;m caught in a photo - light shining off the top of your head makes it look even worse... My hairdresser told me about this product and I figured \\&quot;what have I got to lose\\&quot; - I love it - I was even in the audience at a local tv show and when the cameras caught me no \\&quot;poor bald lady\\&quot; look !  I looks very natural - even my daughter who would most definitely tell me if it looked bad said if I hadn&#x27;t told her she wouldn&#x27;t know what i had done, and even after I told her what the product was and she checked closer she said it looked great !  LOVE LOVE LOVE this !</li>
            <li> This has been a godsend!  I&#x27;ve ordered and reordered however, the product does last a long time.  Try it.. it&#x27;s the best for those of us with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> The last two orders were unusable as the powder was dry and flaky and did not stick at all.  The texture was much different.  I&#x27;m not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair for many many years. I would get so frustrated trying to cover up the pink scalp area on top of my head to no avail. I considered a wig but never liked wearing one. Then one day my cousin gave me this Joan Rivers product &#x27;cause her husband didn&#x27;t want to use it. It has completely changed the way I feel every single day about how I look. Just a couple of minutes every morning and my hair looks much fuller. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of filling in thinning hair by coloring the scalp.  It does not come off until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> this product does what it says it does and i really like it alot. the color is spot on and i wouldnt change a thing.</li>
            <li> I really like Toppik fiber hair cover, but the colors are awful - unless you have jet black or really dark brown hair, or red auburn. But if you have salt &amp; pepper, or light brown with no red in it, you are stuck. Joan Rivers&#x27; salt &amp; pepper is a medium gray with no red in it, perfect for light brown hair that is graying. It also has the advantage of being applied with a brush, so there&#x27;s no shaking a container &amp; worrying about \\&quot;drift\\&quot; into the hairline. However, it does not give body the way Toppik does, so maybe I should take away one star, but I&#x27;m so happy to finally have the right color, I&#x27;m giving it 5. Also, If I shake a little Toppik (dark brown) over this lighter JR color, it adds the little body I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 months later... am still really happy with this product. And it lasts! I use it a few times a week (I wear a baseball cap the rest of the time) and over a year later I&#x27;ve only used up half of the product.</li>
            <li> After many years of looking for ways to camouflage my thinning hair (especially on top and towards front), I am THRILLED to have found a perfect product that not only eliminates the thin spots, but it thickens the hair as well.  And it&#x27;s SO natural looking, unlike other products that cost so much more.  This product lasts such a long time as you don&#x27;t need much to cover the exposed scalp areas.  I always felt self-conscious about my thinning hair, but not any more, thanks to Joan Rivers Great Hair Day!  I&#x27;m so happy now!!</li>
            <li> No more snorts and snarls for me-- when I look in the mirror at my crop of hair!!  All my bald points now get covered!!! Joan Rivers really out did herself with this product- which only takes a of couple minutes to apply!!  My crop looks healthier than ever.  Girlz--you all know you need to get this product for your own crop ASAP!!!  So, let Amazon hook you and your crop up right away!! Remember your beauty requires this purchase!!  And Joan has it in all colors!!</li>
            <li> This product really makes my hair look fuller - I am in my late 50&#x27;s and starting to grey and this product really works well for me though it is a darker grey - I can blend it in though &amp; you would not notice the difference!</li>
            <li> My hair is really thinning on top and is really noticeable..  I thought I would try Joan River&#x27;s day fill powder and - WOW - I am so glad I did.  I am an aging woman with lots of issues about my looks and now, the thin hair on top is not an issue.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier about the product.  THANKS JOAN from the bottom of my heart. I can look in the mirror and like the way my hair looks now.  Sandy</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.  Covers patches of thinning hair and fills in part line perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really works. For the first time in a long time, I wasnt so conscious of the fact that my scalp was shining through.</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT!  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work as well as the Brunette shade, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I am starting to get thinner in the back of my head, this for me (the salt and pepper was perfect). I dust a bit with the brush keeping  in the direction of my hair and voila&#x27; no shine from the bald spot. Gone</li>
            <li> Best product I could have imagined to cover thinning areas on the top of my head.  The quick and easy application of this product makes me appear to have the full head of hair I enjoyed in my younger years.</li>
            <li> The color is much to dark...more &amp;#34;pepper&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34;! My gray is actually more white and is made muddy looking by this shade.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have been embarrassed by a balding spot in the very front of my hair for several years before I found this product. It works, and it is so natural looking I just wish I had found this sooner. It works amazing, do not be afraid to try it!!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these products and this is the only one that works well.  You have to practice applying it until you get the knack so it doesn&#x27;t look like you painted your scalp, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.  I&#x27;ve always had thin hair, but have lost a lot of hair lately due to age, especially on the crown of my head.  Despite this, several people have complemented me on my hair and are shocked when I tell them &#x27;I&#x27;m practically bald,&#x27; and use this powder to cover the bald spots.  They swear you can&#x27;t tell.  I use the salt and pepper.  The dark grey of the powder tends to tone down some of the white hair, which is fine with me.  Once it&#x27;s applied, it stays on until washed out.  Other products I&#x27;ve tried have flacked off, onto my face and into my eyes.  Only negative:  the fine powder tends to get all over the bathroom sink and other surfaces, so be prepared to take a damp cloth and wipe bathroom surfaces quickly after use.</li>
            <li> Great product if you are experiencing hair loss and want to camouflage.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and very satisfied.  People do not believe that I have hair loss problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly bald on top of my scalp in front, but I have plenty of hair all over the rest of my head, so the baldness in front is very apparent. JR&#x27;s GHD really masks my bare scalp and makes my remaining hair look fuller. With a good haircut and GHD, I feel confident that my hair looks great. The product lasts a long time between applications (several days), doesn&#x27;t rub or wear off, and each compact lasts a long time. There&#x27;s nothing about this product that I don&#x27;t like, and I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s concerned about the appearance of their thinning hair. Even my hair stylist now recommends JR&#x27;s GHD to her clients with thin/thinning hair because she&#x27;s seen how well it&#x27;s worked for me.</li>
            <li> The product said it was for white or gray hair, but it made my scalp just look dirty (white hair), so if you too have white hair, I would pass on this product.  The product also arrived damaged, but the vendor was very cooperative and offered a refund.</li>
            <li> works just like it was described. stays in, makes me feel more comfortable to let the wind blow, if you will</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the salt and pepper color as my hair is almost white, but it&#x27;s perfect.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  How can you not for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great takes years off.Good job Joan I love the salt and pepper although at times it crumbles in the container</li>
            <li> works just like it&#x27;s supposed to--great product.  Be sure to wear a towel around your neck to catch the &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34; powder</li>
            <li> I have a family history of bald spots for women, mine is large, this is the only product that works, it is very hard to find,&lt;br /&gt;but one of the packages I ordered was empty, I was very disappointed, got my money back, but would have rather had&lt;br /&gt;the product, it was a great price, can&#x27;t find a decent price on the product when I can find it</li>
            <li> This is a great product I buy this for my mother who has very thin hair in the front  and you would never know it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was a bargain for what it does, but I don&#x27;t like the compact lid because it comes loose to easily.  It seems to cover some of the area I have thinning.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  You can apply it to the roots between colorings or to thinning areas.  It blends well, is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product on tv for a while, but was able to get it thru Amazon at a great price.  It is easy to apply and is not messy.  I wish I had gotten it sooner, but am thrilled at the price I paid.  Thank you Amazon for providing great sellers with reasonably priced products. My family thought I had gotten a haircut or done something different with my hair.  I still wear it as usual, but it looks so much better now.  I love it.  Thanks Joan Rivers, this is a product that women truly needed. I would give it 10 stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in several shades for over 2 years now and it&#x27;s the greatest.  It is easy to use and covers thinning areas and makes your hair seem fuller.  Recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> Wife likes product. Why do I need to type several words to satisfy number of words in this box etc.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this item and the service!  The item is unbelievably great for those with thinning hair, so knew I wanted it.  The price was OUTSTANDING, and I was happy about every aspect of the transaction!</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks, but you don&#x27;t have to accept everything.  I am not completely gray and this product helps fill in the gaps that thinning has caused.  It works just like eye shadow, probably is. One thing - don&#x27;t scratch your head where you use it, as you will have this in your fingernails.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get it on my scalp without getting it on my white/grey hair.  I&#x27;d do better with a pal putting it on for me.</li>
            <li> Had been packaged well and shipped quickly.  Problem was, wrong color sent. Returned order for a quick refund so service was good.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it was nearly worth the price.  I think i could have done as well with the right color eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product keeps the &amp;#34;scalp shine&amp;#34; down, but I really don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with because it seems to put too much on at once.  So, I use a large makeup brush and that works better for me.  Pleased with this purchase, especially at the price I paid</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff!!  Easy and works great.</li>
            <li> This product covers my bald spots, due to age, wonderfully.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Liked it, easy to use but there was a little bit of a learning curve, apply to back of head via mirror.  But it did exactly what I wanted but you do need to make sure scalp is dry to best effect.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Like many \\&quot;older\\&quot; ladies, I was shocked to realize my hair was falling out! I have been dying mine since 18 yrs. old. I began Great Hair Day after consulting a beautician about my hair and discovering that even very expensive shampoo DOES NOT WORK. I sent for my first order in brunette and was Amazed! WOW! It actually works great! I am letting my hair grow out to it&#x27;s natual White/gray--a rather ugly process from dark brown, and have still been using the brunette powder and it looks fine.  I am however, ordering the salt &amp; pepper hoping it will look more natural as the gray gets dominent. I have also found that longer hair covers the thinning front better and that the powder gives BODY to my very fine hair. Thank you Joan for giving us back our dignity after menopause tries to steal it. Bless you.</li>
            <li> As a woman with PCOS, my hair has been thinning for some time, and none of the remedies like Rogaine or special shampoos worked for me. I tried formulating my own fill-in powder, which met with mixed results -- decent coverage but no staying power. A couple of years ago, I happened to tune in to QVC and saw this product advertised and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Say what you want about Joan Rivers, but she makes quality products that address real-world concerns. This one is no exception. When applied correctly -- which takes some time, skill, and a better brush than the one that it comes with (I&#x27;d recommend Hakuhodo&#x27;s G353 Eye Brow Brush [..] which is pricey but durable and does a wonderful job) -- the powder covers well and lasts without fall-out or rubbing off on clothes or pillows for several days. Shop around for the best price -- even with a quantity discount at the official site, you&#x27;ll likely do better from an Amazon affiliate or other online store.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. I did not give it a 5 star because it does not stay perfectly in your hair as they claim. I find if I scratch where I applied it I come away with some of the powder on my finger. But other than that no one can tell I use it. My hair stylist says it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> Gave this product as a Christmas gift to a friend of mine that has thinning hair.  She loves this product.  Great gift.</li>
            <li> With thinning hair and areas of the scalp that shine, this product fills in those areas and helps the hair look fuller and more like when I was younger.  It makes me feel more confident and is an amazing product.  Love It!!!</li>
            <li> This works to disguise my pink scalp so it doesn&#x27;t shine through my thin mostly white/some gray hair.  Easy to use.  My friends say it looks natural unless they peer very closely at my roots, and who does that?</li>
            <li> I previously ordered another color and now salt and pepper, but they seem similar colors and my hair doesn&#x27;t look natural. disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple products for thinning hair, but this products works THE BEST.  I have blonde highlights - the &#x27;blonde&#x27; color works the best for me.  This color will also work for those with light brown hair.  Immediately covers any thinning part line - stays on until washed out.  Does not make my scalp itch - does not run.  Highly recommend.  Also - try K2 vitamins - this will help with hair growth.</li>
            <li> It works well to cover the pink of my bald spots.  I bought the salt and pepper and it is just right for my hair. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!  I used it to fill in and color my grey and black eyebrows! Had to use a thinner brush than supplied, but it worked really well. The salt and pepper color was perfect.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY HELPS THE BALD SPOTS I AM GETTING :) WOULD HIGHLY  RECOMMEND ! COVERS EASILY AND STAYS WHERE YOU PUT IT!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and hides the spot if you need to hide a little thinning  area. Not messy at all.</li>
