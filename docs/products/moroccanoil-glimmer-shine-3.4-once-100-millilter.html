            <li>It works wonderfully well for moisturizing and shining the hair without leaving it feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>However, in June of 2009 a wonderful widower, Arthur Dearing II, found me and rescued me from my isolated seclusion.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of information online about the marvelous benefits of applying this oil to the hair.  </li>

            <li>I found it good but a bit greasy.</li>

            <li>It puts a nice shine on my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a nice almond oil that smells nice and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>It does great at helping &#x27;define&#x27; the variations in my hair color, but what I really love is the smooth look and lack of flyaway hair!  </li>
            <li>I read Moroccan oil should have nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>Afterwards my hair smells so nice.</li>
            <li>I used it two times and wasn&#x27;t thrilled either time.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>and it does shine my hair nicely.</li>

            <li>Glimmer shine provides the finish I want for my hair, the pump makes it very easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product, however I love most of Moroccanoil products!</li>
            <li>Argan oil is supposed to be really good for your hair, but I just found this too greasy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff leaves a nice shine on my hair and keeps the frizz away</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, silky and shiny, I am so happy with the results!</li>

            <li>I have many Moroccanioil products and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li>This spray is perfect for making my curls shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It sprays in a very fine mist.</li>
            <li>After you have styled your hair spray on top to give you a nice shiny &amp; healthy look.</li>
            <li>Smells great, lightweight, lasts long, beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>is disbelief the first time I used it lol.</li>
            <li>go through a bottle REALLY QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li>Very light not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>It does offer shine but not like dudley shine, it&#x27;s really very light.  </li>
            <li>hair is silky and products go on smoothly and hair smell phenomenal!</li>
            <li>It makes hair shiny and healthy in appearance.</li>
            <li>Everyone wonders how I get that shine in my hair. :)</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>but it is better than throwing away the bottle.     </li>
            <li>I will not buy this product again unless they change to a slim bottle that&#x27;s easier to hold with a better sprayer.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>must have if you want shiny healthy hair.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll probably be hooked! :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The regular moroccan oil is perfect for after a wash to protect it during a blow out before you straighten.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely product</li>
            <li>ok..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok and this brand is way overprice.</li>
            <li>It is sooo healthy now</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I end up covering the top of my head with a towel and spraying around it.</li>
            <li>If you pour some in your hands it works better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of these products</li>
            <li>On top of that, after you spray it on, it drips on the bottles and you have a pile of oil sitting</li>
            <li>I cannot say for sure how it should smells or works...</li>
            <li>I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have more conditioning in my hair.</li>
            <li>I never even used but for the price the packaging should have been much better</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Using the two products has allowed me to maintain healthy hair that shines while doing so many things that should damage it.  </li>
            <li>Hold the bottle about 8-10 inches from your hair when you spray the product and be sure not to spray too many times.  </li>
            <li>love the scent and how the Shine lasted all day .The  </li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t over do it</li>
            <li>This product does add some shine to the hair and perhaps out in the sun it would sparkle more.</li>
            <li>Love this hair product.</li>
            <li>and I had many compliments on how shiny my hair was.</li>
            <li>Love all the Moroccan hair products.</li>
            <li>I have bought Moroccan oil in salons and this ranks at the top with those.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can notice the difference and my hair has more shine, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If I spray too close to the top of my head, it makes my hair oily.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the condition of my hair and the manageability this product gave to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love being able to spray where I want it.</li>
            <li>This Moroccan oil works like magic on my hair.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cant say enough good things about it!!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it making my hair any more gold or any more shiny.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>but I wish it smelled more like the moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>The aroma is lovely, too.  </li>
            <li>I have used the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Moroccan oil which I LOVE</li>
            <li>I love everything Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>&quot; it&#x27;s more like a serum.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this brand but not this product….I have unruly curly hair so that may be the issue…it may work better on someone else</li>
            <li>That was over 3 years ago, so when I decided to re-vamp my hair regimen I decided to get some more.</li>
            <li>Oily and more Oily.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the smell and how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Bought the oil and decided to buy the hair spray and was pleased with both.  </li>
            <li>It works for me and I am glad to have found it here.</li>
            <li>I really love the morocan oil gold glimmer shine oil.  </li>
            <li>I love the moroccan oil treatment, so of-course</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to love love love this.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>A must have for anyone who goes more than a couple days without washing.</li>
            <li>Just like the styling cream, I love the MoroccanOil scent.</li>
            <li>love this for my hair</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my hair really shiney and smell very nice.</li>
            <li>I use this when I flat iron my hair and it works amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Moroccanoil Hair Treatment, which has better results and brings more shine to the hair than the very Glimmer Shine.</li>
            <li>I also like that it sprays out in a fine mist because you get greater coverage and even distribution rather than patches that are more oily than others.</li>
            <li>Worth the price of GOLD!!</li>
            <li>Very light weight on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be excellent to use it before the blow dry as well or in-between shampoo for those who have over-processed hair or damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>its fantastic product very soft smooth in your hair smells very good this oil</li>
            <li>I love it and the product came quickly!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE the original Moroccanoil</li>
            <li>Since then I have purchased every product available and love them all...</li>
            <li>I am glad to see it still available.</li>
            <li>I have also found that it is just as wonderful as a quick facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spray the ends with glimmer shine and it makes it looks super healthy and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my own fault for not opening it right away and using it.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair make sure you get the LIGHT Gold Glimmer Shine or</li>
            <li>Perfect combination with the other Moroccan Oil products.</li>
            <li>Despite this, it does give my hair a nice, light gloss, so it&#x27;s still a success in my book.</li>
            <li>I began using it as others have noted (sparingly) and my hair is actually getting better conditioned and it does look and smell great.</li>
            <li>and it gives my hair such a beautiful glimmer</li>
            <li>Everything I have heard about this product is true and more.</li>
            <li>still is hands down the BEST investment in my hair</li>
            <li>My best results have come from spraying one shot on my hand, rubbing my hands together, and then smoothing them down my hair.</li>
            <li>but it is because the sprayer is fine and well-controlled.</li>
            <li>just remember, less is best.</li>
            <li>(I have a blunt bob, my hair is fine textured).      </li>
            <li>Makes your hair look and feel like silk and so smooth you can run your fingers through it easily (and a fine toothed comb).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s package fine</li>
            <li>you have fine hair or hair that doesn&#x27;t need to hold a style, this may be for you.  </li>
            <li>It has a really really fine mist</li>
            <li>you spray it because the droplets are so fine.</li>
            <li>that makes it look super healthy.</li>
            <li>Easy and smooth...and FAST transaction!!!  </li>
            <li>This spray really brings out the highlights and reflects the light nicely.</li>
            <li>Product does add some amazing shine, but it also leaves my hair kind of greasy especially at the roots.</li>
            <li>They are causing a huge hassle for me, that I don&#x27;t appreciate.</li>
            <li>What follows is quoted from my hair-care booklet which is available at my website as a free e-book download.  </li>
            <li>This serum is too light weight my hair has never felt so crispy and straw-like.  </li>
            <li>It works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent.  </li>
            <li>To me, it really is a miracle product as I can now get that salon look when I style my own hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair shiny and fabulous once you are done styling it.  </li>
            <li>The cheap perfume smell on my head is too overbearing.</li>
            <li>This item is available in my salon</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seller was great to accept return, especially when in the title there is still Gold Shimmer.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I lather until it is smooth.</li>
            <li>and it works fantastic</li>
            <li>I use my fingers then to smooth the ends.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I already use other Moroccan Oil products and love a good shine spray - this one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love the waft of tropical fragrance, and the resulting shine is subtle and very attractive.  </li>
            <li>Great to use before applying a flat iron to your hair.</li>
            <li>ENJOY YOUR NEW HEALTHY HAIR!  </li>
            <li>YOUR NEW HEALTHY HAIR!  </li>
            <li>I am real happy with this Product after my Hair is  all dry and styled i spray this on not to much</li>
            <li>The three brands that I am familiar with and have used myself are;</li>
            <li>The three brands that I am familiar with and have used myself are;</li>
            <li>I have used other glimmer sprays much more successfully</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to put on too much or your hair will get too greasy!  </li>
            <li>Yes, I do love the scent, I must first say.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need that as I use Moroccanoil Original treatment and it controls the frizz.  </li>
            <li>Definately worth the $!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li>I would recommend the original Moroccanoil over this Shimmer Spray, but if you want something cheaper, go with this.</li>
            <li>This product is great on my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>This works great on dry damaged colored hair.</li>
            <li>Wow do I love this product!</li>
            <li>Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  </li>
            <li>Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice oil for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair look healthy, shiny and vibrant, if used correctly!  </li>
            <li>It adds softness and smoothes all my fly aways, and comes with the bonus of smelling amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: careful not to hold it too close to your head, or you will end up with a grease spot on your head you can not get rid of for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Smells great, I spray it on wet hair because I notice this way it makes my hair softer.</li>
            <li>In it you will also find a recipe for Laurel&#x27;s Soft &amp; Shiny Hair-Rinse which you can make in your own kitchen from ingredients you probably already have on hand.  </li>
            <li>All three of those I can confidently tell you are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a sweet smell to this.</li>
            <li>It does smell good but that is the only redeming quality here.</li>
            <li>This actually works for shine and glimmer and has a gorgeous scent as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many others but this really helps keep my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li>This product works very well and makes your hair more than shine; your hair will &amp;#34;glimmer&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the softness if gives my hair!the shine with out too much oil and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a bad product, I may buy it again just for the smell.  </li>
            <li>The glimmer shine works wonderfully to moisturize my hair, but not so much it weighs it down.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt weigh my hair down, just adds a beautiful shimmer.</li>
            <li>but this oil is wonderful ;and i really mean it</li>
            <li>but I can easily go 2-3 days without washing and my hair looks exactly as it does on day 1.  </li>
            <li>I love this as it is not heavy on baby fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>other than that it does the job and smells great too.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down, it makes my hair smooth and my hair has a wonderful natural looking shine to it</li>
            <li>I love this product I just have a word for Awesome, I have dry chemical process hair, and as soon as I use one single spray, my hair looks healthier and shiny!Thank you!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and  made it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to fool around with my eye and skin creams, I just quickly dab some witch hazel on my face and neck with a cotton ball as an astringent after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>you have to work quickly before it runs out through your fingers.  </li>
            <li>You really are paying for the name, because this stuff is in no way worth more than $10.  </li>
            <li>This is my go to product for my coarse, curly hair - imparts a nice shine &amp; smells fabulous</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, loving my new gold slimmer shine by moroccanoil!  </li>
            <li>I received a lot of compliments from everyone after my very first application.</li>
            <li>This product is great because it gives me shine and takes off the frizz without weighting down my hair.  </li>
            <li>My old school friends who see me once a year only have complimented me on beautiful hair since I started using this brand.</li>
            <li>At this rate this bottle should last me a year or more!</li>
            <li>Love this oil, makes my hair feel soft and silky!</li>
            <li>Used with Moroccanoil Treatment light hair certainly does shine.</li>
            <li>Anyways, its perfect for you if you flat iron your hair and dont want frizzy, dry hair.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>is so fresh and everyone loves it.    </li>
            <li>There is no trace of grease felt on my hair or on my fingers as the product is instantaneously absorbed by my thirsty and processed hair.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I spray it not too close but not too far away.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and flowery; I always receive comments on the effect and smell.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>This is a fun accessory for your hair styling kit.  </li>
            <li>but it gives your hair a healthy, natural sheen as it conditions.</li>
            <li>worth the investment.</li>
            <li>You will only find the real prodcuts for moroccanoil here on amazon,  definitely for the best price.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff after your done styling your hair just spray a few sprits and it leaves a nice shine without looking oily.</li>
            <li>I also liked the spray rather than than &amp;#34;straight from the bottle&amp;#34; It also left my hair softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jamie Walker (FORT WORTH, TX, US)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it definitely smooths my hair and has a nice scent</li>
            <li>This product is literally absorbed into my hair and makes each strand radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eventually, I caved and bought the name brand Moroccan Oil because I knew I liked it and had some extra money to splurge.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a pretty strong scent to this oil, which really bugs me.  </li>
            <li>Such a fresh, clean and yet, exotic scent.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon right away.</li>
            <li>specially the already straight ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because curly hair does not reflect light very well and therefore does not shine like straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Very oily going on, but absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I have LOVED this product and would highly recommend it to anyone, (as long as they don&#x27;t have thin/fine hair)!</li>
            <li>The beautician commended on how much healther my daughters hair has been after the very first 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Heavier products may weigh this hair type down so this could be perfect; however, you get similar results from the much cheaper \\&quot;One and Only\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product is nice, but not high shine as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It does give a nice shimmer on the hair when you first apply it, but it seems to loose the sheen within about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is light and non greasy, as long as you don&#x27;t over apply, and works well with my fine, medium length hair.</li>
            <li>BUT, the scent is super strong, though it does fade in several minutes.  </li>
            <li>Between the flat iron &amp; a few magical spritzes of Morrocanoil Gold Shine, you&#x27;re set!!!   </li>
            <li>Hair shines using this product and is exactly what we wanted for our hair care.</li>
            <li>He married me and moved me to his home in Sugar City, Idaho.  </li>
            <li>It not only leaves a lovely shine and shimmer</li>
            <li>I think the problem was that I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would try the shampoo as well as the conditioner next.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, this is my second bottle .</li>
            <li>I love the regular moroccan oil, but I thought I&#x27;d try this for a change.  </li>
            <li>It does not do anything more than regular Moroccan oil in my hair.</li>
            <li>This really does make your hair shiny in a golden festive way.  </li>
            <li>I have not found a better product for the price and the lasting effects on my hair.</li>
            <li>I just got mine yesterday, tried it first thing this morning.</li>
            <li>The spray is not what you&#x27;d expect exactly.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say there are no gold flecks in this product.  </li>
            <li>The product is clear and goes on light and shiny.  </li>
            <li>So I first tried this product from a friend who happens to be a hairstylist.</li>
            <li>This product is only ok because instead of the spray making your hair shiny, it makes is bushy and non-compliant.  </li>
            <li>I am going to stick with the regular oil as it makes my hair shine better than this spray.</li>
            <li>no problems i had read a few reviewers with that problem but all is good with this.</li>
            <li>This would be perfect for the beach when hair is a little dry from sun/sea.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell good and makes it shiny which is not easy for hair that is curly and going gray.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about the price when I found online, so I tried some other off brand argan oil and none of them had the texture or scent this product has.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair and this product helps my hair stay straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li>It was so great, i am using it everyday, and my hair is manageably soft.</li>
            <li>Usually my dyed hair looks good for the first week</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way ;this is a must try ;i just love this so much ;well after all it is Marrocan oil as i call it ;and anything form Marroco is always good .</li>
            <li>This is not a big aid for everyone, as it is a good product only for certain types of hair,</li>
            <li>which makes that pretty glass bottle very slippery...</li>
            <li>I followed directions and my hair did not get any shine and also dried my hair and made it very static.  </li>
            <li>First the packaging was very inferior.</li>
            <li>Great for dry, damaged or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It adds a nice sheen to your hair without weighing it down, and helps with flyaways.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s purely for an after style spritz.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for normal, coarse and/or thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different Moroccan or Argan oil products but, hands down, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>trust me, I have fine blonde hair!!!</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil came very highly recommended to me by co-workers.  </li>
            <li>But way beyond that is how amazing this is at making my baby fine, thin hair thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li>One downside though is that you have to test drive this stuff, because if you use too much it can leave hair oily looking at the roots.</li>
            <li>it really does produce a shiny halo over your head.</li>
            <li>If I really want to use this product I spray one squirt into my hand and then rub my hands together and then rub my hair with my hands.</li>
            <li>Go about your toilet-tring and when you are ready to tend to your hair it will be supple, shiny, nourished and healthier.</li>
            <li>it is very inferior considering</li>
            <li>But if you have really curly hair like I do and you don&#x27;t wash it every day</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>my treated hair&#x27;s texture turns much softer and my hair becomes shiny immediately.  </li>
            <li>and it really does shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really makes the hair look heathy.  </li>
            <li>so definetly just one pump if you have short hair) and lightly apply to my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I feel I need a lot of this product to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use much, though, it will be too oily and your hair will be flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, since I combine using this with mousse and hairspray daily, I&#x27;m sure my hair smells well enough; I sure get enough compliments on it!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves it very shiny, but not sticky or with a wet-look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really this one that makes the difference.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li>Made a real difference with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but the spray bottle was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it will leave your hair oily.  </li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t spray to much</li>
            <li>If you have highlights it really makes them &amp;#34;POP!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>This product help to really gloss and shine your hair after blowdrying and straightening.  </li>
            <li>Great product but spray was broken</li>
            <li>I have used much cheaper oil sheens that gave my hair glorious shine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this is the real product.</li>
            <li>I heard that some of the morrocan oil products sold aren&#x27;t the real ones.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems like the ones I read, like too much quantity going out from the spray, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe it does, but I don&#x27;t notice much...</li>
            <li>Too much will make your hair&lt;br /&gt;greasy and look greasy.</li>
            <li>This spray is a lifesaver for anyone really.</li>
            <li>An absolute &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever cuz you don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>We really buy it for the smell.  </li>
            <li>is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>This should sell for $10, that would be reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>fact that this company doesn&#x27;t show me the courtesy of clarifying about the product BEFORE they send it and wants me to pay to return a product that they misrepresent, is a clue who they are.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I bought this by accident thinking it was just a spray morrocan oil, so when I got it, I did not expect much.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>I was using chi iron straight 44 or Matrix straight before and those made my hair \\&quot;chrispy\\&quot; and brittle.  </li>
            <li>Too much, and your hair will immediately look like you&#x27;ve dipped it in cooking oil.</li>
            <li>;well i really don;t think it smells at all .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>have straight hair, so this works for me for shine, but my mom, who has dyed hair, did not like this, as it didn&#x27;t do anything for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally do not apply any kind of of oil, sheen or grease because it ways it down and inhibits free movement.</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful with the amount you spray on because it doesn&#x27;t take much before your hair starts looking more oily than shiny/healthy.  </li>
            <li>Originally in this booklet, my final suggested step was to use a soft-hold hairspray before combing out your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that put more shine in my hair..</li>

            <li>For this smell different from the original.</li>
            <li>Amazon actually had this priced pretty cheap, normally it retails near $40.  </li>
            <li>and I usually don&#x27;t like any scents of any kind.  </li>
            <li>Not a terrible product, just not worth it, to me.</li>
            <li>i had oil coming out of the top of the bottle and down the sides ;but appart form that</li>
            <li>While this product has not completely resolved my fine hair issues; I have had more complements in the few weeks that I have been using Moroccanoil than I have had in years.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll go back to the regular moroccan oil which I can work with better.</li>
            <li>, I feel cheated as it was present for my friend and now there is not way I can return it, shipping from Moscow , Russian, will cost me more then the price of product.</li>
            <li>More oily feeling than regular Moroccan oil when used daily.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend these two   products together.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li>this is a product I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The hair absorbed the oil right away and takes away the dryness due to hair coloring.</li>
            <li>Even with the hot iron I had fly aways that made me crazy.  </li>
            <li>this Moroccan oil really wonders on the hair keeping it soft and moist</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and have so much body.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair really shinny and young looking.  </li>
            <li>its penetrting in yor hair and provide soft and smooth for long time in your hair</li>
            <li>I definitely saw that it made my hair shinier, but it didn&#x27;t seem to last like the oil does, or make my hair nearly as soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>With just a few spritzes your hair will look shiny and healthy all day.</li>
            <li>In between the mandatory 4 months in between I use this product and it works like magic to straighten out my curls and without leaving any heavy residue or flaking like hair gel when I use my straightening iron on it.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t your normal &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>she uses it freely and frequently and often receives compliments on her long, almost-black hair.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions and leave the product on for a few minutes before combing or brushing it into your hair.</li>
            <li>Very very strong smell as indicated in countless other reviews-</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the product, a fine mist, so I hope that it will last a long time too.</li>
            <li>Depending on the humidity where you live, you may not need to do these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this new product</li>

            <li>One or two sprays are OK for daily use on me without too much weigh down.</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair right out of the shower for deep moisturizer instead of those purchased &amp;#34;oil treatments.&amp;#34; With MO simply get out of the shower, spritz this all outside and within your wet, warm hair and swish it up in your turba-towel.</li>
            <li>It is however, NOT oily or greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my rather fine hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li>and i found it there ;bought it ;it makes your hair very soft and shinny and the smell</li>
            <li>Not sure why I ordered this, maybe because I love the brand.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>The texture of the serum is really important: if it&#x27;s too wet your hair will fry, if it&#x27;s too dense your hair will take on a heavy consistancy will feel greasy and not move, if it&#x27;s too light weight your hair will look frizzy and damaged.  </li>
            <li>I like the ordinary Moroccanoil better.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soooooo soft!</li>
            <li>is my second bottle already and I am using the first one for about 3 or 4 months already.</li>
            <li>I love this product; I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>I used this product in the past (I got it in my Beauty Test Tube) and fell in love with it...</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and the light oil doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product smells amazing and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>the Gold Glimmer, is a nice addition to the conditioner/moisturizer, a little goes a long way on all these products.   </li>
            <li>would only recommend this for hair that is already quite healthy and shiny, as it&#x27;s far from a miracle worker and can make other types of hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>After reading the previous reviews,  I was expecting a smooth product.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly kinky hair and only the Japanese Hair Straightening system will work - which costs an $$$ per hour.</li>
            <li>Only use a very light mist or it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li>I prefer this lighter spray to the thicker version before I style my hair or when I travel and need a little help to keep my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This product not only smells divine, but really smooths your hair into a natural shiny texture.  </li>
            <li>Myh only caution to people is not to use too much of it.  </li>
            <li>There, I found the climate to be much dryer than it was at my former home in Murray, Kentucky where I had lived for twenty-six years.  </li>
            <li>It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li>It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li>Hair is so soft and manageable after straightening.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spray it directly on my head</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s losing its color and natural sheen.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Initially, I didn&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li>but after I started using it EVERY morning I&#x27;ve noticed a complete change in my hair.</li>
            <li>I also receive compliments on my hair, and I am 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair, and it even helps with detangling while brushing.</li>
            <li>You spray it on your hair and can instantly see how much shinier and healthier your hair looks with this on.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair and use this product as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; before adding any styling products after cleansing...</li>
            <li>And mine came from Amazon, and as far as I can tell it is</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so shiny and soft, without being oily.</li>
            <li>It does not allow my hair to be running wild, it has polish it to shine.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and always fight with the curls, frizz, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it every day on my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>, I do three sprays, one on the left side, one on the right side and one on the back</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m product comparing this with One and Only to see if there is any big difference between the two.  </li>
            <li>have fine hair but a lot of it and this stuff keeps my hair from being so dry when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>Having thick waist-length hair myself, I am very excited about discovering Moroccan argan oil.  </li>
            <li>The bottle lasts long enough to make it well worth the price.</li>
            <li>then I would highly recommend regular argan oil for a straightening serum</li>
            <li>Although I only spray 1-2 mists from very high above, it&#x27;s still very greasy and really weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very oily scalp and hair and was worried this would make my hair look more oily or weigh it down and feel like it had gunk in it as that is what would happen when I tried shine serums in the past but not with this product.</li>
            <li>Then, I quickly apply a little of the argan oil to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t do much for my locks but dry them out.</li>
            <li>If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li>If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s my second time purchasing) and nothing matches this particular one due to the fine atomizing mist that it outputs as well as the sheen it gives without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li>wear my hair short - an inverted bob style and it&#x27;s very thick, so this really helps smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>The product is light - this could be a negative if you need a heavier product.  </li>
            <li>I have really kinky curls and usually after you blow out your hair when you plan on wearing it straight</li>
            <li>If you would like to obtain the complete booklet, just click on my name above this review, and you will be taken to my profile page here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the Redken Color Extend product I was using prior, so I am definitely going back to that..</li>
            <li>I suddenly have shine  and  soft to touch hair.</li>
            <li>Also, be careful, Linoleum or tile, bathroom floors, get very slippery from this stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair no longer looks dry and stressed and that is saying something for an older woman.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful in overuse, because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>The only other thing I noticed is that the smell is not as strong with this product as it is with my other Morrocanoil products.</li>
            <li>The whole line of Morroconoil products saved my daughters hair, which has been relaxed for several years, was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>This really makes my hair shiny and other people comment on how it just shines.  </li>
            <li>, then I flat iron my hair, it makes my hair so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this because I really like all other Moroccan Oil products I have used.</li>
            <li>but I figured as much from reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li>So I must say I was disappointed to find that this beautiful smelling spray does not actually &amp;#34;glimmer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The main ingredients are silicones, so it&#x27;s not really an \\&quot;oil\\</li>
            <li>I guess I just don&#x27;t think it makes that much of a difference (other than possibly making my hair look oily)</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and difficult to control.</li>
            <li>This product gives a bit of extra smoothing and shimmer to coarse hair, but you have to be very careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>is heavenly, makes my hair feel silky soft and alleviates the dry look of my untreated hair</li>
            <li>There is a similar product on the market, \\&quot;One and Only Argan Oil spray\\&quot; which is almost exactly the same for half the price and comes in a larger bottle.  </li>

            <li> Smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I found it good but a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> The spray is fairly concentrated, it won&#x27;t go all over your bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is really good.</li>
            <li> I powder her with a cornstarch-based powder,rub it in good ,brush her out and spray.</li>
            <li> She smells good and it conditions her coat.</li>
            <li> This product is a good one to restore the shine.</li>
            <li> Hair catches the light, looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I use to use ths in Europe and i loved it ;i tryed to find it here</li>
            <li> I love the spray, it smells wonderful and sprays on very lightly.</li>
            <li> An absolutely sensational product.</li>
            <li> If you want to curl your hair and put more product or hairspray in it for a more structured look, this is not the best product to use.  </li>
            <li> It DOES add a lovely shine to your hair &amp; smells wonderful &amp; exotic (wish it came as a perfume).</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes, and is wonderfully moisturizing without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do and gives your hair a great healthy looking shine.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased using it.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> All three of those I can confidently tell you are very effective.         </li>

            <li> the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> the feel is amazing.</li>

            <li> Love this product, makes my hair nice and curly, it does not make my hair oily, and it smell good.</li>
            <li> It puts a nice shine on my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a nice almond oil that smells nice and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> It does great at helping &#x27;define&#x27; the variations in my hair color, but what I really love is the smooth look and lack of flyaway hair!  </li>
            <li> I read Moroccan oil should have nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> Afterwards my hair smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I used it two times and wasn&#x27;t thrilled either time.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> and it does shine my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice glimmer shine spray</li>
            <li> Your hair will have ZERO frizz, no matter how humid it is out, a beautiful  golden glow &amp; shine &amp;</li>
            <li> Glimmer shine provides the finish I want for my hair, the pump makes it very easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product, however I love most of Moroccanoil products!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is supposed to be really good for your hair, but I just found this too greasy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff leaves a nice shine on my hair and keeps the frizz away</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, silky and shiny, I am so happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Why not have a nice spicy orange smell for this exotic Moroccan oil?</li>
            <li> I have many Moroccanioil products and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect for making my curls shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It sprays in a very fine mist.</li>
            <li> After you have styled your hair spray on top to give you a nice shiny &amp; healthy look.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lightweight, lasts long, beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> is disbelief the first time I used it lol.</li>
            <li> go through a bottle REALLY QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li> Very light not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> It does offer shine but not like dudley shine, it&#x27;s really very light.  </li>
            <li> hair is silky and products go on smoothly and hair smell phenomenal!</li>
            <li> It makes hair shiny and healthy in appearance.</li>
            <li> Everyone wonders how I get that shine in my hair. :)</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> but it is better than throwing away the bottle.     </li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again unless they change to a slim bottle that&#x27;s easier to hold with a better sprayer.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> must have if you want shiny healthy hair.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll probably be hooked! :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The regular moroccan oil is perfect for after a wash to protect it during a blow out before you straighten.  </li>
            <li> This is a lovely product</li>
            <li> ok..  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and this brand is way overprice.</li>
            <li> It is sooo healthy now</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I end up covering the top of my head with a towel and spraying around it.</li>
            <li> If you pour some in your hands it works better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of these products</li>
            <li> On top of that, after you spray it on, it drips on the bottles and you have a pile of oil sitting</li>
            <li> I cannot say for sure how it should smells or works...</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have more conditioning in my hair.</li>
            <li> I never even used but for the price the packaging should have been much better</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Using the two products has allowed me to maintain healthy hair that shines while doing so many things that should damage it.  </li>
            <li> Hold the bottle about 8-10 inches from your hair when you spray the product and be sure not to spray too many times.  </li>
            <li> love the scent and how the Shine lasted all day .The  </li>
            <li> I simply love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t over do it</li>
            <li> This product does add some shine to the hair and perhaps out in the sun it would sparkle more.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product.</li>
            <li> and I had many compliments on how shiny my hair was.</li>
            <li> Love all the Moroccan hair products.</li>
            <li> I have bought Moroccan oil in salons and this ranks at the top with those.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can notice the difference and my hair has more shine, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If I spray too close to the top of my head, it makes my hair oily.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the condition of my hair and the manageability this product gave to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love being able to spray where I want it.</li>
            <li> This Moroccan oil works like magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cant say enough good things about it!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it making my hair any more gold or any more shiny.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> but I wish it smelled more like the moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> The aroma is lovely, too.  </li>
            <li> I have used the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Moroccan oil which I LOVE</li>
            <li> I love everything Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> &quot; it&#x27;s more like a serum.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love this brand but not this product….I have unruly curly hair so that may be the issue…it may work better on someone else</li>
            <li> That was over 3 years ago, so when I decided to re-vamp my hair regimen I decided to get some more.</li>
            <li> Oily and more Oily.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the smell and how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Bought the oil and decided to buy the hair spray and was pleased with both.  </li>
            <li> It works for me and I am glad to have found it here.</li>
            <li> I really love the morocan oil gold glimmer shine oil.  </li>
            <li> I love the moroccan oil treatment, so of-course</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to love love love this.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who goes more than a couple days without washing.</li>
            <li> Just like the styling cream, I love the MoroccanOil scent.</li>
            <li> love this for my hair</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair really shiney and smell very nice.</li>
            <li> I use this when I flat iron my hair and it works amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Moroccanoil Hair Treatment, which has better results and brings more shine to the hair than the very Glimmer Shine.</li>
            <li> I also like that it sprays out in a fine mist because you get greater coverage and even distribution rather than patches that are more oily than others.</li>
            <li> Worth the price of GOLD!!</li>
            <li> Very light weight on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be excellent to use it before the blow dry as well or in-between shampoo for those who have over-processed hair or damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> its fantastic product very soft smooth in your hair smells very good this oil</li>
            <li> I love it and the product came quickly!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE the original Moroccanoil</li>
            <li> Since then I have purchased every product available and love them all...</li>
            <li> I am glad to see it still available.</li>
            <li> I have also found that it is just as wonderful as a quick facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spray the ends with glimmer shine and it makes it looks super healthy and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my own fault for not opening it right away and using it.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair make sure you get the LIGHT Gold Glimmer Shine or</li>
            <li> Perfect combination with the other Moroccan Oil products.</li>
            <li> Despite this, it does give my hair a nice, light gloss, so it&#x27;s still a success in my book.</li>
            <li> I began using it as others have noted (sparingly) and my hair is actually getting better conditioned and it does look and smell great.</li>
            <li> and it gives my hair such a beautiful glimmer</li>
            <li> Everything I have heard about this product is true and more.</li>
            <li> still is hands down the BEST investment in my hair</li>
            <li> My best results have come from spraying one shot on my hand, rubbing my hands together, and then smoothing them down my hair.</li>
            <li> but it is because the sprayer is fine and well-controlled.</li>
            <li> just remember, less is best.</li>
            <li> (I have a blunt bob, my hair is fine textured).      </li>
            <li> Makes your hair look and feel like silk and so smooth you can run your fingers through it easily (and a fine toothed comb).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s package fine</li>
            <li> you have fine hair or hair that doesn&#x27;t need to hold a style, this may be for you.  </li>
            <li> It has a really really fine mist</li>
            <li> you spray it because the droplets are so fine.</li>
            <li> that makes it look super healthy.</li>
            <li> Easy and smooth...and FAST transaction!!!  </li>
            <li> This spray really brings out the highlights and reflects the light nicely.</li>
            <li> Product does add some amazing shine, but it also leaves my hair kind of greasy especially at the roots.</li>
            <li> They are causing a huge hassle for me, that I don&#x27;t appreciate.</li>
            <li> What follows is quoted from my hair-care booklet which is available at my website as a free e-book download.  </li>
            <li> This serum is too light weight my hair has never felt so crispy and straw-like.  </li>
            <li> It works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light scent.  </li>
            <li> To me, it really is a miracle product as I can now get that salon look when I style my own hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair shiny and fabulous once you are done styling it.  </li>
            <li> The cheap perfume smell on my head is too overbearing.</li>
            <li> This item is available in my salon</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller was great to accept return, especially when in the title there is still Gold Shimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I lather until it is smooth.</li>
            <li> and it works fantastic</li>
            <li> I use my fingers then to smooth the ends.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I already use other Moroccan Oil products and love a good shine spray - this one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love the waft of tropical fragrance, and the resulting shine is subtle and very attractive.  </li>
            <li> Great to use before applying a flat iron to your hair.</li>
            <li> ENJOY YOUR NEW HEALTHY HAIR!  </li>
            <li> YOUR NEW HEALTHY HAIR!  </li>
            <li> I am real happy with this Product after my Hair is  all dry and styled i spray this on not to much</li>
            <li> The three brands that I am familiar with and have used myself are;</li>
            <li> The three brands that I am familiar with and have used myself are;</li>
            <li> I have used other glimmer sprays much more successfully</li>
            <li> Just make sure not to put on too much or your hair will get too greasy!  </li>
            <li> Yes, I do love the scent, I must first say.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need that as I use Moroccanoil Original treatment and it controls the frizz.  </li>
            <li> Definately worth the $!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li> I would recommend the original Moroccanoil over this Shimmer Spray, but if you want something cheaper, go with this.</li>
            <li> This product is great on my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> This works great on dry damaged colored hair.</li>
            <li> Wow do I love this product!</li>
            <li> Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  </li>

            <li> This is a very nice oil for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair look healthy, shiny and vibrant, if used correctly!  </li>
            <li> It adds softness and smoothes all my fly aways, and comes with the bonus of smelling amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: careful not to hold it too close to your head, or you will end up with a grease spot on your head you can not get rid of for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I spray it on wet hair because I notice this way it makes my hair softer.</li>
            <li> In it you will also find a recipe for Laurel&#x27;s Soft &amp; Shiny Hair-Rinse which you can make in your own kitchen from ingredients you probably already have on hand.  </li>
            <li> All three of those I can confidently tell you are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a sweet smell to this.</li>
            <li> It does smell good but that is the only redeming quality here.</li>
            <li> This actually works for shine and glimmer and has a gorgeous scent as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many others but this really helps keep my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and makes your hair more than shine; your hair will &amp;#34;glimmer&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the softness if gives my hair!the shine with out too much oil and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a bad product, I may buy it again just for the smell.  </li>
            <li> The glimmer shine works wonderfully to moisturize my hair, but not so much it weighs it down.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt weigh my hair down, just adds a beautiful shimmer.</li>
            <li> but this oil is wonderful ;and i really mean it</li>
            <li> but I can easily go 2-3 days without washing and my hair looks exactly as it does on day 1.  </li>
            <li> I love this as it is not heavy on baby fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> other than that it does the job and smells great too.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down, it makes my hair smooth and my hair has a wonderful natural looking shine to it</li>
            <li> I love this product I just have a word for Awesome, I have dry chemical process hair, and as soon as I use one single spray, my hair looks healthier and shiny!Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and  made it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to fool around with my eye and skin creams, I just quickly dab some witch hazel on my face and neck with a cotton ball as an astringent after cleansing my face.  </li>

            <li> This product is great because it gives me shine and takes off the frizz without weighting down my hair.  </li>
            <li> My old school friends who see me once a year only have complimented me on beautiful hair since I started using this brand.</li>
            <li> At this rate this bottle should last me a year or more!</li>

            <li> is so fresh and everyone loves it.    </li>
            <li> There is no trace of grease felt on my hair or on my fingers as the product is instantaneously absorbed by my thirsty and processed hair.  </li>
            <li> I make sure I spray it not too close but not too far away.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and flowery; I always receive comments on the effect and smell.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a fun accessory for your hair styling kit.  </li>
            <li> but it gives your hair a healthy, natural sheen as it conditions.</li>

            <li> You will only find the real prodcuts for moroccanoil here on amazon,  definitely for the best price.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff after your done styling your hair just spray a few sprits and it leaves a nice shine without looking oily.</li>
            <li> I also liked the spray rather than than &amp;#34;straight from the bottle&amp;#34; It also left my hair softer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jamie Walker (FORT WORTH, TX, US)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it definitely smooths my hair and has a nice scent</li>
            <li> This product is literally absorbed into my hair and makes each strand radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eventually, I caved and bought the name brand Moroccan Oil because I knew I liked it and had some extra money to splurge.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pretty strong scent to this oil, which really bugs me.  </li>
            <li> Such a fresh, clean and yet, exotic scent.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon right away.</li>
            <li> specially the already straight ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because curly hair does not reflect light very well and therefore does not shine like straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Very oily going on, but absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I have LOVED this product and would highly recommend it to anyone, (as long as they don&#x27;t have thin/fine hair)!</li>
            <li> The beautician commended on how much healther my daughters hair has been after the very first 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Heavier products may weigh this hair type down so this could be perfect; however, you get similar results from the much cheaper \\&quot;One and Only\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product is nice, but not high shine as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It does give a nice shimmer on the hair when you first apply it, but it seems to loose the sheen within about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is light and non greasy, as long as you don&#x27;t over apply, and works well with my fine, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> BUT, the scent is super strong, though it does fade in several minutes.  </li>
            <li> Between the flat iron &amp; a few magical spritzes of Morrocanoil Gold Shine, you&#x27;re set!!!   </li>
            <li> Hair shines using this product and is exactly what we wanted for our hair care.</li>
            <li> He married me and moved me to his home in Sugar City, Idaho.  </li>
            <li> It not only leaves a lovely shine and shimmer</li>
            <li> I think the problem was that I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would try the shampoo as well as the conditioner next.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, this is my second bottle .</li>
            <li> I love the regular moroccan oil, but I thought I&#x27;d try this for a change.  </li>
            <li> It does not do anything more than regular Moroccan oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> This really does make your hair shiny in a golden festive way.  </li>
            <li> I have not found a better product for the price and the lasting effects on my hair.</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday, tried it first thing this morning.</li>
            <li> The spray is not what you&#x27;d expect exactly.  </li>
            <li> First I want to say there are no gold flecks in this product.  </li>
            <li> The product is clear and goes on light and shiny.  </li>
            <li> So I first tried this product from a friend who happens to be a hairstylist.</li>
            <li> This product is only ok because instead of the spray making your hair shiny, it makes is bushy and non-compliant.  </li>
            <li> I am going to stick with the regular oil as it makes my hair shine better than this spray.</li>
            <li> no problems i had read a few reviewers with that problem but all is good with this.</li>
            <li> This would be perfect for the beach when hair is a little dry from sun/sea.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell good and makes it shiny which is not easy for hair that is curly and going gray.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about the price when I found online, so I tried some other off brand argan oil and none of them had the texture or scent this product has.</li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair and this product helps my hair stay straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li> It was so great, i am using it everyday, and my hair is manageably soft.</li>
            <li> Usually my dyed hair looks good for the first week</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way ;this is a must try ;i just love this so much ;well after all it is Marrocan oil as i call it ;and anything form Marroco is always good .</li>
            <li> This is not a big aid for everyone, as it is a good product only for certain types of hair,</li>
            <li> which makes that pretty glass bottle very slippery...</li>
            <li> I followed directions and my hair did not get any shine and also dried my hair and made it very static.  </li>
            <li> First the packaging was very inferior.</li>
            <li> Great for dry, damaged or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It adds a nice sheen to your hair without weighing it down, and helps with flyaways.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s purely for an after style spritz.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for normal, coarse and/or thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different Moroccan or Argan oil products but, hands down, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> trust me, I have fine blonde hair!!!</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil came very highly recommended to me by co-workers.  </li>
            <li> But way beyond that is how amazing this is at making my baby fine, thin hair thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li> One downside though is that you have to test drive this stuff, because if you use too much it can leave hair oily looking at the roots.</li>
            <li> it really does produce a shiny halo over your head.</li>
            <li> If I really want to use this product I spray one squirt into my hand and then rub my hands together and then rub my hair with my hands.</li>
            <li> Go about your toilet-tring and when you are ready to tend to your hair it will be supple, shiny, nourished and healthier.</li>
            <li> it is very inferior considering</li>
            <li> But if you have really curly hair like I do and you don&#x27;t wash it every day</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> my treated hair&#x27;s texture turns much softer and my hair becomes shiny immediately.  </li>
            <li> and it really does shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really makes the hair look heathy.  </li>
            <li> so definetly just one pump if you have short hair) and lightly apply to my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I feel I need a lot of this product to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use much, though, it will be too oily and your hair will be flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, since I combine using this with mousse and hairspray daily, I&#x27;m sure my hair smells well enough; I sure get enough compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves it very shiny, but not sticky or with a wet-look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really this one that makes the difference.  </li>
            <li> I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li> Made a real difference with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product, but the spray bottle was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, it will leave your hair oily.  </li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t spray to much</li>
            <li> If you have highlights it really makes them &amp;#34;POP!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This product help to really gloss and shine your hair after blowdrying and straightening.  </li>
            <li> Great product but spray was broken</li>
            <li> I have used much cheaper oil sheens that gave my hair glorious shine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is the real product.</li>
            <li> I heard that some of the morrocan oil products sold aren&#x27;t the real ones.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems like the ones I read, like too much quantity going out from the spray, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it does, but I don&#x27;t notice much...</li>
            <li> Too much will make your hair&lt;br /&gt;greasy and look greasy.</li>
            <li> This spray is a lifesaver for anyone really.</li>
            <li> An absolute &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever cuz you don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> We really buy it for the smell.  </li>
            <li> is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> This should sell for $10, that would be reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> fact that this company doesn&#x27;t show me the courtesy of clarifying about the product BEFORE they send it and wants me to pay to return a product that they misrepresent, is a clue who they are.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident thinking it was just a spray morrocan oil, so when I got it, I did not expect much.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very greasy.</li>
            <li> I was using chi iron straight 44 or Matrix straight before and those made my hair \\&quot;chrispy\\&quot; and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Too much, and your hair will immediately look like you&#x27;ve dipped it in cooking oil.</li>
            <li> ;well i really don;t think it smells at all .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> have straight hair, so this works for me for shine, but my mom, who has dyed hair, did not like this, as it didn&#x27;t do anything for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally do not apply any kind of of oil, sheen or grease because it ways it down and inhibits free movement.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with the amount you spray on because it doesn&#x27;t take much before your hair starts looking more oily than shiny/healthy.  </li>
            <li> Originally in this booklet, my final suggested step was to use a soft-hold hairspray before combing out your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that put more shine in my hair..</li>

            <li> For this smell different from the original.</li>
            <li> Amazon actually had this priced pretty cheap, normally it retails near $40.  </li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t like any scents of any kind.  </li>
            <li> Not a terrible product, just not worth it, to me.</li>
            <li> i had oil coming out of the top of the bottle and down the sides ;but appart form that</li>
            <li> While this product has not completely resolved my fine hair issues; I have had more complements in the few weeks that I have been using Moroccanoil than I have had in years.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to the regular moroccan oil which I can work with better.</li>
            <li> , I feel cheated as it was present for my friend and now there is not way I can return it, shipping from Moscow , Russian, will cost me more then the price of product.</li>
            <li> More oily feeling than regular Moroccan oil when used daily.  </li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend these two   products together.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li> this is a product I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The hair absorbed the oil right away and takes away the dryness due to hair coloring.</li>
            <li> Even with the hot iron I had fly aways that made me crazy.  </li>
            <li> this Moroccan oil really wonders on the hair keeping it soft and moist</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and have so much body.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really shinny and young looking.  </li>
            <li> its penetrting in yor hair and provide soft and smooth for long time in your hair</li>
            <li> I definitely saw that it made my hair shinier, but it didn&#x27;t seem to last like the oil does, or make my hair nearly as soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> With just a few spritzes your hair will look shiny and healthy all day.</li>
            <li> In between the mandatory 4 months in between I use this product and it works like magic to straighten out my curls and without leaving any heavy residue or flaking like hair gel when I use my straightening iron on it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your normal &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> she uses it freely and frequently and often receives compliments on her long, almost-black hair.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions and leave the product on for a few minutes before combing or brushing it into your hair.</li>
            <li> Very very strong smell as indicated in countless other reviews-</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of the product, a fine mist, so I hope that it will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Depending on the humidity where you live, you may not need to do these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this new product</li>

            <li> One or two sprays are OK for daily use on me without too much weigh down.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair right out of the shower for deep moisturizer instead of those purchased &amp;#34;oil treatments.&amp;#34; With MO simply get out of the shower, spritz this all outside and within your wet, warm hair and swish it up in your turba-towel.</li>
            <li> It is however, NOT oily or greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my rather fine hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li> and i found it there ;bought it ;it makes your hair very soft and shinny and the smell</li>
            <li> Not sure why I ordered this, maybe because I love the brand.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> The texture of the serum is really important: if it&#x27;s too wet your hair will fry, if it&#x27;s too dense your hair will take on a heavy consistancy will feel greasy and not move, if it&#x27;s too light weight your hair will look frizzy and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I like the ordinary Moroccanoil better.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soooooo soft!</li>
            <li> is my second bottle already and I am using the first one for about 3 or 4 months already.</li>
            <li> I love this product; I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past (I got it in my Beauty Test Tube) and fell in love with it...</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and the light oil doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li> This product smells amazing and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> the Gold Glimmer, is a nice addition to the conditioner/moisturizer, a little goes a long way on all these products.   </li>
            <li> would only recommend this for hair that is already quite healthy and shiny, as it&#x27;s far from a miracle worker and can make other types of hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews,  I was expecting a smooth product.  </li>
            <li> I have super curly kinky hair and only the Japanese Hair Straightening system will work - which costs an $$$ per hour.</li>
            <li> Only use a very light mist or it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li> I prefer this lighter spray to the thicker version before I style my hair or when I travel and need a little help to keep my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product not only smells divine, but really smooths your hair into a natural shiny texture.  </li>
            <li> Myh only caution to people is not to use too much of it.  </li>
            <li> There, I found the climate to be much dryer than it was at my former home in Murray, Kentucky where I had lived for twenty-six years.  </li>
            <li> It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li> It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li> Hair is so soft and manageable after straightening.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spray it directly on my head</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s losing its color and natural sheen.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Initially, I didn&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li> but after I started using it EVERY morning I&#x27;ve noticed a complete change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I also receive compliments on my hair, and I am 60 years old.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair, and it even helps with detangling while brushing.</li>
            <li> You spray it on your hair and can instantly see how much shinier and healthier your hair looks with this on.</li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair and use this product as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; before adding any styling products after cleansing...</li>
            <li> And mine came from Amazon, and as far as I can tell it is</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so shiny and soft, without being oily.</li>
            <li> It does not allow my hair to be running wild, it has polish it to shine.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and always fight with the curls, frizz, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day on my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> , I do three sprays, one on the left side, one on the right side and one on the back</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m product comparing this with One and Only to see if there is any big difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> have fine hair but a lot of it and this stuff keeps my hair from being so dry when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Having thick waist-length hair myself, I am very excited about discovering Moroccan argan oil.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts long enough to make it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> then I would highly recommend regular argan oil for a straightening serum</li>
            <li> Although I only spray 1-2 mists from very high above, it&#x27;s still very greasy and really weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very oily scalp and hair and was worried this would make my hair look more oily or weigh it down and feel like it had gunk in it as that is what would happen when I tried shine serums in the past but not with this product.</li>
            <li> Then, I quickly apply a little of the argan oil to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t do much for my locks but dry them out.</li>
            <li> If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li> If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s my second time purchasing) and nothing matches this particular one due to the fine atomizing mist that it outputs as well as the sheen it gives without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li> wear my hair short - an inverted bob style and it&#x27;s very thick, so this really helps smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> The product is light - this could be a negative if you need a heavier product.  </li>
            <li> I have really kinky curls and usually after you blow out your hair when you plan on wearing it straight</li>
            <li> If you would like to obtain the complete booklet, just click on my name above this review, and you will be taken to my profile page here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the Redken Color Extend product I was using prior, so I am definitely going back to that..</li>
            <li> I suddenly have shine  and  soft to touch hair.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful, Linoleum or tile, bathroom floors, get very slippery from this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair no longer looks dry and stressed and that is saying something for an older woman.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful in overuse, because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I noticed is that the smell is not as strong with this product as it is with my other Morrocanoil products.</li>
            <li> The whole line of Morroconoil products saved my daughters hair, which has been relaxed for several years, was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> This really makes my hair shiny and other people comment on how it just shines.  </li>
            <li> , then I flat iron my hair, it makes my hair so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I really like all other Moroccan Oil products I have used.</li>
            <li> but I figured as much from reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> So I must say I was disappointed to find that this beautiful smelling spray does not actually &amp;#34;glimmer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The main ingredients are silicones, so it&#x27;s not really an \\&quot;oil\\</li>
            <li> I guess I just don&#x27;t think it makes that much of a difference (other than possibly making my hair look oily)</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and difficult to control.</li>
            <li> This product gives a bit of extra smoothing and shimmer to coarse hair, but you have to be very careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> is heavenly, makes my hair feel silky soft and alleviates the dry look of my untreated hair</li>
            <li> There is a similar product on the market, \\&quot;One and Only Argan Oil spray\\&quot; which is almost exactly the same for half the price and comes in a larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is because it moisturizes and weighs down your hair to the point that it can&#x27;t hold much curl for long.  </li>
            <li> It was the ONLY product that worked with my flat iron and tamed my crazed, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I found another product and it is far better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> We have super thick very long hair so to see how long this product lasts - def.</li>
            <li> I have a little natural color left in my medium-long hair, lots of &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; and some low lights.  </li>
            <li> Sprays out very concentrated in a small spot so it makes my hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I spray each section before I run the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I can tell the product will last a long time also.</li>
            <li> They truly have helped my hair, as long as I use them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I use this as I am flat iron my hair to protect the hair.</li>
            <li> and I will try to go for as long as possible without washing it.</li>
            <li> When you try and spray it from the bottle, it not only sprays but also dribbles down the sprayer and the bottle, which becomes pretty messy.  </li>
            <li> The spray on oil is not heavy nor does it weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is actually difficult to hold the fat slick glass bottle far enough away from my head and still be able to work the sprayer.</li>
            <li> I have dry, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I use this product after I blew dry my hair to restore the moisture back to my blown hair.  </li>
            <li> Recently, my hair started to feel a bit dry</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and my hair sometimes needs a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> You cannot spray this product on your hair directly from the bottle because the sprayer is not fine enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy now (as opposed to those annoying ringlet curls that only belong to 5-year old little girls) and looks amazing after only blow-drying on low.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft with a little shine.</li>
            <li> This spray does not leave enough binders behind to protect your hair if you use a flat iron or a hot comb.</li>
            <li> Makes hair so shiny and soft --- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this flat iron &#x3D;&#x27;s  hAIR BLISS!!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is long with gold highlights.</li>
            <li> I give it about 6-7 sprays since my hair is long and then comb through.</li>
            <li> have long hair</li>
            <li> I waited too long to get around to returning it</li>
            <li> The item arrived on earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also a bit difficult to apply: it asks for a certain distance from the hair, so when trying to apply on the back of the head, that makes it hard to aim the spray on the right</li>
            <li> It only takes just a little bit so the product will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crucial to only use a little.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular moroccan oil and the hydrating moroccan oil cream but found this on Amazon, read the other reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> I can only attribute it to this and the other products I am using.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars due to amazons service</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find this exact spray bottle these days.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I have long, dry, wavy hair, and when I want to look like Demi Moore, this is what I use!  </li>
            <li> I spray this product on my hair when it is dry before straightening.  </li>
            <li> and I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have organix brand argan oil dry mist</li>
            <li> I do not recommend unless your hair is so dry that is falling out of your scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is getting very long (down my back), and I need a haircut.</li>
            <li> kind&#x27;a disappointed that the price has gone up.</li>
            <li> When I received it, the lid was loose and I had lost some of the product into the wrapping.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different and weird compared to the original Moroccanoil</li>
            <li> The previous one I had (different brand) didn&#x27;t have a scent at all.  </li>
            <li> Can apply on wet or dry hair, works either way.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit on wet hair and comb thru, then style as usual.</li>
            <li> When your hair is needing a little boost, moroccan oil will seemingly bring it back to life.</li>
            <li> You have to use a teeny tiny bit or your hair will be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells like the old time pomade used for very frizzy hair back in the 60s.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.</li>
            <li> Here is the partial quote from my booklet specifically regarding the use of argan oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my hair is wet</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on a few times but it just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything different for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought all the products she uses, but even using those, I end up with flyaway hairs, no real definition of my highlights and lowlights.  </li>
            <li> You can also spray some in the palms of your hands, rub them together and apply to wet hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to slip and fall.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how noticeable the difference was or how instantly shinier my hair was after just a few sprays.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my hair when its wet and I use an additional pump just for the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle was opened and empty when I received it.  </li>
            <li> I have long dark hair, and this makes it shine like silk.  </li>
            <li> apply this product to wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> While it does make hair look shinier than before, I expected it to have small sparkle flecks, hence the same &amp;#34;Gold Glimmer Shine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One thing to remember, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> only then it turns dry, dull and brassy until it is time to color it again.  </li>
            <li> I bought a few bottles online, but they were not the same as the ones I had been buying previously from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> , I recommend the other two Moroccan Oil products I mentioned too.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other oil products, there is no worry that argan oil will leave grease stains either on your collar or on your pillow.  </li>
            <li> As it is pretty expensive, I would probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> At this price, I am not willing to gamble that it would arrive intact.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;The squirt pump it comes in, on the other hand,</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy from them again due to their attitude even if they are the lowest price around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &#x27;glimmer&#x27; hair products but this one delivers.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the regular Moroccan Oil it is very heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I had trouble with was the aim of the sprayer, I&#x27;m so used to the one by Image, but after a few uses it won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> broke the first few pumps on the two bottles I bought, which is frustrating!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before I blow dry my hair and little after.  </li>
            <li> It blows my mind that this stuff doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> this one will weigh your hair down and make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I used this to help my frizz go down</li>
            <li> Saw/smelled it on a friend &amp; had to hunt some down.</li>
            <li> The dispenser also gets stuck in the down position, making me re-set it with every spray.</li>
            <li> This product does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my hair look greasy one bit.</li>
            <li> but I have tried some of the other brands and there is no comparison!  </li>
            <li> Money well spent!!</li>
            <li> This is one among a few other Argan oil products here.</li>
            <li> Half of the contents were spilled inside the envelope.</li>
            <li> also the previous porducts guncked up my hair straightner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost less than an areosol mist.</li>
            <li> The price of this product is not at all expensive compared to some of the salon products sold by the high end salons.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have pretty damaged hair, due to bad apartment water and recent highlights.</li>
            <li> My usual places that provided it, are now offering inferior products that you apply while your hair is wet, not as a finished product after styling.  </li>
            <li> My hair is colored - dry and rather dull - This moroccanoil shine make is look and feel so silky</li>
            <li> But figured I would get some products to make my hair a little healthier before going in there.</li>
            <li> This does add a little glimmer.</li>
            <li> Saying that I have ended up using it every day, as a little bit of luxury, so it might go sooner than I hope.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you.</li>
            <li> so I am going to let my little granddaughters take it home if they like the smell.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also overpriced for what little</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, dull frizzy curly hair that I have been straightening for years.</li>
            <li> but it was a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 sprays before &amp; that&#x27;s proved to be too heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the rather horrid scent fades to nothing after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now and don&#x27;t like to be without it.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> The issue with that is, it will start to look dried out at the ends--especially when styled with heat.</li>
            <li> leaves hair shiny and not weighed down only down side to this product is that it is difficult to spray.</li>
            <li> , I prefer it over this morrocanoil brand, and you find that stuff for less than $10!  </li>
            <li> I do use argan oil reguarly so was familiar with base product.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying this product, I should have just stuck to their plain oil.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for someone with dry hair, not fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey though!</li>
            <li> I do strongly believe it was very, very bad packaging from the sellers.</li>
            <li> When you remove the towel, finger a small amount of Moroccan argan kernel oil throughout your hair or spray it throughout if you are using a spray formula.  </li>
            <li> When you remove the towel, finger a small amount of Moroccan argan kernel oil throughout your hair or spray it throughout if you are using a spray formula.  </li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t make the hair heavy or sticky!</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have \\&quot;shiny</li>
            <li> All you need is a small amount in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they named it</li>
            <li> It is hard to control the application like this</li>
            <li> Hard to believe</li>
            <li> I find after about 2 hours my hair is looking dull</li>
            <li> If your hair is dull or gets dull as your color fades try this.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to find in salons around here.  </li>
            <li> Someone said in one review that it \\&quot;sprayed hard onto your head\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My hair is colored, so it sometimes looks dull.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> Argan oil contains both Omega 3 and Omega 9 fatty acids which allow it to penetrate the hair shaft and start repairing damaged or broken hair follicles immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have thick strains along with a lot of hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can see any shine or other benefit while using it.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else...</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong product but without my glasses, unpacked it and used it  a few times before I noticed I had received &amp;#34;Frizz Control&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li> no more split ends!!</li>
            <li> Im addicted to that alone.</li>
            <li> But with it being so thin</li>
            <li> I have thin and hair that does not have a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> Poor inventory control you guys must have.</li>
            <li> the atomizer was broken</li>
            <li> This is very bad customer service as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> It just has the worst old musky smell.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered but, not worth the hassle of returning.  </li>
            <li> but this product makes my hair feel limp and greasy : (</li>
            <li> it was so expensive</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the products in this line...</li>
            <li> However,  I did not realize that it contains triticum (wheat bran),  and having dermatitits herpetiforme,  gluten intolerance,  it unfortunately makes my skin react.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just not impressed.</li>
            <li> Expensive and ineffective, Ill stick with Thermafuse or Davines products.</li>
            <li> The viscosity is different and it will clog horribly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Too expensive but isn&#x27;t that always the way?  </li>
            <li> All this Moroccan oil stuff is expensive</li>
            <li> Think this may be a fake product</li>
            <li> The product itself seems very thin.  </li>
            <li> The recession is on and this stuff is expensive - too bad, I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> I have always been frustrated to be unable to reproduce the look my hair has after my stylist does it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any MO products!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the one bad thing about ordering on line, products cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed and upset.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> this overpriced crap is just your thing.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I hate this product.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> It smelled disgusting and I immediately threw it out.</li>
            <li> This was terrible.</li>

            <li> I have a lot of the products from MoroccanOil. This one does not dissappoint either.  Myh only caution to people is not to use too much of it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. Hair shines using this product and is exactly what we wanted for our hair care.</li>
            <li> This Moroccanoil Gold Glimmer Shine product makes my hair gleam and shine and never greasy!  Everyone wonders how I get that shine in my hair. :)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for adding some shine to my hair after styling. It adds softness and smoothes all my fly aways, and comes with the bonus of smelling amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: careful not to hold it too close to your head, or you will end up with a grease spot on your head you can not get rid of for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I ordered this, maybe because I love the brand.  Glad I did.  Give my brown hair a nice shine and makes my highlights pop.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an item that I can use n my hair for shine and moisturizing, without looking like I had sprayed it with cooking oil.  This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Having thick waist-length hair myself, I am very excited about discovering Moroccan argan oil.  It works wonderfully well for moisturizing and shining the hair without leaving it feeling greasy.  What follows is quoted from my hair-care booklet which is available at my website as a free e-book download.  If you would like to obtain the complete booklet, just click on my name above this review, and you will be taken to my profile page here on Amazon.  There, you can click on the link to my website on Lulu and get your free e-booklet entitled, \\&quot;Laurel&#x27;s Personal Regimen for Healthy Hair at 50-Plus.\\&quot;  In it you will also find a recipe for Laurel&#x27;s Soft &amp; Shiny Hair-Rinse which you can make in your own kitchen from ingredients you probably already have on hand.  Here is the partial quote from my booklet specifically regarding the use of argan oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED ADDITIONAL STEPS:  Originally in this booklet, my final suggested step was to use a soft-hold hairspray before combing out your hair.  However, in June of 2009 a wonderful widower, Arthur Dearing II, found me and rescued me from my isolated seclusion.  He married me and moved me to his home in Sugar City, Idaho.  There, I found the climate to be much dryer than it was at my former home in Murray, Kentucky where I had lived for twenty-six years.  So, I found it necessary to add some steps.  Depending on the humidity where you live, you may not need to do these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In \\&quot;Step 8\\&quot; I recommend using Moroccan argan kernel oil on your hair.  There is a lot of information online about the marvelous benefits of applying this oil to the hair.  I have also found that it is just as wonderful as a quick facial moisturizer.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to fool around with my eye and skin creams, I just quickly dab some witch hazel on my face and neck with a cotton ball as an astringent after cleansing my face.  Then, I quickly apply a little of the argan oil to my face and neck.  It is quickly absorbed, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes, and is wonderfully moisturizing without feeling greasy.  That is also its great advantage as an after-shampoo application for the hair.  It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  The three brands that I am familiar with and have used myself are; Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  All three of those I can confidently tell you are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Step 8:  Use argan oil:  When you remove the towel, finger a small amount of Moroccan argan kernel oil throughout your hair or spray it throughout if you are using a spray formula.  If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.

            <li> Has a sweet smell to this. Love this.</li>
            <li> This product is really wonderful. I use it before I straighten my hair. My hair is long with gold highlights. This spray really brings out the highlights and reflects the light nicely. Hair is so soft and manageable after straightening. The smell is really great too! One downside though is that you have to test drive this stuff, because if you use too much it can leave hair oily looking at the roots. My hair is thick so I use it on every section when I straighten...which makes that pretty glass bottle very slippery...that&#x27;s why I gave the product 4 stars. I don&#x27;t spray it directly on my head, I spray one pump in my hands, rub together and finger through my hair. Use this product before applying heat, it works best that way. If you have blonde highlights, go for it...it really does produce a shiny halo over your head.</li>
            <li> This is a product that you spray on after styling, for shine. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same hydrating effects as the Moroccan oil that you put into your damp hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Makes my hair feel great!  I love it and the product came quickly!</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this product.  It not only leaves a lovely shine and shimmer it smells so good.  It only takes just a little bit so the product will last a long time.  That is unless your daughters and grandaughters want to borrow it.  I suggest you buy them they&#x27;re own.</li>
            <li> Happy hair with lustrous shine ... my must-have hair product</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Gold Glimmer Shine 3.4 oz.    Excellent for hair that&#x27;s losing its color and natural sheen. Just follow the directions (hold spray about 10 inches from hair.) The spray on oil is not heavy nor does it weigh down your hair.  I apply the Moroccanoil Gold Glimmer Shine a couple of times a day and have the shiny hair I had twenty years ago!</li>
            <li> Between the flat iron &amp; a few magical spritzes of Morrocanoil Gold Shine, you&#x27;re set!!!   Your hair will have ZERO frizz, no matter how humid it is out, a beautiful  golden glow &amp; shine &amp; it&#x27;ll stay that way until you wash your hair!!    It looks better than when the Pro&#x27;s do it! I highly reccomend these two   products together. Morrocanoil Gold Shine + this flat iron &#x3D;&#x27;s  hAIR BLISS!!!  AAAAAAMMMMAAAZZZZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Read about this product in a magazine.  I am so happy with this purchase!  This really makes my hair shiny and other people comment on how it just shines.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works so great! Leaves my hair so soft! No Frizz! It is a little pricey though!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for curly hair.  I only use it when I straighten it, so I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the price.  So if you wear your hair straight all the time, this product is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It makes my hair smell good and makes it shiny which is not easy for hair that is curly and going gray. (I have about 20% gray.) I use this product in conjunction with the creme (see my review). You cannot spray this product on your hair directly from the bottle because the sprayer is not fine enough. I have used other glimmer sprays much more successfully but it is because the sprayer is fine and well-controlled. This sprayer is not. Also, it is actually difficult to hold the fat slick glass bottle far enough away from my head and still be able to work the sprayer. So I always end up spraying too close to my head and that is always a disaster. If I really want to use this product I spray one squirt into my hand and then rub my hands together and then rub my hair with my hands. It is hard to control the application like this but it is better than throwing away the bottle.     I will not buy this product again unless they change to a slim bottle that&#x27;s easier to hold with a better sprayer.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me back in 2008 - and I have never stopped using it. The recession is on and this stuff is expensive - too bad, I&#x27;m still using it. I use it for my hair right out of the shower for deep moisturizer instead of those purchased &amp;#34;oil treatments.&amp;#34; With MO simply get out of the shower, spritz this all outside and within your wet, warm hair and swish it up in your turba-towel. Go about your toilet-tring and when you are ready to tend to your hair it will be supple, shiny, nourished and healthier. And the scent? Lovely.</li>
            <li> Arrived practically the next day.  The price was great and the product is wonderful, everything the ad says.</li>
            <li> This product advertised that it would give hair shine.  I followed directions and my hair did not get any shine and also dried my hair and made it very static.  I would not recommend this product it is very inferior considering it was so expensive</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pretty strong scent to this oil, which really bugs me.  The previous one I had (different brand) didn&#x27;t have a scent at all.  That&#x27;s the one bad thing about ordering on line, products cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist turned me on to Morrocan oil a year ago.  Since then I have purchased every product available and love them all...I especially love the Morrocan Gold for the shine it givve your hair and the scent is so fresh and everyone loves it.    You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the products in this line...just remember, less is best.</li>
            <li> The Moroccanoil Gold Glimmer Shine is a must have if you want shiny healthy hair. I&#x27;m probably on by 7th bottle! Try it once and you&#x27;ll probably be hooked! :)</li>
            <li> This moroccan oil is a great product. When your hair is needing a little boost, moroccan oil will seemingly bring it back to life.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my hairdresser used it on my hair. I love it. I have very fine hair and  made it very soft and shiny. I prefer the spray because it&#x27;s easier to limit what you use. It&#x27;s crucial to only use a little.</li>
            <li> This product is junk. I have very dry hair and this oil does nothing for my hair at all. It does smell good but that is the only redeming quality here. In addition I used it twice and pump in spray bottle broke ! Save your money.</li>
            <li> Unimpressed.  I could put baby oil on my hair and have the same effect.  Borderline greasy look so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeking this overpriced crap is just your thing.</li>
            <li> Although this product smells absolutely delicious, and leaves a nice shimmer it&#x27;s purely for an after style spritz.  This spray does not leave enough binders behind to protect your hair if you use a flat iron or a hot comb. I have really kinky curls and usually after you blow out your hair when you plan on wearing it straight you need some type of serum to straighten it with or it&#x27;ll fry.  The texture of the serum is really important: if it&#x27;s too wet your hair will fry, if it&#x27;s too dense your hair will take on a heavy consistancy will feel greasy and not move, if it&#x27;s too light weight your hair will look frizzy and damaged.  This serum is too light weight my hair has never felt so crispy and straw-like.  The regular moroccan oil is perfect for after a wash to protect it during a blow out before you straighten.  But if you have really curly hair like I do and you don&#x27;t wash it every day then I would highly recommend regular argan oil for a straightening serum it&#x27;s a really good consistency and it leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great great shine</li>
            <li> I have bought this twice!  It smells wonderful and gives a great shine to my hair!  Only spray a few times though as too much could make your hair look oily.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair really shiney and smell very nice. You only need a tiny bit on wet hair and comb thru, then style as usual. I have color treated hair and it conditions it beautifully. I only use it about once a week, that&#x27;s all you need!</li>
            <li> I bought this to kind of condition my hair with. I had the regular type that you rub on but it was a little too heavy for my hair. I use this two ways. When my hair is wet I tip my head over and spray on back side of my head and rub in for conditioning. Or I mist my boar bristle brush and brush it on.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair care product I have used in years! And a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular moroccan oil and the hydrating moroccan oil cream but found this on Amazon, read the other reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it.  It works great.  I spray it the distance they recommend from my hair, I do three sprays, one on the left side, one on the right side and one on the back and that&#x27;s it.  I wait a minute then comb through my hair, then I flat iron my hair, it makes my hair so incredibly soft.  I&#x27;ve used 4 sprays before &amp; that&#x27;s proved to be too heavy for my hair (I have a blunt bob, my hair is fine textured).      I highly recommend it!  I even got my mom to try it and she was amazed too, I recommend the other two Moroccan Oil products I mentioned too.  It blows my mind that this stuff doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Try this oil for shimmer and great smelling finish to your hair.  It&#x27;s just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil came very highly recommended to me by co-workers.  My hair is very fine and difficult to control. Even with the hot iron I had fly aways that made me crazy.  While this product has not completely resolved my fine hair issues; I have had more complements in the few weeks that I have been using Moroccanoil than I have had in years.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li> Initially, I didn&#x27;t really like this product. I sprayed it on a few times but it just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything different for my hair. I think the problem was that I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently. I have dry, coarse hair but after I started using it EVERY morning I&#x27;ve noticed a complete change in my hair. My routine is using Redkin Anti-Snap (blue bottle) at night as a leave-in after my shower and spraying this shine spray on my hair (pony tail section only- not the roots!) in the morning. It has made such a difference! This is a lovely product and I&#x27;ll probably purchase again!</li>
            <li> I just changed hairdresser three months ago who introduced me to the Moroccan Oil hair products.  To try, I just bought a bottle of the Gold and Glimmer Shine.  An absolutely sensational product. I am an aging baby boomer who colors her hair every four weeks.  Usually my dyed hair looks good for the first week only then it turns dry, dull and brassy until it is time to color it again.  The Gold and Glimmer Shine contains argan oil, a miracle oil from Morocco.  This oil brings back the shine I used to have on my virgin hair.  After spraying it (from 10 inches away) my treated hair&#x27;s texture turns much softer and my hair becomes shiny immediately.  There is no trace of grease felt on my hair or on my fingers as the product is instantaneously absorbed by my thirsty and processed hair.  Argan oil contains both Omega 3 and Omega 9 fatty acids which allow it to penetrate the hair shaft and start repairing damaged or broken hair follicles immediately.  Unlike other oil products, there is no worry that argan oil will leave grease stains either on your collar or on your pillow.  I use this product after I blew dry my hair to restore the moisture back to my blown hair.  I imagine it would be excellent to use it before the blow dry as well or in-between shampoo for those who have over-processed hair or damaged hair.  I love this product and would try the shampoo as well as the conditioner next.  It smells good, too.  The price of this product is not at all expensive compared to some of the salon products sold by the high end salons.</li>
            <li> It  is a great product,  and it does what it says.  However,  I did not realize that it contains triticum (wheat bran),  and having dermatitits herpetiforme,  gluten intolerance,  it unfortunately makes my skin react.</li>
            <li> Perfect combination with the other Moroccan Oil products. Makes your hair smell WONDERFUL!!! If you have fine hair make sure you get the LIGHT Gold Glimmer Shine or this one will weigh your hair down and make it look greasy. It is perfect for normal, coarse and/or thick hair. I have thick strains along with a lot of hair and I have polish and tongan genes but I am blonde... I have LOVED this product and would highly recommend it to anyone, (as long as they don&#x27;t have thin/fine hair)!</li>
            <li> I have long, dry, wavy hair, and when I want to look like Demi Moore, this is what I use!  This product not only smells divine, but really smooths your hair into a natural shiny texture.  If you want to curl your hair and put more product or hairspray in it for a more structured look, this is not the best product to use.  This is because it moisturizes and weighs down your hair to the point that it can&#x27;t hold much curl for long.  Product does not leave my roots oily, so I can wait 2 to 3 days to wash my hair if I don&#x27;t otherwise sweat.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do and gives your hair a great healthy looking shine. Very light not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff leaves a nice shine on my hair and keeps the frizz away</li>
            <li> Well, this product is great. The smell is just incredible! Im addicted to that alone. I make sure I spray it not too close but not too far away. It covers a good area with just one spray. My hair is getting very long (down my back), and I need a haircut. So, its not in the best shape. But figured I would get some products to make my hair a little healthier before going in there. This is one among a few other Argan oil products here. This does add a little glimmer. I give it about 6-7 sprays since my hair is long and then comb through. I step back away from the mirror and can see a baby shine. Also, it helps with softness. Love it!</li>
            <li> I used this to help my frizz go down and it works ok..  I&#x27;ve used other products that put more shine in my hair..</li>
            <li> its fantastic product very soft smooth in your hair smells very good this oil its penetrting in yor hair and provide soft and smooth for long time in your hair</li>
            <li> I dunno.. I read alot of the &#x27;raving&#x27; reviews and I&#x27;m just not impressed. Although I only spray 1-2 mists from very high above, it&#x27;s still very greasy and really weighs down my hair. I also do NOT like the smell. I much prefer the Redken Color Extend product I was using prior, so I am definitely going back to that..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years..smells great and have even been asked if I highlighted my hair...kind&#x27;a disappointed that the price has gone up.</li>
            <li> I already use other Moroccan Oil products and love a good shine spray - this one is fantastic!  My fiance even mentioned how \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; my hair was looking after I started using it.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any MO products!</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair nice and curly, it does not make my hair oily, and it smell good.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored - dry and rather dull - This moroccanoil shine make is look and feel so silky and it really does shine.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Image Shine Plus Hi Gloss Mist for YEARS. It was the ONLY product that worked with my flat iron and tamed my crazed, frizzy hair. I panicked when I learned the mist had been discontinued. I bought a few bottles online, but they were not the same as the ones I had been buying previously from a beauty supply store. So I started my search to find a replacement... this product tops it!! My hair is soft, silky and shiny, I am so happy with the results! The only thing I had trouble with was the aim of the sprayer, I&#x27;m so used to the one by Image, but after a few uses it won&#x27;t be a problem. I highly recommend this product. I spray each section before I run the flat iron. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This product is great on my dry curly hair. I suddenly have shine  and  soft to touch hair. The fragrance is fresh and flowery; I always receive comments on the effect and smell. I feel like a million bucks with all the gold in my hair.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic.  It puts a nice shine on my medium brown hair.  It really makes the hair look heathy.  It smells really good and I usually don&#x27;t like any scents of any kind.  It&#x27;s a light scent.  Not like perfume......earthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and this brand is way overprice.</li>
            <li> This product is what they company says it is...I was very pleased using it.  I have very long hair and it gives my hair such a beautiful glimmer shine!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone--long or short hair!  It works and doesn&#x27;t make the hair heavy or sticky!</li>
            <li> I like the shine and the fragrance is heavenly, makes my hair feel silky soft and alleviates the dry look of my untreated hair</li>
            <li> the product is nice, but not high shine as I had hoped. Leaves hair soft with a little shine. Pricey for results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Moroccanoil for about a year and it has transformed my hair!  It is sooo healthy now so I decided to try this new product and I love it!  I squirt just 1 to 2 pumps on my hands and rub them together(I have long hair so definetly just one pump if you have short hair) and lightly apply to my hair.  It adds a softness and sheen.  Just make sure not to put on too much or your hair will get too greasy!  At this rate this bottle should last me a year or more!</li>
            <li> As always, the glimmer shine adds just what I need to keep my hair manageable with great sheen without feeling or looking oily. Great !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. After you have styled your hair spray on top to give you a nice shiny &amp; healthy look. This works great on dry damaged colored hair.</li>
            <li> This product was great at giving my hair some shine and vibrancy but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. I can tell the product will last a long time also.</li>
            <li> I love the product, this is my second bottle . The hair absorbed the oil right away and takes away the dryness due to hair coloring.</li>
            <li> Product does add some amazing shine, but it also leaves my hair kind of greasy especially at the roots. I end up covering the top of my head with a towel and spraying around it. This would be perfect for the beach when hair is a little dry from sun/sea. If you have thin hair be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have pretty damaged hair, due to bad apartment water and recent highlights. I became a fan of the Moroccanoil products (specifically their oil and deep conditioners). They truly have helped my hair, as long as I use them on a regular basis. Instead of buying this product, I should have just stuck to their plain oil. The oil hydrates my hair and leaves it just as shiny. I have thick hair and I feel I need a lot of this product to make much of a difference. I definitely saw that it made my hair shinier, but it didn&#x27;t seem to last like the oil does, or make my hair nearly as soft and healthy looking. Not a terrible product, just not worth it, to me.</li>
            <li> This smells really good. Don&#x27;t use much, though, it will be too oily and your hair will be flat.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product if used just like it says.</li>
            <li> This product turned my frizzy curls into gleaming locks. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments, even from a stranger at CVS! This is a must for curlies!</li>
            <li> I love the regular moroccan oil, but I thought I&#x27;d try this for a change.  The product itself seems very thin.  When you try and spray it from the bottle, it not only sprays but also dribbles down the sprayer and the bottle, which becomes pretty messy.  If you pour some in your hands it works better. But with it being so thin you have to work quickly before it runs out through your fingers.  The product itself seems to work likes it&#x27;s intended.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to the regular moroccan oil which I can work with better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of these products but I just don&#x27;t get the fuss. This one doesn&#x27;t do much for my locks but dry them out. Expensive and ineffective, Ill stick with Thermafuse or Davines products.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  I have thin and hair that does not have a lot of volume.  This product is great because it gives me shine and takes off the frizz without weighting down my hair.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> You have to use a teeny tiny bit or your hair will be a little greasy. But man, it makes your hair shine!  I use it when I have my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li> So I must say I was disappointed to find that this beautiful smelling spray does not actually &amp;#34;glimmer&amp;#34;. While it does make hair look shinier than before, I expected it to have small sparkle flecks, hence the same &amp;#34;Gold Glimmer Shine&amp;#34;. Despite this, it does give my hair a nice, light gloss, so it&#x27;s still a success in my book. The only other thing I noticed is that the smell is not as strong with this product as it is with my other Morrocanoil products. However, since I combine using this with mousse and hairspray daily, I&#x27;m sure my hair smells well enough; I sure get enough compliments on it! Overall, four stars!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Glimmer Shine Spray &amp; they sent me a receipt for the glimmer shine spay, but they sent me the regular frizz control spray. Wth? Never had this problem before. Poor inventory control you guys must have.</li>
            <li> This actually works for shine and glimmer and has a gorgeous scent as well. You don&#x27;t need much of the product, a fine mist, so I hope that it will last a long time too. Saying that I have ended up using it every day, as a little bit of luxury, so it might go sooner than I hope. It is light and non greasy, as long as you don&#x27;t over apply, and works well with my fine, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I purchased a nice almond oil that smells nice and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This product is even better than I thought!!! It leaves such a shiny hair and I just love it and recommended with no doubts!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does nothing for my hair.  On top of that, after you spray it on, it drips on the bottles and you have a pile of oil sitting&lt;br /&gt;under it.  They should change the name because I don&#x27;t see any glimmer or shine.</li>
            <li> This is a fun accessory for your hair styling kit.  It is moisturizing and the light oil doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.  The smell is pleasing without being overpowering and the sheen is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Moroccanoil Hair Treatment, which has better results and brings more shine to the hair than the very Glimmer Shine.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have always been frustrated to be unable to reproduce the look my hair has after my stylist does it.  I have bought all the products she uses, but even using those, I end up with flyaway hairs, no real definition of my highlights and lowlights.  The sprayer works great for me.  it isn&#x27;t an aerosol; it&#x27;s a mist, but it works.  It does great at helping &#x27;define&#x27; the variations in my hair color, but what I really love is the smooth look and lack of flyaway hair!  A little dab will do you. It leaves it very shiny, but not sticky or with a wet-look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair short - an inverted bob style and it&#x27;s very thick, so this really helps smooth it out.  To me, it really is a miracle product as I can now get that salon look when I style my own hair.</li>
            <li> It is NOT GOLD Glimmer Shine. It is different product. I order 2 battle (one for my friend). They packed different... How is it possible? I did not use that product before. I cannot say for sure how it should smells or works... Product I received has no smell at all. I read Moroccan oil should have nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Item delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m questioning if I got Moroccan Oil... I would not buy it here again.</li>
            <li> Yes, I do love the scent, I must first say.  It is addictive.  But way beyond that is how amazing this is at making my baby fine, thin hair thicker and stronger.  I would never have thought it possible but I can easily go 2-3 days without washing and my hair looks exactly as it does on day 1.  I can only attribute it to this and the other products I am using.  But it&#x27;s really this one that makes the difference.  My hair is wavy now (as opposed to those annoying ringlet curls that only belong to 5-year old little girls) and looks amazing after only blow-drying on low.  Wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> This smelled nothing like the moroccan oil product that my hair dresser used on me. It smelled disgusting and I immediately threw it out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair shiny and fabulous once you are done styling it.  It finishes a style with a beautiful frizz free shine.</li>
            <li> this Moroccan oil really wonders on the hair keeping it soft and moist</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews prior to making this purchase. This hair product is amazing! I received a lot of compliments from everyone after my very first application. Worth the price of GOLD!!</li>
            <li> If you like your locks to shine, this is the best product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  Made a real difference with my hair.  Easy and smooth...and FAST transaction!!!  Happy customer!  Will forever use it!</li>
            <li> Great product, but the spray bottle was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> It does not do anything more than regular Moroccan oil in my hair. No shimmer or shine. But it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have more conditioning in my hair. Don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I DONT KNOW if this product works because I can&#x27;t wear it.  The cheap perfume smell on my head is too overbearing. It smells like the old time pomade used for very frizzy hair back in the 60s.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad. I wanted my hair to glimmer. I waited too long to get around to returning it so I am going to let my little granddaughters take it home if they like the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different Moroccan or Argan oil products but, hands down, this is my favorite. Not too keen on fragrance which reminds me of public restroom disinfectant. Thankfully, the rather horrid scent fades to nothing after a few minutes. Why not have a nice spicy orange smell for this exotic Moroccan oil? Anyhow, there are no gold flakes in this but it gives your hair a healthy, natural sheen as it conditions. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Glimmer shine provides the finish I want for my hair, the pump makes it very easy to apply evenly. Like the ease in massaging the product in.</li>
            <li> This was terrible. It came damaged and leaking. I never even used but for the price the packaging should have been much better</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE the original Moroccanoil but I didn&#x27;t like this at all. It is way too greasy-even if I spray it in the air and try to walk through it</li>
            <li> Very light weight on baby fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasey. The very best detangler I can find.....</li>
            <li> I like it because it helps with fly aways and give me shimmer and moisture with a spray! I don&#x27;t have to get my hands oily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have my hair highlighted every six weeks and I straighten my hair every day.  I spray this product on my hair when it is dry before straightening.  It helps my hair to straighten easier and it acts as a protectant against the heat.  I also use the Moroccan oil after I wash my hair.  Using the two products has allowed me to maintain healthy hair that shines while doing so many things that should damage it.  My hair is healthier now than it has ever been, including before highlighting and straightening.  My hair stylist is constantly amazed by the strength and endurance of my hair.  One thing to remember, a little goes a long way.  Hold the bottle about 8-10 inches from your hair when you spray the product and be sure not to spray too many times.  If you use too much, it will leave your hair oily.  A bottle of the Gold Glimmer Shine 3.4 oz. lasted me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am real happy with this Product after my Hair is  all dry and styled i spray this on not to much and this leaves my Hair with a great Shine just don&#x27;t spray to much your Hair could look oily .I love the scent and how the Shine lasted all day .The  spray pump on mine works great no problems i had read a few reviewers with that problem but all is good with this.</li>
            <li> I simply love it. Smells great !  Just make sure you don&#x27;t over do it</li>
            <li> This product does add some shine to the hair and perhaps out in the sun it would sparkle more. Easier to have a glosser done at your salon.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Looks like you just came out a salon after you use it.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Gold Glimmer Shine works beautifully. With just a few spritzes your hair will look shiny and healthy all day.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product. Saw/smelled it on a friend &amp; had to hunt some down. It is the final thing you spritz on your hair after styling, etc. It DOES add a lovely shine to your hair &amp; smells wonderful &amp; exotic (wish it came as a perfume). It is however, NOT oily or greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my rather fine hair. Highly recommend for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I have super curly kinky hair and only the Japanese Hair Straightening system will work - which costs an $$$ per hour. In between the mandatory 4 months in between I use this product and it works like magic to straighten out my curls and without leaving any heavy residue or flaking like hair gel when I use my straightening iron on it. This product is like a lotion for your hair and only a dab will do. Hard to believe but my sister and I have been using this 1 bottle over 6 months. We have super thick very long hair so to see how long this product lasts - def. worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your normal &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; product. It smells great and I had many compliments on how shiny my hair was. If you have highlights it really makes them &amp;#34;POP!&amp;#34;  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using product for years</li>
            <li> I love this product I just have a word for Awesome, I have dry chemical process hair, and as soon as I use one single spray, my hair looks healthier and shiny!Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this oil, makes my hair feel soft and silky! Can apply on wet or dry hair, works either way.</li>
            <li> I have had a bunch of friends try this product (it&#x27;s my second time purchasing) and nothing matches this particular one due to the fine atomizing mist that it outputs as well as the sheen it gives without weighing down the hair. I definitely recommend and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Love all the Moroccan hair products.</li>
            <li> This really does make your hair shiny in a golden festive way.  BUT, the scent is super strong, though it does fade in several minutes.  Only use a very light mist or it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now and don&#x27;t like to be without it.  Makes hair so shiny and soft --- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product help to really gloss and shine your hair after blowdrying and straightening.  Makes your hair look and feel like silk and so smooth you can run your fingers through it easily (and a fine toothed comb).  I have not found a better product for the price and the lasting effects on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Great product but spray was broken so I had to move to another bottle</li>
            <li> I have always loved this item because of the spray availability to get a finished look.  It is very hard to find this exact spray bottle these days.  My usual places that provided it, are now offering inferior products that you apply while your hair is wet, not as a finished product after styling.  It gives you a salon look from home.  I am glad to see it still available.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product, however I love most of Moroccanoil products!</li>
            <li> This item is available in my salon but I found it cheaper online, of course.  It adds a nice sheen to your hair without weighing it down, and helps with flyaways.  This has never clogged on me.  Just don&#x27;t make the mistake of refilling this with regular Moroccan Oil, as they are not the same thing.  The viscosity is different and it will clog horribly.</li>
            <li> Adds a touch of softness to my hair.  I would recommend it-seems to take the freeziness out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to buy it and this is my third bottle. I gave one to my friend. She likes it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes. smells good very good indead however did not give my hair any shine. I have used much cheaper oil sheens that gave my hair glorious shine. I wont be buying this again. I guess somethings only work for some.</li>
            <li> The whole line of Morroconoil products saved my daughters hair, which has been relaxed for several years, was dry and brittle. DO not go for any of the knock off brands sold in stores that say Moroccanoil. You will only find the real prodcuts for moroccanoil here on amazon,  definitely for the best price.  the Gold Glimmer, is a nice addition to the conditioner/moisturizer, a little goes a long way on all these products.   The beautician commended on how much healther my daughters hair has been after the very first 2 weeks of use.  if you have relaxed hair this is a product I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> leaves hair shiny and not weighed down only down side to this product is that it is difficult to spray. you cant spray continuously you have to wait which can hold you up if you are in a hurry. other than that it does the job and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I use this as I am flat iron my hair to protect the hair.</li>
            <li> Good for shine and conditioner.  I have bought Moroccan oil in salons and this ranks at the top with those.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong product but without my glasses, unpacked it and used it  a few times before I noticed I had received &amp;#34;Frizz Control&amp;#34; .  I didn&#x27;t need that as I use Moroccanoil Original treatment and it controls the frizz.  It was a waste of money and I&#x27;ll never bother to try the glimmer shine product</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday, tried it first thing this morning. My hair smelled like moth balls! It just has the worst old musky smell. I contacted Amazon right away. I have many Moroccanioil products and they are all amazing. I just got a dud this time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is the real product. I heard that some of the morrocan oil products sold aren&#x27;t the real ones. I received this it&#x27;s package fine but the pump doesn&#x27;t work. Also I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s makes my hair shinier or not, but I do like the smell so not a total loss.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I live in a very dry climate and my hair sometimes needs a little extra shine. This does the trick and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> absolutely the best line on the market- great great product</li>
            <li> I bought this product specifically for the shine. Unfortunately I can see any shine or other benefit while using it. It smells great but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and they admit that Maroccanoil changed the formula about 6 months ago and it is not called Gold Glimmer Shine but just Glimmer shine now. Also it didn&#x27;t help with my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great to accept return, especially when in the title there is still Gold Shimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is alright. Sometimes I can notice the difference and my hair has more shine, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. If I spray too close to the top of my head, it makes my hair oily. The dispenser also gets stuck in the down position, making me re-set it with every spray.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the Glimmer Shine spray, I usually buy the regular Moroccan Oil treatment.  I love the spray, it smells wonderful and sprays on very lightly. You can also spray some in the palms of your hands, rub them together and apply to wet hair. Whenever I order anything, I always use Amazon.com. They offer the best service and information on products.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff after your done styling your hair just spray a few sprits and it leaves a nice shine without looking oily.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m not sure if I have \\&quot;shiny Hair\\&quot; but, too soon to tell if its a keeper.  Check back later.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems like the ones I read, like too much quantity going out from the spray, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair. Maybe it does, but I don&#x27;t notice much...I like the ordinary Moroccanoil better.</li>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews,  I was expecting a smooth product.  Instead,  it made my hair feel sticky.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> My 30-year-old daughter introduced me to Glimmer Shine - she uses it freely and frequently and often receives compliments on her long, almost-black hair.  I have a little natural color left in my medium-long hair, lots of &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; and some low lights.  Whether I flat-iron my hair, leave it wavy, or clip it up, I finish with 3 to 5 spritzes.  I love the waft of tropical fragrance, and the resulting shine is subtle and very attractive.  I also receive compliments on my hair, and I am 60 years old.  This is a must-try product!</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice smell to it. When I received it, the lid was loose and I had lost some of the product into the wrapping. It does give a nice shimmer on the hair when you first apply it, but it seems to loose the sheen within about 15 minutes. As it is pretty expensive, I would probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Sprays out very concentrated in a small spot so it makes my hair look greasy.  Also came leaking all over the place.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After you&#x27;re done styling your hair, hold the bottle up about 1-2 feet above your hair and spritz just 2-3 times, all over hair. Do not spray on scalp area. Too much will make your hair&lt;br /&gt;greasy and look greasy. Great for dry, damaged or dry hair. It makes your hair look healthy, shiny and vibrant, if used correctly!  Also, be careful, Linoleum or tile, bathroom floors, get very slippery from this stuff. Try putting a bathroom towel on the floor and stand on towel when spraying (then put towel in laundry and possibly mop floor too), or spray your hair while you stand in shower (just wash tub afterwards and before someone uses the shower/tub.  Just be careful not to slip and fall. This spray is a lifesaver for anyone really. Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for my hair! An absolute &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me. It makes my hair so soft and silky. I have pretty long hair, and it even helps with detangling while brushing. This is a product that will forever be in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I use marocan oil line it&#x27;s expensive but I like smell and shine after my hair have I have 1 butle for 1 year will buy</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and I let it air dry. This spray is perfect for making my curls shiny and soft. A little goes a long way....great smell too!</li>
            <li> Wow do I love this product! You spray it on your hair and can instantly see how much shinier and healthier your hair looks with this on. I could not believe how noticeable the difference was or how instantly shinier my hair was after just a few sprays.  I stared in the mirror is disbelief the first time I used it lol. It also smells great. I have naturally very oily scalp and hair and was worried this would make my hair look more oily or weigh it down and feel like it had gunk in it as that is what would happen when I tried shine serums in the past but not with this product. It makes your hair shiny but it does not make your hair feel oily to the touch.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasant product to use. It was more expensive that others but left hair shiny and fragrant . I also liked the spray rather than than &amp;#34;straight from the bottle&amp;#34; It also left my hair softer.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while on a Regent cruise around Australia and Indonesia.  The crew gave out samples in their salon.  I fell in love with the condition of my hair and the manageability this product gave to my hair.  My hair no longer looks dry and stressed and that is saying something for an older woman.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice oil for dry hair.  As advertised it does give a glimmer shine to the hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing for all types of hair</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with the amount you spray on because it doesn&#x27;t take much before your hair starts looking more oily than shiny/healthy.  I guess I just don&#x27;t think it makes that much of a difference (other than possibly making my hair look oily) because I don&#x27;t ever use mine.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair smell divine!! You won&#x27;t even need to wear fragrance. Men will follow you home. Smiles. (&amp;#60;;</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and when I wash my hair I normally do not apply any kind of of oil, sheen or grease because it ways it down and inhibits free movement. Recently, my hair started to feel a bit dry so I tried this product. It is fabulous. It does not weigh my hair down, it makes my hair smooth and my hair has a wonderful natural looking shine to it that makes it look super healthy. I also like that it sprays out in a fine mist because you get greater coverage and even distribution rather than patches that are more oily than others. The bottle lasts long enough to make it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> When you want that extra shine you use this product. Going to a party or even during the day your hair sparkle. I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> this is a performer!!&lt;br /&gt;does shine hair and detangle....!!&lt;br /&gt;good for my blonde hair,&lt;br /&gt;just go through a bottle REALLY QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it everyday before I blow dry my hair and little after.  Love being able to spray where I want it.</li>
            <li> Everything I have heard about this product is true and more. This Moroccan oil works like magic on my hair. My hair has never been so soft and have so much body. This product does not weigh your hair down. I have had family and friends that I let try, they to were amazed instantly. All you need is a small amount in the palm of your hand. Afterwards my hair smells so nice. People even asked me what perfume I am wearing when it was the Moroccan oil that was the fragrance. I know I will be using this indefinitely.

I have VERY dry, dull frizzy curly hair that I have been straightening for years. I also dye it a lot so it is SO damaged that it hasnt grown in YEARS. I got this for Christmas and it literally saved my hair. My hair is growing again!! I put this on my hair when its wet and I use an additional pump just for the ends of my hair. I lather until it is smooth. TA-DA! no more split ends!! Hence, your hair will start to grow! This product will NOT make your hair feel heavy or greasy, only soft, shiny and beautiful. Cant say enough good things about it!!!! And mine came from Amazon, and as far as I can tell it is the realdeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was this review helpful to you?

            <li> Great product, great service! Definitely worth the money. The item arrived on earlier than expected. I love this product; I use it everyday! It makes my hair so shiny and soft, without being oily. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like all the products I&#x27;ve received from Moroccanoil except this one. I used it two times and wasn&#x27;t thrilled either time. I don&#x27;t notice it making my hair any more gold or any more shiny. That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else...just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> keeps your hair healthy!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered gold glimmer shine but instead of that I got totally different item, even wrapping was saying gold glimmer shine but when u open it, it was smoothing lotion by Moroccanoil , I feel cheated as it was present for my friend and now there is not way I can return it, shipping from Moscow , Russian, will cost me more then the price of product. Really disappointed and upset.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I spray it on wet hair because I notice this way it makes my hair softer. Good product.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair glisten after you fix it. Must be your last touch before leaving....love it but I wish it smelled more like the moroccan oil. I love that smell!!</li>
            <li> The product appears to be not legitimate. For this smell different from the original. Not recommend to anyone. Best buy in a salon. Because this product does not seem in any way with the legitimate, does not leave your hair with the same brightness. not recommend</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2 years and I love it. Leaves hair shiny and very soft. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> The bottle was opened and empty when I received it.  It&#x27;s my own fault for not opening it right away and using it.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is supposed to be really good for your hair, but I just found this too greasy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> where has moroccanoil been all my life?  It&#x27;s really great.  Too expensive but isn&#x27;t that always the way?  The spray is not what you&#x27;d expect exactly.  It does offer shine but not like dudley shine, it&#x27;s really very light.  We really buy it for the smell.  My god, what is that wonderful smell?  If the price we lower it would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I really like all other Moroccan Oil products I have used. I was quite disappointed. First the packaging was very inferior. Half of the contents were spilled inside the envelope. When I opened it up copious oil spilled.I do not believe the pkg was messed with I do strongly believe it was very, very bad packaging from the sellers. As for the product itself, I did try what spilled out onto my hands when I initially opened it. I found it good but a bit greasy. Not quite on par with the gold standard Moroccan oil. I would probably try it again but from another seller. At this price, I am not willing to gamble that it would arrive intact.</li>
            <li> I love this as it is not heavy on baby fine hair like mine. I also use Moroccan oil after each hair washing. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It doesnt weigh my hair down, just adds a beautiful shimmer. I continue to reorder it over and over.</li>
            <li> Love this product...it definitely smooths my hair and has a nice scent</li>
            <li> Order Gold Glimmer...received Glimmer ....they are different products...didn&#x27;t bother to return.  Disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered but, not worth the hassle of returning.  I will not order again.</li>
            <li> I have long dark hair, and this makes it shine like silk.  I get lots of compliments, and random people touch my hair and ask how I keep it so healthy.  The aroma is lovely, too.  I use sparingly, so this lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The Glimmer Shine never disappoints it adds the perfect amount of shine and always leaves my hair smelling so amazing</li>
            <li> I have used the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Moroccan oil which I LOVE but this product makes my hair feel limp and greasy : (</li>
            <li> I love everything Moroccanoil. I prefer this lighter spray to the thicker version before I style my hair or when I travel and need a little help to keep my hair smooth and shiny. My old school friends who see me once a year only have complimented me on beautiful hair since I started using this brand.</li>
            <li> I love glimmer shine but the sprayer on this one did not work !</li>
            <li> The oil itself is a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;The squirt pump it comes in, on the other hand, broke the first few pumps on the two bottles I bought, which is frustrating!</li>
            <li> Amazon actually had this priced pretty cheap, normally it retails near $40.  Regardless, I won&#x27;t ever buy this stuff again.  The main ingredients are silicones, so it&#x27;s not really an \\&quot;oil\\&quot; it&#x27;s more like a serum.  They should change the name to morrocan serum!!  You really are paying for the name, because this stuff is in no way worth more than $10.  I have organix brand argan oil dry mist and it works fantastic, I prefer it over this morrocanoil brand, and you find that stuff for less than $10!  I only gave it 3 stars due to amazons service, otherwise I&#x27;d only gave it a 1.</li>
            <li> First I want to say there are no gold flecks in this product.  I&#x27;m not sure why they named it that but the name is deceiving.  The product is clear and goes on light and shiny.  I bought this because curly hair does not reflect light very well and therefore does not shine like straight hair.  This has a wonderful smell, like all products in the Moroccanoil line, but it&#x27;s not as good as I had hoped.  It is also overpriced for what little it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives - the smell is amazing.  I wish they sold a body spray!  The product is light - this could be a negative if you need a heavier product.  I like the application, using a spray bottle is very convenient.  The spray is fairly concentrated, it won&#x27;t go all over your bathroom.  It adds shine to your hair but it doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives - overpriced.  This should sell for $10, that would be reasonable.  There is a similar product on the market, \\&quot;One and Only Argan Oil spray\\&quot; which is almost exactly the same for half the price and comes in a larger bottle.  Although Moroccanoil Gold Glimmer adds shine, it is short lived.  I find after about 2 hours my hair is looking dull again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair or hair that doesn&#x27;t need to hold a style, this may be for you.  Heavier products may weigh this hair type down so this could be perfect; however, you get similar results from the much cheaper \\&quot;One and Only\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a bad product, I may buy it again just for the smell.  Right now I&#x27;m product comparing this with One and Only to see if there is any big difference between the two.  I&#x27;m not finding any to justify paying extra for Moroccanoil. (I really love the smell though!)</li>
            <li> I will recomend it to everyone it has my hair looking great.It does not allow my hair to be running wild, it has polish it to shine. I love it</li>
            <li> Love this brand but not this product….I have unruly curly hair so that may be the issue…it may work better on someone else</li>
            <li> This brand is truly the best in the market. Smells great, lightweight, lasts long, beautiful shine. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!  All this Moroccan oil stuff is expensive but I have tried some of the other brands and there is no comparison!  If your hair is dull or gets dull as your color fades try this.  It is really good.</li>
            <li> I ordered Gold Glimmer Shine, but got Glimmer Shine Finish instead. The company claims that it is the same product, but I don&#x27;t trust them. So I emailed Morrocan Oil and asked them. I am awaiting a reply. The company says that I will have to pay shipping to return it. This is very bad customer service as far as I am concerned. They should have emailed me and told me that this is the same product. It actually may be a similar product, but not the same. I will see what Moroccan Oil says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this company doesn&#x27;t show me the courtesy of clarifying about the product BEFORE they send it and wants me to pay to return a product that they misrepresent, is a clue who they are. I won&#x27;t buy from them again due to their attitude even if they are the lowest price around. They are causing a huge hassle for me, that I don&#x27;t appreciate. I don&#x27;t trust their word.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Great to use before applying a flat iron to your hair. The aroma is awesome! Such a fresh, clean and yet, exotic scent. Give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I use this on my dog between groomings.I powder her with a cornstarch-based powder,rub it in good ,brush her out and spray.She smells good and it conditions her coat.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very happy with the product.  The price was affordable.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past (I got it in my Beauty Test Tube) and fell in love with it...but not enough to buy it again. That was over 3 years ago, so when I decided to re-vamp my hair regimen I decided to get some more. This product works very well and makes your hair more than shine; your hair will &amp;#34;glimmer&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this product to wet hair before blow drying. This product is literally absorbed into my hair and makes each strand radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I hate this product.  Oily.  Oily and more Oily.  I do not recommend unless your hair is so dry that is falling out of your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works wonders for my hair and it leaves  great shine and smell to my hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my hair look greasy one bit.</li>
            <li> I only use this line in my hair because i am goint nautral but have not compeletely yet! I love the smell and the softness if gives my hair!the shine with out too much oil and the feel is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product for my coarse, curly hair - imparts a nice shine &amp; smells fabulous</li>
            <li> So I first tried this product from a friend who happens to be a hairstylist. I fell in love with the smell and how it made my hair feel. I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about the price when I found online, so I tried some other off brand argan oil and none of them had the texture or scent this product has. Eventually, I caved and bought the name brand Moroccan Oil because I knew I liked it and had some extra money to splurge. Was just as I had remembered, for some reason whatever scent they use is absolutely amazing. Eventually I&#x27;ll probably try the oil instead of the spray, may last longer.</li>
            <li> Not as what I expect, just like a regular serum that can be purchase in stores</li>
            <li> This product is only ok because instead of the spray making your hair shiny, it makes is bushy and non-compliant.  For the price, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Augusta hair dresser introduced me to this and it is hard to find in salons around here.  Bought the oil and decided to buy the hair spray and was pleased with both.  Very oily going on, but absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident thinking it was just a spray morrocan oil, so when I got it, I did not expect much. I do use argan oil reguarly so was familiar with base product. I began using it as others have noted (sparingly) and my hair is actually getting better conditioned and it does look and smell great. Hair is noticeably softer and shinier. Will definitely continue to get this with my regular morrocan/ argan oil to supplement it.</li>
            <li> It works for me and I am glad to have found it here.I could not find it where I shop,even though I visited the beauty supplies stores.I like the way it smells and it does shine my hair nicely.The company from which I order the product was real quick to ship ! 3 days for the most !!!!</li>
            <li> A great product.  Used with Moroccanoil Treatment light hair certainly does shine.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very greasy. Think this may be a fake product</li>
            <li> I love this product !!!</li>
            <li> I use this when I flat iron my hair and it works amazing!!! I was using chi iron straight 44 or Matrix straight before and those made my hair \\&quot;chrispy\\&quot; and brittle.  also the previous porducts guncked up my hair straightner.  I really love the morocan oil gold glimmer shine oil.  It has a really really fine mist so its dosnt make your hair greasy......trust me, I have fine blonde hair!!! It sprays in a very fine mist. I love that!!! Someone said in one review that it \\&quot;sprayed hard onto your head\\&quot; but thats not the case at all. It&#x27;s almost less than an areosol mist. You can bresly see it coming out weh you spray it because the droplets are so fine. Anyways, its perfect for you if you flat iron your hair and dont want frizzy, dry hair. It makes your hair really shinny and young looking.  Excellent product!!! Money well spent!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it provides a lot of shine, but it does provide some. I found another product and it is far better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product.  Compared to the regular Moroccan Oil it is very heavy on your hair. I am going to stick with the regular oil as it makes my hair shine better than this spray.</li>
            <li> I love the moroccan oil treatment, so of-course i&#x27;m going to love love love this. its just easy and a great alternative to a hair balm, it makes your hair supper shinny and it smells great. Love it.. recommended to all types of hair! its just perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a very good frizz control spray. The smell is a little different and weird compared to the original Moroccanoil but it&#x27;s tolerable. I would recommend the original Moroccanoil over this Shimmer Spray, but if you want something cheaper, go with this.</li>
            <li> Nice glimmer shine spray</li>
            <li> the atomizer was broken</li>
            <li> On a whim, I purchased this product. My hair is colored, so it sometimes looks dull. This product is a good one to restore the shine. You have to be careful in overuse, because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have thick, wavy/curly hair and I will try to go for as long as possible without washing it. The issue with that is, it will start to look dried out at the ends--especially when styled with heat. After 1-2 days of not washing my hair I&#x27;ll spray the ends with glimmer shine and it makes it looks super healthy and smells fantastic! A must have for anyone who goes more than a couple days without washing.</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller.  Super fast shipping, loving my new gold slimmer shine by moroccanoil!  Leaves my hair shiny and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Imparted no shine to hair. Very very strong smell as indicated in countless other reviews- Listen to them!&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be using product.</li>
            <li> I have alopecia areata a condition where my hair falls. The hair that does not fall is coarse and lackluster. This oil makes my hair shinny vigorous. I love it!</li>
            <li> Just like the styling cream, I love the MoroccanOil scent. This product gives a bit of extra smoothing and shimmer to coarse hair, but you have to be very careful not to use too much. My best results have come from spraying one shot on my hand, rubbing my hands together, and then smoothing them down my hair. I use my fingers then to smooth the ends. Too much, and your hair will immediately look like you&#x27;ve dipped it in cooking oil.</li>
            <li> Works well and does leave shiny, but left my hair feeling and looking too oily . Would recommend for someone with dry hair, not fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day on my thick, curly hair. Be sure to follow the directions and leave the product on for a few minutes before combing or brushing it into your hair. It makes all the difference. The scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give the shine I was hoping for</li>
            <li> No glitter in it but I figured as much from reading other reviews.  More oily feeling than regular Moroccan oil when used daily.  I use it on humid days or before pool/beach outings.  One or two sprays are OK for daily use on me without too much weigh down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &#x27;glimmer&#x27; hair products but this one delivers.  Hair catches the light, looks wonderful.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I use to use ths in Europe and i loved it ;i tryed to find it here but with no  luck ;then i went to Amazon and i found it there ;bought it ;it makes your hair very soft and shinny and the smell ;well i really don;t think it smells at all .&lt;br /&gt;Now the only problem i had was when i recieved it li tryed to spray and it would not work i had oil coming out of the top of the bottle and down the sides ;but appart form that ;i went out and found a plastic bottle and it worked ;but this oil is wonderful ;and i really mean it ;i even use it on my legs and arms ;and face ,Now you don;t need a lot a little goes a long way ;this is a must try ;i just love this so much ;well after all it is Marrocan oil as i call it ;and anything form Marroco is always good .</li>
            <li> love this for my hair</li>
            <li> Love this product.Works very well.</li>
            <li> Temporary shine then stickiness</li>
            <li> This is not a big aid for everyone, as it is a good product only for certain types of hair, specially the already straight ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair, so this works for me for shine, but my mom, who has dyed hair, did not like this, as it didn&#x27;t do anything for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a bit difficult to apply: it asks for a certain distance from the hair, so when trying to apply on the back of the head, that makes it hard to aim the spray on the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this for hair that is already quite healthy and shiny, as it&#x27;s far from a miracle worker and can make other types of hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells sooooo good!</li>
            <li> I love the Moroccanoil products!  I have naturally curly hair and always fight with the curls, frizz, fly-away hair.  The glimmer shine works wonderfully to moisturize my hair, but not so much it weighs it down.  My hair is healthier since using it!</li>
