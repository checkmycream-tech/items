            <li>Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed with the service from this seller!</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly, and I see no difference from the filters I received when I was issued the CPAP.  </li>
            <li>This item worked perfectly with my CPAP machine.  </li>
            <li>Great price for the mask.  </li>
            <li>The quality was also great.  </li>
            <li>thx for this its great</li>
            <li>Stock up on these when they are at a great price.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful filters and they fit very nicely in my Cpap machine!  </li>
            <li>They fit well and work great.</li>
            <li>I received these very quickly!</li>
            <li>however I was able to make it work.  </li>
            <li>but i dont know what else to say too many words.</li>
            <li>ok ok ok ok..</li>
            <li>These are slightly different than the ones that came with my machine, but they seem to work great!</li>
            <li>As described.&lt;br /&gt;The requirement for 18 or more words will make me stop doing the reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t pay very much for them.</li>
            <li>so I am sure they will work fine.</li>
            <li>They work OK but the original units that came witht he CPAP were a touch better fit.</li>
            <li>Everything was factory fit for my M machine.  </li>
            <li>I will cut and make them fit for spares or disgaurd them at that time I want to</li>
            <li>So make sure it&#x27;s the right one for you</li>
            <li>keep the air clean in the machine.</li>
            <li>When the insurance stooped paying for the original unit and wanted a huge copay for a new one, we started looking for all the parts.</li>
            <li>enough to last for a year, these are very well priced and are better than what originally came with unit, Too good of a deal to pass up.</li>
            <li>Was the right size had to use both foam ..</li>
            <li>These are the exact thing we needed.</li>
            <li>but i was able to cut it down to size to fit</li>
            <li>Plugged right into my Older Respironics CPAP machine.  </li>
            <li>Having the fine pollen filters was a plus for the springtime when we sleep with windows open!</li>
            <li>The size of the filter was to big to fit my machine</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m particular</li>
            <li>I high recommend these.</li>
            <li>These air filters are a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>( THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT FROM THE EXACT SAME MANUFACTURE)  </li>
            <li>They are just like my old one</li>
            <li>A F T E R. my Blue Cross - Blue Shield paid their part,  my share at my medical supply store was ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH as what I paid for these WITHOUT using my insurance.</li>

            <li> it is to small and not quite useful and Amazon screwed my order what esle new - not happy with them once again</li>
            <li> Between the dust and pollen this filter really catches the very small stuff that gets beyond the foam filter.</li>
            <li> I  would definitely recommend these filters to other Cpap  users!</li>
            <li> A fraction of the cost from the medical supply house, and less than just my &amp;#34;co-pay&amp;#34; from insurance.</li>
            <li> The foam filters were as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other filters and ended up trimming them.  </li>
            <li> These  filters are the wrong size--much too large for my machine.  </li>
            <li> Not worth returning</li>
            <li> and I will have to cut them down</li>
            <li> My machine has has wider rectangular filters, these were too narrow.  </li>
            <li> I order this for Rem Star C Flex CPAP machine, but the filters were too small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say about it.</li>
            <li> I only get that talkative when something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Size was not clear and was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, these little suckers are hard to find!</li>
            <li> Poor and deceptive.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the size was unclear from the description.</li>

            <li> it is to small and not quite useful and Amazon screwed my order what esle new - not happy with them once again</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my CPAP machine,  along with an extra hose,  facemask and gel nose piece. I had been buying the products from my medical supply store. ( THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT FROM THE EXACT SAME MANUFACTURE)  A F T E R. my Blue Cross - Blue Shield paid their part,  my share at my medical supply store was ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH as what I paid for these WITHOUT using my insurance. Makes sense to buy the same product here and save money.</li>
            <li> I order this for Rem Star C Flex CPAP machine, but the filters were too small.  My machine has has wider rectangular filters, these were too narrow.  It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t pay very much for them.</li>

            <li> Plugged right into my Older Respironics CPAP machine.  A fraction of the cost from the medical supply house, and less than just my &amp;#34;co-pay&amp;#34; from insurance.</li>
            <li> Received two foam filters but not pollen filters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size was not clear and was wrong.  No contact information.  Poor and deceptive.</li>
            <li> When the insurance stooped paying for the original unit and wanted a huge copay for a new one, we started looking for all the parts. These are the exact thing we needed.</li>
            <li> keep the air clean in the machine. I just use them all the time. thank you for asking keep them around.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my husband&#x27;s cpap. They fit well and work great. The eliminate dust and allergens from entering the unit and damaging it.</li>
            <li> Great price for the mask.  The quality was also great.  The filter was not the correct filter for my machine however I was able to make it work.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> thx for this its great but i dont know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, these little suckers are hard to find! Stock up on these when they are at a great price. I do not change mine enough and when I do, I notice a big improvement in my breathing.</li>
            <li> enough to last for a year, these are very well priced and are better than what originally came with unit, Too good of a deal to pass up.</li>
            <li> These air filters are a high quality product.You need to protect your machine as you do your vehicle &amp; furnace by changing the air filters when needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sneeze at night, so I suppose it does its job.  I&#x27;m not sure what else to say about it.</li>
            <li> These are slightly different than the ones that came with my machine, but they seem to work great! I would order these again.</li>
            <li> As described.&lt;br /&gt;The requirement for 18 or more words will make me stop doing the reviews. I only get that talkative when something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> They work OK but the original units that came witht he CPAP were a touch better fit. I think they do the job but I&#x27;m particular</li>
            <li> Was the right size had to use both foam .. So make sure it&#x27;s the right one for you respiratory</li>
            <li> The size of the filter was to big to fit my machine but i was able to cut it down to size to fit</li>
            <li> These  filters are the wrong size--much too large for my machine.  I am disappointed that the size was unclear from the description.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with the service from this seller! I received these very quickly! These are wonderful filters and they fit very nicely in my Cpap machine!  I  would definitely recommend these filters to other Cpap  users!</li>
            <li> these looked like the correct filter but when they came they were twice as big and I will have to cut them down</li>
            <li> Everything was factory fit for my M machine.  Just what I wanted!  I&#x27;ve purchased other filters and ended up trimming them.  No need with this set.  Having the fine pollen filters was a plus for the springtime when we sleep with windows open!</li>
            <li> This is a simple replacement part for my Respironics One CPAP.  It fits perfectly, and I see no difference from the filters I received when I was issued the CPAP.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use the product yet.  They are just like my old one so I am sure they will work fine.</li>
            <li> This item worked perfectly with my CPAP machine.  I will definitely make future purchases of this item because of the lower price compared to using my insurance &amp; going through a DME company!</li>
            <li> I never received the pollen filters. The foam filters were as expected.  I thought maybe I only ordered the foam filters and realized I should have received both types when I was asked to review my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning I will cut and make them fit for spares or disgaurd them at that time I want to</li>
