            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the best lip product for along time and have tried literally dozens.</li>
            <li>and my lips looked great.</li>
            <li>I dont know about the anti aging benefits, but it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells great and stays put as I sleep.</li>
            <li>Smells great and goes on smooth!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>Even though I really liked it, I probably will not purchase again.  </li>
            <li>This is really the best one.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective lip cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lip products, and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My lips have never been better.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps:)</li>
            <li>I have tried more lip products than I can count.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product and it did smooth out and soften my lips</li>
            <li>/&gt;I really love it.</li>
            <li>In the end, it&#x27;s the moisturizing effect that had me buying two more.</li>
            <li>I have read some posts about the greasy look and this is true</li>
            <li>Lipstick stays on all day and lips look full and luscious.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Lost bottle right after purchase but the first couple days seemed like worked well</li>
            <li>I am a lip conditioner junkie, and never have found anything that helps dry lips until this product which is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love all of the Theraderm products but this lip complex is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Prior to applying your lipstick, pat your lips with your fingers first to spread evenly around, then dab a little bit of foundation or cover up then apply or blot with compact and you will great results.</li>
            <li>Lipstick goes on so much smoother now.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>It leaves your lips soft and moistened without being greasy ,reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and actually plumps the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Twice daily seems about right</li>
            <li>I recently wore bright red lipstick and following the above directions is did not bleed</li>
            <li>This is the first product that has actually helped.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Before I moved to a super dry climate this stuff really seemed to help make my lips fuller and smoother, now my lips are unfortunately not as full.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s working to smooth out lip lines, but it takes such a long time to dry that you can&#x27;t put lipstick on evenly for quite a while.</li>
            <li>You may not experience the same problem, so don’t let the fact that my item was half full alter your decision to purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I barely used it and it is gone.  </li>
            <li>This left my lips undeniably soft.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by the initial amount of plump.</li>
            <li>This is to be expected when there is no moisture in the air, so it&#x27;s back on the hunt for something that works here, without getting injections and looking like the Real Housewives of Duck City.</li>

            <li> It finally healed with a steroid cream from the dermatologist, but it left my lip very sensitive and thin.  </li>
            <li> Glides on and is great all day as a base and as a way to gloss up a fav lip pencil!</li>
            <li> My lips have a pink color again and I can wear lip gloss without irritation.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first however I have been using this product for 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped for miracles but the lines are still there, just less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but it seems that my item was not full.  </li>
            <li> All though I don&#x27;t have a lot of lines, it has helped with the few lines I do have.</li>
            <li> It actually dried them out instead.</li>
            <li> Worthless, and such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> As a result of an allergic reaction to medication, I had a chronic painful irritation on my lower lip for several years.  </li>

            <li> softens and moistens my lips over night.  I&#x27;d hoped for miracles but the lines are still there, just less noticeable.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! Smells great and goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first however I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and it works really well. I have read some posts about the greasy look and this is true however I have figured a way around this. Prior to applying your lipstick, pat your lips with your fingers first to spread evenly around, then dab a little bit of foundation or cover up then apply or blot with compact and you will great results. Lipstick stays on all day and lips look full and luscious. I recently wore bright red lipstick and following the above directions is did not bleed and my lips looked great. I will definitely order again. Hope this helps:)</li>
            <li> This is the most effective lip cream I have ever used. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I&#x27;d rather spend my money on something that works.</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s working to smooth out lip lines, but it takes such a long time to dry that you can&#x27;t put lipstick on evenly for quite a while. Also, it leaves a sheen on my upper lip that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Wow! Worth the purchase. Glides on and is great all day as a base and as a way to gloss up a fav lip pencil!</li>
            <li> I dont know about the anti aging benefits, but it is a great conditioner. Twice daily seems about right</li>

            <li> Did not do anything for my lips. It actually dried them out instead. So dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This left my lips undeniably soft. There was a tingle and I was surprised by the initial amount of plump. In the end, it&#x27;s the moisturizing effect that had me buying two more. Smells great and stays put as I sleep.</li>
