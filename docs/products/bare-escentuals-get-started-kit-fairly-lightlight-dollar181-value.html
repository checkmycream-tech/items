            <li>The mineral veil also keeps away shine and is the perfect compliment to the foundation.  </li>
            <li>As I said, go see a dermatologist or use what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But best of all, my birthmark is gone.  </li>
            <li>what a great age to be!  </li>
            <li>I started using this after my best friend purchased it</li>
            <li>This provides the best coverage she has had and does not clog her pores like liquid foundations.      </li>
            <li>The brushes are awesome!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>(I have very fair skin)</li>
            <li>I am a very fair skinned woman, who has had no luck with liquid or mousse foundations.</li>
            <li>In addition, it made my face incredibly shiny.</li>
            <li>Good Luck if you purchase this!</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the results, so I went out and got my own supplies!!  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER seen my skin look so beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The brushes included in the starter kit are high-quality and work great.  </li>
            <li>I feel great just putting this on.</li>
            <li>This kit is great because of its value.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are perfect and you get two shades of foundation which is nice</li>
            <li>The kit is great for starters.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my mom and it didn&#x27;t look so great</li>
            <li>In the set you will receive a video with some great tips on how to apply it.  </li>
            <li>All my friends use this and they look great</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I tried this make-up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It looks great on her and covers any skin issues she may have.  </li>
            <li>The value of this product is great.</li>
            <li>and it looks great...</li>
            <li>Mine came with the handy buki brush, max coverage concealer brush and the flawless face brush.  </li>
            <li>I also worried that some of the reviewers said it was great if you already have great skin, but not otherwise.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great.  </li>
            <li>Another great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to block my pores -</li>
            <li>a great plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It can be buffed off to some extent, but the results aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>I found a make-up that doesn&#x27;t feel like make-up, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, stays on, and covers a great deal of my acne and scars.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I tried this make-up</li>
            <li>makes me look &amp; feel great.  </li>
            <li>Because they are in powder form, they come off quicker and the coverage isn&#x27;t as great as a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>You can wear this makeup all day and it still looks great</li>
            <li>Their products are as great as they advertise.</li>
            <li>It puts on the powder eyeshadow quickly, great coverage.      </li>
            <li>The instructional DVD is a great help and you will be amazed at how versatile all of the additional products are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be amazed and happy that you did.  </li>
            <li>The instructional DVD is a great help and you will be amazed at how versatile all of the additional products are.   </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be amazed and happy that you did.  </li>
            <li>Mineral Veil is really great.  </li>
            <li>and he thinks it makes my skin look great, too.  </li>
            <li>and he thinks it makes my skin look great, too.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>so i use the fairly light powder &amp; it works!!!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, My best girlfriend got me hooked.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks good and I am quite happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>then the \\&quot;expert\\&quot; put eyebrow pencil on--yes just pencil--and raved about the remarkable improvement, and showed the \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; close-ups.  </li>
            <li>What I was happy with from the start was that \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; was a good color for me despite being warm instead of neutral.  </li>
            <li>I look like I&#x27;m about to drop, and the coverage is so good that my skin looks calmer in seconds.</li>
            <li>The Fairly Light is the shade that works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>really good (good coverage, no lines, not overly made up).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 and it still looks good</li>
            <li>I bought the fairly light/light.</li>
            <li>With this I have seen that it looks great no matter what kind of lighting I&#x27;m in.  </li>
            <li>If you apply it lightly with a swirling motion with the brush it will apply evenly and flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for your skin, you don&#x27;t feel it</li>
            <li>upper\\&quot; is good do not put over or in your eye area though</li>
            <li>I tried every technique they showed on the DVD...and when those didn&#x27;t give great results I tried techniques of my own.    </li>
            <li>I recommend those if you&#x27;re looking for good coverage and a good finish (depending on your skin color).</li>
            <li>Provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>are good too.</li>
            <li>I used it just as instructed on the video, and had fairly good results.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a makeup that wouldn&#x27;t fade throughout the day, On a good day</li>
            <li>While some of the products are good, the combination in a kit form is not a \\&quot;one-size-fits-all\\&quot; solution.    </li>
            <li>The coverage of the foundation, however, is good if you like a matte finish.    </li>
            <li>It gives a good finish when used with a concealer</li>
            <li>This is good, but not it.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li>Mineral Veil does a good job of hiding the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>With this I have seen that it looks great no matter what kind of lighting I&#x27;m in.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks gorgeous</li>
            <li>I suppose, if you have oily skin, then this product would be good for you.</li>
            <li>would be a great starter kit for someone whose skin isn&#x27;t super-fair and has neutral to warm skintones.  </li>
            <li>It looked so good</li>
            <li>If you have even lighter skin than this kit allows for, you can order the FAIR foundation to compliment this kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lightness of the product is fascinating and you feel as if you are not wearing foundation.</li>
            <li>The kits are a good way to introduce your skin to the products because they include the brushes you need to apply this powdery foundation.</li>
            <li>Get Started Kit with the Fair foundation</li>
            <li>Get Started Kit with the Fair foundation</li>
            <li>When I tried covering the breakouts the colors were way to orange for my fair skin tone.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fair, the \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot;</li>
            <li>this really is a good deal.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to put on and makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li>included in the kit:  Flawless Application Brush, Full Coverage Kabuki Brush, Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush, Mineral Veil and Warmth All Over Face Color.  </li>
            <li>The brushes in this kit are luxurious and include the Full Coverage Kabuki, Flawless Face and Max Coverage Concealer Brush.</li>
            <li>Nothing is perfect but Bare Minerals is honestly the closest my face has ever looked to flawless and as soon as the moisture in my skin is restored I will return to using it.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed the first time I tried this makeup!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to be introduced to this line of cosmetics at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I think I experienced most if not all of the problems that users have written about here.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say I LOVE these items.</li>
            <li>In fact when I run out, I&#x27;ll probably get another starter kit instead of just ordering the powder foundation just to get more brushes!</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>You will be so glad you did!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this makeup! &lt;</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>(Make sure you swirl tap buff!</li>
            <li>I do have some redness that I need to even out and was excited that the demo DVD showed a girl with acne scarring and skin discoloration because I thought that if it makes her skin look good, I should be in great shape.    </li>
            <li>I will be &amp; have been buying more of the BE products!</li>
            <li>I also love about the kit is you get warmth!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did!    </li>
            <li>I just bought the Get Started Kit this weekend, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars, though, and writing my first review on Amazon, because I am so impressed with how it feels and how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants to look like the peasant girls in the movies who look like they woke up looking naturally beautiful and have people comment that YOU look beautiful, this make-up is for you.   </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hide my freckles....which I LOVE!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I still use my Corn Silk powder to top it all off (a must for people with oily skin!), but even without my Corn Silk</li>
            <li>If this can make me feel beautiful, confident and feminine all over again then it can help anyone :) &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>best part about this makeup is how light it feels, how easily it comes off with my face wash</li>
            <li>The concealer brush is amazing and does a great job at covering fine lines and concealing blemishes.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but the light works great</li>
            <li>the price this is an amazing kit.  </li>
            <li>It provides amazing coverage</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>This kit is an amazing value.</li>
            <li>you already own this product and you have oily skin and your skin still seems to have excess oil try putting on the Mineral Veil once before the foundation, once after, then again after you apply warmth.</li>
            <li>I especially love the \\&quot;bisque\\&quot; (concealer) because it covers up my acne very well.  </li>
            <li>Good luck :)</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product and was thrilled by the results.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I have a nice texture to my skin.    </li>
            <li>Also, invest in your own brushes.</li>
            <li>Results: really liked the feel and look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started trying some of their eye shadows too and they are quite nice as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit because I thought it would be nice to have a mineral-based makeup.  </li>
            <li>They have a fantastic selection of shades, I use fairly light, and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, in the beginning, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>It does look nice on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and you just have nice skin.</li>
            <li>I also really liked the mineral veil</li>
            <li>The kit comes with brushes also, which really feel wonderfully calming on my face.</li>
            <li>had no idea that powder could give me this kind of coverage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is nice, but the \\&quot;mineral veil\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Handy Buki</li>
            <li>like the bristles go into the pores of my skin and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Handy Buki brush.    </li>
            <li>and the warmth does a nice job as eyeshadow, although i am tempted to buy their eye kit too.  </li>
            <li>It goes on quick and looks beautiful all day.  </li>
            <li>It is light and very easy to use, anyone can look great even if you have always sucked at putting on makeup (like me).</li>
            <li>colors are excellent for my light, cool toned skin....</li>
            <li>No make-up can provide the miracle of flawless skin, but Bare Minerals provides good coverage...</li>
            <li>The coverage was great and it was easy to use; I was extremely pleased with the results for about four days.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I would recommend this if you truly want *full* coverage, but for a you-only-better look, I think this is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warmth is an awesome product; as long as you don&#x27;t use any more than about a pinhead, you come out looking sunkissed and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and really do a wonderful job of tucking the powder in and then buffing it into my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to overuse.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem to fall out very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad I did!  </li>
            <li>For one, like others with very fair skin, I needed the Fair color foundation and Bare Escentuals doesn&#x27;t make a</li>
            <li>For one, like others with very fair skin, I needed the Fair color foundation and Bare Escentuals doesn&#x27;t make a</li>
            <li>If you can learn to use the smallest possible amount, it&#x27;s ok, but not that great for very fair skin.    </li>
            <li>The warmth, also, gave me a glow that I&#x27;ve never been able to duplicate with blush, and it&#x27;s just absolutely amazing.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good mineral make up, I recommend J. Lynne instead (available through their website).</li>
            <li>All my blemishes and redness were cover more effectively than my Clinque makeup had done.</li>
            <li>It is light feeling, good for all skin types and does not cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li>like i have nothing on so natural and so beautiful buy this!!</li>
            <li>The upside being that by purchasing the Fairly Light/Light Kit I can use the Fairly Light in the summer when my color darkens a bit or if I go tanning.  </li>
            <li>The upside being that by purchasing the Fairly Light/Light Kit I can use the Fairly Light in the summer when my color darkens a bit or if I go tanning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it may not look great right away</li>
            <li>Same thing with the eyeliner, I just use an avon brush and it gives a perfect line sure to never smudge!</li>
            <li>have never in my life gotten so many compliments on how beautiful my skin is -- and it really isn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>so make sure to use a good light when u put it on</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it looks great and feels great, because you cannot feel it!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that this makeup lasts longer than others, but the great thing about it is that you can reapply right over the top of the existing makeup</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals (Essentials) makeup has to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals is the perfect mix between the two.  </li>
            <li>my skin was perfectly matte after applying the Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>Bare escentuals has become my best friend when it comes to imperfections.  </li>
            <li>I had a make over using Bare Minerals and am so absolutely impressed.  </li>
            <li>If I am not sweating, the makeup stays great, but it&#x27;s not practicle, and I find myself being weary to wear it if I might be in a situation to sweat, which sort of defeats the purpose of owning the makeup in the first place.      </li>
            <li>An instruction guide/how-to brochure and DVD is also included to get you on your way to becoming your own makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My problem with make-up has always been that it looks great for the first hour that I put it on and then literally slides off me throughout the day (</li>
            <li>The powder accentuates my fine wrinkles (and lo and behold, I have more than I thought I did!)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look very smooth.</li>
            <li>I think the application is very very important and will affect how you&#x27;ll look.</li>
            <li>Feels very light.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin and a touch of rosacea.  </li>
            <li>If you like this kit I also recommend the crown jewels kit which comes with some great eye brushes and the best black liner powder plus a bunch of other awesome products.  </li>
            <li>Feels better too.</li>
            <li>It was five times the size of the one that comes in the kit and cost $25 which was much better than spending $50 for a refill of the kit when all I needed was the foundation.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and only wish that I had purchased it sooner.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a makeup that stayed on almost all day.  </li>
            <li>They refund your money if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, and for some ladies it may not be the magic cure.  </li>
            <li>I love this product; been using it for a couple of months &amp; it rocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bareMinerals foundation is much better for my skin type than liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to get the brushes too, and not just but the foundation.</li>
            <li>one more thing...</li>
            <li>The coverage is awesome, and sheer.  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t tried the bisque conclearer yet, but I am ordering some) and my face is more even-toned and matte, without looking powdery.  </li>
            <li>I also love the built in sunscreen.   </li>
            <li>I use moisturizer in the morning and put everything in this kit on top of that</li>
            <li>I also love that I can&#x27;t feel it on my face and at the end of the day it is still there.</li>
            <li>so I just gave up and wore blush and eye shadow for most of the years I have been wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>The Light will be nice to incorporate in the summer when I have a tan.</li>
            <li>I love the Mineral Veil and the Warmth too.</li>
            <li>I love it, but with everything it is not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>most companies offer women.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the need for it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to look more polished</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>You cannot find a better deal out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so sheer yet provides great coverage!  </li>
            <li>and I just love the mineral veil and the barevitamins.  </li>
            <li>sincerely reccomend that, before you purchase this set, you find a Sephora where you can give it a try and make sure that it&#x27;s what you want it to be.  </li>
            <li>Like most women I have tried every type of makeup on the market.</li>
            <li>Even the powder makeup used by many of the makeup artists felt like I was wearing mud.  </li>
            <li>Okay you get the picture.</li>
            <li>Also apply soooooooooo lightly that you can&#x27;t even believe you are applying anything at all!  </li>
            <li>and it makes it for the most part throughout the workout.</li>
            <li>The mineral veil is ok, I don&#x27;t always use it.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I wear eye shawdow, liner, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently works for many, but not everybody.</li>
            <li>I have glowing, healthy looking skin and my blemishes are well covered.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you watch the video</li>
            <li>I love it because it provides coverage without making me look like a mannequin.  </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t linger (unless I just got used to it), and it&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not a smell</li>
            <li>I love the Kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed when I was not wearing it that my face had a healthy glow to it that hadn&#x27;t been there for years.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of the things I love about it is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all, and yet my face looks radiant</li>
            <li>Who knows, it may become your favorite too...</li>
            <li>To me,  BE is like a magic trick in a jar</li>
            <li>You just look better  :)</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I don&#x27;t regret that I bought the kit, since I&#x27;ve been able to experience mineral foundations for myself</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for me now, but it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how the tiniest bit of powder could give me such great coverage!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products.  </li>
            <li>but I felt that it also made the wrinkles I have stand out more.</li>
            <li>I gave them to my sister and friend, who love them, and I bought [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love the spf 15 (For better, waterproof sun-protection</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Veil - I love this powder because it isn&#x27;t colored.  </li>
            <li>in \\&quot;Glee,\\&quot; which I use more as a blush than an all-over face color.  </li>
            <li>Pros - I absolutely love this make-up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I love a lot of things about this makeup, but it is not quite the miracle worker they claim it it.  </li>
            <li>Things I love about it:  </li>
            <li>I have to make sure to wash it off every night and use an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product looks and feels</li>
            <li>I never thought that I would be able to ween myself away from liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>Artist in you will love the way you apply this makeup.</li>
            <li>Each container of powder has many possibilities.</li>
            <li>You can blend more warmth or add a touch of summer shimmer.</li>
            <li>items I&#x27;ve enjoyed:  &lt;br</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>He said, \\&quot;I absolutely love the finish, but you need to learn how to put in on better.  </li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t yet mastered using the concealer brush, so maybe as I get better, I&#x27;ll be able to cover up</li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t yet mastered using the concealer brush, so maybe as I get better, I&#x27;ll be able to cover up more.</li>
            <li>It softens and mattes the appearance of shine and makes it look healthy and glowing, not shiny.</li>
            <li>I say this if it works for you - more power to you -, but it just didnt do it for me.</li>
            <li>I was pleased by this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I love buying everything online</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this make-up (and I&#x27;ve never said that about a cosmetic product before).  </li>
            <li>it is an okay product</li>
            <li>The point is ,B. Minerals is JUST POWDER.NO MAGICAL PROPERTIES,BUT I guess you could use it to flour a cake pan!I gave it one star</li>
            <li>With so many infomercials, I had to try this product.  </li>
            <li>When you see the informmerical you think, right, sure powder can provide flawless coverage, but it really does.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it at first, but once I got used to it, I fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>You will get a beautiful, natural result!</li>
            <li>However, for very fair skinned ladies like myself even the fairly light/light is a tad dark.</li>
            <li>However, they are light and airy and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t cover up blemishes as well as a liquid might, but the payoff is that the rest of my skin looks absolutely amazing, so I don&#x27;t mind the one blemish that might not be covered.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I wish they had more kits available with MORE brushes, so you can continue to get more deals.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel natural and beautiful</li>
            <li>Surprisingly the conceler brush really did cover up my blemishes!</li>
            <li>in the end a pretty good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect foundation for a long time, one that will give me that airbrushed look.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t learn anything new, but it might be great if you&#x27;ve never worn makeup before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair-skinned (probably more on the pink than yellow-toned side), and this kit was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>It gives great coverage, is easy to put on and feels so much better than my old liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any make up at all, and I think that having 90% amazing skin and not feeling masky is worth having a zit or two not covered up as well.  </li>
            <li>The colors are brilliant and last all day!!  </li>
            <li>Many places that sell this product will give a free demonstration on how to apply the makeup and which foundation you should use as a concealer and which you should use as your all-over foundation.</li>
            <li>I bought the \\&quot;Fairly Light kit\\&quot; at the store, it was 15.00 more (75.00) but in addtion you get the compact 25.00 and highlighter color 20.00.</li>
            <li>The look and coverage was fantastic for the overwhelming weightlessness of the minerals.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves how I look and comments frequently about how my skin looks flawless but not fake.</li>
            <li>Within about 5 months of her telling us how much she loved this product 3 of my cousins, both aunts, and now myself refuse to wear anything else.  </li>
            <li>Use a good moisturizer and dryness shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a new foundation color called \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; that matched my skin much better than the \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and if you do not normally have sensitive skin, ENJOY, because it does have great flawless coverage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just love a product very often, but I love this one!</li>
            <li>The coverage is very nice and soft....</li>
            <li>I purchased this starter kit because I was excited about the idea of being able to sleep in this makeup.  </li>
            <li>The minerals are so light they don&#x27;t have to, they just have to be close, and your original skin tone does the rest! &lt;</li>
            <li>I can understand the instruction for the eye makeup (which isn&#x27;t included in this kit anyway), but the foundation is really, really easy.  </li>
            <li>I once spilled some warmth on my counter top and was pulling up the color for days every time I would clean up the area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The manual (plus the 98734 million commercials on tv) makes it really easy to use.    </li>
            <li>Just wanted to put my two cents in and say that I have a fair complexion, and dry sensitive skin, yet I look excellent in this make-up.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it is so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>They come off easily...</li>
            <li>It will rub off easy though, being that it&#x27;s a powder.  </li>
            <li>It really is just amazing - it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>Like many people mentioned, I had to blend the light and fairly light foundation to get it to match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The free feeling and the beautiful complexion you achieve through the use of Bare Escentuals may make you want to try all their products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, covers well, and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make-up at all.  </li>
            <li>I used the skin tone matching system available on the Bare Escentuals site, and having fair skin with golden undertones, the site suggested I get the Fairly Light/Light kit.  </li>
            <li>It is a great way to introduce yourself to the Bare Escentuals line of makeup products.  </li>
            <li>Warmth is wonderful, at first I used it only as a blush, now I use it as a blush, eyeshadow and I mix it in with rose balm for a warmth colored gloss, I have really fallen in love with the matching color thing.  </li>
            <li>I normally have good skin with no acne.  </li>
            <li>This is the best foundation that I have ever used - hand&#x27;s down.  </li>
            <li>It comes in powder form so its easy to apply with the brushes, but it goes on smooth like liquid.  </li>
            <li>The brushes in the kit were fine.</li>
            <li>But over-all I just don&#x27;t think it is ideal for dry skin.</li>
            <li>But the powder went on just fine</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, it is very oily, and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many types of foundations and the Bare Minerals is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot; and \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundations in this kit were both too dark and too warm (yellow/orange undertones) for me, but I love the way the foundation wears.  </li>
            <li>The powder is great, but this color absolutely did not work for me; it was way too dark and looked brownish-orange on my skin, but it looks great on the friend I gave it to.  </li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth the clean up and the learning curve because it really will make you look fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>but because I have less than perfect skin I don&#x27;t feel comfortable going without it.</li>
            <li>It is cool, light, refreshing, feels great, and smooths the skin prior to makeup application.</li>
            <li>If you like more of a natural look and can&#x27;t do more than a five-minute morning, this product will do the trick!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be of excellent quality and value because you need to use so little of it.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair and have pink cheeks or ruddy skin.  </li>
            <li>The huge pores on my nose are invisible, the circles under my eyes are gone.  </li>
            <li>also, the fairly light and light are not that light.</li>
            <li>have a light skin</li>
            <li>My skin looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Fairly light was to light</li>
            <li>A light dab before makeup application gives a smooth surface on which to apply the foundation.  </li>
            <li>I invested my money in this product and thought that it would be fantastic.</li>
            <li>Having worked in front of a camera I believed having a perfect complexion meant heavy feeling makeup.</li>
            <li>You need to go lightly with this otherwise you can see the powder on your face.  </li>
            <li>A friend and I both bought the light/fairly light kit.  </li>
            <li>I use not only this kit, but also the Well Rested Bisque, which is a really great cover up tool.</li>
            <li>Just a light application covered and made a matte complexion.</li>
            <li>For me, the best way to use powdered makeup is to moisturize well and then wait a few minutes before applying makeup.    </li>
            <li>If your face is \\&quot;sticky,\\&quot; the makeup does not go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Feels light on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I found the fairly light shade to be too light for me and gave a whitish cast and was told I could use it as a concealer or to brighten the undereye area.  </li>
            <li>I am told several times that I have lost weight, lol not an ounce.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 months ago the FAIR/FAIRLY LIGHT starter kit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just completed four months of using the B.E. light/fairly light kit.</li>
            <li>The kit includes a product called \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot;, which for light skin, should be called \\&quot;overwhelming\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is lighter than the Fairly Light and Light foundations.</li>
            <li>The Fairly Light seems to work for me, but having an even lighter shade is helpful in the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This kit includes the Mineral Veil, Fairly Light and Light Foundation.</li>
            <li>If you order the basic kit and like it, Sephora also has \\&quot;beauty at any age\\&quot; kits by decade that are a great value for add-ons.</li>
            <li>love looking at my skin when I&#x27;m wearing this make up, and my hubby says that it is completely worth the money</li>
            <li>love looking at my skin when I&#x27;m wearing this make up, and my hubby says that it is completely worth the money</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about blending the liquid foundation in, or worry about powder or liquid lines at the jaw because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li>The handles are light plastic.</li>
            <li>containers that the minerals come in also feel like cheap plastic...</li>
            <li>The containers that the minerals come in also feel like cheap plastic...</li>
            <li>it is as fabulous as all the informercials say it is.</li>
            <li>have fair, sensitive, combination skin</li>
            <li>But I mastered the technique of applying a different kind of foundation using tools I&#x27;d never used before and am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love the concealer brush; it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>My least favorite brush is the \\&quot;Flawless Face.\\</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with cool undertones (light pink), and this kit didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to watch the instructional DVD that comes with the kit first.</li>
            <li>is quick and easy.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>This kit includes two shades of the light foundation, so you can mix the two and find the perfect shade year round!  </li>
            <li>I first ordered this kit in early spring and wasn&#x27;t too happy until I had some practice at applying it.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, try dusting some of the mineral veil over the oily spots first before applying the foundation then dust another light layer of mineral veil on top of everything for added shine</li>
            <li>I have light acne and it will even cover most of that, just like a liquid or stick concealer, but looks so much more natural!</li>
            <li>I also *love* the Mineral Veil; it&#x27;s a really neat product that adds a great finished look while being totally see through and light.</li>
            <li>on my nose first, then went over it with a circular buffing motion and this made a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product a year ago because a friend was using it.  </li>
            <li>A girl who lived in my apartment building this summer said that her mom had started using Bare Minerals and absolutely loved it, so I went and did some research.    </li>
            <li>I would recommend this kit to anyone, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin and my face will barely have any oil on it by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I loved the feel and application of Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li>After years of struggling with imperfect skin, I tried Bare Escentuals on a whim and have never in my life looked this good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this kit.</li>
            <li>I do Mineral Veil first, then foundation, then the Warmth, then one more touch of Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was recommended to try Bare Escentuals \\&quot;get started\\&quot; kit, in fairly light/light.</li>
            <li>First off, I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty fair and the fairly light was too dark and the light was too light when I put it on with the handy buki brush.  </li>
            <li>When I first started wearing Bare Escentuals, everyone told me how great I looked.  </li>
            <li>In my over twenty years of trying numerous foundations, I have yet to see anything cover and perfect all while allowing the natural radiance of your skin to shine through.</li>
            <li>I read the many positive reviews on this product and rushed out to buy it.</li>
            <li>This makeup is the first I&#x27;ve ever used that goes on easily and looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>When I originally ordered the kit, I tried to justify it by telling myself that when you did the math and divided the cost by the number of products, it really wasn&#x27;t much more than what you would pay at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I was sold when I saw you could get a full refund if you weren&#x27;t satisfied, and purchased my starter kit that very day.    </li>
            <li>I have used the Bare Minerals for about 3 months now and absolutely love it, Mineral Veil has to be some sort of pixie dust - it works magic on my skin.    </li>
            <li>I do not like anything on my face, so I have never been able to wear makeup, but I can wear bare minerals and love to.  </li>
            <li>yet I had a full container of the warmth.</li>
            <li>It has really showed its advantages as the weather is getting more humid.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin and acne scarring with the occasional break out.</li>
            <li>This morning, I used it in place of my Loreal True Match foundation.   </li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne for many years, and this product really covers and helps heal acne and the scars.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin, freckles and red hair.  </li>
            <li>I really believe it does make your skin better over time.</li>
            <li>It does not settle in my crinkles, I am not constantly wiping the excees  out of the lines, it does as good of a job on under eye circles as my stick concealor does, but I am not having to tug and rub my eyes.</li>
            <li>a touch of True over it.  </li>
            <li>Bristles fall out and they are not that soft on the skin, kind of itchy.</li>
            <li>Who really knows for sure what \\&quot;pure\\&quot; minerals it is made from???</li>
            <li>good if you want sheer</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is way too yellow for my skin and the \\&quot;fairly light\\</li>
            <li>The negative thing is that the coverage is not as flawless as advertised on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the amount of drugstore powder that I had to use just to get a good finish, this should definitely save me time and money.    </li>
            <li>I have fair skin, freckles and red hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look &#x27;made up\\&quot;, just a really nice natural.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and my husband tells me that I look very radiant with it on.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had to switch to a more intense moisturizer since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>and I felt like if I smiled my face would \\&quot;crack\\&quot; and my liquid foundation would make me look like an old painting.  </li>
            <li>and I felt like if I smiled my face would \\&quot;crack\\&quot; and my liquid foundation would make me look like an old painting.  </li>
            <li>- have shoeboxes full of make up</li>
            <li>It truely is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Since I have a little acne anyway, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Bare Minerals was the culprit, so I kept using it for a couple more weeks--plus the advertising was so convincing about how good it&#x27;s supposed to be for your skin.  </li>
            <li>first time I used it, I used the swirl-tap-buff method and it was so easy.</li>
            <li>The only problem I ran across is that the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is too dark for my fair skin, and I look sunburned if I use it, so I bought a tub of \\&quot;glee\\&quot; and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>love my new BE kit so much, I could not wait to get some more colors</li>
            <li>The foundation powder really works with your skins natural oils to give a gorgeous glow.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I kept trying because I saw that my skin changed a bit over time and the make up does deliver what they say it will.  </li>
            <li>, I have almost perfect skin, and look ten years younger.</li>
            <li>Finally, the finished product of the whole kit just isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many, many different types of makeup and, although they looked o.k.</li>
            <li>To summarize--great makeup, and super quick to apply.  </li>
            <li>Rev-er Upper - I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this alone, so I&#x27;m glad it came in the kit because I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is super lightweight and has helped take some of the oiliness away from my t-zone.</li>
            <li>You have to put in the time and effort to take care of your skin properly to get the best possible effect.  </li>
            <li>So every day since then I&#x27;ve been getting better, and I always check with him, and he examines my face in natural light.  </li>
            <li>I did a quick wash up,redid my makeup with foundation from my purse &amp; salvaged the evening.</li>
            <li>fairly light would be too light for me, as I am light complected but not pale.</li>
            <li>The Bare Vitamins lotion that comes in this kits is also really nice.</li>
            <li>When the package came in the mail, I was so excited that I actually put it on when I was at work just to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Thought coverage was light at first but found it depends on application and type of brush used.  </li>
            <li>I bought the FAIR foundation a few weeks later &amp; it looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I thought Bare Escentuals was a marketing gimmick to get people buy their products.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d heard so many great reviews from random people in the store going to buy more.</li>
            <li>first thought when I saw the brushes was that they are cheap.</li>
            <li>Looks good and stays on for a long time.  </li>
            <li>i mean ill be honest its not giving me flawless skin but its still great ...</li>
            <li>The makeup itself is great, but since I didn&#x27;t keep half of the products, it wasn&#x27;t a cost-efficient purchase for me.</li>
            <li>But from now on, I&#x27;m a Bare Escentuals girl!having 90% amazing skin and not feeling masky is worth having a zit or two not covered up as well.  </li>
            <li>First let me say it&#x27;s a good product if you have the yellow undertones.   </li>
            <li>I was also very pleased with Bare Escentuals as a foundation because the application time was minimal, it didn&#x27;t feel like makeup and, most importantly, it delivered what it promised:  a smooth glowing complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy and fast to do in the morning, I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing make-up, and</li>
            <li>It is super-lightweight, very natural-looking and feeling, easy to blend, and easy to control how much coverage I want.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I noticed an immediate result the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>After starting with this kit I went on to buy the Beyond the Basics kit, Get Started Eyes, and Brow kit, I LOVE it all!  </li>
            <li>If bought individually, this would cost way more!</li>
            <li>and I love the natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I have been told they cant believe my age because I have no wrinkles, lol not true.</li>
            <li>After starting with this kit I went on to buy the Beyond the Basics kit, Get Started Eyes, and Brow kit, I LOVE it all!  </li>
            <li>but it greatly minimizes them and you are left with a very natural look.  </li>
            <li>I am also very fair complected, and have a hard time finding my shade.  </li>
            <li>I have oily but not broken out skin and fine lines, and some freckles.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin (always buying the lightest foundation shade) that gets very dry in the winter...</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister (along with one of the foundations that didn&#x27;t work); it seemed like a great little brush.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you need a ton of coverage, but it does a great job of covering up redness and uneven tone</li>
            <li>to get this stuff to look smooth on my face, I&#x27;d end up looking like a kabuki girl or something with so much of the power</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t great, but they do the job, I don&#x27;t ever use the kabuku brush because it puts the makeup on waay too heavy for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I think it is absolutely amazing and so different from anything else.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>ALIMA COSMETICS gives a far better range for your skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I found that mixing the light foundation with the Clear Radience helps make the light foundation more pink for those who need it,and setting it with Mineral Veil helps lighten it up even more if you do this.  </li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to and the coverage is natural which is what I came to love.</li>
            <li>For nearly three years I have sold Mary Kay and thought that I would always love their products, but soon found that I could not wear MK foundation with my skin medication.  </li>
            <li>Both shades were warm enough to conceal the redness of my skin.   </li>
            <li>My 61 year old skin never looked better.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but just had to chime in about this product.</li>
            <li>just seemed to settle in lines and didn&#x27;t blend so well, others have mentioned issues with more mature skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I like a more natural look and for some reason I feel too made up with this on, even though it is just a translucent powder.</li>
            <li>I will close by saying this is really worth the sixty dollar price.</li>
            <li>Also, the Mineral Veil is nice and can be used to put finishing touches on any makeup, so that&#x27;s not a total loss either.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;People tell me I look fresh.</li>
            <li>It is well worth purchasing, but takes a lot of practice.</li>
            <li>If all the makeup claims about this product were true, I would (willingly) pay twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this makeup because of the price, but it is worth it</li>
            <li>tells me I can, but the end results of the longer time are worth it in my book.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the trip to get your color matched by a pro.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the trip to get your color matched by a pro.  </li>
            <li>Glee is also really fun, and adds that rosy-happy look to your cheeks.</li>
            <li>Always try to get most of it back through the holes by lightly tapping on the bottom if you have this problem.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to wear foundation before because I always end up looking like a clown because it is so hard to blend the edges and find the right shade for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>All of the imperfections I was self conscious about disappeared with a little dab of the full concealer brush, there were no lines, and although my face will never be flawless (thanks to a number of freckles)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants to look like you have fake airbrushed skin and have people comment that your make-up job is beautiful, then this is not the make-up you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have never ever worn foundation or pressed powders before because the colors never seemed to look right on my skin</li>
            <li>But the biggest problem I have on my face is my birthmark, on the right side of my lower lip.  </li>
            <li>When you put the right color on, your skin will look radiant.</li>
            <li>I think if you have normal/combo skin type and can find the right shade</li>
            <li>This makeup gives me a natural looking flawless finish that I was never able to acheive with liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have never in the past 4 years used anything that cleared my skin and looked so natural and beautiful on!</li>
            <li>colors that come with this kit are very natural and blend easily into my skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I am a Bare Escentuals user for life now!</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals!</li>
            <li>i have never been able to find a lightweight coverage that worked, but bare minerals does!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s very hard to goof up, you don&#x27;t need to be a makeup artist to fake perfect skin.</li>
            <li>They feel fantastic on the skin, and they feel like high quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be a good value for my initial purchase, because you get all the brushes, which are high quality, and you can try the basic products to find which will be most useful for you.  </li>
            <li>I ordered bare minerals about a month ago and LOVE it.   </li>
            <li>I love my Bare Escentuals BareMinerals.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li>I tried Neutrogena mineral sheers ($12) for awhile before I tried the Bare Escentuals, for the money I would have to say it was a better</li>
            <li>I ended up having to purchase the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; foundation separately and mix the fairly light and light with Everyday Minerals colors I already owned to get a color that is appropriate for my face.    </li>
            <li>of the most positive things I can say about this beauty product is that it more uniformly covered my dark circles and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different of course, but I love the stuff and if you can afford to give it a chance I feel it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I also love the BE Club that you can join where they will automatically send you two more foundations in the mail every few months</li>
            <li>and I hadn&#x27;t gotten used to putting it on very fast</li>
            <li>I was really thrilled with how quickly my order was shipped out to me (despite the typical shipping dates and schedules).    </li>
            <li>There is a specific way you need to apply it in order to get the desired results, but you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s so quick and easy to do</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have good skin just a little oily and this product seemed to stick to those areas alot.</li>
            <li>I just wish I had bought it the first time I saw it on TV.  </li>
            <li>was in a hurry during the first week that I was using BE</li>
            <li>I have FINALLY found my magic potion.  </li>
            <li>I did not like it for the first week</li>
            <li>I recently switched to this makeup and love it.</li>
            <li>while my regular foundation ($65, top name brand) faded, creased in the lines around my eyes, and didn&#x27;t cover as well.  </li>
            <li>even my husband&#x27;s eyes lit up when he first saw me wearing it.  </li>
            <li>She asked me if I&#x27;d like to try it, and I said yes; I had seen the info-mercial and was interested in the product.   </li>
            <li>My grandmother first tried this then got both me and my mother hooked on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now and already my skin feels softer and my skin tone appears to be more even.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin looks better without makeup on so whatever is in this makeup is improving my overall skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have clear, smooth skin for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li>you want the first time around.</li>
            <li>I hesitated for months before finally purchasing the Bare Escentuals Get Started Kit - Fairly Light/Light for 2 reasons:  </li>
            <li>Warmth is a bit dark for fair skin but it can be used, albeit very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I first found out about this product from my Aunt who refuses to wear anything else.</li>
            <li>All of the products can be used many different ways.  </li>
            <li>I watched the video first (it is not too long)and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I do have oily skin, so I did not use a moisturizer first, and that seemed to work well for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the starter kit first and adding on from there.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it out</li>
            <li>or you might use too much!</li>
            <li>The first step they tell you is to put on the bareVitamins Rev-upper.  </li>
            <li>(of course, I was using too much at first too.</li>
            <li>For first time buyers, I recommend purchasing one of the get started kits.</li>
            <li>so many competitors out there coming out with the same principle of powder foundation/makeup</li>
            <li>If you are considering buying this kit, you may want to try the foundation first at a Sephora store, like I did.</li>
            <li>after you put it on for the first time, go away from the mirror for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>With daily practice my results have become more uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The warmth and glee colors add a nice bit of color to your face (though I prefer the warmth, the glee is a bit too pink).      </li>
            <li>First, I chose standard shipping (because I&#x27;m cheap), but received it almost immediately!  </li>
            <li>You definitely get a more translucent look with this product than you do with the drugstore brands...</li>
            <li>First, I would like to say you should \\&quot;proceed with caution\\&quot; when watching any infomercial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many different companies who now sell mineral makeup, and even Maybelline or Cover Girl  is now selling it.</li>
            <li>/cleaning my face consistently.  </li>
            <li>I found myself falling in love with the way it made my skin look and feel, and how simple it was to apply!</li>
            <li>I first tried bareMinerals at a friend&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li>The instructional video was very helpful and as I purchase more Bare Minerals products I refer to it often.  </li>
            <li>so i ordered the makeup about two weeks ago and the first day i used it</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this was because the makeup was having an adverse interaction with my face lotions.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately not everything works for everyone.  </li>
            <li>short, I absolutely *love*</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried *a lot*).</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope everyone out there can get the same results as I did.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I&#x27;ll just try some of the eye products at Sephora, first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands and types of foundation but have never found anything I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>is different than most others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more and can&#x27;t wait to try their eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you put on moisturizer and/or the skin revver upper before applying the foundation.    </li>
            <li>For anyone who is interested in trying BE</li>
            <li>It is a must have for a smooth surface to apply bare minerals and it cleared my skin!!!  </li>
            <li>The colors are easy to blend, and you can easily use them with other blushes, bronzers...    5)</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews and seeing most were positive, I finally decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews, but I just had to say that this is a great little product!    </li>
            <li>I can not wear the Warmth, its too red and dark but the Clear Radiance is wonderful.    </li>
            <li>The foundation powders do not yield any coverage remotely close to my skin shade despite the fact that I have fairly light to light skin.  </li>
            <li>The mineral veil puts such a nice soft focus to your skin.  </li>
            <li>first step was to buy the Bare Escentuals Light/Fairly Light starter kit.</li>
            <li>I did buy the clear radiance all over color later and that is really nice.  </li>
            <li>And I used to wear it to coverup all the red spots and blemishes that is not so much the case any more.</li>
            <li>.. looks very natural, and its so clean and gentle that you can sleep in it.  </li>
            <li>This Get Started Kit comes with a DVD to show you how to apply the makeup, but honestly, the foundation is pretty idiot-proof, even for someone like me who&#x27;s not very comfortable with applying makeup.</li>
            <li>it is kind of messy and it takes time to get the look right</li>
            <li>The positive:  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll send the product back because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for foundation, but I think I&#x27;ll shop around a little more before I buy a second time from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll send the product back because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for foundation, but I think I&#x27;ll shop around a little more before I buy a second time from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>I should have guessed that something wasn&#x27;t going to work out quite right when the DVD that came with it showed the CEO of the company looking particularly orange</li>
            <li>The Light is almost too dark for me but the Fairly Light is exactly my skin color.  </li>
            <li>I love every product I have tried and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>, I will probably shop around and see what else is available before I purchase Bare Escentuals again.</li>
            <li>I have fair translucent color skin with dark circles under the eye with dry patches in cheeks, fine lines on forehead and crows feet.</li>
            <li>whole Bare Minerals line, if used correctly, will probably give everyone that soft, natural, beautiful look most people crave but can&#x27;t get from heavy liquids and powders that don&#x27;t ever really match.</li>
            <li>The only negatives that I have are that the brushes, although extremely soft, lose their bristles very easily.  </li>
            <li>and if you are even a hint curious about this product I strongly advise you to order it!</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and find that it won&#x27;t apply well then you probably need to use a better skin cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing regime.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily T zone and it did keep that area dry most days</li>
            <li>i watched the first part of the video, and after about 1 minute putting on the fairly light makeup, i was simply AMAZED.</li>
            <li>I tried traditional liquid foundation once after using Bare Escentuals and I was quickly reminded why I love this makeup so much.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea around my nose, large pores, and I still find myself fighting acne at the age of 35.</li>
            <li>I am not a makeup wearer, largely because I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of it on my face and, no matter what, I always look \\&quot;made up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>It also makes my pores look large.  </li>
            <li>If you have medium to large pores, any blackheads or wrinkles, this product seeps into them.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try Bare Escentuals, and used it for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>loose powder w talc makes me sneeze, regardless of brand - I wanted better options.   </li>
            <li>, it is addicting because everything seems to suit my skin tone extremely well, and if it doesn&#x27;t the first time, it seems if you are creative you can think of a way for it to work for you.  </li>
            <li>I do not look like I have make-up on just really pretty vibrant skin.   </li>
            <li>This one--the Bare Minerals--in particular makes it sound as if EVERY skin problem will be miraclously</li>
            <li>And also, the fairly light color tends to be a little yellowish, so I end up using a lot of light.  </li>
            <li>My face has redness and acne scarring but no one can tell anymore thanks to this make-up.  </li>
            <li>I have so much to say about this product.</li>
            <li>The coverage lasts all day, and by using the mineral veil just once after the initial application my face stays shine free all day, even though I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, it blends very well and doesn&#x27;t appear cakey at all.  </li>
            <li>The trick here is not to put too much  </li>
            <li>Since using bareMinerals, the redness in my skin has been reduced, and I do not break out as much.</li>
            <li>A clear skin day was a rare occurrence.</li>
            <li>but, you have to give it a couple of uses before you really get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>If you have really oily skin</li>
            <li>The dvd with the kit was very informative and taught me everything I needed to know for applying this make-up and achieving the look I want.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t see the coverage, then I used too much so that it looked like I was wearing a mask.  </li>
            <li>thing that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned here too much is the BareVitamins foundation primer which comes with the kit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>My whole face looks</li>
            <li>it was all very helpful.</li>
            <li>As soon as I went back to cheap Neutrogena foundation from Rite Aid....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent value for money since so much stuff comes with the starter kit.  </li>
            <li>have found that exfoliating and using a moisturizer are very helpful in preparing your face (like a canvas) for mineral make up.  </li>
            <li>the 1st time cause I used way, way too much....</li>
            <li>it is highly informative and will keep you from using excess product (and thereby wasting $$!).  </li>
            <li>and I found I had to REALLY cake it on to match the coverage and even tone that BE provides effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>(the infomercials were very alluring).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 (can pass for 30) and I don&#x27;tneed to have a dry-looking (or feeling) face, and I&#x27;m getting really picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>The dvd with the kit was very informative and taught me everything I needed to know for applying this make-up and achieving the look I want.  </li>
            <li>I think we all know that any cheap eyebrow pencil would have had the same</li>
            <li>And there was way too much shine on my face.</li>
            <li>in \\&quot;fair,\\&quot; which is light enough for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make up when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>I really think it is the make up.</li>
            <li>which I like) shine through while still getting a smoother looking face because you really do have a lot of control with this system.</li>
            <li>Its like a mini massage really.</li>
            <li>You can apply several light layers until you have the look you want.  </li>
            <li>You really can sleep in it--</li>
            <li>These foundations/bronzers work very well to brighten your face.</li>
            <li>I started to really like it.  </li>
            <li>concealer\\&quot; brush adds way too much make up.</li>
            <li>If I use it I end up with splotchy areas where you can really tell I have make up on.    </li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t really use the concealer brush with foundation, but I do use it to put on eyeshawdow and found that I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really wish this product would have worked for me....</li>
            <li>These people may have overly oily skin and used too much.  </li>
            <li>is probably going to be too much.  </li>
            <li>But I also recommend checking out the \\&quot;sheer radiance\\&quot; (which again, was included in another kit I got) - it reflects light and makes your skin look dewy and so smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have oily skin, and I really recommend it for others with it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found much use for these, yet</li>
            <li>This stuff really does cover up your problem spots, and my skin has cleared up a lot.</li>
            <li>While it is not as matte as my former makeup, it looks much more natural.    </li>
            <li>Not that I needed the brushes, but they are at least good, usable brushes...and I will use the mineral veil, but the rest of the stuff will probably get thrown away.    </li>
            <li>I have medium sized pores near my nose and even with the foundation and veil on, does not camoflauge them, and actually brings them out more.  </li>
            <li>My face overall looks more even, soft and radiant than ever.  </li>
            <li>My face overall looks more even, soft and radiant than ever.  </li>
            <li>I am also starting to see the fine lines and crow&#x27;s feet that come with getting older.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like any other foundation -- you really have to use the proper shade for your skin to look good.      </li>
            <li>I live in hot humid San Antonio,TX</li>
            <li>It really seems to help heal my acne better and faster than any other product on the market.</li>
            <li>Now, my skin problems are not major--relatively mild, but Bare Minerals made no improvement at all.</li>
            <li>The finish is quite good - it is not flawless, but I guess I would need something thick and masklike to achieve that look, so I am pretty happy with this.  </li>
            <li>The original kit that I bought lasted me for almost an entire year, and I didn&#x27;t even use all the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but it looks a lot better than any other concealer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and other acne medication, but they are so drying to my skin that they create more problems than they solve.</li>
            <li>This starter kit is essential for a first time user, the DVD it comes with is very helpful!!  </li>
            <li>Once you order your kit, you may also find many other brushes you want to order and try, but these three will give you your powder foundation coverage.</li>
            <li>They definitely aren&#x27;t low quality, but the first time you use most makeup brushes they shed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than any liquid foundations I&#x27;ve tried and is comparable to any other pressed powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructional DVD is also useful, and application IS as easy as they say once you get a little practice.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had such a clear and glowing complexion since the last time I was in love!</li>
            <li>Make sure to let both DRY completely.</li>
            <li>I would warn to go very easy handed on the \\&quot;Warm\\&quot; skinlighting product in the kit if you&#x27;re pale complexioned....</li>
            <li>The BE was definitely better at covering blemishes and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This starter kit is an excellent value for this product line, which can be very expensive.</li>
            <li>I am glad I went light-I think the medium would have been too dark for me.</li>
            <li>The mineral vein helps to stop all of that embarassing oil that accumulates on my forehead and nose, and it is so quick, so easy, and I never have to worry about getting my fingers messy with liquid foundations, or having the foundation ball off of my face!  </li>
            <li>Bare escentuals diffuses light and enhances the look of my skin in ways that no other make up ever did.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can get as little or as much coverage as I need.  </li>
            <li>you get new makeup or something because it is really dark?\\</li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure to do an inspection of my face, neck and chest (or clothing) before leaving the house to ensure I&#x27;m not covered in black bristles.</li>
            <li>I felt like any foundation I used made me look older and was too noticable - I don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this product i love it .. and dont let any negtive comments affect your purchase because everyone has different skin, so the results will always be different!  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product, however if you have sensitive skin you may experience itching after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li>I finally found a makeup that lasts all day and looks light and natural.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my skin is dryer and it tends to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; makeup.  </li>
            <li>I tried everything from applying the mineral veil first and then applying after everything else, or just applying the mineral veil first or just applying the mineral veil last.</li>
            <li>I also love that it includes two shades because let&#x27;s face it, our faces never stay the same color too long, and you can always mix and match, unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried (and trust me,</li>
            <li>\\&quot;warmth\\&quot; and other blushes are great to mix in and add a little color to your face \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a natural part of a new brush, but after over 6 months of use, it&#x27;s still happening.</li>
            <li>I was afraid that this combo wouldn&#x27;t be light enough for my very fair skin; and 2) I haven&#x27;t worn foundation since I was in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>No dry look to my skin, my acne was barely visible, all that was there was a smooth even complexion.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are high quality makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>and I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if your thinking about purchasing, 1 for color matching purposes.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem that high quality.</li>
            <li>It will keep mineral makeup from caking and falling into wrinkles (even in high humidity).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of endlessly searching for the perfect makeup, stop the search here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally normal and all you need to do is take your index finger and thumb and lightly pluck the brush to get the loose hairs out</li>
            <li>Also, if you are looking for a little more coverage- get the Tinted Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li>I do like to blend for a little more color.    </li>
            <li>The application is really simple and you are left looking like yourself, only better!</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!!</li>
            <li>Even though I am unable to use the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; the starter kit is still a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>It really does look natural and feels like you have nothing on.</li>
            <li>But I have very oily skin, frequent breakouts, and brown spots (melasma), and I have been searching for years to find something to deal with these issues.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel cakey, and it has a natural look to it - you won&#x27;t go out in the natural light and discover your face is a different color than the rest of your body!</li>
            <li>Most of the make-up has a clear yellow hue to them, so if you have no yellow in your skin (still try it of course!)</li>
            <li>: You cannot apply this makeup like normal makeup.</li>
            <li>I rarely use make up until I had a scar on my forehead last Fall.  </li>
            <li>For 5 months now I have been using the kit , and now have graduated to just buying the product individually, it was completely worth the 60 bucks to \\&quot;test drive\\&quot; the makeup.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals offers full coverage with a totally natural look.  </li>
            <li>the money back guarantee gave was worth it.</li>
            <li>but if you would rather spend you money on other items (shoes, clothes, jewlery etc) then there are other products out there that are just as good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend Bare Escentuals to anyone interested in trying something new makeup-wise.  </li>
            <li>I have never watched the DVD,but if you watch the informercial a couple of times, the concept is not hard to pick up.  </li>
            <li>You have to hand it to BE for great marketing hype, but unfortunately, the product just doesn&#x27;t live up to it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the foundation should last for several months, but I am going through the mineral veil very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This makeup is easy to apply and actually covers pimples and red marks.  </li>
            <li>, I put the mineral veil on, take a tissue and very lightly rub it over my makeup to take off extra powder and after that it looks great, but that&#x27;s just an extra step, which is inconvenient.  </li>
            <li>can even apply the makeup right after going to the gym, when my face is so red</li>
            <li>I will no-doubt use them with my other powders and my bare escentuals eye shadows (which I love, by the way.).  </li>
            <li>It polishes your final look and really give it that soft, smooth final touch we so desire in makeup.</li>
            <li>With this make-up I don&#x27;t feel pale and I feel confident because it looks SOOOOO natural!  </li>
            <li>With this make-up I don&#x27;t feel pale and I feel confident because it looks SOOOOO natural!  </li>
            <li>about BE is that it&#x27;s not very travel friendly and the jars all match</li>
            <li>It took so little time (which is always a plus, because personally, I&#x27;m busy from almost 0600 to 2300 every day, and I never have to spend more than five minutes</li>
            <li>and i said its my new makeup</li>
            <li>Nothing new.</li>
            <li>Nothing new.</li>
            <li>But with the benefit I have seen, I will remain a loyal customer for quite a long time!</li>
            <li>But, Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action Moisturizer from Johnson and Johnson (around $6 in my area) is my favorite to use as a primer and to keep mineral makeup from itching or irritating my skin in anyway.</li>
            <li>I was starting to not like the handy buki brush, it seemed to put it on to heavy.  </li>
            <li>When you get the starter kit, the first thing you might notice (if you&#x27;re cheap like me) is that the jars are SMALL.  </li>
            <li>with, but on a daily basis, I really don&#x27;t wear much as I don&#x27;t like feeling all cakey and maskey.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals certainly meets this requirement</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying the mileage I get out of this makeup, but a problem I have is that I&#x27;m very pale with pink undertones, and the light/fairly light make me look too yellowy.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, the light and fairly light are too dark for me.</li>
            <li>First of all, I live in Florida and about 6 months out of the year, I will start sweating within 10 minutes of being outside.  </li>
            <li>My pores look smaller, and I actually look younger because this makeup gives you a youthful, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I feel feminine and look fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>They wanted to know how I&#x27;d managed to look exactly the same at age 33 as I did at 22!</li>
            <li>I have some larger pores on my nose and the first time I used this makeup according to the technique described, it somehow accentuated the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t find a regimen that works for you, go to a spa or a dermatologist and get a consultation done, it&#x27;s well worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I splurge on foundation in general and always get the \\&quot;good\\&quot; stuff, not from the drugstore, and I didn&#x27;t think a powder could do much in the way of coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Skin Revver Upper smells funny</li>
            <li>A little bit of warmth goes a long way into making my skin like nice and glowing, almost like that sun kissed look.</li>
            <li>I actually bought the starter kit off the website which included a bisque concealer, which covers more naturally and completly than any other concealer I&#x27;ve used.      </li>
            <li>Thirdly, I had difficulty getting the right coverage on my small bit of scarring, despite how easy the DVD told me it would be.  </li>
            <li>and I have not even used half of the Fairly Light and</li>
            <li>They are fun and can be used dry or moist (as well as blended) for varying effects.    </li>
            <li>About my skin (it matters): I have fair skin, yet find that this color can be TOO dark for my skin in the dead of winter when there is 10 hours a day of sun.</li>
            <li>And by glowing I don&#x27;t mean shimmery or shiny - just a fresh, clean, natural glow.</li>
            <li>It actually covers up my flaws better than my previous liquid foundation</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily,w/ acne, and can be dry at times when I put to much acne med.</li>
            <li>Although it left my dry skin with a smooth finish, I never felt that it was moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my previous skincare line (Prescriptives) because I prefer a more dewy finish to my skin.</li>
            <li>First of all, the brushes that come with the set are incredibly cheap and rough, and left my skin red and irritated for some time afterwards.  </li>
            <li>But in the past few years, I&#x27;d noticed more and more lines and found that skin make up made me look fresher and younger.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine purchased the Bare Escentuals kit and found it didn&#x27;t work well for her, particularly since she travels for business each week</li>
            <li>but on the rare days that make-up would be ridiculous, I wear the foundation, a tad of Warmth, and a sweep of True on my lids.  </li>
            <li>- just be sure not to overdo it - I found out the hard way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if your like me (fair and oily) or even a little oily then don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li>Clear Radiance &lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave my skin a week to clear up</li>
            <li>especially like the mineral veil (which you put on after your makeup for that soft, \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; finish) &amp; the warmth (which really does provide you with a sun-kissed glow</li>
            <li>This coverage looks natural.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t completely cover those spots (which no makeup does anyway)</li>
            <li>My skin is not getting nearly as oily as it used to.  </li>
            <li>I guess better late than never.  </li>
            <li>The product claimed that it worked well for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>THough she&#x27;s a natural beauty, I by no means am one myself.</li>
            <li>I use a  gentle facial cleanser to balance me out and</li>
            <li>&amp; I make sure to leave it on my face for at least 30 minutes then</li>
            <li>Much to my surprize, I discovered that application of the foundation and Mineral Veil is enough for my skin to retain moisture throughout the day.   </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I am 16 and have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and am often complimented on how \\&quot;young\\&quot; I look.  </li>
            <li>I can go a whole day without even reapplying (just the occasional blotting is all you need)!</li>
            <li>I have oily (and sensitive and 29 year old) skin</li>
            <li>We went to a spa to buy it, where a professional makeup artist demonstrated how to apply it.</li>
            <li>The makeup is so natural looking.</li>
            <li>I know that I have found the makeup that will take me through my 30&#x27;s and beyond with a natural, healthy-looking glow.beyond with a natural, healthy-looking glow.</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up with my old makeup.</li>
            <li>I also bought the \\&quot;MD Formulations Cleansor for Sensitive Skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>We both have sensitive skin prone to redness.  </li>
            <li>it focuses peoples attention away from flaws and on your natural beauty.  </li>
            <li>I end up being completely covered in bristles</li>
            <li>but this is where the buffing action comes into play....</li>
            <li>and I have old acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I have wear makeup since I was 13 years old and I am 37 now.</li>
            <li>Application Brush - Wonderfully soft brush that I use for foundation, blush, and mineral veil.</li>
            <li>It covers my scar (a fairly deep scar) very well now combining with the Multi-Bisque (Summer Bisque) for coverage purposes.    </li>
            <li>I am 14 years old</li>
            <li>It looked so natural.</li>
            <li>If I sweat just a tiny bit my face gets very itchy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come near my eyes with any of the products in this kit.  </li>
            <li>Even with that, my skin still had a powder look, so to make it look really natural</li>
            <li>The makeup completely agrivates my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had to leave friends early in order to go to the bathroom to wash the makeup off, otherwise I was going to be clawing at my face</li>
            <li>and after I&#x27;ve washed the makeup off, my whole face looks red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I found this make-up just searching through Amazon and ordered it directly from the company because they give you a 30-day moneyback guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the make-up</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you have a store anywhere near you</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you have a store anywhere near you</li>
            <li>I have stopped using this product and my skin has since cleared up completely.</li>
            <li>I now have to fight my adult acne AND wrinkles....</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised that this does cover redness and blemishes.</li>
            <li>But the brushes do feel soft and work well.</li>
            <li>my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as oily as it used to be.</li>
            <li>So, my advice is really to go to a professional make-up counter that carries this line, and let them help you find your color.</li>
            <li>The only liquid foundations that do not do that are the heavy oil-based types, which irritate my skin and make it redder and more prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested in make-up beyond just the basics of foundation, then I suggest buying one of the larger expanded kits directly from the Bare Escentuals website so that you can get the money-back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t deterred by my first experience with Bare Minerals when a sweet but inexperienced sales clerk incorrectly applied a sample to my face and it looked absolutely horrid, a cakey mess that emphasized and magnified every flaw.</li>
            <li>one and only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t travel well, but given all the other great qualities I give it all 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Other foundations are heavy and cakey, where this is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Believe me it doesn&#x27;t take much, when you&#x27;re first starting out use a little bit at a time until you get an idea of how much you need.  </li>
            <li>In the past I have used liquid foundation and thought it looked great indoors and then looked at myself outside in natural light and thought the color was all wrong.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly priced and it actually cost less then the department store brands I used previously.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used liquid foundation and thought it looked great indoors and then looked at myself outside in natural light and thought the color was all wrong.  </li>
            <li>The price may seem a bit extreme, but trust me, it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; powder (which I know a lot of reviewers have complained about), but I generally like a more natural look and</li>
            <li>I will admit that this make-up did not cover as well as I thought it would, but I have very fair skin and trying to cover dark circles or acne scarring is difficult with any makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used other expensive brands for foundations, powders prior but found Bare Escentuals&#x27; foundation works the best.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals makes sure that you have the right brushes and aren&#x27;t using $1.50 Walmart brand brushes that might give you the wrong effect.    </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got dry skin, definitely use a nice heavy moisturizer after the revver-upper stuff that&#x27;s included in this kit.</li>
            <li>Fourthly, I didn&#x27;t get the reassuring feel that makeup usually gives me--that sensation that I look better, that added piece of confidence.  </li>
            <li>I have major reddish tones and blemishes are frequent.   </li>
            <li>The liquid settled into my crinkles, Mousee applied with foundation brush was okay, but kinda tired looking, and the new hydrationg creme was a rash.  </li>
            <li>I had to jump in and share my experience with Bare escentuals in the hopes that it will help new users or those unsure about trying Bare escentuals.</li>
            <li>It has the same effect as the regular Mineral Veil, but it adds a little bit more coverage.</li>
            <li>I have never loved a makeup more.</li>
            <li>a lot of the product really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>BTW, my face is sensitive and I cannot use the cleansing/moisturizing products from Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li>Feels:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals every day since I received it early this week.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of expensive stuff in the past (most recently MAC) and this is so much better!</li>
            <li>only problem I have ever had with this product is the fact that if you travel with the pots they will become top heavy and whenyou open them or try to tap into the lid they may spill.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried because I need something with significant coverage and some of the reveiws made it sound like that was hard to get from this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product while in New York at their local Sephora store.  </li>
            <li>I had started using a new skin cleaning regimene at the same time</li>
            <li>I see there are new companies with this same mineral idea</li>
            <li>and have had combination skin my whole life while living in both dry and humid climates.  </li>
            <li>This is what happened to me, which is sad because I really liked the coverage and that it is natural.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it four stars was that it doesn&#x27;t last for the whole day, so you have to bring extra in your purse to re-apply (spl?)</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I have exceptionally sensitive, pale skin with roseacea.  </li>
            <li>Some people have very, very sensitive skin and have allergies to things that may not bother the vast majority of others.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Bare Minerals all the way for me!  </li>
            <li>But from now on, I&#x27;m a Bare Escentuals girl!</li>
            <li>I guess, if anything, the Bare Minerals nourish my skin!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, and looks quite natural if you can find your right skin tone.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It takes a little practice to get the \\&quot;swirl, tap, buff\\&quot; technique down, and please know that the buffing is very important.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I ever used a loose powder foundation and I have been totally converted.   </li>
            <li>suffer from age spots, light acne, dark undereye circles, sensitive skin and due to PCOS, hirsutism.  </li>
            <li>Kit is definitely the way to experiment with Bare Escentuals because you receive samples of two shades of foundation, several other products, and three full size brushes.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, while the lighter option in the starter kit was suitable for my skin, if not ideal, the &#x27;warmth&#x27; jar did not in any case look natural or flattering.  </li>
            <li>Bare minerals has also helped minimize my breakouts.</li>
            <li>After years of trying to find a foundation that looked natural I finally gave up and stopped wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>To avoid losing money altogether, I&#x27;ve used my Bare Minerals as a finishing powder...over the concealer and foundation</li>
            <li>I got online and ordered bare minerals.  </li>
            <li>I think part of the results is using the bare vitimins lotion every morning and night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this kit, and have been using Bare Minerals for about a week now.  </li>
            <li>My mom bought me this Bare Escentuals Kit after trying it herself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been 3 weeks using the Bare Escentuals and 2 weeks with the Philosphy products.</li>
            <li>(For both the Bare Escentuals and the Hope in a Jar.)</li>
            <li>I had been going on bare skin with blended concealer for 10+ years and that had worked for me, but heading into my mid-30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I wanted a product that would conceal different flaws than those I had as a 20-something young</li>
            <li>I brought this product after watching the QVC Bare Escentuals program</li>
            <li>I use the Bare Escentuals foundation and blush every day and have for years.  </li>
            <li>I find when I try to use a liquid foundation that it feels like a mask in comparison to the Bare Escentuals product.</li>
            <li>I bought bare escentuals after watching an infomercial about four years ago.</li>
            <li>I went to a Bare Escentuals store, to have it applied by make up specialist.</li>
            <li>Note the girl in the store applied a TON of product, I had asked for medium coverage, so ask for minimal application this way you can really see what it looks like.</li>
            <li>As far as foundation, blush, and powder, I am going back to using Estee Lauder: Foundation-</li>
            <li>I was applying it properly and it looked natural.</li>
            <li>I have tried the sleep test, several times not on purpose, and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, but I never used to breakout when I slept in my old makeup either.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried my old makeup (loreal color match, primer, and powder)</li>
            <li>I felt absolutely gross trying to wash off my old makeup after wearing it for 8 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use bare escentuals AFTER concealer</li>
            <li>I tried Bare Escentuals 5 years ago and made the switch.  </li>
            <li>So when I went to Saphora and just happened to try Bare Minerals I was in heaven.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely used it.</li>

            <li>Bare Escentuals i.d.</li>
            <li>When I use Bare Escentuals, I feel like there is nothing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now, I barely have acne coming out from my face</li>
            <li>I could barely see the pores after that.</li>
            <li>The Bare Minerals Face Color 36077</li>
            <li>I have mild-moderate acne on my chin, jawline and forehead and even with the bare minerals you can still see a couple of the spots, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>I have mild-moderate acne on my chin, jawline and forehead and even with the bare minerals you can still see a couple of the spots, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>After trying Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li>I decided to try Bare Escentuals, based on the recommendation of a friend.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Bare Minerals Starter Kit while on break from college</li>
            <li>I just will stick with my bare skin and my clinique.  </li>
            <li>That is until I tried Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always use liquid foundation for my combination skin,but when I saw all the Bare E. ads,I thought:\\&quot;Whoopee\\&quot;,makeup in a minute!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals products are all I use.  </li>
            <li>That said, I am a Bare Escentuals fan.  </li>
            <li>I stronly recommend trying it out in-store at Sephora or Bare Escentuals stores before buying it.</li>
            <li>as a matter of fact the more you have on the worse</li>
            <li>I have regular breakouts, large pores on my cheeks, oily skin on my forehead and around my eyes, dry skin around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li>I also thought since I have dry skin this makeup would accentuate the dryness and facial lines, but it did exactly the opposite!</li>
            <li>I live in Texas where the climate is hot and humid but this product does not get slick on my face.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get decent coverage of my red splotchiness (which is very mild and easily covered by my normal liquid makeup) and now mattter how much or little I used the results either looked unfinished or unnatural, not to mention the coloring was bad.    </li>
            <li>It really takes so little of the minerals to give complete coverage.</li>
            <li>Thanks, but NO THANKS!  </li>
            <li>it is a little bit messy but it could just be me. :)</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have the worst complexion in the world, it is FAR from perfect.</li>
            <li>I also seperately purchased a blush and an eye lining brush to be able to put a little of the bronzer (included in kit) along my upper lashline to give a little definition.</li>
            <li>When I used the ones in my set the first time they shed a little bit.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty unpredictable skin with plenty that needs to be covered up, and this is the only make up I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t turn application into a headache.  </li>
            <li>I actually purchased my starter kit on the Bare Minerals website.  </li>
            <li>I use to have a lot of red areas on and around my nose and the bare minerals has even helped that.  </li>
            <li>Since trying Bare Minerals about 6 years ago, its now the only makeup I will use.  </li>
            <li>With Bare Escentuals my skin can breathe and therefor the acne medication I use actually works now</li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer who said results vary, and I wanted to give my opinion and personal experience with the Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li>However, if you have the chance to go to a Bare Escentuals store, or Sephora, or a store that carries this line, then go in and have them match your skin to the proper color.</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding a shade at first.</li>
            <li>I watched the informercials on tv a few times, and was always interested in the products</li>
            <li>Not only do the crushed minerals shimmer ever so delicately, they are magical once they touch your skin.</li>
            <li>- This is a great little brush for applying a second layer of foundation to help cover dark under-eye color and other trouble spots.</li>
            <li>In fact, when it is hot/humid, I make an extra effort to blot my face first, and brush a little Mineral Veil on my skin to absorb excess oil.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, as many  people  have reported, had difficulty working with such small containers with the  powder making a mess.</li>
            <li>with other makeup i usually feel like i have a ton of [...] on my face and by the end of the day it wears off but bare minerals stays on your face all day and it feels so light</li>
            <li>But they mean it with Bare Escentuals when they say less is more.  </li>
            <li>Even my seventeen year old daughter uses it and she has extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and I find my self taking less time to get ready.</li>
            <li>I am not one to spend an hour getting ready, if I can&#x27;t do it in less than five</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is definitely the makeup of the future.</li>
            <li>I just use whatever is left on the lid without putting any in, and see a barely noticeable difference, but that is not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, slight acne, and a few fine lines around the eyes and</li>
            <li>I will stick with the Prescriptives that my dermatologist reccomends--it&#x27;s not cheap, either, but it lasts quite a long time, does not irritate my skin, and makes me feel a little better dressed when I leave the house in the morning.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to use blushes because I am naturally pink and don&#x27;t want to be over-pink, but \\&quot;Glee\\&quot; looks very natural on me.)  </li>
            <li>If you are pale the light/fairly light may be too dark.  </li>
            <li>The warmth is waaaay too dark for pale skintones, I don&#x27;t understand why they included it in the light skintone kit.  </li>
            <li>I have used liquid cheap and expensive, Mousse, and new covergirl creme .</li>
            <li>I am in my late 30s and have been struggling with mild acne since a teen.</li>
            <li>My own experience is that I have terribly dry skin, and makeup always looks caked on and fake.</li>
            <li>so you can use Light if you get a little tan in the summer and add a little of the pigment.  </li>
            <li>I decided, \\&quot;Hey, if it sounds like an informercial in real life, why not?\\&quot; So I splurged a little.</li>
            <li>the other three are nearly new.  </li>
            <li>But by the end of the fourth day, I realized my face was absolutely covered with tons of little bumps.</li>
            <li>My disastrous store demo was done over an otherwise perfectly fine face cream I was wearing, which I am sure caused the bad results by creating a barrier that just sort of soaked up the minerals and lay on my skin like dust on top of the refrigerator...</li>

            <li> It is also a great deal!  </li>
            <li> This is the best makeup ever!!</li>
            <li> The mineral veil also keeps away shine and is the perfect compliment to the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mineral veil also keeps away shine and is the perfect compliment to the foundation.  </li>
            <li> As I said, go see a dermatologist or use what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But best of all, my birthmark is gone.  </li>
            <li> what a great age to be!  </li>
            <li> I started using this after my best friend purchased it</li>
            <li> This provides the best coverage she has had and does not clog her pores like liquid foundations.      </li>
            <li> The brushes are awesome!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> (I have very fair skin)</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned woman, who has had no luck with liquid or mousse foundations.</li>
            <li> In addition, it made my face incredibly shiny.</li>
            <li> Good Luck if you purchase this!</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the results, so I went out and got my own supplies!!  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER seen my skin look so beautiful.  </li>
            <li> The brushes included in the starter kit are high-quality and work great.  </li>
            <li> I feel great just putting this on.</li>
            <li> This kit is great because of its value.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are perfect and you get two shades of foundation which is nice</li>
            <li> The kit is great for starters.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my mom and it didn&#x27;t look so great</li>
            <li> In the set you will receive a video with some great tips on how to apply it.  </li>
            <li> All my friends use this and they look great</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I tried this make-up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It looks great on her and covers any skin issues she may have.  </li>
            <li> The value of this product is great.</li>
            <li> and it looks great...</li>
            <li> Mine came with the handy buki brush, max coverage concealer brush and the flawless face brush.  </li>
            <li> I also worried that some of the reviewers said it was great if you already have great skin, but not otherwise.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great.  </li>
            <li> Another great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to block my pores -</li>
            <li> a great plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It can be buffed off to some extent, but the results aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> I found a make-up that doesn&#x27;t feel like make-up, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, stays on, and covers a great deal of my acne and scars.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I tried this make-up</li>
            <li> makes me look &amp; feel great.  </li>
            <li> Because they are in powder form, they come off quicker and the coverage isn&#x27;t as great as a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> You can wear this makeup all day and it still looks great</li>
            <li> Their products are as great as they advertise.</li>
            <li> It puts on the powder eyeshadow quickly, great coverage.      </li>
            <li> The instructional DVD is a great help and you will be amazed at how versatile all of the additional products are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be amazed and happy that you did.  </li>
            <li> The instructional DVD is a great help and you will be amazed at how versatile all of the additional products are.   </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be amazed and happy that you did.  </li>
            <li> Mineral Veil is really great.  </li>
            <li> and he thinks it makes my skin look great, too.  </li>
            <li> and he thinks it makes my skin look great, too.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> so i use the fairly light powder &amp; it works!!!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, My best girlfriend got me hooked.</li>
            <li> but my skin looks good and I am quite happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> then the \\&quot;expert\\&quot; put eyebrow pencil on--yes just pencil--and raved about the remarkable improvement, and showed the \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; close-ups.  </li>
            <li> What I was happy with from the start was that \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; was a good color for me despite being warm instead of neutral.  </li>
            <li> I look like I&#x27;m about to drop, and the coverage is so good that my skin looks calmer in seconds.</li>
            <li> The Fairly Light is the shade that works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> really good (good coverage, no lines, not overly made up).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and it still looks good</li>
            <li> I bought the fairly light/light.</li>
            <li> With this I have seen that it looks great no matter what kind of lighting I&#x27;m in.  </li>
            <li> If you apply it lightly with a swirling motion with the brush it will apply evenly and flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for your skin, you don&#x27;t feel it</li>
            <li> upper\\&quot; is good do not put over or in your eye area though</li>
            <li> I tried every technique they showed on the DVD...and when those didn&#x27;t give great results I tried techniques of my own.    </li>
            <li> I recommend those if you&#x27;re looking for good coverage and a good finish (depending on your skin color).</li>
            <li> Provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li> are good too.</li>
            <li> I used it just as instructed on the video, and had fairly good results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a makeup that wouldn&#x27;t fade throughout the day, On a good day</li>
            <li> While some of the products are good, the combination in a kit form is not a \\&quot;one-size-fits-all\\&quot; solution.    </li>
            <li> The coverage of the foundation, however, is good if you like a matte finish.    </li>
            <li> It gives a good finish when used with a concealer</li>
            <li> This is good, but not it.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li> Mineral Veil does a good job of hiding the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> With this I have seen that it looks great no matter what kind of lighting I&#x27;m in.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks gorgeous</li>
            <li> I suppose, if you have oily skin, then this product would be good for you.</li>
            <li> would be a great starter kit for someone whose skin isn&#x27;t super-fair and has neutral to warm skintones.  </li>
            <li> It looked so good</li>
            <li> If you have even lighter skin than this kit allows for, you can order the FAIR foundation to compliment this kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lightness of the product is fascinating and you feel as if you are not wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> The kits are a good way to introduce your skin to the products because they include the brushes you need to apply this powdery foundation.</li>
            <li> Get Started Kit with the Fair foundation</li>
            <li> Get Started Kit with the Fair foundation</li>
            <li> When I tried covering the breakouts the colors were way to orange for my fair skin tone.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fair, the \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot;</li>
            <li> this really is a good deal.</li>
            <li> The coverage is good.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to put on and makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li> included in the kit:  Flawless Application Brush, Full Coverage Kabuki Brush, Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush, Mineral Veil and Warmth All Over Face Color.  </li>
            <li> The brushes in this kit are luxurious and include the Full Coverage Kabuki, Flawless Face and Max Coverage Concealer Brush.</li>
            <li> Nothing is perfect but Bare Minerals is honestly the closest my face has ever looked to flawless and as soon as the moisture in my skin is restored I will return to using it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed the first time I tried this makeup!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to be introduced to this line of cosmetics at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I think I experienced most if not all of the problems that users have written about here.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to say I LOVE these items.</li>
            <li> In fact when I run out, I&#x27;ll probably get another starter kit instead of just ordering the powder foundation just to get more brushes!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> You will be so glad you did!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup! &lt;</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> (Make sure you swirl tap buff!</li>
            <li> I do have some redness that I need to even out and was excited that the demo DVD showed a girl with acne scarring and skin discoloration because I thought that if it makes her skin look good, I should be in great shape.    </li>
            <li> I will be &amp; have been buying more of the BE products!</li>
            <li> I also love about the kit is you get warmth!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad she did!    </li>
            <li> I just bought the Get Started Kit this weekend, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars, though, and writing my first review on Amazon, because I am so impressed with how it feels and how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants to look like the peasant girls in the movies who look like they woke up looking naturally beautiful and have people comment that YOU look beautiful, this make-up is for you.   </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hide my freckles....which I LOVE!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I still use my Corn Silk powder to top it all off (a must for people with oily skin!), but even without my Corn Silk</li>
            <li> If this can make me feel beautiful, confident and feminine all over again then it can help anyone :) &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> best part about this makeup is how light it feels, how easily it comes off with my face wash</li>
            <li> The concealer brush is amazing and does a great job at covering fine lines and concealing blemishes.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but the light works great</li>
            <li> the price this is an amazing kit.  </li>
            <li> It provides amazing coverage</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> This kit is an amazing value.</li>
            <li> you already own this product and you have oily skin and your skin still seems to have excess oil try putting on the Mineral Veil once before the foundation, once after, then again after you apply warmth.</li>
            <li> I especially love the \\&quot;bisque\\&quot; (concealer) because it covers up my acne very well.  </li>
            <li> Good luck :)</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product and was thrilled by the results.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I have a nice texture to my skin.    </li>
            <li> Also, invest in your own brushes.</li>
            <li> Results: really liked the feel and look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started trying some of their eye shadows too and they are quite nice as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because I thought it would be nice to have a mineral-based makeup.  </li>
            <li> They have a fantastic selection of shades, I use fairly light, and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, in the beginning, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> It does look nice on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and you just have nice skin.</li>
            <li> I also really liked the mineral veil</li>
            <li> The kit comes with brushes also, which really feel wonderfully calming on my face.</li>
            <li> had no idea that powder could give me this kind of coverage.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is nice, but the \\&quot;mineral veil\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Handy Buki</li>
            <li> like the bristles go into the pores of my skin and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Handy Buki brush.    </li>
            <li> and the warmth does a nice job as eyeshadow, although i am tempted to buy their eye kit too.  </li>
            <li> It goes on quick and looks beautiful all day.  </li>
            <li> It is light and very easy to use, anyone can look great even if you have always sucked at putting on makeup (like me).</li>
            <li> colors are excellent for my light, cool toned skin....</li>
            <li> No make-up can provide the miracle of flawless skin, but Bare Minerals provides good coverage...</li>
            <li> The coverage was great and it was easy to use; I was extremely pleased with the results for about four days.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I would recommend this if you truly want *full* coverage, but for a you-only-better look, I think this is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warmth is an awesome product; as long as you don&#x27;t use any more than about a pinhead, you come out looking sunkissed and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and really do a wonderful job of tucking the powder in and then buffing it into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to overuse.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to fall out very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I did!  </li>
            <li> For one, like others with very fair skin, I needed the Fair color foundation and Bare Escentuals doesn&#x27;t make a</li>
            <li> For one, like others with very fair skin, I needed the Fair color foundation and Bare Escentuals doesn&#x27;t make a</li>
            <li> If you can learn to use the smallest possible amount, it&#x27;s ok, but not that great for very fair skin.    </li>
            <li> The warmth, also, gave me a glow that I&#x27;ve never been able to duplicate with blush, and it&#x27;s just absolutely amazing.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good mineral make up, I recommend J. Lynne instead (available through their website).</li>
            <li> All my blemishes and redness were cover more effectively than my Clinque makeup had done.</li>
            <li> It is light feeling, good for all skin types and does not cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> like i have nothing on so natural and so beautiful buy this!!</li>
            <li> The upside being that by purchasing the Fairly Light/Light Kit I can use the Fairly Light in the summer when my color darkens a bit or if I go tanning.  </li>
            <li> The upside being that by purchasing the Fairly Light/Light Kit I can use the Fairly Light in the summer when my color darkens a bit or if I go tanning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it may not look great right away</li>
            <li> Same thing with the eyeliner, I just use an avon brush and it gives a perfect line sure to never smudge!</li>
            <li> have never in my life gotten so many compliments on how beautiful my skin is -- and it really isn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> so make sure to use a good light when u put it on</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it looks great and feels great, because you cannot feel it!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this makeup lasts longer than others, but the great thing about it is that you can reapply right over the top of the existing makeup</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals (Essentials) makeup has to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals is the perfect mix between the two.  </li>
            <li> my skin was perfectly matte after applying the Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> Bare escentuals has become my best friend when it comes to imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I had a make over using Bare Minerals and am so absolutely impressed.  </li>
            <li> If I am not sweating, the makeup stays great, but it&#x27;s not practicle, and I find myself being weary to wear it if I might be in a situation to sweat, which sort of defeats the purpose of owning the makeup in the first place.      </li>
            <li> An instruction guide/how-to brochure and DVD is also included to get you on your way to becoming your own makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My problem with make-up has always been that it looks great for the first hour that I put it on and then literally slides off me throughout the day (</li>
            <li> The powder accentuates my fine wrinkles (and lo and behold, I have more than I thought I did!)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look very smooth.</li>
            <li> I think the application is very very important and will affect how you&#x27;ll look.</li>
            <li> Feels very light.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin and a touch of rosacea.  </li>
            <li> If you like this kit I also recommend the crown jewels kit which comes with some great eye brushes and the best black liner powder plus a bunch of other awesome products.  </li>
            <li> Feels better too.</li>
            <li> It was five times the size of the one that comes in the kit and cost $25 which was much better than spending $50 for a refill of the kit when all I needed was the foundation.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and only wish that I had purchased it sooner.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a makeup that stayed on almost all day.  </li>
            <li> They refund your money if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, and for some ladies it may not be the magic cure.  </li>
            <li> I love this product; been using it for a couple of months &amp; it rocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bareMinerals foundation is much better for my skin type than liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to get the brushes too, and not just but the foundation.</li>
            <li> one more thing...</li>
            <li> The coverage is awesome, and sheer.  </li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t tried the bisque conclearer yet, but I am ordering some) and my face is more even-toned and matte, without looking powdery.  </li>
            <li> I also love the built in sunscreen.   </li>
            <li> I use moisturizer in the morning and put everything in this kit on top of that</li>
            <li> I also love that I can&#x27;t feel it on my face and at the end of the day it is still there.</li>
            <li> so I just gave up and wore blush and eye shadow for most of the years I have been wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> The Light will be nice to incorporate in the summer when I have a tan.</li>
            <li> I love the Mineral Veil and the Warmth too.</li>
            <li> I love it, but with everything it is not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li> most companies offer women.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the need for it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to look more polished</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> You cannot find a better deal out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sheer yet provides great coverage!  </li>
            <li> and I just love the mineral veil and the barevitamins.  </li>
            <li> sincerely reccomend that, before you purchase this set, you find a Sephora where you can give it a try and make sure that it&#x27;s what you want it to be.  </li>
            <li> Like most women I have tried every type of makeup on the market.</li>
            <li> Even the powder makeup used by many of the makeup artists felt like I was wearing mud.  </li>
            <li> Okay you get the picture.</li>
            <li> Also apply soooooooooo lightly that you can&#x27;t even believe you are applying anything at all!  </li>
            <li> and it makes it for the most part throughout the workout.</li>
            <li> The mineral veil is ok, I don&#x27;t always use it.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I wear eye shawdow, liner, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently works for many, but not everybody.</li>
            <li> I have glowing, healthy looking skin and my blemishes are well covered.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you watch the video</li>
            <li> I love it because it provides coverage without making me look like a mannequin.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t linger (unless I just got used to it), and it&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not a smell</li>
            <li> I love the Kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed when I was not wearing it that my face had a healthy glow to it that hadn&#x27;t been there for years.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the things I love about it is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all, and yet my face looks radiant</li>
            <li> Who knows, it may become your favorite too...</li>
            <li> To me,  BE is like a magic trick in a jar</li>
            <li> You just look better  :)</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I don&#x27;t regret that I bought the kit, since I&#x27;ve been able to experience mineral foundations for myself</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for me now, but it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how the tiniest bit of powder could give me such great coverage!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products.  </li>
            <li> but I felt that it also made the wrinkles I have stand out more.</li>
            <li> I gave them to my sister and friend, who love them, and I bought [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love the spf 15 (For better, waterproof sun-protection</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Veil - I love this powder because it isn&#x27;t colored.  </li>
            <li> in \\&quot;Glee,\\&quot; which I use more as a blush than an all-over face color.  </li>
            <li> Pros - I absolutely love this make-up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love a lot of things about this makeup, but it is not quite the miracle worker they claim it it.  </li>
            <li> Things I love about it:  </li>
            <li> I have to make sure to wash it off every night and use an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks and feels</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would be able to ween myself away from liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> Artist in you will love the way you apply this makeup.</li>
            <li> Each container of powder has many possibilities.</li>
            <li> You can blend more warmth or add a touch of summer shimmer.</li>
            <li> items I&#x27;ve enjoyed:  &lt;br</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li> am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li> He said, \\&quot;I absolutely love the finish, but you need to learn how to put in on better.  </li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t yet mastered using the concealer brush, so maybe as I get better, I&#x27;ll be able to cover up</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t yet mastered using the concealer brush, so maybe as I get better, I&#x27;ll be able to cover up more.</li>
            <li> It softens and mattes the appearance of shine and makes it look healthy and glowing, not shiny.</li>
            <li> I say this if it works for you - more power to you -, but it just didnt do it for me.</li>
            <li> I was pleased by this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I love buying everything online</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this make-up (and I&#x27;ve never said that about a cosmetic product before).  </li>
            <li> it is an okay product</li>
            <li> The point is ,B. Minerals is JUST POWDER.NO MAGICAL PROPERTIES,BUT I guess you could use it to flour a cake pan!I gave it one star</li>
            <li> With so many infomercials, I had to try this product.  </li>
            <li> When you see the informmerical you think, right, sure powder can provide flawless coverage, but it really does.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it at first, but once I got used to it, I fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li> You will get a beautiful, natural result!</li>
            <li> However, for very fair skinned ladies like myself even the fairly light/light is a tad dark.</li>
            <li> However, they are light and airy and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t cover up blemishes as well as a liquid might, but the payoff is that the rest of my skin looks absolutely amazing, so I don&#x27;t mind the one blemish that might not be covered.  </li>
            <li> With that said, I wish they had more kits available with MORE brushes, so you can continue to get more deals.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel natural and beautiful</li>
            <li> Surprisingly the conceler brush really did cover up my blemishes!</li>
            <li> in the end a pretty good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect foundation for a long time, one that will give me that airbrushed look.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t learn anything new, but it might be great if you&#x27;ve never worn makeup before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair-skinned (probably more on the pink than yellow-toned side), and this kit was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> It gives great coverage, is easy to put on and feels so much better than my old liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any make up at all, and I think that having 90% amazing skin and not feeling masky is worth having a zit or two not covered up as well.  </li>
            <li> The colors are brilliant and last all day!!  </li>
            <li> Many places that sell this product will give a free demonstration on how to apply the makeup and which foundation you should use as a concealer and which you should use as your all-over foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;Fairly Light kit\\&quot; at the store, it was 15.00 more (75.00) but in addtion you get the compact 25.00 and highlighter color 20.00.</li>
            <li> The look and coverage was fantastic for the overwhelming weightlessness of the minerals.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves how I look and comments frequently about how my skin looks flawless but not fake.</li>
            <li> Within about 5 months of her telling us how much she loved this product 3 of my cousins, both aunts, and now myself refuse to wear anything else.  </li>
            <li> Use a good moisturizer and dryness shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a new foundation color called \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; that matched my skin much better than the \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and if you do not normally have sensitive skin, ENJOY, because it does have great flawless coverage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just love a product very often, but I love this one!</li>
            <li> The coverage is very nice and soft....</li>
            <li> I purchased this starter kit because I was excited about the idea of being able to sleep in this makeup.  </li>
            <li> The minerals are so light they don&#x27;t have to, they just have to be close, and your original skin tone does the rest! &lt;</li>
            <li> I can understand the instruction for the eye makeup (which isn&#x27;t included in this kit anyway), but the foundation is really, really easy.  </li>
            <li> I once spilled some warmth on my counter top and was pulling up the color for days every time I would clean up the area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> The manual (plus the 98734 million commercials on tv) makes it really easy to use.    </li>
            <li> Just wanted to put my two cents in and say that I have a fair complexion, and dry sensitive skin, yet I look excellent in this make-up.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it is so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> They come off easily...</li>
            <li> It will rub off easy though, being that it&#x27;s a powder.  </li>
            <li> It really is just amazing - it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> Like many people mentioned, I had to blend the light and fairly light foundation to get it to match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The free feeling and the beautiful complexion you achieve through the use of Bare Escentuals may make you want to try all their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, covers well, and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make-up at all.  </li>
            <li> I used the skin tone matching system available on the Bare Escentuals site, and having fair skin with golden undertones, the site suggested I get the Fairly Light/Light kit.  </li>
            <li> It is a great way to introduce yourself to the Bare Escentuals line of makeup products.  </li>
            <li> Warmth is wonderful, at first I used it only as a blush, now I use it as a blush, eyeshadow and I mix it in with rose balm for a warmth colored gloss, I have really fallen in love with the matching color thing.  </li>
            <li> I normally have good skin with no acne.  </li>
            <li> This is the best foundation that I have ever used - hand&#x27;s down.  </li>
            <li> It comes in powder form so its easy to apply with the brushes, but it goes on smooth like liquid.  </li>
            <li> The brushes in the kit were fine.</li>
            <li> But over-all I just don&#x27;t think it is ideal for dry skin.</li>
            <li> But the powder went on just fine</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, it is very oily, and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many types of foundations and the Bare Minerals is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot; and \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundations in this kit were both too dark and too warm (yellow/orange undertones) for me, but I love the way the foundation wears.  </li>
            <li> The powder is great, but this color absolutely did not work for me; it was way too dark and looked brownish-orange on my skin, but it looks great on the friend I gave it to.  </li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s worth the clean up and the learning curve because it really will make you look fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> but because I have less than perfect skin I don&#x27;t feel comfortable going without it.</li>
            <li> It is cool, light, refreshing, feels great, and smooths the skin prior to makeup application.</li>
            <li> If you like more of a natural look and can&#x27;t do more than a five-minute morning, this product will do the trick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be of excellent quality and value because you need to use so little of it.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair and have pink cheeks or ruddy skin.  </li>
            <li> The huge pores on my nose are invisible, the circles under my eyes are gone.  </li>
            <li> also, the fairly light and light are not that light.</li>
            <li> have a light skin</li>
            <li> My skin looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Fairly light was to light</li>
            <li> A light dab before makeup application gives a smooth surface on which to apply the foundation.  </li>
            <li> I invested my money in this product and thought that it would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> Having worked in front of a camera I believed having a perfect complexion meant heavy feeling makeup.</li>
            <li> You need to go lightly with this otherwise you can see the powder on your face.  </li>
            <li> A friend and I both bought the light/fairly light kit.  </li>
            <li> I use not only this kit, but also the Well Rested Bisque, which is a really great cover up tool.</li>
            <li> Just a light application covered and made a matte complexion.</li>
            <li> For me, the best way to use powdered makeup is to moisturize well and then wait a few minutes before applying makeup.    </li>
            <li> If your face is \\&quot;sticky,\\&quot; the makeup does not go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Feels light on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I found the fairly light shade to be too light for me and gave a whitish cast and was told I could use it as a concealer or to brighten the undereye area.  </li>
            <li> I am told several times that I have lost weight, lol not an ounce.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 months ago the FAIR/FAIRLY LIGHT starter kit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just completed four months of using the B.E. light/fairly light kit.</li>
            <li> The kit includes a product called \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot;, which for light skin, should be called \\&quot;overwhelming\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is lighter than the Fairly Light and Light foundations.</li>
            <li> The Fairly Light seems to work for me, but having an even lighter shade is helpful in the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This kit includes the Mineral Veil, Fairly Light and Light Foundation.</li>
            <li> If you order the basic kit and like it, Sephora also has \\&quot;beauty at any age\\&quot; kits by decade that are a great value for add-ons.</li>
            <li> love looking at my skin when I&#x27;m wearing this make up, and my hubby says that it is completely worth the money</li>
            <li> love looking at my skin when I&#x27;m wearing this make up, and my hubby says that it is completely worth the money</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about blending the liquid foundation in, or worry about powder or liquid lines at the jaw because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li> The handles are light plastic.</li>
            <li> containers that the minerals come in also feel like cheap plastic...</li>
            <li> The containers that the minerals come in also feel like cheap plastic...</li>
            <li> it is as fabulous as all the informercials say it is.</li>
            <li> have fair, sensitive, combination skin</li>
            <li> But I mastered the technique of applying a different kind of foundation using tools I&#x27;d never used before and am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love the concealer brush; it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> My least favorite brush is the \\&quot;Flawless Face.\\</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with cool undertones (light pink), and this kit didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to watch the instructional DVD that comes with the kit first.</li>
            <li> is quick and easy.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and quick.  </li>
            <li> This kit includes two shades of the light foundation, so you can mix the two and find the perfect shade year round!  </li>
            <li> I first ordered this kit in early spring and wasn&#x27;t too happy until I had some practice at applying it.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, try dusting some of the mineral veil over the oily spots first before applying the foundation then dust another light layer of mineral veil on top of everything for added shine</li>
            <li> I have light acne and it will even cover most of that, just like a liquid or stick concealer, but looks so much more natural!</li>
            <li> I also *love* the Mineral Veil; it&#x27;s a really neat product that adds a great finished look while being totally see through and light.</li>
            <li> on my nose first, then went over it with a circular buffing motion and this made a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product a year ago because a friend was using it.  </li>
            <li> A girl who lived in my apartment building this summer said that her mom had started using Bare Minerals and absolutely loved it, so I went and did some research.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend this kit to anyone, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and my face will barely have any oil on it by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I loved the feel and application of Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li> After years of struggling with imperfect skin, I tried Bare Escentuals on a whim and have never in my life looked this good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this kit.</li>
            <li> I do Mineral Veil first, then foundation, then the Warmth, then one more touch of Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was recommended to try Bare Escentuals \\&quot;get started\\&quot; kit, in fairly light/light.</li>
            <li> First off, I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty fair and the fairly light was too dark and the light was too light when I put it on with the handy buki brush.  </li>
            <li> When I first started wearing Bare Escentuals, everyone told me how great I looked.  </li>
            <li> In my over twenty years of trying numerous foundations, I have yet to see anything cover and perfect all while allowing the natural radiance of your skin to shine through.</li>
            <li> I read the many positive reviews on this product and rushed out to buy it.</li>
            <li> This makeup is the first I&#x27;ve ever used that goes on easily and looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> When I originally ordered the kit, I tried to justify it by telling myself that when you did the math and divided the cost by the number of products, it really wasn&#x27;t much more than what you would pay at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I was sold when I saw you could get a full refund if you weren&#x27;t satisfied, and purchased my starter kit that very day.    </li>
            <li> I have used the Bare Minerals for about 3 months now and absolutely love it, Mineral Veil has to be some sort of pixie dust - it works magic on my skin.    </li>
            <li> I do not like anything on my face, so I have never been able to wear makeup, but I can wear bare minerals and love to.  </li>
            <li> yet I had a full container of the warmth.</li>
            <li> It has really showed its advantages as the weather is getting more humid.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and acne scarring with the occasional break out.</li>
            <li> This morning, I used it in place of my Loreal True Match foundation.   </li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for many years, and this product really covers and helps heal acne and the scars.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin, freckles and red hair.  </li>
            <li> I really believe it does make your skin better over time.</li>
            <li> It does not settle in my crinkles, I am not constantly wiping the excees  out of the lines, it does as good of a job on under eye circles as my stick concealor does, but I am not having to tug and rub my eyes.</li>
            <li> a touch of True over it.  </li>
            <li> Bristles fall out and they are not that soft on the skin, kind of itchy.</li>
            <li> Who really knows for sure what \\&quot;pure\\&quot; minerals it is made from???</li>
            <li> good if you want sheer</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is way too yellow for my skin and the \\&quot;fairly light\\</li>
            <li> The negative thing is that the coverage is not as flawless as advertised on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the amount of drugstore powder that I had to use just to get a good finish, this should definitely save me time and money.    </li>
            <li> I have fair skin, freckles and red hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look &#x27;made up\\&quot;, just a really nice natural.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and my husband tells me that I look very radiant with it on.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had to switch to a more intense moisturizer since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> and I felt like if I smiled my face would \\&quot;crack\\&quot; and my liquid foundation would make me look like an old painting.  </li>
            <li> and I felt like if I smiled my face would \\&quot;crack\\&quot; and my liquid foundation would make me look like an old painting.  </li>
            <li> - have shoeboxes full of make up</li>
            <li> It truely is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Since I have a little acne anyway, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Bare Minerals was the culprit, so I kept using it for a couple more weeks--plus the advertising was so convincing about how good it&#x27;s supposed to be for your skin.  </li>
            <li> first time I used it, I used the swirl-tap-buff method and it was so easy.</li>
            <li> The only problem I ran across is that the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is too dark for my fair skin, and I look sunburned if I use it, so I bought a tub of \\&quot;glee\\&quot; and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> love my new BE kit so much, I could not wait to get some more colors</li>
            <li> The foundation powder really works with your skins natural oils to give a gorgeous glow.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I kept trying because I saw that my skin changed a bit over time and the make up does deliver what they say it will.  </li>
            <li> , I have almost perfect skin, and look ten years younger.</li>
            <li> Finally, the finished product of the whole kit just isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many, many different types of makeup and, although they looked o.k.</li>
            <li> To summarize--great makeup, and super quick to apply.  </li>
            <li> Rev-er Upper - I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this alone, so I&#x27;m glad it came in the kit because I love it.  </li>
            <li> It is super lightweight and has helped take some of the oiliness away from my t-zone.</li>
            <li> You have to put in the time and effort to take care of your skin properly to get the best possible effect.  </li>
            <li> So every day since then I&#x27;ve been getting better, and I always check with him, and he examines my face in natural light.  </li>
            <li> I did a quick wash up,redid my makeup with foundation from my purse &amp; salvaged the evening.</li>
            <li> fairly light would be too light for me, as I am light complected but not pale.</li>
            <li> The Bare Vitamins lotion that comes in this kits is also really nice.</li>
            <li> When the package came in the mail, I was so excited that I actually put it on when I was at work just to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Thought coverage was light at first but found it depends on application and type of brush used.  </li>
            <li> I bought the FAIR foundation a few weeks later &amp; it looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I thought Bare Escentuals was a marketing gimmick to get people buy their products.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d heard so many great reviews from random people in the store going to buy more.</li>
            <li> first thought when I saw the brushes was that they are cheap.</li>
            <li> Looks good and stays on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> i mean ill be honest its not giving me flawless skin but its still great ...</li>
            <li> The makeup itself is great, but since I didn&#x27;t keep half of the products, it wasn&#x27;t a cost-efficient purchase for me.</li>
            <li> But from now on, I&#x27;m a Bare Escentuals girl!having 90% amazing skin and not feeling masky is worth having a zit or two not covered up as well.  </li>
            <li> First let me say it&#x27;s a good product if you have the yellow undertones.   </li>
            <li> I was also very pleased with Bare Escentuals as a foundation because the application time was minimal, it didn&#x27;t feel like makeup and, most importantly, it delivered what it promised:  a smooth glowing complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy and fast to do in the morning, I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing make-up, and</li>
            <li> It is super-lightweight, very natural-looking and feeling, easy to blend, and easy to control how much coverage I want.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate result the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> After starting with this kit I went on to buy the Beyond the Basics kit, Get Started Eyes, and Brow kit, I LOVE it all!  </li>
            <li> If bought individually, this would cost way more!</li>
            <li> and I love the natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I have been told they cant believe my age because I have no wrinkles, lol not true.</li>
            <li> After starting with this kit I went on to buy the Beyond the Basics kit, Get Started Eyes, and Brow kit, I LOVE it all!  </li>
            <li> but it greatly minimizes them and you are left with a very natural look.  </li>
            <li> I am also very fair complected, and have a hard time finding my shade.  </li>
            <li> I have oily but not broken out skin and fine lines, and some freckles.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin (always buying the lightest foundation shade) that gets very dry in the winter...</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister (along with one of the foundations that didn&#x27;t work); it seemed like a great little brush.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you need a ton of coverage, but it does a great job of covering up redness and uneven tone</li>
            <li> to get this stuff to look smooth on my face, I&#x27;d end up looking like a kabuki girl or something with so much of the power</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t great, but they do the job, I don&#x27;t ever use the kabuku brush because it puts the makeup on waay too heavy for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I think it is absolutely amazing and so different from anything else.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> ALIMA COSMETICS gives a far better range for your skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I found that mixing the light foundation with the Clear Radience helps make the light foundation more pink for those who need it,and setting it with Mineral Veil helps lighten it up even more if you do this.  </li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to and the coverage is natural which is what I came to love.</li>
            <li> For nearly three years I have sold Mary Kay and thought that I would always love their products, but soon found that I could not wear MK foundation with my skin medication.  </li>
            <li> Both shades were warm enough to conceal the redness of my skin.   </li>
            <li> My 61 year old skin never looked better.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but just had to chime in about this product.</li>
            <li> just seemed to settle in lines and didn&#x27;t blend so well, others have mentioned issues with more mature skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I like a more natural look and for some reason I feel too made up with this on, even though it is just a translucent powder.</li>
            <li> I will close by saying this is really worth the sixty dollar price.</li>
            <li> Also, the Mineral Veil is nice and can be used to put finishing touches on any makeup, so that&#x27;s not a total loss either.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;People tell me I look fresh.</li>
            <li> It is well worth purchasing, but takes a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> If all the makeup claims about this product were true, I would (willingly) pay twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this makeup because of the price, but it is worth it</li>
            <li> tells me I can, but the end results of the longer time are worth it in my book.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the trip to get your color matched by a pro.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the trip to get your color matched by a pro.  </li>
            <li> Glee is also really fun, and adds that rosy-happy look to your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Always try to get most of it back through the holes by lightly tapping on the bottom if you have this problem.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to wear foundation before because I always end up looking like a clown because it is so hard to blend the edges and find the right shade for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> All of the imperfections I was self conscious about disappeared with a little dab of the full concealer brush, there were no lines, and although my face will never be flawless (thanks to a number of freckles)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants to look like you have fake airbrushed skin and have people comment that your make-up job is beautiful, then this is not the make-up you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have never ever worn foundation or pressed powders before because the colors never seemed to look right on my skin</li>
            <li> But the biggest problem I have on my face is my birthmark, on the right side of my lower lip.  </li>
            <li> When you put the right color on, your skin will look radiant.</li>
            <li> I think if you have normal/combo skin type and can find the right shade</li>
            <li> This makeup gives me a natural looking flawless finish that I was never able to acheive with liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have never in the past 4 years used anything that cleared my skin and looked so natural and beautiful on!</li>
            <li> colors that come with this kit are very natural and blend easily into my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I am a Bare Escentuals user for life now!</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals!</li>
            <li> i have never been able to find a lightweight coverage that worked, but bare minerals does!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it&#x27;s very hard to goof up, you don&#x27;t need to be a makeup artist to fake perfect skin.</li>
            <li> They feel fantastic on the skin, and they feel like high quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be a good value for my initial purchase, because you get all the brushes, which are high quality, and you can try the basic products to find which will be most useful for you.  </li>
            <li> I ordered bare minerals about a month ago and LOVE it.   </li>
            <li> I love my Bare Escentuals BareMinerals.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li> I tried Neutrogena mineral sheers ($12) for awhile before I tried the Bare Escentuals, for the money I would have to say it was a better</li>
            <li> I ended up having to purchase the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; foundation separately and mix the fairly light and light with Everyday Minerals colors I already owned to get a color that is appropriate for my face.    </li>
            <li> of the most positive things I can say about this beauty product is that it more uniformly covered my dark circles and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different of course, but I love the stuff and if you can afford to give it a chance I feel it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I also love the BE Club that you can join where they will automatically send you two more foundations in the mail every few months</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t gotten used to putting it on very fast</li>
            <li> I was really thrilled with how quickly my order was shipped out to me (despite the typical shipping dates and schedules).    </li>
            <li> There is a specific way you need to apply it in order to get the desired results, but you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s so quick and easy to do</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have good skin just a little oily and this product seemed to stick to those areas alot.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had bought it the first time I saw it on TV.  </li>
            <li> was in a hurry during the first week that I was using BE</li>
            <li> I have FINALLY found my magic potion.  </li>
            <li> I did not like it for the first week</li>
            <li> I recently switched to this makeup and love it.</li>
            <li> while my regular foundation ($65, top name brand) faded, creased in the lines around my eyes, and didn&#x27;t cover as well.  </li>
            <li> even my husband&#x27;s eyes lit up when he first saw me wearing it.  </li>
            <li> She asked me if I&#x27;d like to try it, and I said yes; I had seen the info-mercial and was interested in the product.   </li>
            <li> My grandmother first tried this then got both me and my mother hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now and already my skin feels softer and my skin tone appears to be more even.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin looks better without makeup on so whatever is in this makeup is improving my overall skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have clear, smooth skin for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li> you want the first time around.</li>
            <li> I hesitated for months before finally purchasing the Bare Escentuals Get Started Kit - Fairly Light/Light for 2 reasons:  </li>
            <li> Warmth is a bit dark for fair skin but it can be used, albeit very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I first found out about this product from my Aunt who refuses to wear anything else.</li>
            <li> All of the products can be used many different ways.  </li>
            <li> I watched the video first (it is not too long)and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I do have oily skin, so I did not use a moisturizer first, and that seemed to work well for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the starter kit first and adding on from there.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it out</li>
            <li> or you might use too much!</li>
            <li> The first step they tell you is to put on the bareVitamins Rev-upper.  </li>
            <li> (of course, I was using too much at first too.</li>
            <li> For first time buyers, I recommend purchasing one of the get started kits.</li>
            <li> so many competitors out there coming out with the same principle of powder foundation/makeup</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying this kit, you may want to try the foundation first at a Sephora store, like I did.</li>
            <li> after you put it on for the first time, go away from the mirror for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> With daily practice my results have become more uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The warmth and glee colors add a nice bit of color to your face (though I prefer the warmth, the glee is a bit too pink).      </li>
            <li> First, I chose standard shipping (because I&#x27;m cheap), but received it almost immediately!  </li>
            <li> You definitely get a more translucent look with this product than you do with the drugstore brands...</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say you should \\&quot;proceed with caution\\&quot; when watching any infomercial.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many different companies who now sell mineral makeup, and even Maybelline or Cover Girl  is now selling it.</li>
            <li> /cleaning my face consistently.  </li>
            <li> I found myself falling in love with the way it made my skin look and feel, and how simple it was to apply!</li>
            <li> I first tried bareMinerals at a friend&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li> The instructional video was very helpful and as I purchase more Bare Minerals products I refer to it often.  </li>
            <li> so i ordered the makeup about two weeks ago and the first day i used it</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this was because the makeup was having an adverse interaction with my face lotions.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately not everything works for everyone.  </li>
            <li> short, I absolutely *love*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried *a lot*).</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope everyone out there can get the same results as I did.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;ll just try some of the eye products at Sephora, first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands and types of foundation but have never found anything I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> is different than most others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying more and can&#x27;t wait to try their eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you put on moisturizer and/or the skin revver upper before applying the foundation.    </li>
            <li> For anyone who is interested in trying BE</li>
            <li> It is a must have for a smooth surface to apply bare minerals and it cleared my skin!!!  </li>
            <li> The colors are easy to blend, and you can easily use them with other blushes, bronzers...    5)</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews and seeing most were positive, I finally decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews, but I just had to say that this is a great little product!    </li>
            <li> I can not wear the Warmth, its too red and dark but the Clear Radiance is wonderful.    </li>
            <li> The foundation powders do not yield any coverage remotely close to my skin shade despite the fact that I have fairly light to light skin.  </li>
            <li> The mineral veil puts such a nice soft focus to your skin.  </li>
            <li> first step was to buy the Bare Escentuals Light/Fairly Light starter kit.</li>
            <li> I did buy the clear radiance all over color later and that is really nice.  </li>
            <li> And I used to wear it to coverup all the red spots and blemishes that is not so much the case any more.</li>
            <li> .. looks very natural, and its so clean and gentle that you can sleep in it.  </li>
            <li> This Get Started Kit comes with a DVD to show you how to apply the makeup, but honestly, the foundation is pretty idiot-proof, even for someone like me who&#x27;s not very comfortable with applying makeup.</li>
            <li> it is kind of messy and it takes time to get the look right</li>
            <li> The positive:  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll send the product back because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for foundation, but I think I&#x27;ll shop around a little more before I buy a second time from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll send the product back because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for foundation, but I think I&#x27;ll shop around a little more before I buy a second time from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> I should have guessed that something wasn&#x27;t going to work out quite right when the DVD that came with it showed the CEO of the company looking particularly orange</li>
            <li> The Light is almost too dark for me but the Fairly Light is exactly my skin color.  </li>
            <li> I love every product I have tried and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> , I will probably shop around and see what else is available before I purchase Bare Escentuals again.</li>
            <li> I have fair translucent color skin with dark circles under the eye with dry patches in cheeks, fine lines on forehead and crows feet.</li>
            <li> whole Bare Minerals line, if used correctly, will probably give everyone that soft, natural, beautiful look most people crave but can&#x27;t get from heavy liquids and powders that don&#x27;t ever really match.</li>
            <li> The only negatives that I have are that the brushes, although extremely soft, lose their bristles very easily.  </li>
            <li> and if you are even a hint curious about this product I strongly advise you to order it!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and find that it won&#x27;t apply well then you probably need to use a better skin cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing regime.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily T zone and it did keep that area dry most days</li>
            <li> i watched the first part of the video, and after about 1 minute putting on the fairly light makeup, i was simply AMAZED.</li>
            <li> I tried traditional liquid foundation once after using Bare Escentuals and I was quickly reminded why I love this makeup so much.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea around my nose, large pores, and I still find myself fighting acne at the age of 35.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup wearer, largely because I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of it on my face and, no matter what, I always look \\&quot;made up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> It also makes my pores look large.  </li>
            <li> If you have medium to large pores, any blackheads or wrinkles, this product seeps into them.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try Bare Escentuals, and used it for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> loose powder w talc makes me sneeze, regardless of brand - I wanted better options.   </li>
            <li> , it is addicting because everything seems to suit my skin tone extremely well, and if it doesn&#x27;t the first time, it seems if you are creative you can think of a way for it to work for you.  </li>
            <li> I do not look like I have make-up on just really pretty vibrant skin.   </li>
            <li> This one--the Bare Minerals--in particular makes it sound as if EVERY skin problem will be miraclously</li>
            <li> And also, the fairly light color tends to be a little yellowish, so I end up using a lot of light.  </li>
            <li> My face has redness and acne scarring but no one can tell anymore thanks to this make-up.  </li>
            <li> I have so much to say about this product.</li>
            <li> The coverage lasts all day, and by using the mineral veil just once after the initial application my face stays shine free all day, even though I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, it blends very well and doesn&#x27;t appear cakey at all.  </li>
            <li> The trick here is not to put too much  </li>
            <li> Since using bareMinerals, the redness in my skin has been reduced, and I do not break out as much.</li>
            <li> A clear skin day was a rare occurrence.</li>
            <li> but, you have to give it a couple of uses before you really get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> If you have really oily skin</li>
            <li> The dvd with the kit was very informative and taught me everything I needed to know for applying this make-up and achieving the look I want.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t see the coverage, then I used too much so that it looked like I was wearing a mask.  </li>
            <li> thing that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned here too much is the BareVitamins foundation primer which comes with the kit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> My whole face looks</li>
            <li> it was all very helpful.</li>
            <li> As soon as I went back to cheap Neutrogena foundation from Rite Aid....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent value for money since so much stuff comes with the starter kit.  </li>
            <li> have found that exfoliating and using a moisturizer are very helpful in preparing your face (like a canvas) for mineral make up.  </li>
            <li> the 1st time cause I used way, way too much....</li>
            <li> it is highly informative and will keep you from using excess product (and thereby wasting $$!).  </li>
            <li> and I found I had to REALLY cake it on to match the coverage and even tone that BE provides effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> (the infomercials were very alluring).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 (can pass for 30) and I don&#x27;tneed to have a dry-looking (or feeling) face, and I&#x27;m getting really picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> The dvd with the kit was very informative and taught me everything I needed to know for applying this make-up and achieving the look I want.  </li>
            <li> I think we all know that any cheap eyebrow pencil would have had the same</li>
            <li> And there was way too much shine on my face.</li>
            <li> in \\&quot;fair,\\&quot; which is light enough for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make up when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I really think it is the make up.</li>
            <li> which I like) shine through while still getting a smoother looking face because you really do have a lot of control with this system.</li>
            <li> Its like a mini massage really.</li>
            <li> You can apply several light layers until you have the look you want.  </li>
            <li> You really can sleep in it--</li>
            <li> These foundations/bronzers work very well to brighten your face.</li>
            <li> I started to really like it.  </li>
            <li> concealer\\&quot; brush adds way too much make up.</li>
            <li> If I use it I end up with splotchy areas where you can really tell I have make up on.    </li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t really use the concealer brush with foundation, but I do use it to put on eyeshawdow and found that I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really wish this product would have worked for me....</li>
            <li> These people may have overly oily skin and used too much.  </li>
            <li> is probably going to be too much.  </li>
            <li> But I also recommend checking out the \\&quot;sheer radiance\\&quot; (which again, was included in another kit I got) - it reflects light and makes your skin look dewy and so smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have oily skin, and I really recommend it for others with it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found much use for these, yet</li>
            <li> This stuff really does cover up your problem spots, and my skin has cleared up a lot.</li>
            <li> While it is not as matte as my former makeup, it looks much more natural.    </li>
            <li> Not that I needed the brushes, but they are at least good, usable brushes...and I will use the mineral veil, but the rest of the stuff will probably get thrown away.    </li>
            <li> I have medium sized pores near my nose and even with the foundation and veil on, does not camoflauge them, and actually brings them out more.  </li>
            <li> My face overall looks more even, soft and radiant than ever.  </li>
            <li> My face overall looks more even, soft and radiant than ever.  </li>
            <li> I am also starting to see the fine lines and crow&#x27;s feet that come with getting older.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other foundation -- you really have to use the proper shade for your skin to look good.      </li>
            <li> I live in hot humid San Antonio,TX</li>
            <li> It really seems to help heal my acne better and faster than any other product on the market.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin problems are not major--relatively mild, but Bare Minerals made no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> The finish is quite good - it is not flawless, but I guess I would need something thick and masklike to achieve that look, so I am pretty happy with this.  </li>
            <li> The original kit that I bought lasted me for almost an entire year, and I didn&#x27;t even use all the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> but it looks a lot better than any other concealer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and other acne medication, but they are so drying to my skin that they create more problems than they solve.</li>
            <li> This starter kit is essential for a first time user, the DVD it comes with is very helpful!!  </li>
            <li> Once you order your kit, you may also find many other brushes you want to order and try, but these three will give you your powder foundation coverage.</li>
            <li> They definitely aren&#x27;t low quality, but the first time you use most makeup brushes they shed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than any liquid foundations I&#x27;ve tried and is comparable to any other pressed powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD is also useful, and application IS as easy as they say once you get a little practice.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had such a clear and glowing complexion since the last time I was in love!</li>
            <li> Make sure to let both DRY completely.</li>
            <li> I would warn to go very easy handed on the \\&quot;Warm\\&quot; skinlighting product in the kit if you&#x27;re pale complexioned....</li>
            <li> The BE was definitely better at covering blemishes and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This starter kit is an excellent value for this product line, which can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> I am glad I went light-I think the medium would have been too dark for me.</li>
            <li> The mineral vein helps to stop all of that embarassing oil that accumulates on my forehead and nose, and it is so quick, so easy, and I never have to worry about getting my fingers messy with liquid foundations, or having the foundation ball off of my face!  </li>
            <li> Bare escentuals diffuses light and enhances the look of my skin in ways that no other make up ever did.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can get as little or as much coverage as I need.  </li>
            <li> you get new makeup or something because it is really dark?\\</li>
            <li> Less is more.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure to do an inspection of my face, neck and chest (or clothing) before leaving the house to ensure I&#x27;m not covered in black bristles.</li>
            <li> I felt like any foundation I used made me look older and was too noticable - I don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product i love it .. and dont let any negtive comments affect your purchase because everyone has different skin, so the results will always be different!  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product, however if you have sensitive skin you may experience itching after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I finally found a makeup that lasts all day and looks light and natural.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my skin is dryer and it tends to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; makeup.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything from applying the mineral veil first and then applying after everything else, or just applying the mineral veil first or just applying the mineral veil last.</li>
            <li> I also love that it includes two shades because let&#x27;s face it, our faces never stay the same color too long, and you can always mix and match, unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried (and trust me,</li>
            <li> \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; and other blushes are great to mix in and add a little color to your face \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a natural part of a new brush, but after over 6 months of use, it&#x27;s still happening.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this combo wouldn&#x27;t be light enough for my very fair skin; and 2) I haven&#x27;t worn foundation since I was in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> No dry look to my skin, my acne was barely visible, all that was there was a smooth even complexion.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are high quality makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if your thinking about purchasing, 1 for color matching purposes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem that high quality.</li>
            <li> It will keep mineral makeup from caking and falling into wrinkles (even in high humidity).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of endlessly searching for the perfect makeup, stop the search here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally normal and all you need to do is take your index finger and thumb and lightly pluck the brush to get the loose hairs out</li>
            <li> Also, if you are looking for a little more coverage- get the Tinted Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> I do like to blend for a little more color.    </li>
            <li> The application is really simple and you are left looking like yourself, only better!</li>
            <li> It looks so natural!!</li>
            <li> Even though I am unable to use the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; the starter kit is still a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> It really does look natural and feels like you have nothing on.</li>
            <li> But I have very oily skin, frequent breakouts, and brown spots (melasma), and I have been searching for years to find something to deal with these issues.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel cakey, and it has a natural look to it - you won&#x27;t go out in the natural light and discover your face is a different color than the rest of your body!</li>
            <li> Most of the make-up has a clear yellow hue to them, so if you have no yellow in your skin (still try it of course!)</li>
            <li> : You cannot apply this makeup like normal makeup.</li>
            <li> I rarely use make up until I had a scar on my forehead last Fall.  </li>
            <li> For 5 months now I have been using the kit , and now have graduated to just buying the product individually, it was completely worth the 60 bucks to \\&quot;test drive\\&quot; the makeup.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals offers full coverage with a totally natural look.  </li>
            <li> the money back guarantee gave was worth it.</li>
            <li> but if you would rather spend you money on other items (shoes, clothes, jewlery etc) then there are other products out there that are just as good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend Bare Escentuals to anyone interested in trying something new makeup-wise.  </li>
            <li> I have never watched the DVD,but if you watch the informercial a couple of times, the concept is not hard to pick up.  </li>
            <li> You have to hand it to BE for great marketing hype, but unfortunately, the product just doesn&#x27;t live up to it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the foundation should last for several months, but I am going through the mineral veil very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This makeup is easy to apply and actually covers pimples and red marks.  </li>
            <li> , I put the mineral veil on, take a tissue and very lightly rub it over my makeup to take off extra powder and after that it looks great, but that&#x27;s just an extra step, which is inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> can even apply the makeup right after going to the gym, when my face is so red</li>
            <li> I will no-doubt use them with my other powders and my bare escentuals eye shadows (which I love, by the way.).  </li>
            <li> It polishes your final look and really give it that soft, smooth final touch we so desire in makeup.</li>
            <li> With this make-up I don&#x27;t feel pale and I feel confident because it looks SOOOOO natural!  </li>
            <li> With this make-up I don&#x27;t feel pale and I feel confident because it looks SOOOOO natural!  </li>
            <li> about BE is that it&#x27;s not very travel friendly and the jars all match</li>
            <li> It took so little time (which is always a plus, because personally, I&#x27;m busy from almost 0600 to 2300 every day, and I never have to spend more than five minutes</li>
            <li> and i said its my new makeup</li>
            <li> Nothing new.</li>
            <li> Nothing new.</li>
            <li> But with the benefit I have seen, I will remain a loyal customer for quite a long time!</li>
            <li> But, Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action Moisturizer from Johnson and Johnson (around $6 in my area) is my favorite to use as a primer and to keep mineral makeup from itching or irritating my skin in anyway.</li>
            <li> I was starting to not like the handy buki brush, it seemed to put it on to heavy.  </li>
            <li> When you get the starter kit, the first thing you might notice (if you&#x27;re cheap like me) is that the jars are SMALL.  </li>
            <li> with, but on a daily basis, I really don&#x27;t wear much as I don&#x27;t like feeling all cakey and maskey.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals certainly meets this requirement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the mileage I get out of this makeup, but a problem I have is that I&#x27;m very pale with pink undertones, and the light/fairly light make me look too yellowy.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the light and fairly light are too dark for me.</li>
            <li> First of all, I live in Florida and about 6 months out of the year, I will start sweating within 10 minutes of being outside.  </li>
            <li> My pores look smaller, and I actually look younger because this makeup gives you a youthful, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I feel feminine and look fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> They wanted to know how I&#x27;d managed to look exactly the same at age 33 as I did at 22!</li>
            <li> I have some larger pores on my nose and the first time I used this makeup according to the technique described, it somehow accentuated the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find a regimen that works for you, go to a spa or a dermatologist and get a consultation done, it&#x27;s well worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I splurge on foundation in general and always get the \\&quot;good\\&quot; stuff, not from the drugstore, and I didn&#x27;t think a powder could do much in the way of coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Skin Revver Upper smells funny</li>
            <li> A little bit of warmth goes a long way into making my skin like nice and glowing, almost like that sun kissed look.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the starter kit off the website which included a bisque concealer, which covers more naturally and completly than any other concealer I&#x27;ve used.      </li>
            <li> Thirdly, I had difficulty getting the right coverage on my small bit of scarring, despite how easy the DVD told me it would be.  </li>
            <li> and I have not even used half of the Fairly Light and</li>
            <li> They are fun and can be used dry or moist (as well as blended) for varying effects.    </li>
            <li> About my skin (it matters): I have fair skin, yet find that this color can be TOO dark for my skin in the dead of winter when there is 10 hours a day of sun.</li>
            <li> And by glowing I don&#x27;t mean shimmery or shiny - just a fresh, clean, natural glow.</li>
            <li> It actually covers up my flaws better than my previous liquid foundation</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily,w/ acne, and can be dry at times when I put to much acne med.</li>
            <li> Although it left my dry skin with a smooth finish, I never felt that it was moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my previous skincare line (Prescriptives) because I prefer a more dewy finish to my skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, the brushes that come with the set are incredibly cheap and rough, and left my skin red and irritated for some time afterwards.  </li>
            <li> But in the past few years, I&#x27;d noticed more and more lines and found that skin make up made me look fresher and younger.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine purchased the Bare Escentuals kit and found it didn&#x27;t work well for her, particularly since she travels for business each week</li>
            <li> but on the rare days that make-up would be ridiculous, I wear the foundation, a tad of Warmth, and a sweep of True on my lids.  </li>
            <li> - just be sure not to overdo it - I found out the hard way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if your like me (fair and oily) or even a little oily then don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Clear Radiance &lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave my skin a week to clear up</li>
            <li> especially like the mineral veil (which you put on after your makeup for that soft, \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; finish) &amp; the warmth (which really does provide you with a sun-kissed glow</li>
            <li> This coverage looks natural.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t completely cover those spots (which no makeup does anyway)</li>
            <li> My skin is not getting nearly as oily as it used to.  </li>
            <li> I guess better late than never.  </li>
            <li> The product claimed that it worked well for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> THough she&#x27;s a natural beauty, I by no means am one myself.</li>
            <li> I use a  gentle facial cleanser to balance me out and</li>
            <li> &amp; I make sure to leave it on my face for at least 30 minutes then</li>
            <li> Much to my surprize, I discovered that application of the foundation and Mineral Veil is enough for my skin to retain moisture throughout the day.   </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am 16 and have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and am often complimented on how \\&quot;young\\&quot; I look.  </li>
            <li> I can go a whole day without even reapplying (just the occasional blotting is all you need)!</li>
            <li> I have oily (and sensitive and 29 year old) skin</li>
            <li> We went to a spa to buy it, where a professional makeup artist demonstrated how to apply it.</li>
            <li> The makeup is so natural looking.</li>
            <li> I know that I have found the makeup that will take me through my 30&#x27;s and beyond with a natural, healthy-looking glow.beyond with a natural, healthy-looking glow.</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up with my old makeup.</li>
            <li> I also bought the \\&quot;MD Formulations Cleansor for Sensitive Skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> We both have sensitive skin prone to redness.  </li>
            <li> it focuses peoples attention away from flaws and on your natural beauty.  </li>
            <li> I end up being completely covered in bristles</li>
            <li> but this is where the buffing action comes into play....</li>
            <li> and I have old acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I have wear makeup since I was 13 years old and I am 37 now.</li>
            <li> Application Brush - Wonderfully soft brush that I use for foundation, blush, and mineral veil.</li>
            <li> It covers my scar (a fairly deep scar) very well now combining with the Multi-Bisque (Summer Bisque) for coverage purposes.    </li>
            <li> I am 14 years old</li>
            <li> It looked so natural.</li>
            <li> If I sweat just a tiny bit my face gets very itchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come near my eyes with any of the products in this kit.  </li>
            <li> Even with that, my skin still had a powder look, so to make it look really natural</li>
            <li> The makeup completely agrivates my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had to leave friends early in order to go to the bathroom to wash the makeup off, otherwise I was going to be clawing at my face</li>
            <li> and after I&#x27;ve washed the makeup off, my whole face looks red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I found this make-up just searching through Amazon and ordered it directly from the company because they give you a 30-day moneyback guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the make-up</li>
            <li> Bottom line, if you have a store anywhere near you</li>
            <li> Bottom line, if you have a store anywhere near you</li>
            <li> I have stopped using this product and my skin has since cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> I now have to fight my adult acne AND wrinkles....</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised that this does cover redness and blemishes.</li>
            <li> But the brushes do feel soft and work well.</li>
            <li> my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as oily as it used to be.</li>
            <li> So, my advice is really to go to a professional make-up counter that carries this line, and let them help you find your color.</li>
            <li> The only liquid foundations that do not do that are the heavy oil-based types, which irritate my skin and make it redder and more prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re interested in make-up beyond just the basics of foundation, then I suggest buying one of the larger expanded kits directly from the Bare Escentuals website so that you can get the money-back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t deterred by my first experience with Bare Minerals when a sweet but inexperienced sales clerk incorrectly applied a sample to my face and it looked absolutely horrid, a cakey mess that emphasized and magnified every flaw.</li>
            <li> one and only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t travel well, but given all the other great qualities I give it all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Other foundations are heavy and cakey, where this is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Believe me it doesn&#x27;t take much, when you&#x27;re first starting out use a little bit at a time until you get an idea of how much you need.  </li>
            <li> In the past I have used liquid foundation and thought it looked great indoors and then looked at myself outside in natural light and thought the color was all wrong.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly priced and it actually cost less then the department store brands I used previously.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used liquid foundation and thought it looked great indoors and then looked at myself outside in natural light and thought the color was all wrong.  </li>
            <li> The price may seem a bit extreme, but trust me, it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; powder (which I know a lot of reviewers have complained about), but I generally like a more natural look and</li>
            <li> I will admit that this make-up did not cover as well as I thought it would, but I have very fair skin and trying to cover dark circles or acne scarring is difficult with any makeup.  </li>
            <li> I used other expensive brands for foundations, powders prior but found Bare Escentuals&#x27; foundation works the best.  </li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals makes sure that you have the right brushes and aren&#x27;t using $1.50 Walmart brand brushes that might give you the wrong effect.    </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got dry skin, definitely use a nice heavy moisturizer after the revver-upper stuff that&#x27;s included in this kit.</li>
            <li> Fourthly, I didn&#x27;t get the reassuring feel that makeup usually gives me--that sensation that I look better, that added piece of confidence.  </li>
            <li> I have major reddish tones and blemishes are frequent.   </li>
            <li> The liquid settled into my crinkles, Mousee applied with foundation brush was okay, but kinda tired looking, and the new hydrationg creme was a rash.  </li>
            <li> I had to jump in and share my experience with Bare escentuals in the hopes that it will help new users or those unsure about trying Bare escentuals.</li>
            <li> It has the same effect as the regular Mineral Veil, but it adds a little bit more coverage.</li>
            <li> I have never loved a makeup more.</li>
            <li> a lot of the product really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> BTW, my face is sensitive and I cannot use the cleansing/moisturizing products from Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li> Feels:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals every day since I received it early this week.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of expensive stuff in the past (most recently MAC) and this is so much better!</li>
            <li> only problem I have ever had with this product is the fact that if you travel with the pots they will become top heavy and whenyou open them or try to tap into the lid they may spill.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because I need something with significant coverage and some of the reveiws made it sound like that was hard to get from this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product while in New York at their local Sephora store.  </li>
            <li> I had started using a new skin cleaning regimene at the same time</li>
            <li> I see there are new companies with this same mineral idea</li>
            <li> and have had combination skin my whole life while living in both dry and humid climates.  </li>
            <li> This is what happened to me, which is sad because I really liked the coverage and that it is natural.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars was that it doesn&#x27;t last for the whole day, so you have to bring extra in your purse to re-apply (spl?)</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I have exceptionally sensitive, pale skin with roseacea.  </li>
            <li> Some people have very, very sensitive skin and have allergies to things that may not bother the vast majority of others.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Bare Minerals all the way for me!  </li>
            <li> But from now on, I&#x27;m a Bare Escentuals girl!</li>
            <li> I guess, if anything, the Bare Minerals nourish my skin!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, and looks quite natural if you can find your right skin tone.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It takes a little practice to get the \\&quot;swirl, tap, buff\\&quot; technique down, and please know that the buffing is very important.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I ever used a loose powder foundation and I have been totally converted.   </li>
            <li> suffer from age spots, light acne, dark undereye circles, sensitive skin and due to PCOS, hirsutism.  </li>
            <li> Kit is definitely the way to experiment with Bare Escentuals because you receive samples of two shades of foundation, several other products, and three full size brushes.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, while the lighter option in the starter kit was suitable for my skin, if not ideal, the &#x27;warmth&#x27; jar did not in any case look natural or flattering.  </li>
            <li> Bare minerals has also helped minimize my breakouts.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find a foundation that looked natural I finally gave up and stopped wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> To avoid losing money altogether, I&#x27;ve used my Bare Minerals as a finishing powder...over the concealer and foundation</li>
            <li> I got online and ordered bare minerals.  </li>
            <li> I think part of the results is using the bare vitimins lotion every morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this kit, and have been using Bare Minerals for about a week now.  </li>
            <li> My mom bought me this Bare Escentuals Kit after trying it herself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been 3 weeks using the Bare Escentuals and 2 weeks with the Philosphy products.</li>
            <li> (For both the Bare Escentuals and the Hope in a Jar.)</li>
            <li> I had been going on bare skin with blended concealer for 10+ years and that had worked for me, but heading into my mid-30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I wanted a product that would conceal different flaws than those I had as a 20-something young</li>
            <li> I brought this product after watching the QVC Bare Escentuals program</li>
            <li> I use the Bare Escentuals foundation and blush every day and have for years.  </li>
            <li> I find when I try to use a liquid foundation that it feels like a mask in comparison to the Bare Escentuals product.</li>
            <li> I bought bare escentuals after watching an infomercial about four years ago.</li>
            <li> I went to a Bare Escentuals store, to have it applied by make up specialist.</li>
            <li> Note the girl in the store applied a TON of product, I had asked for medium coverage, so ask for minimal application this way you can really see what it looks like.</li>
            <li> As far as foundation, blush, and powder, I am going back to using Estee Lauder: Foundation-</li>
            <li> I was applying it properly and it looked natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried the sleep test, several times not on purpose, and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, but I never used to breakout when I slept in my old makeup either.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried my old makeup (loreal color match, primer, and powder)</li>
            <li> I felt absolutely gross trying to wash off my old makeup after wearing it for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use bare escentuals AFTER concealer</li>
            <li> I tried Bare Escentuals 5 years ago and made the switch.  </li>
            <li> So when I went to Saphora and just happened to try Bare Minerals I was in heaven.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely used it.</li>

            <li> Bare Escentuals i.d.</li>
            <li> When I use Bare Escentuals, I feel like there is nothing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now, I barely have acne coming out from my face</li>
            <li> I could barely see the pores after that.</li>
            <li> The Bare Minerals Face Color 36077</li>
            <li> I have mild-moderate acne on my chin, jawline and forehead and even with the bare minerals you can still see a couple of the spots, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> I have mild-moderate acne on my chin, jawline and forehead and even with the bare minerals you can still see a couple of the spots, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> After trying Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li> I decided to try Bare Escentuals, based on the recommendation of a friend.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Bare Minerals Starter Kit while on break from college</li>
            <li> I just will stick with my bare skin and my clinique.  </li>
            <li> That is until I tried Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always use liquid foundation for my combination skin,but when I saw all the Bare E. ads,I thought:\\&quot;Whoopee\\&quot;,makeup in a minute!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals products are all I use.  </li>
            <li> That said, I am a Bare Escentuals fan.  </li>
            <li> I stronly recommend trying it out in-store at Sephora or Bare Escentuals stores before buying it.</li>
            <li> as a matter of fact the more you have on the worse</li>
            <li> I have regular breakouts, large pores on my cheeks, oily skin on my forehead and around my eyes, dry skin around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> I also thought since I have dry skin this makeup would accentuate the dryness and facial lines, but it did exactly the opposite!</li>
            <li> I live in Texas where the climate is hot and humid but this product does not get slick on my face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get decent coverage of my red splotchiness (which is very mild and easily covered by my normal liquid makeup) and now mattter how much or little I used the results either looked unfinished or unnatural, not to mention the coloring was bad.    </li>
            <li> It really takes so little of the minerals to give complete coverage.</li>
            <li> Thanks, but NO THANKS!  </li>
            <li> it is a little bit messy but it could just be me. :)</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have the worst complexion in the world, it is FAR from perfect.</li>
            <li> I also seperately purchased a blush and an eye lining brush to be able to put a little of the bronzer (included in kit) along my upper lashline to give a little definition.</li>
            <li> When I used the ones in my set the first time they shed a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty unpredictable skin with plenty that needs to be covered up, and this is the only make up I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t turn application into a headache.  </li>
            <li> I actually purchased my starter kit on the Bare Minerals website.  </li>
            <li> I use to have a lot of red areas on and around my nose and the bare minerals has even helped that.  </li>
            <li> Since trying Bare Minerals about 6 years ago, its now the only makeup I will use.  </li>
            <li> With Bare Escentuals my skin can breathe and therefor the acne medication I use actually works now</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who said results vary, and I wanted to give my opinion and personal experience with the Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li> However, if you have the chance to go to a Bare Escentuals store, or Sephora, or a store that carries this line, then go in and have them match your skin to the proper color.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding a shade at first.</li>
            <li> I watched the informercials on tv a few times, and was always interested in the products</li>
            <li> Not only do the crushed minerals shimmer ever so delicately, they are magical once they touch your skin.</li>
            <li> - This is a great little brush for applying a second layer of foundation to help cover dark under-eye color and other trouble spots.</li>
            <li> In fact, when it is hot/humid, I make an extra effort to blot my face first, and brush a little Mineral Veil on my skin to absorb excess oil.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, as many  people  have reported, had difficulty working with such small containers with the  powder making a mess.</li>
            <li> with other makeup i usually feel like i have a ton of [...] on my face and by the end of the day it wears off but bare minerals stays on your face all day and it feels so light</li>
            <li> But they mean it with Bare Escentuals when they say less is more.  </li>
            <li> Even my seventeen year old daughter uses it and she has extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I find my self taking less time to get ready.</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend an hour getting ready, if I can&#x27;t do it in less than five</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is definitely the makeup of the future.</li>
            <li> I just use whatever is left on the lid without putting any in, and see a barely noticeable difference, but that is not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, slight acne, and a few fine lines around the eyes and</li>
            <li> I will stick with the Prescriptives that my dermatologist reccomends--it&#x27;s not cheap, either, but it lasts quite a long time, does not irritate my skin, and makes me feel a little better dressed when I leave the house in the morning.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to use blushes because I am naturally pink and don&#x27;t want to be over-pink, but \\&quot;Glee\\&quot; looks very natural on me.)  </li>
            <li> If you are pale the light/fairly light may be too dark.  </li>
            <li> The warmth is waaaay too dark for pale skintones, I don&#x27;t understand why they included it in the light skintone kit.  </li>
            <li> I have used liquid cheap and expensive, Mousse, and new covergirl creme .</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s and have been struggling with mild acne since a teen.</li>
            <li> My own experience is that I have terribly dry skin, and makeup always looks caked on and fake.</li>
            <li> so you can use Light if you get a little tan in the summer and add a little of the pigment.  </li>
            <li> I decided, \\&quot;Hey, if it sounds like an informercial in real life, why not?\\&quot; So I splurged a little.</li>
            <li> the other three are nearly new.  </li>
            <li> But by the end of the fourth day, I realized my face was absolutely covered with tons of little bumps.</li>
            <li> My disastrous store demo was done over an otherwise perfectly fine face cream I was wearing, which I am sure caused the bad results by creating a barrier that just sort of soaked up the minerals and lay on my skin like dust on top of the refrigerator...</li>
            <li> My large pores are less noticible and my breakouts after nearly a year of use are less severe.</li>
            <li> then a non-comedogenic (no oil, non pore clogging) lotion for the dry spots and then apply my bare escentuals.</li>
            <li> I used all sorts of heavy full coverage foundations to try to hide my imperfections, but they only made me look heavily made up and actually accentuated my flaws.  </li>
            <li> As far as the dry skin goes, I also suffer from dry skin (my hubby and I were stationed in North Dakota...</li>
            <li> If you are worried about if this product will work on you or if you&#x27;re not sure which shade to buy, I highly suggest visiting a Sephora or Bare Essencials store if there is one in your area.</li>
            <li> I learned that you don&#x27;t just brush these bare minerals products on like you would a loose foundation</li>
            <li> and I am hoping that it is not the minerals that are making my skin itchy, so I will try other mineral makeup products, such as Sheer Cover, but I am not tempted to buy Bare Escentuals again.</li>
            <li> Rosacea, large pores, dry spots, acne, all topped off with really pale skin that freckles.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time with these at first.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin, especially in the winter, and definitely needed makeup to even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I am one of the skeptics that has watched the infomercial for the last several years and was too chicken to try it.</li>
            <li> One thing I recommend though, if you are very fair-skinned is not to go overboard with the bronzer.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found Bare Escentuals earlier because it would have saved me frustration and aggravation of trying other makeups.   </li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other foundation after using Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> I looked online for other reports of acne and clogged pores after using Bare Escentuals, and found out that one of the ingredients (bismuth oxychloride) actually can cause breakouts in some individuals.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> All I know is that I wish I had tried this a long time ago and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> but if used judiciously, it will last quite a long time....</li>
            <li> However, I found that the Bare Escentuals did not not really cover my acne at all</li>
            <li> With Bare Essentuals I had the same problem with my makeup looking caked on and fake, but not nearly as bad</li>
            <li> Because of the oilyness of my skin, other makeups usually end up being useless by the end of the day, but BE keeps looking great all day long!</li>
            <li> i have never found such complete, color-matched coverage from so little makeup.</li>
            <li> Also had a huge problem with itching, I mean little twitches here and there</li>
            <li> It was a pain, and I resigned myself to the horrible truth that I would never be able to wear \\&quot;real\\&quot; foundation, just a light powder.  </li>
            <li> Basically every night before going to bed I put on Ponds dry skin cream on my face the next day  </li>
            <li> (I use Ponds for extra dry skin)</li>
            <li> Viola-my flaws are hidden and I look natural.  </li>
            <li> my nose isn&#x27;t red, my dark circles are gone, it barely looks like i am wearing anything at all.</li>
            <li> Warmth is simply too dark for my porcelain skin with pink undertones-and I use it in the method consistent with the dvd, which is a tiny amount like a pin head of a few grains of salt.     </li>
            <li> My face broke out all over in little red bumps after using Bare Minerals for only a week.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been limping along with a liquid foundation until I finally broke down and went to Sephora and tried some samples of the Bare Escentuals brand.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way with this stuff so use less than you think you should at first.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I went to work for the day with my regular foundation on one half of my face, and the BE on the other half.  </li>
            <li> I put the bare escentuals back on and my skin is a mess again.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not exactly fresh-faced, but I&#x27;m far from aged.  </li>
            <li> does not feel heavy at all, does not \\&quot;slip\\&quot; like some powders do, absorbs oil very well for me, does not settle into the experience lines (like other foundations)</li>
            <li> &quot; It does advertise other products, like the Skin Rev-ver Upper and Basic Eye</li>
            <li> &quot; It does advertise other products, like the Skin Rev-ver Upper and Basic Eye kit.    </li>
            <li> It is just more complicated than other makeup.</li>
            <li> saw previous posts about dry skin or sensitive skin that felt as thought he make up burned them.</li>
            <li> (you can choose how long.  </li>
            <li> As long as I apply my moisturizer, which I do twice a day anyways</li>
            <li> breakouts are few and far between now.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I saw Bare Minerals on an infomercial and asked for it for Christmas just a few months back.</li>
            <li> smaller &amp; less frequent breakouts than when using conventional liquid/powder foundations.    </li>
            <li> It has lasted me for months, and it only takes a little bit to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> went through my make up drawer, tossed out all my former foundation and powders and cleansers and just use these items and whatever other cosmetics (lipstick and mascara)</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that putting your makeup on in the morning does not take long at all!  </li>
            <li> I use other powder based foundations and am never left with that sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Several other reviews have commented on this as well.</li>
            <li> It causes me to breakout just like other regular makeup.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to put all the other shoe boxes of make up in a closet somewhere, and maybe just take them out to play with occasionally!  </li>

            <li> This made my face extremely shiny, even after several layers of the mineral veil.</li>
            <li> It still looked amazing without feeling heavy or dirty.  </li>
            <li> It still looked amazing without feeling heavy or dirty.  </li>
            <li> My routine balancing act with my skin - which I must do with any makeup I&#x27;d wear - seems to manage any dry patches for me.</li>
            <li> Also, It may not work for you if you have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> have seen people say this product doesnt work with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin &amp;</li>
            <li> but it works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry and flakey because of my acne medicine so the make-up just caked on and emphasized my dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Also the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is absolutley a terrible shade for anyone with fairly light to light skin.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and the powder would dry my dry spots except for one thing...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> but I think it accentuated my dry spots.</li>
            <li> I also have periodic patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat oily T-zone combined with some dry areas</li>
            <li> It even seems to dry my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bareVitamins product in the kit contains the same active ingredient in acne medication (Salicylic Acid).</li>
            <li> Although i&#x27;m younger i have very bad acne scars and till about 3 weeks ago still had fairly embarassing acne.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend EVERY woman of EVERY age at least take this company up on its offer to try it.  </li>
            <li> , I solved the problem of looking under every single jar by labling the lids.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have large pores), every tiny line exaggerated &amp; my entire face looked coated with colored flour.</li>
            <li> - I finally watched this a year or more after my purchase when I was sick and felt like lying on the sofa and doing nothing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting the brushes that are made for this product because even though they run a bit expensive (in my opinion) they are very high quality and in the end you will end up using less makeup because of the way the brushes are made.   </li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about any product sold through infomercials, but this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and had very little break outs with my old liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> definitely not what I was expecting after putting down $75 for the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> definitely not what I was expecting after putting down $75 for the kit.     </li>
            <li> I noticed after using the product for a few weeks my face was not dry anymore!</li>
            <li> first I was very skeptical about this makeup, especially since it is much more expensive than what you can buy at the drugstore, but it was well-worth the price.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s dry in places and oily in others, and this stuff works like a charm!</li>
            <li> It would have made for much less stressfull teenage years.</li>
            <li> Especially if they even slightly began to sweat...such as when on a walk or even cooking dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, I typically skip the liquid foundation for the sake of time and use a powder foundation that I buy at the grocery store for about $5.00.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a slightly cooler tone, but it is close enough.  </li>
            <li> I find that my redness and the occasional pimple that I get are well hidden with this makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to admit that since I have started wearing this makeup, I have gotten lazy and now I don&#x27;t wash my face before I go to bed at night--however, I have never had a single breakout since I&#x27;ve worn Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li> One makes me orange and the other makes me yellow and both were way too dark.</li>
            <li> You only use a little of the product and buff it into your face.</li>
            <li> So when I saw how tiny the jars were, I was feeling a little bit of buyers&#x27; remorse...    </li>
            <li> I can actually see little oil droplets form.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I did not research and read reviews elsewhere, which most people were having a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Many of my close friends tell me \\&quot;You didn&#x27;t look bad before, but you look better.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> My boyfriend had always complained that I wore foundation, saying that I didn&#x27;t need it and it didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> The liquid foundation balls off of my face and left streaks and uneven areas on my skin.  </li>
            <li> So I finally wised up and quit using it, and my face cleared up within a few days.     </li>
            <li> Finding a makeup that covers those problems without making them worse has been a real issue.</li>
            <li> few weeks ago I decided that perhaps my makeup (Clinique) and skin care regime was the culprit and decided to research various options out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think I just spent $60 on some powder</li>
            <li> Then I apply the rest of the bare minerals as usual.    </li>
            <li> that means with the slightest bit of perspiration or like the time I bumped my forehead applying mascara while my hand was wet.  </li>
            <li> , I was never really satisfied - that is until I tried Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li> The only minor complaint I will have about using Bare Escentuals product is that this product is messy.  </li>
            <li> This was because the powder wasn&#x27;t settling into the deeper areas...same concept as when you run chalk over a rough surface and see that some areas aren&#x27;t touched by the chalk.</li>
            <li> Also be careful around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> The few times I slept in it, I broke out a lot the very next day.     </li>
            <li> It will only work for a few minutes</li>
            <li> My uneven, overly red cheeks now fade into the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> but it is a nice base for the make up.    </li>
            <li> I have what my dermotalagist calls mild acne, but this past year there has not been one day where my skin wasn&#x27;t broken out.  </li>
            <li> and I guess this is a common reaction for people with highly sensitive skin due to an ingredient, bismuth oxide.  </li>
            <li> The only caution I would have is for those who have extremely oily skin or need to use heavy moisturizer under their make up.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts and less redness overall.</li>
            <li> I found that my occasional acne became less and less with this product.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it my results were not flawless as advertised - this was to be expected.</li>
            <li> After trying this kit (and following the instructions verbatim from the DVD that comes with it), I can wholeheartedly and honestly say the coloring was ALL WRONG for me, which is really disappointing having spent $60 on the kit.    </li>
            <li> I had a big bare spot where my hand had touched, and trying to blend in new BareEscentuals foundation without being noticed was impossible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While learning to apply it properly, I was a little skeptical because I would use too much</li>
            <li> my skin is probably about average, a bit oily, a bit dry, redness across my nose, dark circles under my eyes, etc.</li>
            <li> notice some other reviewers of the product feel it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> It took, literally, minutes to do, and the rest of the day I walked past the mirror and constantly looked at my face because I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing!  </li>
            <li> if you have any issues at all with how to apply it correctly, it is usually priced the same.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried BE I used the wrong color for the foundation for my coloring.  </li>
            <li> and I admit I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product, I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> However, as other reviewers have pointed out, as the seasons have changed and my skin has started drying out with the colder weather, the product no longer \\&quot;performs\\&quot; like it once did.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the first application was horrible on me, partly because I didn&#x27;t watch the video and the Light foundation in the kit was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> In other words, if you have a pimple (like I do every month) or a scar, this won&#x27;t cover it up all the way.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with my other powders to lighten them.  </li>
            <li> but in the long run, it&#x27;s probably cost-effective as I will never again waste money taking chances on this and that cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Once you have your foundation on, the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> Be careful of this if you have them!</li>
            <li> Because my skin is dry, a heavy cream moisturizer was recommended before applying this makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have no facial skin problems, other than a few small wrinkles around my eyes and larger-than-I-like pores.  </li>
            <li> It also covers blemishes, imperfections and dark circles without the caked look of liquid concealers.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not effective enough for your level of dryness.  </li>
            <li> The foundation and mineral veil are really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is just way too dark and had orangy tones on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The eye and face colors will probably last at least 5 years the way I use them so sparingly.  </li>
            <li> it calms the redness and reduces the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I would have to say the product is not worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I also was careful not to be too heavy</li>
            <li> It takes so little time to apply and you can determine the depth of color of your eye color, a little or a lot, depending on time of day and event and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I found I do not have to re-apply \\&quot;viel\\&quot; to keep the shine down.</li>
            <li> On the way home, it was pouring down rain</li>
            <li> On the way home, it was pouring down rain</li>
            <li> am a believer and will not use any other makeup again!</li>
            <li> My dark undereye circles are less noticeable</li>
            <li> no more dry patches.</li>
            <li> Also, I have slight dark circles under my eyes and this does almost nothing for those.    </li>
            <li> I was reading these reviews online last night and was a little nervous because of the bad reviews even though the majority were positive.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the powders can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Thank you to all previous reviewers</li>
            <li> year-round and half the time</li>
            <li> I got out to check it and got half soaked, but my makeup didn&#x27;t flinch.  </li>
            <li> I got out to check it and got half soaked, but my makeup didn&#x27;t flinch.  </li>
            <li> The swirl, tap and apply on your skin concept sounded cheesy until two of my girlfriends highly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure if this is acne or something else, but it&#x27;s very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I researched online and found that other people had had similar or worse (cystic acne) reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li> I am so totally addicted to Bare Escentuals products.  </li>
            <li> and I did not want to cover them up but just tone them down a few notches and bareminerals</li>
            <li> After a few days, now have it down.  </li>
            <li> If your skin feels tight 5 minutes after you apply moisturizer</li>
            <li> tight, but not flaky.</li>
            <li> I think in the beginning the makeup emphasized my pores a little, but over time I think the use of the bare minerals foundation and a learning curve have dramatically decreased the appearance of my pores.   </li>
            <li> I let the moisturizer absorb for half an hour before applying the foundation, and it still caked on my skin, and in some places looked like a heavy old-fashioned pancake make up.  </li>
            <li> I  previously could not get rid of dry patches, anything agitating will make my skin erupt!!!!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it was one or the other</li>
            <li> I was a little worried the light/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a make-up minimalist, but like to have something that diffuses my 40+ yrs of experience lines and cover my little breakouts and discolorations.  </li>
            <li> was in a Sephora store and saw the little starter kit thingy and said what the heck?</li>
            <li> I watched the little DVD and tried it.</li>
            <li> If you look close, it tends to look a little \\&quot;crepey\\&quot; or \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; under my eyes.</li>
            <li> And have had absolutely no break outs!!!  </li>
            <li> With liquids I would keep layering it on to try and cover my sins only to end up having to wash it off and start over again because it looked worse than before.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments since I started wearing it.  </li>
            <li> and it did look unnatural and heavy.</li>
            <li> and it was too messy to deal with (\\&quot;powder everywhere\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> was too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months</li>
            <li> The product is also really messy to put on.</li>
            <li> I had trouble at the start with the foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have found dead sea salt scrubs in health food stores inexpensive ( around $13 in my area for 24 oz.)</li>
            <li> and there a few bristles would fall out</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the quality, or the price, of BE, I have used it everyday for 2 months and it isn&#x27;t even 1/2 way gone with the foundation and veil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people tell me to try out the primer with it, but I don&#x27;t think I want to waste anymore money.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t like to see people waste their money on something that is not what one would expect.</li>
            <li> I am 33 so have few wrinkles</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know that I would make it a part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> The makeup did not keep my skin from being shiny within a few hours, even when I used the recommended mineral veil under and over the foundation.  </li>
            <li> Messy,</li>
            <li> then the shine comes thru worse than regular liquid makeup and powder.  </li>
            <li> a few times I even slept with it on, which is a definate no-no....</li>
            <li> have also gotten a few blemishes since using the product and look forward to washing my face by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It was so much trouble.  </li>
            <li> After seeing all of the tv advertisements for this product, I had always wanted to try it but was hesitant to dish out so much money on a product that, ultimately, I could hate.    </li>
            <li> With this make up, a little goes a long way, it lasts me two months at the very least before needing to replace.   </li>
            <li> For winter I&#x27;ll have to invest in the pale foundation.    </li>
            <li> I even found a color for my extremely pale skin.  </li>
            <li> i am quite pale.  </li>
            <li> I have an unpleasant trifecta of skin issues - rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis - so I really feel self-conscious about my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has dried out over the past 3 months</li>
            <li> It is now impossible to see acne on my face thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> &quot; only works once I&#x27;ve had a bit of sun (which is difficult for someone who already has pale skin).</li>
            <li> I will add that I make very little money, so spending the money was a bit of a sacrifice...</li>
            <li> You can cover small imperfections with the concealer.</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin over the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to find something that matched my skin tone before.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this works for anyone else</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m stuck with the look today, since I saved my makeup for last this morning.  </li>
            <li> because when I have had makeovers in the past it seems like people try to make me even whiter than I already am and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how small of an amount you use or even if you dilute it with the foundation powder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I might even be persuaded to splurge and try out a few of their blushes!    </li>
            <li> because when I have had makeovers in the past it seems like people try to make me even whiter than I already am and</li>
            <li> (yes, no more acne)</li>
            <li> BIGGEST DRAWBACK: makes my skin intensly itchy whenever I sweat even a small bit.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure what the guarantee is</li>
            <li> Redness coverage is not very good.</li>
            <li> I am 18 and still have some problems with acne, it usually takes a liquid foundation, concealer and powder to cover my blemishes- a complex and time consuming procedure.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to those women, and men, that hate layers and layers of gunky, funky heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> Buff everything in but, not to hard or your skin just absorbs it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding make-up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not blotchy or hard to blend.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding make-up</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try to \\&quot;perfect\\</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t make my skin shiny by the end of the day (liquid foundation) or doesn&#x27;t look too caked on (pressed powder).  </li>
            <li> Used the dvd and just found it too hard to figure out.  </li>
            <li> AND I don&#x27;t have messy, heavy makeup on!!!</li>
            <li> I do not have bad or sensitive skin, but this product broke my skin out.</li>
            <li> To address a complaint that seem fairly common.  </li>
            <li> then my boyfriend (who was afraid of upsetting me) finally spoke up and said, \\&quot;Did</li>
            <li> The negative:  </li>
            <li> I am 33 and had stopped wearing foundation in my late teens, when my skin cleared up.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic....</li>
            <li> Maybe those who were unhappy failed to watch the video or used too much?</li>
            <li> and I was so confused about makeup, and I have a few pimples here</li>
            <li> ,you look really cakey?\\&quot;I ran to the ladies,looked close &amp; was appalled.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer, making choosing a foundation to use year round very difficult.</li>
            <li> Very small.  </li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> it was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I bought this since I saw it on an infomercial, but I have to say it surpassed all my expectations.  </li>
            <li> the colors weren&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t enough coverage.  </li>
            <li> I always felt like liquid makeup would clog up my pores and felt heavy, but powders always looked so fake.  </li>
            <li> The few times I have purchased another brand of eye shadow (and once foundation) from a designer, expensive line, I kicked myself.  </li>
            <li> Really not good for me.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is with the brushes - maybe my set is just a fluke, but they are the absolute worst quality!</li>
            <li> becauseI can use the brush at least!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try Bare Escentuals after reading a few of the reviews saying that it looked horrible on dry/problem skin.</li>
            <li> But to go from no make up for over a decade to liquid foundation was a tough transition...</li>
            <li> /&gt;So-- give it a week to become addicted to it.  </li>
            <li> Even if I hadn&#x27;t broken out, I didn&#x27;t like that the foundation was so shiny</li>
            <li> The trick is to exfoliate realy well, then move on to moisture (not just the moisturizer that comes in the kit), and then use 2 thin layers.</li>
            <li> will say I haven&#x27;t broken out at all since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours of wearing the minerals, though, both of us had crazy itchiness on our faces.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the tips and tricks and it&#x27;s still not great.</li>
            <li> but that has decreased with use.  </li>
            <li> The dual blending brush seems unnecessary to me.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, don&#x27;t be afraid of this product!</li>
            <li> And I am not being over dramatic.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy and disgusting and my skin got extremely oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed since I got my hopes up when in actuality this product is mediocre and not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I admit it can become quite expensive</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> me thinking the coloring was wrong, but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this kit just to see if I like it and I&#x27;ve used these products ever since.  I tried traditional liquid foundation once after using Bare Escentuals and I was quickly reminded why I love this makeup so much. I have combination skin, slight acne, and a few fine lines around the eyes and this makeup does wonders for my skin.  It feels like I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup.  Also, I apply it in the morning and don&#x27;t have to touch up my makeup throughout the day.  Oh, and the brushes do make a difference.  This kit made me a long-term customer.</li>
            <li> My face has redness and acne scarring but no one can tell anymore thanks to this make-up.  I searched for something that would cover up my imperfections for yeasr and finally i have from the pefect product.  My friend used Bare Escentuals long before I did and turned me onto this make-up.  I admit it can become quite expensive but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> First let me say it&#x27;s a good product if you have the yellow undertones.   NOT EVERYONE HAS YELLOW UNDERTONES.  I found the products limiting, as my skin is neutral.  ALIMA COSMETICS gives a far better range for your skin tones.  Feels better too.</li>
            <li> I have so much to say about this product. It has made such a difference. I have pretty unpredictable skin with plenty that needs to be covered up, and this is the only make up I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t turn application into a headache.  With liquids I would keep layering it on to try and cover my sins only to end up having to wash it off and start over again because it looked worse than before.  This coverage looks natural.  It is sheer so it doesn&#x27;t completely cover those spots (which no makeup does anyway) but it greatly minimizes them and you are left with a very natural look.  The best part is that it&#x27;s very hard to goof up, you don&#x27;t need to be a makeup artist to fake perfect skin. I found this to be a good value for my initial purchase, because you get all the brushes, which are high quality, and you can try the basic products to find which will be most useful for you.  I would order this kit to get you started, and then purchase the products individually after that as you need them.  I was on the auto delivery plan but found that A: I needed a different foundation color than was offered in the kit and B: I wasn&#x27;t going through the products at the same rate.  I was out of the one foundation color yet I had a full container of the warmth. I bought a new foundation color called \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; that matched my skin much better than the \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot;. It was five times the size of the one that comes in the kit and cost $25 which was much better than spending $50 for a refill of the kit when all I needed was the foundation.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that this makeup lasts longer than others, but the great thing about it is that you can reapply right over the top of the existing makeup and it still won&#x27;t get cakey.  Bare minerals has also helped minimize my breakouts. It has really showed its advantages as the weather is getting more humid.  My skin is not getting nearly as oily as it used to.  All in all I am very happy with this product and only wish that I had purchased it sooner.  It would have made for much less stressfull teenage years.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a makeup that stayed on almost all day.  I have oily/combo skin and Clinique makeup contains mineral oil that dries skin and makes me break out.  This makeup is the first I&#x27;ve ever used that goes on easily and looks fantastic.  I just wish I had bought it the first time I saw it on TV.  I guess better late than never.  My daughter loves it and she hates to wear makeup.  I am buying a starter kit for her.  From someone who has tried myriad types and brands, this is the only one I will ever use again.</li>
            <li> After channel-surfing and seeing the infommercial for this product, I decided, what the heck.  I&#x27;m sure glad I did!  This is the best make-up ever.  When you see the informmerical you think, right, sure powder can provide flawless coverage, but it really does.  It also covers blemishes, imperfections and dark circles without the caked look of liquid concealers.  The brushes included in the starter kit are high-quality and work great.  The coverage lasts all day, and by using the mineral veil just once after the initial application my face stays shine free all day, even though I have oily skin.  After using it only once, I immediately ordered the kit for my daughter, and she loves it too!  I also threw away all of my liquid foundation.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else!  The only problem I ran across is that the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is too dark for my fair skin, and I look sunburned if I use it, so I bought a tub of \\&quot;glee\\&quot; and it looks great.  Even though I am unable to use the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; the starter kit is still a great bargain.  In fact when I run out, I&#x27;ll probably get another starter kit instead of just ordering the powder foundation just to get more brushes!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Bare Minerals! I have fairly oily skin and acne scarring with the occasional break out. Because of the oilyness of my skin, other makeups usually end up being useless by the end of the day, but BE keeps looking great all day long! If you are worried about if this product will work on you or if you&#x27;re not sure which shade to buy, I highly suggest visiting a Sephora or Bare Essencials store if there is one in your area. &lt;br /&gt;I was in a hurry during the first week that I was using BE and I hadn&#x27;t gotten used to putting it on very fast so I decided that I would wear a liquid foundation just so that I could get out of the house quicker. Big Mistake! It felt heavy and disgusting and my skin got extremely oily. I will never wear regular make-up again! The Bare Vitamins lotion that comes in this kits is also really nice. It really seems to help heal my acne better and faster than any other product on the market. Also, if you are looking for a little more coverage- get the Tinted Mineral Veil. It has the same effect as the regular Mineral Veil, but it adds a little bit more coverage. &lt;br /&gt;If you already own this product and you have oily skin and your skin still seems to have excess oil try putting on the Mineral Veil once before the foundation, once after, then again after you apply warmth.</li>
            <li> I researched this product extensively and finally purchased it.  I was excited to try it.  The product claimed that it worked well for sensitive skin.  I could only wear it one day.  After about six hours, I had to go home to wash it all off because it burned and itched so badly.  My face was very red after I washed it off.  I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the mileage I get out of this makeup, but a problem I have is that I&#x27;m very pale with pink undertones, and the light/fairly light make me look too yellowy.  I found that mixing the light foundation with the Clear Radience helps make the light foundation more pink for those who need it,and setting it with Mineral Veil helps lighten it up even more if you do this.  I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s dry in places and oily in others, and this stuff works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, My best girlfriend got me hooked. THough she&#x27;s a natural beauty, I by no means am one myself. But I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments since I started wearing it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive, combination skin, you name it I have it. I have regular breakouts, large pores on my cheeks, oily skin on my forehead and around my eyes, dry skin around my nose and mouth. Prior to application I use a  gentle facial cleanser to balance me out and then a non-comedogenic (no oil, non pore clogging) lotion for the dry spots and then apply my bare escentuals. My routine balancing act with my skin - which I must do with any makeup I&#x27;d wear - seems to manage any dry patches for me. My large pores are less noticible and my breakouts after nearly a year of use are less severe. If I dont tap enough powder from the the brush before applying is the only time I&#x27;ve I noticed a cakey effect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different of course, but I love the stuff and if you can afford to give it a chance I feel it&#x27;s worth it.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find a foundation that looked natural I finally gave up and stopped wearing makeup. I felt like any foundation I used made me look older and was too noticable - I don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing makeup. This stuff is awesome!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you need a ton of coverage, but it does a great job of covering up redness and uneven tone is your skin. Also, It may not work for you if you have extremely dry skin. You can cover small imperfections with the concealer. Use a teeny tiny bit of the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; just where the sun would hit your face, and some blush (this is not included in the kit). A little goes a long, long way with this stuff so use less than you think you should at first. My pores look smaller, and I actually look younger because this makeup gives you a youthful, healthy glow. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing make up for over 45 years and have been using this product for about 4 years now.  I have FINALLY found my magic potion.  I highly recommend EVERY woman of EVERY age at least take this company up on its offer to try it.  They refund your money if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, and for some ladies it may not be the magic cure.  It is for me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have spent a mint on makeup  and skin care products over the years, evolving from the inexpensive drug store brands to the not so inexpensive department store offerings in an attempt to find a product that looked and felt natural. Bare Minerals certainly meets this requirement AND I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin over the past couple of years.  I no longer have the ugly deep pores on and around my nose and in the T-Zone that would clog up and be just really disgusting.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While learning to apply it properly, I was a little skeptical because I would use too much and it did look unnatural and heavy. But I mastered the technique of applying a different kind of foundation using tools I&#x27;d never used before and am thrilled with the results.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I notice some other reviewers of the product feel it is a bit pricey. I&#x27;ve found it to be of excellent quality and value because you need to use so little of it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The starter kit is just that...a STARTER kit.  It is an introduction.  After mastering Foundations 101 in the starter kit, I ventured off to the eye and lip products.  LOVE THEM!!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of my favs: &lt;br /&gt;  Skin Reverupper &lt;br /&gt;  Bisque and Summer Bisque (MUST HAVE) &lt;br /&gt;  Clear Radiance &lt;br /&gt;  Buxom Lips &lt;br /&gt;  Neutral Lip Liner &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product a year ago because a friend was using it.  I did not like it for the first week I used it, but now I cannot ever imagine wearing liquid foundation ever again.  It takes some getting used to and the coverage is natural which is what I came to love. &lt;br /&gt;I have never in my life gotten so many compliments on how beautiful my skin is -- and it really isn&#x27;t!  I have major reddish tones and blemishes are frequent.   &lt;br /&gt;I do recommend purchasing the all over face bisque.  that is the concealer that hides all of the imperfections.   &lt;br /&gt;So-- give it a week to become addicted to it.  I have now switched over 4 co-workers, my sister, and several of my friends.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing.  I have probably the lightest skin you will ever see in your life, and yet this still manages to match my skin tone perfectly.  I was never able to find something that matched my skin tone before.  Also, it blends very well and doesn&#x27;t appear cakey at all.  I especially love the \\&quot;bisque\\&quot; (concealer) because it covers up my acne very well.  The price may seem a bit extreme, but trust me, it is well worth the investment.  It has lasted me for months, and it only takes a little bit to cover your entire face.  I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased my starter kit on the Bare Minerals website.  After seeing all of the tv advertisements for this product, I had always wanted to try it but was hesitant to dish out so much money on a product that, ultimately, I could hate.    For nearly three years I have sold Mary Kay and thought that I would always love their products, but soon found that I could not wear MK foundation with my skin medication.  The liquid foundation balls off of my face and left streaks and uneven areas on my skin.  It was a pain, and I resigned myself to the horrible truth that I would never be able to wear \\&quot;real\\&quot; foundation, just a light powder.  Of course, this was upsetting everytime I broke out or had blotchy redness from the sun.  Nothing I could do would cover it up!    A girl who lived in my apartment building this summer said that her mom had started using Bare Minerals and absolutely loved it, so I went and did some research.    I was sold when I saw you could get a full refund if you weren&#x27;t satisfied, and purchased my starter kit that very day.    When the package came in the mail, I was so excited that I actually put it on when I was at work just to see if I liked it.  It took, literally, minutes to do, and the rest of the day I walked past the mirror and constantly looked at my face because I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing!  All of the imperfections I was self conscious about disappeared with a little dab of the full concealer brush, there were no lines, and although my face will never be flawless (thanks to a number of freckles) I have NEVER seen my skin look so beautiful.  The mineral vein helps to stop all of that embarassing oil that accumulates on my forehead and nose, and it is so quick, so easy, and I never have to worry about getting my fingers messy with liquid foundations, or having the foundation ball off of my face!  The warmth, also, gave me a glow that I&#x27;ve never been able to duplicate with blush, and it&#x27;s just absolutely amazing.    I also love the BE Club that you can join where they will automatically send you two more foundations in the mail every few months (you can choose how long.  From 1 to 6 months)  And, instead of paying 25 for each, you only pay 20, saving 10 dollars on your foundation!    I would recommend this product to anyone.  Although I would caution you if you have red undertones instead of yellow.  Most of the make-up has a clear yellow hue to them, so if you have no yellow in your skin (still try it of course!) but know that the yellow and red may not mix!</li>
            <li> I recently switched to this makeup and love it. It gives great coverage, is easy to put on and feels so much better than my old liquid makeup. I have recommended it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li> I love this product; been using it for a couple of months &amp; it rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a light skin so i use the fairly light powder &amp; it works!!!  The trick here is not to put too much  so make sure to use a good light when u put it on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen people say this product doesnt work with dry skin. I have dry skin &amp; it works.  Basically every night before going to bed I put on Ponds dry skin cream on my face the next day  once my face is washed I put Ponds cream on again &amp; I make sure to leave it on my face for at least 30 minutes then once it dries I put the lotion thats provided in the Kit &amp; do the rest.  Not sure if this works for anyone else but it works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My face broke out all over in little red bumps after using Bare Minerals for only a week.  Since I have a little acne anyway, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Bare Minerals was the culprit, so I kept using it for a couple more weeks--plus the advertising was so convincing about how good it&#x27;s supposed to be for your skin.  I researched online and found that other people had had similar or worse (cystic acne) reactions to this product.  It turns out that it contains Bismuth Oxide which causes some people to break out in an itchy red rash within minutes of applying it.  So I finally wised up and quit using it, and my face cleared up within a few days.     Even if I hadn&#x27;t broken out, I didn&#x27;t like that the foundation was so shiny--it&#x27;s impossible to achieve a matte look.  I&#x27;d rather have a matte foundation and apply something shimmery where I want it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good mineral make up, I recommend J. Lynne instead (available through their website).</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these products. My goal was to find a natural-looking foundation that minimized rosacea (around my nose and forehead) and that evened my skin tone overall. Now, my skin problems are not major--relatively mild, but Bare Minerals made no improvement at all. My face had the appearance of a sheer layer of powder--with all the imperfections just as visible underneath. To avoid losing money altogether, I&#x27;ve used my Bare Minerals as a finishing powder...over the concealer and foundation I&#x27;m back to using.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation for my skin type that I have found.  I have rosacea, and the bareMinerals provided enough coverage to even out my skin tone.  Both shades were warm enough to conceal the redness of my skin.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was when I used moisturizer underneath the foundation.  I let the moisturizer absorb for half an hour before applying the foundation, and it still caked on my skin, and in some places looked like a heavy old-fashioned pancake make up.  The next day I tried it putting the Mineral Veil between the moisturizer and foundation as suggested in the directions, but it did not help.  When I tried the foundation without moisturizer, the finish was excellent.  Much to my surprize, I discovered that application of the foundation and Mineral Veil is enough for my skin to retain moisture throughout the day.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bareMinerals foundation is much better for my skin type than liquid foundation.  On my skin, liquid foundation pools in my pores, leaving my cheeks, nose, and chin with a spotted appearance.  The only liquid foundations that do not do that are the heavy oil-based types, which irritate my skin and make it redder and more prone to breaking out.  Since using bareMinerals, the redness in my skin has been reduced, and I do not break out as much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Get Started Kit is definitely the way to experiment with Bare Escentuals because you receive samples of two shades of foundation, several other products, and three full size brushes.  The instructional DVD is also useful, and application IS as easy as they say once you get a little practice.  The only caution I would have is for those who have extremely oily skin or need to use heavy moisturizer under their make up.</li>
            <li> This kit is wonderful. Make sure to get the brushes too, and not just but the foundation. I feel great just putting this on. It covers my acne scars and my current acne. I can&#x27;t even see my blackheads. Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try Bare Escentuals after reading a few of the reviews saying that it looked horrible on dry/problem skin. I have an unpleasant trifecta of skin issues - rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis - so I really feel self-conscious about my skin. Finding a makeup that covers those problems without making them worse has been a real issue. Everything either looks flaky and gross, provides insufficient coverage, or triggers breakouts/redness/flaking. (Sometimes all three.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been limping along with a liquid foundation until I finally broke down and went to Sephora and tried some samples of the Bare Escentuals brand. Because my skin is dry, a heavy cream moisturizer was recommended before applying this makeup.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Long story short - this stuff actually works!! This Get Started Kit comes with a DVD to show you how to apply the makeup, but honestly, the foundation is pretty idiot-proof, even for someone like me who&#x27;s not very comfortable with applying makeup. I can understand the instruction for the eye makeup (which isn&#x27;t included in this kit anyway), but the foundation is really, really easy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can even apply the makeup right after going to the gym, when my face is so red I look like I&#x27;m about to drop, and the coverage is so good that my skin looks calmer in seconds. I seriously can&#x27;t believe it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got dry skin, definitely use a nice heavy moisturizer after the revver-upper stuff that&#x27;s included in this kit. Other than that, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about any product sold through infomercials, but this stuff is fantastic! When I first got it, I went to work for the day with my regular foundation on one half of my face, and the BE on the other half.  The BE never faded, creased, got shiny ... while my regular foundation ($65, top name brand) faded, creased in the lines around my eyes, and didn&#x27;t cover as well.  The BE was definitely better at covering blemishes and dark circles under my eyes. I also thought since I have dry skin this makeup would accentuate the dryness and facial lines, but it did exactly the opposite! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am 16 and have sensitive skin.  I have what my dermotalagist calls mild acne, but this past year there has not been one day where my skin wasn&#x27;t broken out.  I have tried covergirl, burts bees, phsycians formula you name it.  My skin was dry and flakey because of my acne medicine so the make-up just caked on and emphasized my dry skin &lt;br /&gt;.....But then about a month ago I decided I&#x27;ve had enough!  I got online and ordered bare minerals.  The day it arrived I put in the video and effortlessly applied the make-up. I was amazed at what I saw when I was done!  No dry look to my skin, my acne was barely visible, all that was there was a smooth even complexion. Since I&#x27;ve ordered this I quit using my acne medicine(proactive).  And have had absolutely no break outs!!!  I think part of the results is using the bare vitimins lotion every morning and night.  It is a must have for a smooth surface to apply bare minerals and it cleared my skin!!!  I have never in the past 4 years used anything that cleared my skin and looked so natural and beautiful on! I will never use anything else and if you are even a hint curious about this product I strongly advise you to order it! You will be so glad you did! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh one more thing...I recently ordred 4 of there eyeshadows and 2 eyeliners.  The colors are brilliant and last all day!!  Same thing with the eyeliner, I just use an avon brush and it gives a perfect line sure to never smudge!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I bought this since I saw it on an infomercial, but I have to say it surpassed all my expectations.  The coverage is awesome, and sheer.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any make-up at all and even my husband&#x27;s eyes lit up when he first saw me wearing it.  I actually bought the starter kit off the website which included a bisque concealer, which covers more naturally and completly than any other concealer I&#x27;ve used.      To address a complaint that seem fairly common.  As far as the dry skin goes, I also suffer from dry skin (my hubby and I were stationed in North Dakota...enough said).  Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!  If your skin feels tight 5 minutes after you apply moisturizer it&#x27;s not effective enough for your level of dryness.  As long as I apply my moisturizer, which I do twice a day anyways (I use Ponds for extra dry skin) I have no problem with this product making my skin look or feel flaky, which I did with traditional liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals (Essentials) makeup has to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.  I always felt like liquid makeup would clog up my pores and felt heavy, but powders always looked so fake.  Bare Escentuals is the perfect mix between the two.  It comes in powder form so its easy to apply with the brushes, but it goes on smooth like liquid.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all, and looks quite natural if you can find your right skin tone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; and other blushes are great to mix in and add a little color to your face \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;.  I highly recommend getting the brushes that are made for this product because even though they run a bit expensive (in my opinion) they are very high quality and in the end you will end up using less makeup because of the way the brushes are made.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first I was very skeptical about this makeup, especially since it is much more expensive than what you can buy at the drugstore, but it was well-worth the price.  The original kit that I bought lasted me for almost an entire year, and I didn&#x27;t even use all the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;.  I wish I had found Bare Escentuals earlier because it would have saved me frustration and aggravation of trying other makeups.   If you&#x27;re tired of endlessly searching for the perfect makeup, stop the search here.</li>
            <li> I went to Saphora so that they could demonstrate it on my skin and tell me which color range I would need. The foundation covered blotchiness and redness. I was sold on the spot. It really takes so little of the minerals to give complete coverage. I bought the $60 Getting started kit. I also seperately purchased a blush and an eye lining brush to be able to put a little of the bronzer (included in kit) along my upper lashline to give a little definition. Next, I&#x27;ll purchase the compact for touchups. My 61 year old skin never looked better.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and am often complimented on how \\&quot;young\\&quot; I look.  I have no facial skin problems, other than a few small wrinkles around my eyes and larger-than-I-like pores.  A friend of mine purchased the Bare Escentuals kit and found it didn&#x27;t work well for her, particularly since she travels for business each week and it was too messy to deal with (\\&quot;powder everywhere\\&quot;).  She asked me if I&#x27;d like to try it, and I said yes; I had seen the info-mercial and was interested in the product.   This morning, I used it in place of my Loreal True Match foundation.   To my dismay, I zoomed from 40 to 50(+!) in a heartbeat.   The powder accentuates my fine wrinkles (and lo and behold, I have more than I thought I did!), makes my under eye area look ghastly, and my eyelids baggy. Thanks, but NO THANKS!  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m stuck with the look today, since I saved my makeup for last this morning.  Tommorow, Hello Loreal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this kit, and have been using Bare Minerals for about a week now.  I am so happy with this product!  It covers flawlessly, including dark-undereye circles and acne and rosacea outbreaks. It also controls the oil in my T-zone wonderfully.  I can go a whole day without even reapplying (just the occasional blotting is all you need)! It&#x27;s very important to watch the instructional DVD that comes with the kit first. There is a specific way you need to apply it in order to get the desired results, but you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s so quick and easy to do, you&#x27;ll never want to bother with liquid make-up again!</li>
            <li> I bought the kit two weeks ago and I have been using it ever since.  I have oily (and sensitive and 29 year old) skin so I use the mineral veil under and over the foundation.  In fact, the foundation should last for several months, but I am going through the mineral veil very quickly.  The finish is quite good - it is not flawless, but I guess I would need something thick and masklike to achieve that look, so I am pretty happy with this.  My dark undereye circles are less noticeable (I haven&#x27;t tried the bisque conclearer yet, but I am ordering some) and my face is more even-toned and matte, without looking powdery.  I also love the built in sunscreen.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this if you truly want *full* coverage, but for a you-only-better look, I think this is great.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer, making choosing a foundation to use year round very difficult. My mom bought me this Bare Escentuals Kit after trying it herself. Bare Minerals is definitely the makeup of the future. I use moisturizer in the morning and put everything in this kit on top of that (using the instructions provided by the video) and it feels like I have no make up on. I have noticed a drastic improvement in my skins texture and color. I have less breakouts and less redness overall. Other foundations are heavy and cakey, where this is light and fresh. You look like you only prettier. I would recommend this kit to anyone, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> My grandmother first tried this then got both me and my mother hooked on it. It doesn&#x27;t cover up the circles under my eyes 100% but it looks a lot better than any other concealer I have ever tried. I also love that I can&#x27;t feel it on my face and at the end of the day it is still there. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now and already my skin feels softer and my skin tone appears to be more even. I have fairly oily skin and my face will barely have any oil on it by the end of the day. We went to a spa to buy it, where a professional makeup artist demonstrated how to apply it. It sounds like to me that a bunch of people who don&#x27;t like it didn&#x27;t put it on correctly. Many places that sell this product will give a free demonstration on how to apply the makeup and which foundation you should use as a concealer and which you should use as your all-over foundation. This will be different for different skin tones.  If you can find a place that will give a demonstration, I would reccomend you buy it from there if you have any issues at all with how to apply it correctly, it is usually priced the same. In my case, the dvd would not have been enough.</li>
            <li> I have never ever worn foundation or pressed powders before because the colors never seemed to look right on my skin (I have very fair skin) and I would always break out. I have oiler acne prone skin so I just gave up and wore blush and eye shadow for most of the years I have been wearing makeup. I saw Bare Minerals on an infomercial and asked for it for Christmas just a few months back. I absolutely love this makeup! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The colors that come with this kit are very natural and blend easily into my skin. The brushes are very soft and really do a wonderful job of tucking the powder in and then buffing it into my skin. A little bit of warmth goes a long way into making my skin like nice and glowing, almost like that sun kissed look. The mineral veil puts such a nice soft focus to your skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the powders can be a bit messy. I once spilled some warmth on my counter top and was pulling up the color for days every time I would clean up the area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best part about this makeup is how light it feels, how easily it comes off with my face wash and I do not break out with it AT ALL. In fact, my skin looks better without makeup on so whatever is in this makeup is improving my overall skin tone.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am a believer and will not use any other makeup again!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but just had to chime in about this product. I am in my late 30s and have been struggling with mild acne since a teen. I wondered if I would ever \\&quot;out grow\\&quot; the acne phase, especially since I color my hair to hide the gray. (I envisioned myself in the nursing home one day still dealing with acne flare ups.) I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and other acne medication, but they are so drying to my skin that they create more problems than they solve. My acne wasn&#x27;t horrible, just annoyingly chronic. A clear skin day was a rare occurrence. I also have dry skin, especially in the winter, and definitely needed makeup to even skin tone.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I decided that perhaps my makeup (Clinique) and skin care regime was the culprit and decided to research various options out there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My first step was to buy the Bare Escentuals Light/Fairly Light starter kit. I noticed an immediate result the first time I used it! My skin looked fantastic. It felt like I was not wearing any make up at all. After a week of using this product, my acne had reduced dramatically. I think my former make up was clogging my pores and the sponge applicator I used was too harsh for my skin. My only issue was that my skin looked too shiny, so I decided that my moisturizer needed some updating as well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My second step was to buy Philosphy&#x27;s Purity cleanser and Hope in a Jar moisturizer. After 1 use of Hope in a Jar my skin was perfectly matte after applying the Bare Escentuals. No shiny areas at all!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has now been 3 weeks using the Bare Escentuals and 2 weeks with the Philosphy products. I am amazed to report that I have NO ACNE AT ALL! Not even during my period. I have clear, smooth skin for the first time ever.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went through my make up drawer, tossed out all my former foundation and powders and cleansers and just use these items and whatever other cosmetics (lipstick and mascara) I care to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I could not behappier with the results. The makeup is so natural looking. The Fairly Light is the shade that works perfectly for me. The Light will be nice to incorporate in the summer when I have a tan. I love the Mineral Veil and the Warmth too. The brushes are excellent.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way. (For both the Bare Escentuals and the Hope in a Jar.) Less is more. You can always apply another coat of the mineral make up if you don&#x27;t get the coverage you want the first time around. The mineral make up literally melts into your skin, minimizes pores, and makes your face look flawless. I absolutely love this product and I am a Bare Escentuals user for life now!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to be introduced to this line of cosmetics at Sephora.  The foundation powder really works with your skins natural oils to give a gorgeous glow.  This kit is great because of its value.  The brushes are perfect and you get two shades of foundation which is nice so you can use Light if you get a little tan in the summer and add a little of the pigment.  The kit is great for starters.  I have had it for a few months and I have not even used half of the Fairly Light and the other three are nearly new.  So you get all you need and when the foundation runs out you have the option of buying it separately.  If you like this kit I also recommend the crown jewels kit which comes with some great eye brushes and the best black liner powder plus a bunch of other awesome products.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with these at first. The trick is to exfoliate realy well, then move on to moisture (not just the moisturizer that comes in the kit), and then use 2 thin layers. It dosen&#x27;t work well as a concealer and those items will need to be purchased seperately(keep it mind you will need the BM concealer or you&#x27;ll just get cakey lines from regular concealer). Buff everything in but, not to hard or your skin just absorbs it. I&#x27;ve noticed that it may not look great right away but after it fuses with your skin (about 30 mins to 1 hr) it looks like really good (good coverage, no lines, not overly made up). I tried it on my mom and it didn&#x27;t look so great (she&#x27;s 55)it just seemed to settle in lines and didn&#x27;t blend so well, others have mentioned issues with more mature skin. I&#x27;m 29 and it still looks good but, you have to give it a couple of uses before you really get the hang of it. Overall it gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Bare escentuals has become my best friend when it comes to imperfections.  I have suffered from acne for many years, and this product really covers and helps heal acne and the scars.  I highly recommend it.  If you have really oily skin i advise you apply some mineral veil before applying the make up.. looks very natural, and its so clean and gentle that you can sleep in it.  In the set you will receive a video with some great tips on how to apply it.  I will keep buying this product i love it .. and dont let any negtive comments affect your purchase because everyone has different skin, so the results will always be different!  Good luck :)</li>
            <li> All my friends use this and they look great so I bought it. I had trouble finding a shade at first. I bought the fairly light/light. Fairly light was to light but the light works great I might need to go one shade darker still. I don&#x27;t wear makeup all of the time and when I do this is quick and easy.   It makes my skin look very smooth. I love it, but with everything it is not for everyone.  I rated it a 4 b/c it is a little bit messy but it could just be me. :)</li>
            <li> The first time I tried BE I used the wrong color for the foundation for my coloring.  I used the one that was recommended for \\&quot;75% of everyone who tried Bare Escentuals\\&quot;; however on my face it looked grey toned and I was discouraged.  After about an 18 month period I tried again and ordered another color that was lighter and was perfect for my coloring.  What a differece.  I love this makeup.  It takes so little time to apply and you can determine the depth of color of your eye color, a little or a lot, depending on time of day and event and a little goes a long way.  YOU have control not the compacts of color  most companies offer women.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products.  I came across it on-line at Sephora with no knowledge of it and decided to try it out.  I don&#x27;t consider myself very experienced with make-up application as I have always just gone for the simplest look.  The dvd with the kit was very informative and taught me everything I needed to know for applying this make-up and achieving the look I want.  I have fair skin, freckles and red hair.  I have a hard time finding make-up I like because when I have had makeovers in the past it seems like people try to make me even whiter than I already am and I like to have color on my face.  With this make-up I don&#x27;t feel pale and I feel confident because it looks SOOOOO natural!  In the past I have used liquid foundation and thought it looked great indoors and then looked at myself outside in natural light and thought the color was all wrong.  With this I have seen that it looks great no matter what kind of lighting I&#x27;m in.  After starting with this kit I went on to buy the Beyond the Basics kit, Get Started Eyes, and Brow kit, I LOVE it all!  I am so happy that I tried this make-up, I know that I will be using it exclusively from now on.</li>
            <li> My face reacted horribly to this product. It began to burn horribly and itch within the hour after applying the product to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I did not research and read reviews elsewhere, which most people were having a bad reaction. Especially if they even slightly began to sweat...such as when on a walk or even cooking dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From further research I found that the bismuth oxychloride is the cause and am now seeking a mineral makeup that does not contain this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brushes that come with this kit will fall apart and leave tons of brush hairs on your face, which are a pain in the rear to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I hesitated for months before finally purchasing the Bare Escentuals Get Started Kit - Fairly Light/Light for 2 reasons:  1) I was afraid that this combo wouldn&#x27;t be light enough for my very fair skin; and 2) I haven&#x27;t worn foundation since I was in my early 20&#x27;s so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the need for it.  I had been going on bare skin with blended concealer for 10+ years and that had worked for me, but heading into my mid-30&#x27;s I wanted to look more polished and I wanted a product that would conceal different flaws than those I had as a 20-something young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with my purchase - once I got the hang of it, that is.  I think I experienced most if not all of the problems that users have written about here.  I used not enough so I didn&#x27;t see the coverage, then I used too much so that it looked like I was wearing a mask.  What I was happy with from the start was that \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; was a good color for me despite being warm instead of neutral.  I was also very pleased with Bare Escentuals as a foundation because the application time was minimal, it didn&#x27;t feel like makeup and, most importantly, it delivered what it promised:  a smooth glowing complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned here too much is the BareVitamins foundation primer which comes with the kit.  I love it!  A light dab before makeup application gives a smooth surface on which to apply the foundation.  It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included in the kit:  Flawless Application Brush, Full Coverage Kabuki Brush, Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush, Mineral Veil and Warmth All Over Face Color.  The brushes are high quality makeup brushes.  I love them.  Mineral Veil is a shine stopper and it works well.  Warmth is a bit dark for fair skin but it can be used, albeit very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is an amazing kit.  It is a great way to introduce yourself to the Bare Escentuals line of makeup products.  I know that I have found the makeup that will take me through my 30&#x27;s and beyond with a natural, healthy-looking glow.beyond with a natural, healthy-looking glow.</li>
            <li> I brought this product after watching the QVC Bare Escentuals program and I admit I was a bit skeptical at first. I am 18 and still have some problems with acne, it usually takes a liquid foundation, concealer and powder to cover my blemishes- a complex and time consuming procedure. I decided to try this product and was thrilled by the results. This product simply works. All my blemishes and redness were cover more effectively than my Clinque makeup had done. I live in Texas where the climate is hot and humid but this product does not get slick on my face. This is an excellcent buy and I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking at this kit to purchase for a friend as I have been a user of these products for several years.  I read the reviews and felt that I wanted to respond to some of the issues raised.  I have oily skin - all over - and I have larger pores.  The first time I used the product, I was not impressed.  Luckily, I kept trying because I saw that my skin changed a bit over time and the make up does deliver what they say it will.  I am 43 and do have lines around my eyes.  I do not feel like it accentuates my pores - in fact it seems like it has helped diminish them.  The foundation does not settle in your lines.  If you apply it lightly with a swirling motion with the brush it will apply evenly and flawlessly.  I really believe it does make your skin better over time. I found that my occasional acne became less and less with this product.  The best thing about this product is that you don&#x27;t feel like you are wearing make up.  I get compliments all the time about my skin and that I look radiant.  Even my seventeen year old daughter uses it and she has extremely dry skin.  It looks great on her and covers any skin issues she may have.  If you have dry skin and find that it won&#x27;t apply well then you probably need to use a better skin cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing regime.  Try Murad it is great!</li>
            <li> I invested my money in this product and thought that it would be fantastic. I do not have bad or sensitive skin, but this product broke my skin out. I gave my skin a week to clear up so I could figure out if it was the makeup or something else. My skin cleared up with my old makeup. I put the bare escentuals back on and my skin is a mess again. The product is also really messy to put on. I like the lip and eye products. The foundation and mineral veil are really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product. It&#x27;s $60 and you get a load of stuff. Bare Escentuals makes sure that you have the right brushes and aren&#x27;t using $1.50 Walmart brand brushes that might give you the wrong effect.    1) About my skin (it matters): I have fair skin, yet find that this color can be TOO dark for my skin in the dead of winter when there is 10 hours a day of sun. However, I get pimples now and then and sometimes blackheads. Otherwise, I have a nice texture to my skin.    2) The value of this product is great. You cannot find a better deal out there. If bought individually, this would cost way more! (Almost $200 bucks)    3) It&#x27;s easy to use. The manual (plus the 98734 million commercials on tv) makes it really easy to use.    4) The colors are easy to blend, and you can easily use them with other blushes, bronzers...    5) With that said, I wish they had more kits available with MORE brushes, so you can continue to get more deals.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this product from my Aunt who refuses to wear anything else. Within about 5 months of her telling us how much she loved this product 3 of my cousins, both aunts, and now myself refuse to wear anything else.  Although i&#x27;m younger i have very bad acne scars and till about 3 weeks ago still had fairly embarassing acne. Since i started using this product i have no acne (which helped me on my proactiv bill)and I get a lot of compliments on my make up. Many of my close friends tell me \\&quot;You didn&#x27;t look bad before, but you look better.\\&quot;    It actually covers up my flaws better than my previous liquid foundation and I find my self taking less time to get ready. (Once you get the hang of how to apply it)      I would recommend this to any close friend or family member.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and have pink cheeks or ruddy skin.  The Light is almost too dark for me but the Fairly Light is exactly my skin color.  I do like to blend for a little more color.    I have used the Bare Minerals for about 3 months now and absolutely love it, Mineral Veil has to be some sort of pixie dust - it works magic on my skin.    I can not wear the Warmth, its too red and dark but the Clear Radiance is wonderful.    The downside....  My skin has dried out over the past 3 months and I have had to switch to my standby liquid foundation for a while until my skin restores some of its moisture.     Nothing is perfect but Bare Minerals is honestly the closest my face has ever looked to flawless and as soon as the moisture in my skin is restored I will return to using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product while in New York at their local Sephora store.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it at first, but once I got used to it, I fell in love with it!  It&#x27;s so sheer yet provides great coverage!  It&#x27;s very lightweight.  It doesn&#x27;t cake on or come off with humidity.  It&#x27;s radiant and glowing.  It&#x27;s easy and quick.  It&#x27;s not blotchy or hard to blend.  It treats your skin like gold!  It makes you feel natural and beautiful and I just love the mineral veil and the barevitamins.  I definitely recommend this product for any skin type!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I have exceptionally sensitive, pale skin with roseacea.  I purchased this starter kit because I was excited about the idea of being able to sleep in this makeup.  I should have guessed that something wasn&#x27;t going to work out quite right when the DVD that came with it showed the CEO of the company looking particularly orange--I was hoping it was just my TV.  When I tried the product on, I had several reactions.  First of all, the brushes that come with the set are incredibly cheap and rough, and left my skin red and irritated for some time afterwards.  Secondly, while the lighter option in the starter kit was suitable for my skin, if not ideal, the &#x27;warmth&#x27; jar did not in any case look natural or flattering.  No problem, I skipped it.  Thirdly, I had difficulty getting the right coverage on my small bit of scarring, despite how easy the DVD told me it would be.  Fourthly, I didn&#x27;t get the reassuring feel that makeup usually gives me--that sensation that I look better, that added piece of confidence.  I will stick with the Prescriptives that my dermatologist reccomends--it&#x27;s not cheap, either, but it lasts quite a long time, does not irritate my skin, and makes me feel a little better dressed when I leave the house in the morning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I sincerely reccomend that, before you purchase this set, you find a Sephora where you can give it a try and make sure that it&#x27;s what you want it to be.  Also, invest in your own brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered bare minerals about a month ago and LOVE it.   I use it everyday and it looks great and feels great, because you cannot feel it!  I do not like anything on my face, so I have never been able to wear makeup, but I can wear bare minerals and love to.  It gives me confidence to know that my skin looks great!   Some people might think that you have to have perfect skin already and believe me you don&#x27;t.  My face is covered in freckles and I did not want to cover them up but just tone them down a few notches and bareminerals has done it perfectly.  I do not look like I have make-up on just really pretty vibrant skin.   I would recomment this to everyone!  I use to have a lot of red areas on and around my nose and the bare minerals has even helped that.  It&#x27;s good for your skin, you don&#x27;t feel it and it looks great... Why not get it!</li>
            <li> This starter kit is an excellent value for this product line, which can be very expensive. I use the Bare Escentuals foundation and blush every day and have for years.  It is light feeling, good for all skin types and does not cause breakouts.  I find when I try to use a liquid foundation that it feels like a mask in comparison to the Bare Escentuals product.</li>
            <li> Like most women I have tried every type of makeup on the market. Having worked in front of a camera I believed having a perfect complexion meant heavy feeling makeup. Even the powder makeup used by many of the makeup artists felt like I was wearing mud.  I bought bare escentuals after watching an infomercial about four years ago. My skin has never been healthier. It provides amazing coverage and I love the natural sunscreen! All of the products can be used many different ways.  You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I am 37. Combination T-Zone skin. Often with mini breakouts. I have fair translucent color skin with dark circles under the eye with dry patches in cheeks, fine lines on forehead and crows feet.Okay you get the picture. I have used liquid cheap and expensive, Mousse, and new covergirl creme . The liquid settled into my crinkles, Mousee applied with foundation brush was okay, but kinda tired looking, and the new hydrationg creme was a rash.  I went to a Bare Escentuals store, to have it applied by make up specialist. I would highly recommend this if your thinking about purchasing, 1 for color matching purposes. 2. for application results. Note the girl in the store applied a TON of product, I had asked for medium coverage, so ask for minimal application this way you can really see what it looks like. Results: really liked the feel and look. It does not settle in my crinkles, I am not constantly wiping the excees  out of the lines, it does as good of a job on under eye circles as my stick concealor does, but I am not having to tug and rub my eyes. Long lasting and I believe that the color system overall, is brighter even though the depth of color is the same, My whole face looks \\&quot;happier\\&quot; does that make sense... My daughter 15 said the make up \\&quot;look\\&quot; is also \\&quot;younger\\&quot;. I bought the \\&quot;Fairly Light kit\\&quot; at the store, it was 15.00 more (75.00) but in addtion you get the compact 25.00 and highlighter color 20.00. Definately buy in addtion to the kit a blush and concealor too the blending is really crucial so I would invest. I also bought the \\&quot;MD Formulations Cleansor for Sensitive Skin\\&quot;. I  previously could not get rid of dry patches, anything agitating will make my skin erupt!!!!! I have been faithfully using it twice a day for a week now.. no more dry patches. Skin \\&quot;rever upper\\&quot; is good do not put over or in your eye area though, it also has exfoliating qualities and it will burn. Use a seperate eye moisturizer if needed. Make sure to let both DRY completely. To avoid T-ZONE shine put \\&quot;veil\\&quot; on the forehead, sides of nose and chin, with the Flawless Application Brush. Then start the application process from begining. I found I do not have to re-apply \\&quot;viel\\&quot; to keep the shine down. In summation I would definately recommend this product system, get the Cleansor too  you need the smoothest pallet possible on your face to work with. Thank you to all previous reviewers it was all very helpful.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to put my two cents in and say that I have a fair complexion, and dry sensitive skin, yet I look excellent in this make-up. If you have dry skin, don&#x27;t be afraid of this product! I would suggest that you go into one of the stores that sells this product and try it on if you have any doubts. Also apply soooooooooo lightly that you can&#x27;t even believe you are applying anything at all!  You will get a beautiful, natural result! (Can you tell that I adore this makeup?)</li>
            <li> I had trouble at the start with the foundation.  Mine came with the handy buki brush, max coverage concealer brush and the flawless face brush.  I am pretty fair and the fairly light was too dark and the light was too light when I put it on with the handy buki brush.  If I used the flawless face brush the colors weren&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t enough coverage.  I was starting to not like the handy buki brush, it seemed to put it on to heavy.  I finally decided to mix the two together and gave the buki brush another try.  Now I got it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and I like it alot.  Looks good and stays on for a long time.  I use the max coverage concealer brush around my nose and any spots I might have and it covers well.  You don&#x27;t need any additional concealer.  I go to the gym after work and it makes it for the most part throughout the workout. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now the warmth all over color, is just horrible for my skin tone.  I just couldn&#x27;t make that work for me at all.  It is just way too dark and had orangy tones on my skin.  I did buy the clear radiance all over color later and that is really nice.  The mineral veil is ok, I don&#x27;t always use it.  You need to go lightly with this otherwise you can see the powder on your face.  I like a more natural look and for some reason I feel too made up with this on, even though it is just a translucent powder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will say I haven&#x27;t broken out at all since I started using this.  I had started using a new skin cleaning regimene at the same time so I&#x27;m not sure if it was one or the other but my skin looks good and I am quite happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve started trying some of their eye shadows too and they are quite nice as well.</li>
            <li> Best of the best make-up I have ever, ever used!</li>
            <li> A friend and I both bought the light/fairly light kit.  We both have sensitive skin prone to redness.  I loved the feel and application of Bare Escentuals.  Once you get the hang of it, it is so easy to apply.  The look and coverage was fantastic for the overwhelming weightlessness of the minerals.  After a few hours of wearing the minerals, though, both of us had crazy itchiness on our faces.  After a day or two of wearing it, my skin got really red.  I looked up some reviews online and I guess this is a common reaction for people with highly sensitive skin due to an ingredient, bismuth oxide.  So please test this before buying it and if you do not normally have sensitive skin, ENJOY, because it does have great flawless coverage.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, however if you have sensitive skin you may experience itching after a few hours of wear. This is what happened to me, which is sad because I really liked the coverage and that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Since trying Bare Minerals about 6 years ago, its now the only makeup I will use.  I love every product I have tried and it lasts a long time.  I have very fair, sensitive skin and a touch of rosacea.  The foundation covers the pick spots.  I don&#x27;t need blush so rather I use Warmth year-round and half the time a touch of True over it.  Most of the time I wear eye shawdow, liner, etc. but on the rare days that make-up would be ridiculous, I wear the foundation, a tad of Warmth, and a sweep of True on my lids.  Viola-my flaws are hidden and I look natural.  The few times I have purchased another brand of eye shadow (and once foundation) from a designer, expensive line, I kicked myself.  Now those products, tried once (out of bordom?) sit unused.</li>
            <li> After years of struggling with imperfect skin, I tried Bare Escentuals on a whim and have never in my life looked this good. My skin was always too oily so it would break out from department store makeup. With Bare Escentuals my skin can breathe and therefor the acne medication I use actually works now, I have almost perfect skin, and look ten years younger. I use not only this kit, but also the Well Rested Bisque, which is a really great cover up tool.</li>
            <li> I read the many positive reviews on this product and rushed out to buy it. I bought the starter kit at Sephora, they sell a similar kit at Ulta for the same price $60 (with one extra \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; color).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I was impressed with the concept and coverage. Just a light application covered and made a matte complexion. (Make sure you swirl tap buff! as the DVD will point out 146 times) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUT as soon as I started using this product, my skin started to break out. I never wore it at night. I have problem skin to begin with, but using liquid foundations did not make my skin erupt this badly. It was AWFUL! I thought my skin would just need to get used to it, that&#x27;s why I used it for two months. My skin never cleared up. As soon as I went back to cheap Neutrogena foundation from Rite Aid....go figure....skin clears up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another disappointment was the brushes. They don&#x27;t seem that high quality. Bristles fall out and they are not that soft on the skin, kind of itchy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I just spent $60 on some powder I can&#x27;t use. Who really knows for sure what \\&quot;pure\\&quot; minerals it is made from??? &lt;br /&gt;I was recently in Utah, and could have smeared some dust on my face with similar results.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apparently works for many, but not everybody.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on a recommendation of a friend. I have never loved a makeup more. I finally found a makeup that lasts all day and looks light and natural.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am one of the skeptics that has watched the infomercial for the last several years and was too chicken to try it. While I don&#x27;t have the worst complexion in the world, it is FAR from perfect. I have rosacea around my nose, large pores, and I still find myself fighting acne at the age of 35. I am also starting to see the fine lines and crow&#x27;s feet that come with getting older. I was a little worried because I need something with significant coverage and some of the reveiws made it sound like that was hard to get from this product. I also worried that some of the reviewers said it was great if you already have great skin, but not otherwise. After reading all the reviews and seeing most were positive, I finally decided to try it. I watched the video first (it is not too long)and followed the directions exactly. I am amazed- I have glowing, healthy looking skin and my blemishes are well covered. AND I don&#x27;t have messy, heavy makeup on!!! I do have oily skin, so I did not use a moisturizer first, and that seemed to work well for me. I also was careful not to be too heavy handed- a lot of the product really does go a long way. Maybe those who were unhappy failed to watch the video or used too much? All I know is that I wish I had tried this a long time ago and will definitely continue to use it. I tried a lot of expensive stuff in the past (most recently MAC) and this is so much better! I would recommend buying the starter kit first and adding on from there. I was a little worried the light/fairly light would be too light for me, as I am light complected but not pale. It blends perfectly with my skin tone! I am glad I went light-I think the medium would have been too dark for me. Anyways, I&#x27;m just rambling now...I will close by saying this is really worth the sixty dollar price. Don&#x27;t wait like I did!</li>
            <li> I watched the informercials on tv a few times, and was always interested in the products but I never ordered them. I was in Sephora last weekend and saw this kit, and figured what the heck, I will give it a try. I was very impressed the first time I tried this makeup! It really does look natural and feels like you have nothing on. Its very easy to put on and makes your skin look great. The first time I tried it out I had people compliment me on my complexion. I will never go back to liquid again! Try it out, you won&#x27;t be disapointed. Just make sure you watch the video or you might use too much!</li>
            <li> I began with this kit, and now use a number of the products.  I love it because it provides coverage without making me look like a mannequin.  While it is not as matte as my former makeup, it looks much more natural.    As I have gotten older, my skin is dryer and it tends to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; makeup.  For me, the best way to use powdered makeup is to moisturize well and then wait a few minutes before applying makeup.    If your face is \\&quot;sticky,\\&quot; the makeup does not go on smoothly and evenly.  In fact, when it is hot/humid, I make an extra effort to blot my face first, and brush a little Mineral Veil on my skin to absorb excess oil.  Then I apply the rest of the bare minerals as usual.    BTW, my face is sensitive and I cannot use the cleansing/moisturizing products from Bare Escentuals.  But the makeup has never caused any problems.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who said results vary, and I wanted to give my opinion and personal experience with the Bare Escentuals Get Started Kit.    I bought this kit because I thought it would be nice to have a mineral-based makeup.  My thoughts were that I might as well give my skin nutrients through my makeup if I could.    I used the skin tone matching system available on the Bare Escentuals site, and having fair skin with golden undertones, the site suggested I get the Fairly Light/Light kit.  After trying this kit (and following the instructions verbatim from the DVD that comes with it), I can wholeheartedly and honestly say the coloring was ALL WRONG for me, which is really disappointing having spent $60 on the kit.    I thought maybe it was just me thinking the coloring was wrong, but then my boyfriend (who was afraid of upsetting me) finally spoke up and said, \\&quot;Did you get new makeup or something because it is really dark?\\&quot;    I don&#x27;t have bad skin.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t have dry skin.  I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  I do have some redness that I need to even out and was excited that the demo DVD showed a girl with acne scarring and skin discoloration because I thought that if it makes her skin look good, I should be in great shape.    The first step they tell you is to put on the bareVitamins Rev-upper.  I have no doubt that this stuff has vitamins in it because that&#x27;s what it smells like.  When you open up a bottle of multi-vitamins...take a big whiff because that&#x27;s what this stuff smells like when you put it on your face.  The smell doesn&#x27;t linger (unless I just got used to it), and it&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not a smell I like.    I tried every technique they showed on the DVD...and when those didn&#x27;t give great results I tried techniques of my own.    The positive:  The brushes are great.  They feel fantastic on the skin, and they feel like high quality brushes.  I will no-doubt use them with my other powders and my bare escentuals eye shadows (which I love, by the way.).  Also, the Mineral Veil is nice and can be used to put finishing touches on any makeup, so that&#x27;s not a total loss either.    The negative:  The foundation powders do not yield any coverage remotely close to my skin shade despite the fact that I have fairly light to light skin.  They come off easily...that means with the slightest bit of perspiration or like the time I bumped my forehead applying mascara while my hand was wet.  I had a big bare spot where my hand had touched, and trying to blend in new BareEscentuals foundation without being noticed was impossible.  Also the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is absolutley a terrible shade for anyone with fairly light to light skin.  I don&#x27;t care how small of an amount you use or even if you dilute it with the foundation powder, it&#x27;s just orangey and bad.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will find any sort of use for the Warmth.  Finally, the finished product of the whole kit just isn&#x27;t great.  I&#x27;m 30...so I&#x27;m not exactly fresh-faced, but I&#x27;m far from aged.  to get this stuff to look smooth on my face, I&#x27;d end up looking like a kabuki girl or something with so much of the power it was ridiculous.  I couldn&#x27;t get decent coverage of my red splotchiness (which is very mild and easily covered by my normal liquid makeup) and now mattter how much or little I used the results either looked unfinished or unnatural, not to mention the coloring was bad.    So that&#x27;s my review.  It&#x27;s not a total loss.  Not that I needed the brushes, but they are at least good, usable brushes...and I will use the mineral veil, but the rest of the stuff will probably get thrown away.    On a side note, I do recommend BareEscentuals Eye Shadows.  They are fun and can be used dry or moist (as well as blended) for varying effects.    As far as foundation, blush, and powder, I am going back to using Estee Lauder: Foundation- Double Wear in \\&quot;Fresco\\&quot;, blush- Tender Blush in \\&quot;Petal\\&quot;, and Powder--AeroMatte in \\&quot;light\\&quot;.  I recommend those if you&#x27;re looking for good coverage and a good finish (depending on your skin color).</li>
            <li> I love my Bare Escentuals BareMinerals. I am so totally addicted to Bare Escentuals products.  Will not use anything else!  Feels light on the skin.  Thought coverage was light at first but found it depends on application and type of brush used.  I love the Kabuki brush.  Provides good coverage.  Flawless application brush good if you want sheer coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for money since so much stuff comes with the starter kit.  The brushes alone cost a lot already.  I found the fairly light shade to be too light for me and gave a whitish cast and was told I could use it as a concealer or to brighten the undereye area.  Not for those who are in a hurry though...I think one needs to spend time on application, including the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to those women, and men, that hate layers and layers of gunky, funky heavy makeup. My own experience is that I have terribly dry skin, and makeup always looks caked on and fake. I am also very fair complected, and have a hard time finding my shade.  With Bare Essentuals I had the same problem with my makeup looking caked on and fake, but not nearly as bad (of course, I was using too much at first too. They have a fantastic selection of shades, I use fairly light, and it is perfect.  I noticed after using the product for a few weeks my face was not dry anymore! I was applying it properly and it looked natural. I also noticed when I was not wearing it that my face had a healthy glow to it that hadn&#x27;t been there for years. Another bonus is that putting your makeup on in the morning does not take long at all!  Once you have a practiced hand it takes 1-2 minutes! Love, love, love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: You cannot apply this makeup like normal makeup. You do not need a ton of it... as a matter of fact the more you have on the worse it looks. You only use a little of the product and buff it into your face. If you need to cover something up use the bisque and concealer brush not extra foundation. For first time buyers, I recommend purchasing one of the get started kits. In it, you will find a video that shows you how to apply the make up.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many, many different types of makeup and, although they looked o.k., I was never really satisfied - that is until I tried Bare Escentuals.  Once I began using this makeup set, I knew that I could never go back to buying store brands again - it&#x27;s THAT good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I love about it is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all, and yet my face looks radiant - it&#x27;s truly amazing.  Another great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to block my pores - a great plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the mineral veil (which you put on after your makeup for that soft, \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; finish) &amp; the warmth (which really does provide you with a sun-kissed glow - just be sure not to overdo it - I found out the hard way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend Bare Escentuals to anyone interested in trying something new makeup-wise.  Who knows, it may become your favorite too...</li>
            <li> I had to jump in and share my experience with Bare escentuals in the hopes that it will help new users or those unsure about trying Bare escentuals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;True, you cant expect miracles in a jar but for me it is the closest I will ever come to finding a miracle in a jar.  I have been using BE for over a year and will never go back to anything else. It is fairly priced and it actually cost less then the department store brands I used previously. With this make up, a little goes a long way, it lasts me two months at the very least before needing to replace.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suffer from age spots, light acne, dark undereye circles, sensitive skin and due to PCOS, hirsutism.  BE covers and camoflauges so well. I feel feminine and look fresh all day long. I used all sorts of heavy full coverage foundations to try to hide my imperfections, but they only made me look heavily made up and actually accentuated my flaws.  Bare escentuals diffuses light and enhances the look of my skin in ways that no other make up ever did.  If this can make me feel beautiful, confident and feminine all over again then it can help anyone :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In just two weeks, redness, pore size and blackheads diminished as well.   &lt;br /&gt;Acne breakouts are few and far between now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;People tell me I look fresh. I have been told they cant believe my age because I have no wrinkles, lol not true. I am told several times that I have lost weight, lol not an ounce. I only began getting complimented like this when I started wearing BE make-up.  To me,  BE is like a magic trick in a jar it focuses peoples attention away from flaws and on your natural beauty.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I saw previous posts about dry skin or sensitive skin that felt as thought he make up burned them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found that exfoliating and using a moisturizer are very helpful in preparing your face (like a canvas) for mineral make up.  It will keep mineral makeup from caking and falling into wrinkles (even in high humidity). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A moisturizer does not have to be expensive like Philosophy brand of products mentioned, although excellent products.  I have found Mary Kay Timewise moisturizer, sea weed daily shine control moisturizer from The Body Shop are good too. But, Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action Moisturizer from Johnson and Johnson (around $6 in my area) is my favorite to use as a primer and to keep mineral makeup from itching or irritating my skin in anyway. I have found dead sea salt scrubs in health food stores inexpensive ( around $13 in my area for 24 oz.) and just awesome to exfoliate the skin.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To me you have to prepare your skin before you put make up on its like ironing clothes before you put them on. You just look better  :)</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 months ago the FAIR/FAIRLY LIGHT starter kit and I learned that I was even lighter then those 2 colors. I bought the FAIR foundation a few weeks later &amp; it looks great on my skin. My skin is very oily,w/ acne, and can be dry at times when I put to much acne med. on my face. Surprisingly the conceler brush really did cover up my blemishes! and I use the minerial veil thru out the day to touch up my oily face. I love this makeup. I will be &amp; have been buying more of the BE products!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, in the beginning, I really liked this product. I used it just as instructed on the video, and had fairly good results. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, as the seasons have changed and my skin has started drying out with the colder weather, the product no longer \\&quot;performs\\&quot; like it once did. I&#x27;ve tried all the tips and tricks and it&#x27;s still not great. My biggest complaint is with the brushes - maybe my set is just a fluke, but they are the absolute worst quality! I end up being completely covered in bristles everytime I use the product -especially with the flawless application brush. At first I thought it was a natural part of a new brush, but after over 6 months of use, it&#x27;s still happening. I have to make sure to do an inspection of my face, neck and chest (or clothing) before leaving the house to ensure I&#x27;m not covered in black bristles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With so many competitors out there coming out with the same principle of powder foundation/makeup, I will probably shop around and see what else is available before I purchase Bare Escentuals again.</li>
            <li> recently decided to try this after researching a variety of make-ups and deciding on a mineral formulation.  Reg pressed compacts give me breakouts...loose powder w talc makes me sneeze, regardless of brand - I wanted better options.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes a little practice to get the \\&quot;swirl, tap, buff\\&quot; technique down, and please know that the buffing is very important.  After a few days, now have it down.  I&#x27;m a make-up minimalist, but like to have something that diffuses my 40+ yrs of experience lines and cover my little breakouts and discolorations.  This product serves those puposes excellently for me....does not feel heavy at all, does not \\&quot;slip\\&quot; like some powders do, absorbs oil very well for me, does not settle into the experience lines (like other foundations) - but this is where the buffing action comes into play....that has to be practiced to get the finish you desire.  I live in hot humid San Antonio,TX so if my foundation doesn&#x27;t melt by the end of the day, that is a testament to the quality of the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The colors are excellent for my light, cool toned skin....I would warn to go very easy handed on the \\&quot;Warm\\&quot; skinlighting product in the kit if you&#x27;re pale complexioned....I gave myself an instant tan the 1st time cause I used way, way too much....now use it as a blusher as well.  I learned that you don&#x27;t just brush these bare minerals products on like you would a loose foundation -otherwise the result is not at all what is desired...it will look cakey and unattractive.  However, when it is properly applied, my skin tone is evened out and blemishes are covered that I&#x27;ve never had luck covering before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Watch the video that comes with the kit...it is highly informative and will keep you from using excess product (and thereby wasting $$!).  Yes, the product is expensive....but if used judiciously, it will last quite a long time....in the end a pretty good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It does look nice on my skin.  It will rub off easy though, being that it&#x27;s a powder.  You may have to reapply during the day, depending on what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the started kit after christmas this year. I was looking for a makeup that wouldn&#x27;t fade throughout the day, On a good day I leave my house at 6:30am and won&#x27;t get home til 6:30pm. Anyways, the first application was horrible on me, partly because I didn&#x27;t watch the video and the Light foundation in the kit was too dark for my skin tone. After watching the DVD, the second go-round was a lot easier. I think in the beginning the makeup emphasized my pores a little, but over time I think the use of the bare minerals foundation and a learning curve have dramatically decreased the appearance of my pores.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I also love about the kit is you get warmth!  Warmth is wonderful, at first I used it only as a blush, now I use it as a blush, eyeshadow and I mix it in with rose balm for a warmth colored gloss, I have really fallen in love with the matching color thing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The brushes I have not had a problem with, here and there a few bristles would fall out but that has decreased with use.  I use the BE brushes for the foundation, veil, and face colors. And I use Sonia Kashuk eyeshadow brushes for the BE glimmers, it works well but I have never tried the BE shadow brushes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love my new BE kit so much, I could not wait to get some more colors, it is addicting because everything seems to suit my skin tone extremely well, and if it doesn&#x27;t the first time, it seems if you are creative you can think of a way for it to work for you.  I have tried the sleep test, several times not on purpose, and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, but I never used to breakout when I slept in my old makeup either.  I recently tried my old makeup (loreal color match, primer, and powder) and I found I had to REALLY cake it on to match the coverage and even tone that BE provides effortlessly.  BE may seem very sheer, but nothing perfects your complexion like BE.  I felt absolutely gross trying to wash off my old makeup after wearing it for 8 hours. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about BE is that it&#x27;s not very travel friendly and the jars all match, I solved the problem of looking under every single jar by labling the lids.  You cannot beat the quality, or the price, of BE, I have used it everyday for 2 months and it isn&#x27;t even 1/2 way gone with the foundation and veil. The eye and face colors will probably last at least 5 years the way I use them so sparingly.  Good Luck if you purchase this! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just completed four months of using the B.E. light/fairly light kit. While some of the products are good, the combination in a kit form is not a \\&quot;one-size-fits-all\\&quot; solution.    Like other reviewers, the light and fairly light are too dark for me. B.E. makes another, lighter foundation, but you have to purchase it separately. The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is way too yellow for my skin and the \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot; only works once I&#x27;ve had a bit of sun (which is difficult for someone who already has pale skin). If you are considering buying this kit, you may want to try the foundation first at a Sephora store, like I did. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t have known how yellow these two foundations are.    The coverage of the foundation, however, is good if you like a matte finish.    The kit includes a product called \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot;, which for light skin, should be called \\&quot;overwhelming\\&quot;. B.E. makes the same product in a lighter shade with a different name. Why they choose to include Warmth in a kit for fair-skinned people is beyond me. This product is very easy to overuse. It can be buffed off to some extent, but the results aren&#x27;t that great. If you can learn to use the smallest possible amount, it&#x27;s ok, but not that great for very fair skin.    The brushes in the kit were fine. No problems there.    The bareVitamins product in the kit contains the same active ingredient in acne medication (Salicylic Acid). Although it left my dry skin with a smooth finish, I never felt that it was moisturizing my skin. This is a product I personally will not continue to use, especially since cooler weather is coming soon and I do not need a product that contains drying ingredients.    In retrospect, I don&#x27;t regret that I bought the kit, since I&#x27;ve been able to experience mineral foundations for myself (the infomercials were very alluring). But I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again. I&#x27;m going back to my previous skincare line (Prescriptives) because I prefer a more dewy finish to my skin. I&#x27;m 42 (can pass for 30) and I don&#x27;tneed to have a dry-looking (or feeling) face, and I&#x27;m getting really picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;d use bare escentuals AFTER concealer, this did not help me hide acne scars or birthmarks at all. It gives a good finish when used with a concealer and I no longer have to carry pressed powder with me to fight shine throughout the day, but I&#x27;m disappointed since I got my hopes up when in actuality this product is mediocre and not really worth the money. I&#x27;ve had people tell me to try out the primer with it, but I don&#x27;t think I want to waste anymore money.</li>
            <li> I had acne as a teen ager and am now 53.  I tried Bare Escentuals 5 years ago and made the switch.  I actually get compliments on my complexion....and I have old acne scars.  I use their eye shadow and their Skin Revver-upper.  One thing....after you put it on for the first time, go away from the mirror for 10 minutes.  When you look at yourself ten minutes later you&#x27;ll be amazed the way the \\&quot;powder\\&quot; is gone and you just have nice skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This starter kit is a great bargain!</li>
            <li> I have wear makeup since I was 13 years old and I am 37 now. My face has always broke out from the makeup I wore. This is the only product that has cleared up by face. I did not believe that would ever happen. But it feels just like you dont have any makeup on. And I used to wear it to coverup all the red spots and blemishes that is not so much the case any more. I just love this product.</li>
            <li> This takes some practice to use. I purchased my kit recently. The first time I used it my results were not flawless as advertised - this was to be expected. With daily practice my results have become more uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most positive things I can say about this beauty product is that it more uniformly covered my dark circles and evened out my skin tone. The negative thing is that the coverage is not as flawless as advertised on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars. It is well worth purchasing, but takes a lot of practice. Also, if you are looking for heavier coverage for problem skin, this is not the product for you. However, if you are just looking to even out your skin tone and don&#x27;t have problem skin, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect foundation for a long time, one that will give me that airbrushed look.  This is good, but not it.    What this set does-- the foundation helps even out your skin tone and hide tiny flaws.   The warmth and glee colors add a nice bit of color to your face (though I prefer the warmth, the glee is a bit too pink).      What this doesn&#x27;t do is camouflage anything larger than a pinhead.  In other words, if you have a pimple (like I do every month) or a scar, this won&#x27;t cover it up all the way.  Maybe if you reapplied 3 or 4 coats it could, but then you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing a kabuki mask.  Also, I have slight dark circles under my eyes and this does almost nothing for those.    If you are pale the light/fairly light may be too dark.  It&#x27;s ok for me now, but it&#x27;s summer and I have a bit of color in my face.  For winter I&#x27;ll have to invest in the pale foundation.    It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews, but I just had to say that this is a great little product!    First, I chose standard shipping (because I&#x27;m cheap), but received it almost immediately!  I was really thrilled with how quickly my order was shipped out to me (despite the typical shipping dates and schedules).    Second, I typically skip the liquid foundation for the sake of time and use a powder foundation that I buy at the grocery store for about $5.00.  I was skeptical about spending the money to upgrade to a pricier product, but my friend talked me into it and I&#x27;m glad she did!    When you get the starter kit, the first thing you might notice (if you&#x27;re cheap like me) is that the jars are SMALL.  Very small.  When I originally ordered the kit, I tried to justify it by telling myself that when you did the math and divided the cost by the number of products, it really wasn&#x27;t much more than what you would pay at the drugstore.  So when I saw how tiny the jars were, I was feeling a little bit of buyers&#x27; remorse...    But they mean it with Bare Escentuals when they say less is more.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how the tiniest bit of powder could give me such great coverage!  With the amount of drugstore powder that I had to use just to get a good finish, this should definitely save me time and money.    I&#x27;m fair-skinned (probably more on the pink than yellow-toned side), and this kit was perfect for me.  I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; powder (which I know a lot of reviewers have complained about), but I generally like a more natural look and the foundations and mineral veil are a perfect match.  You definitely get a more translucent look with this product than you do with the drugstore brands...I might even be persuaded to splurge and try out a few of their blushes!    To summarize--great makeup, and super quick to apply.  If you like more of a natural look and can&#x27;t do more than a five-minute morning, this product will do the trick!</li>
            <li> I hate make-up with a passion. Hate the way it feels, the way it clogs my pores, the way it smears on my face and ends up on my clothes. So when I went to Saphora and just happened to try Bare Minerals I was in heaven. I found a make-up that doesn&#x27;t feel like make-up, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, stays on, and covers a great deal of my acne and scars. No make-up can provide the miracle of flawless skin, but Bare Minerals provides good coverage...it calms the redness and reduces the dark spots. Mineral Veil does a good job of hiding the size of my pores. I have combination skin, and the powder would dry my dry spots except for one thing...I moisturize. Use a good moisturizer and dryness shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t travel well, but given all the other great qualities I give it all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products.  I came across it on-line at Sephora with no knowledge of it and decided to try it out.  I don&#x27;t consider myself very experienced with make-up application as I have always just gone for the simplest look.  The dvd with the kit was very informative and taught me everything I needed to know for applying this make-up and achieving the look I want.  I have fair skin, freckles and red hair.  I have a hard time finding make-up I like because when I have had makeovers in the past it seems like people try to make me even whiter than I already am and I like to have color on my face.  With this make-up I don&#x27;t feel pale and I feel confident because it looks SOOOOO natural!  In the past I have used liquid foundation and thought it looked great indoors and then looked at myself outside in natural light and thought the color was all wrong.  With this I have seen that it looks great no matter what kind of lighting I&#x27;m in.  After starting with this kit I went on to buy the Beyond the Basics kit, Get Started Eyes, and Brow kit, I LOVE it all!  I am so happy that I tried this make-up, I know that I will be using it exclusively from now on.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say you should \\&quot;proceed with caution\\&quot; when watching any infomercial. This one--the Bare Minerals--in particular makes it sound as if EVERY skin problem will be miraclously eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, as many  people  have reported, had difficulty working with such small containers with the  powder making a mess. I would advise you to save your money, and buy a cheaper mineral makeup if you have your heart set on the mineral makup. If all the makeup claims about this product were true, I would (willingly) pay twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many different companies who now sell mineral makeup, and even Maybelline or Cover Girl  is now selling it. I am sorry I have forgotten which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once watched an infomercial where a lady didn&#x27;t have noticeable eyebrows...then the \\&quot;expert\\&quot; put eyebrow pencil on--yes just pencil--and raved about the remarkable improvement, and showed the \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; close-ups.  I think we all know that any cheap eyebrow pencil would have had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like to see people waste their money on something that is not what one would expect.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup wearer, largely because I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of it on my face and, no matter what, I always look \\&quot;made up\\&quot;.  I had a make over using Bare Minerals and am so absolutely impressed.  My skin looks gorgeous, it&#x27;s easy and fast to do in the morning, I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing make-up, and I don&#x27;t look &#x27;made up\\&quot;, just a really nice natural.  I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this kit. I watched the entire DVD and read everything that came in the box. That was 2 months ago and I&#x27;ve barely used it. I gave it a week just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something I was doing wrong. I have dry skin so I must put on moisturizer before powder. The make-up did cover up my freckles but I think it accentuated my dry spots. I am 33 so have few wrinkles but I felt that it also made the wrinkles I have stand out more. And there was way too much shine on my face. Plus my face felt sticky, so this product didn&#x27;t work too well with my need for moisturizers. I use other powder based foundations and am never left with that sticky feeling. I did purchase the Mineral Veil, some of the eye shadows, and blushes on an auction site. I am happy to say I LOVE these items. I continually use the blush/eye shadows. I also really liked the mineral veil but I don&#x27;t know that I would make it a part of my everyday routine. Also I did not like the brushes. I got the ones that came with the kit as well as a blush brush. The bristles seem to fall out very easily. I&#x27;ll stick with my current make-up brushes! I suppose, if you have oily skin, then this product would be good for you. But over-all I just don&#x27;t think it is ideal for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with cool undertones (light pink), and this kit didn&#x27;t work for me.  The makeup itself is great, but since I didn&#x27;t keep half of the products, it wasn&#x27;t a cost-efficient purchase for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Foundation - The \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot; and \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundations in this kit were both too dark and too warm (yellow/orange undertones) for me, but I love the way the foundation wears.  It is super-lightweight, very natural-looking and feeling, easy to blend, and easy to control how much coverage I want.  I gave them to my sister and friend, who love them, and I bought [[ASIN:B00021DVCQ Bare Escentuals i.d. bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation]] in \\&quot;fair,\\&quot; which is light enough for my skin.  I wish it was a slightly cooler tone, but it is close enough.  I love the spf 15 (For better, waterproof sun-protection I love [[ASIN:B000Q9EK38 Colorescience Sunforgettable SPF 30 (0.23 oz)]] in \\&quot;All Clear\\&quot;). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mineral Veil - I love this powder because it isn&#x27;t colored.  I mix it with my other powders to lighten them.  Like the foundation, it is super-lightweight and natural-looking and feeling.  If it had spf, I would use it as foundation and use the foundation as concealer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warmth All-over Face Color - The powder is great, but this color absolutely did not work for me; it was way too dark and looked brownish-orange on my skin, but it looks great on the friend I gave it to.  I later purchased [[ASIN:B00021DV4O Bare Escentuals i.d. bareMinerals All-Over Face Color]] in \\&quot;Glee,\\&quot; which I use more as a blush than an all-over face color.  (I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to use blushes because I am naturally pink and don&#x27;t want to be over-pink, but \\&quot;Glee\\&quot; looks very natural on me.)  I also use it as lip-color under a layer of gloss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Skin Rev-er Upper - I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this alone, so I&#x27;m glad it came in the kit because I love it.  It is cool, light, refreshing, feels great, and smooths the skin prior to makeup application. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flawless Application Brush - Wonderfully soft brush that I use for foundation, blush, and mineral veil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full-Coverage Kabuki Brush - I gave it to my sister (along with one of the foundations that didn&#x27;t work); it seemed like a great little brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maximum-Coverage Concealer Brush - This is a great little brush for applying a second layer of foundation to help cover dark under-eye color and other trouble spots. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DVD - I finally watched this a year or more after my purchase when I was sick and felt like lying on the sofa and doing nothing.  I didn&#x27;t learn anything new, but it might be great if you&#x27;ve never worn makeup before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This would be a great starter kit for someone whose skin isn&#x27;t super-fair and has neutral to warm skintones.  Unfortunately, this was not me, but I do love the products I have purchased individually that do match my skin.</li>
            <li> Pros - I absolutely love this make-up. It is light and very easy to use, anyone can look great even if you have always sucked at putting on makeup (like me). I have acne prone skin, scars, and some discoloration but this make-up makes me look &amp; feel great.  Plus it has cleared up my skin... smaller &amp; less frequent breakouts than when using conventional liquid/powder foundations.    Cons - The brushes in this kit shed bristles all the time... on your clothes, chest, face, etc. Several other reviews have commented on this as well.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and had stopped wearing foundation in my late teens, when my skin cleared up. But in the past few years, I&#x27;d noticed more and more lines and found that skin make up made me look fresher and younger. But to go from no make up for over a decade to liquid foundation was a tough transition...I always felt like I was wearing a mask. Then I discovered BE. I really don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make up when it&#x27;s on. And my husband HATES the made up look and hasn&#x27;t even noticed that I am now walking on with three layers of skin make up every day. Best of all, I just went to a family function where relatives who hadn&#x27;t seen me since I was in college were attending. They wanted to know how I&#x27;d managed to look exactly the same at age 33 as I did at 22! I really think it is the make up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it is kind of messy and it takes time to get the look right--those complaints are valid. I still think it&#x27;s worth the clean up and the learning curve because it really will make you look fabulous!!! I have oily but not broken out skin and fine lines, and some freckles. Best of all, I can let my freckles (which I like) shine through while still getting a smoother looking face because you really do have a lot of control with this system. I do Mineral Veil first, then foundation, then the Warmth, then one more touch of Mineral Veil. And I like \\&quot;Well Rested\\&quot; for the eyes.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I thought Bare Escentuals was a marketing gimmick to get people buy their products.  The swirl, tap and apply on your skin concept sounded cheesy until two of my girlfriends highly recommended this product.  I rarely use make up until I had a scar on my forehead last Fall.  I used other expensive brands for foundations, powders prior but found Bare Escentuals&#x27; foundation works the best.  It covers my scar (a fairly deep scar) very well now combining with the Multi-Bisque (Summer Bisque) for coverage purposes.    When I use Bare Escentuals, I feel like there is nothing on my skin.  I used to have acne even when I don&#x27;t wear makeup/cleaning my face consistently.  Now, I barely have acne coming out from my face (yes, no more acne) and it is summer time too!      The only minor complaint I will have about using Bare Escentuals product is that this product is messy.  No matter how hard I try to \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; my make up skills, I still get powder all over the sink/clothes at times (after using it for 4 months now).  But with the benefit I have seen, I will remain a loyal customer for quite a long time!</li>
            <li> We recently had a Sephora counter added to our local JC Penney&#x27;s store, and I went in to look at what they had to offer. I am a very fair skinned woman, who has had no luck with liquid or mousse foundations. The liquid ones never blended correctly with my skin, and the mousse ones ended up looking like stage makeup. Being of Norwegian/Hungarian stock, I cannot go out into the sun for fear of burning to death like a vampire so I also needed something with sun protection. I also have periodic patches of dry skin. Anyway, I was recommended to try Bare Escentuals \\&quot;get started\\&quot; kit, in fairly light/light. She demonstrated the powder foundation, mineral veil, blush and I found myself falling in love with the way it made my skin look and feel, and how simple it was to apply! I am not one to spend an hour getting ready, if I can&#x27;t do it in less than five it&#x27;s not going to work! The kit comes with brushes also, which really feel wonderfully calming on my face. Its like a mini massage really. For 5 months now I have been using the kit , and now have graduated to just buying the product individually, it was completely worth the 60 bucks to \\&quot;test drive\\&quot; the makeup. It has changed my life, and I know that sounds all QVC drunk call in but it has!! It&#x27;s the only makeup I have ever used that lived up to its commercials.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t deterred by my first experience with Bare Minerals when a sweet but inexperienced sales clerk incorrectly applied a sample to my face and it looked absolutely horrid, a cakey mess that emphasized and magnified every flaw. Sephora&#x27;s liberal return policy and a chance word-of-mouth recommendation I recently overheard convinced me that I had nothing to lose, so I bought the Get Started Kit, followed the very-easy-to-follow DVD (if you don&#x27;t have a DVD player written instructions are also included), and gave it a go. It really is just amazing - it&#x27;s like magic. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. I haven&#x27;t had such a clear and glowing complexion since the last time I was in love! And by glowing I don&#x27;t mean shimmery or shiny - just a fresh, clean, natural glow. I&#x27;m 55 but still have rather oily skin, so my ever-enlargening pores were always clogged, and prone to erupting into full-blown blemishes. This product not only minimizes the flaws but has actually seemed to improve the quality of my skin, tightening the pores and clearing up the blemishes. I can&#x27;t say enough about how terrific this product is. I will add that I make very little money, so spending the money was a bit of a sacrifice...but in the long run, it&#x27;s probably cost-effective as I will never again waste money taking chances on this and that cosmetic. Plus, I can declutter my makeup collection - it&#x27;s Bare Minerals all the way for me!  P.S. My disastrous store demo was done over an otherwise perfectly fine face cream I was wearing, which I am sure caused the bad results by creating a barrier that just sort of soaked up the minerals and lay on my skin like dust on top of the refrigerator...</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try this makeup after reading a gazillion online reviews about it and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have a somewhat oily T-zone combined with some dry areas so I was worried about how the makeup would go on. But the powder went on just fine and I didn&#x27;t end up with blotchy areas. I think the application is very very important and will affect how you&#x27;ll look. You&#x27;re supposed to pour some powder into the lid, swirl your brush into it, tap of the excess then buff it onto your face in a circular motion. I have some larger pores on my nose and the first time I used this makeup according to the technique described, it somehow accentuated the size of my pores. This was because the powder wasn&#x27;t settling into the deeper areas...same concept as when you run chalk over a rough surface and see that some areas aren&#x27;t touched by the chalk. So on my second attempt, I used a dabbing motion esp. on my nose first, then went over it with a circular buffing motion and this made a huge improvement! I could barely see the pores after that. I love this product and my husband tells me that I look very radiant with it on. It is super lightweight and has helped take some of the oiliness away from my t-zone. Even on the hottest days, my makeup stays put. Some people have said that the coverage isn&#x27;t enough but it&#x27;s definitely enough for me. I don&#x27;t even need concealer under my eyes. This makeup takes the darkness away. I&#x27;m never going back to liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Get Started Kit this weekend, and I love it!  I first tried bareMinerals at a friend&#x27;s wedding.  I was really happy with the results, so I went out and got my own supplies!!  I have large pores and oily, acne prone skin so it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t make my skin shiny by the end of the day (liquid foundation) or doesn&#x27;t look too caked on (pressed powder).  The application is really simple and you are left looking like yourself, only better!</li>
            <li> I am 14 years old and I was so confused about makeup, and I have a few pimples here and there, so I thought I would try putting on liquid foudation, blush, and mascara.   It was BAD. And I am not being over dramatic. It even made my acne worse!!! &lt;br /&gt;I was in a Sephora store and saw the little starter kit thingy and said what the heck? What have I got to lose? I watched the little DVD and tried it. It looked so good, you couldn&#x27;t tell I had anything on. It looked so natural. The coverage was flawless. &lt;br /&gt;     The reason I gave it four stars was that it doesn&#x27;t last for the whole day, so you have to bring extra in your purse to re-apply (spl?) during the day. OVERALL:Awesome product great for teens and women alike!!!</li>
            <li> This makeup is easy to apply and actually covers pimples and red marks.  I have never been able to wear foundation before because I always end up looking like a clown because it is so hard to blend the edges and find the right shade for my fair skin.  This kit includes two shades of the light foundation, so you can mix the two and find the perfect shade year round!  You can apply several light layers until you have the look you want.  This starter kit is essential for a first time user, the DVD it comes with is very helpful!!  It is also a great deal!  This is the best makeup ever!! If your on the fence about this product you should get it and try it!</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals mineral makeup.  I had an instore demonstration last year and I have been a believer ever since.  This makeup gives me a natural looking flawless finish that I was never able to acheive with liquid foundation.  It goes on quick and looks beautiful all day.  I am embarrassed to admit that since I have started wearing this makeup, I have gotten lazy and now I don&#x27;t wash my face before I go to bed at night--however, I have never had a single breakout since I&#x27;ve worn Bare Minerals makeup.  You really can sleep in it--believe me, I do every night!</li>
            <li> These foundations/bronzers work very well to brighten your face. Because they are in powder form, they come off quicker and the coverage isn&#x27;t as great as a liquid foundation. However, they are light and airy and very easy to apply. One thing I recommend though, if you are very fair-skinned is not to go overboard with the bronzer.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other foundation after using Bare Minerals.  I love that I can get as little or as much coverage as I need.  The instructional video was very helpful and as I purchase more Bare Minerals products I refer to it often.  I find that my redness and the occasional pimple that I get are well hidden with this makeup.  You can wear this makeup all day and it still looks great and I don&#x27;t ever feel like I have tons on.  The only negatives that I have are that the brushes, although extremely soft, lose their bristles very easily.  Everytime I apply my makeup there are bristles all over the bathroom sink.  And also, the fairly light color tends to be a little yellowish, so I end up using a lot of light.  I was hesitant to purchase this makeup because of the price, but it is worth it and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so i ordered the makeup about two weeks ago and the first day i used it my boyfriend said \\&quot;baby you have this glow about you i dont know what it is\\&quot; and i said its my new makeup and he loves it! so i recommend anybody to get it.. i mean ill be honest its not giving me flawless skin but its still great ... with other makeup i usually feel like i have a ton of [...] on my face and by the end of the day it wears off but bare minerals stays on your face all day and it feels so light like i have nothing on so natural and so beautiful buy this!!</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals! Their products are as great as they advertise. When I first started wearing Bare Escentuals, everyone told me how great I looked.  Some people I told why; others I let wonder. I don&#x27;t just love a product very often, but I love this one!</li>
            <li> I first ordered this kit in early spring and wasn&#x27;t too happy until I had some practice at applying it.  I started to really like it.  But once the summer heat came I realized its not for me.  I have very dry skin and had very little break outs with my old liquid foundation.  This kit does not add moisture they way they claim in the videos, I&#x27;ve had to switch to a more intense moisturizer since I started using it.  Being in the heat with this makeup has made me break out.  If I sweat just a tiny bit my face gets very itchy.  Also be careful around your eyes.  I have ended up with red, swollen, itchy eyes anytime I&#x27;ve come near my eyes with any of the products in this kit.  The quality of the brushes is also questionable because they shed a lot.    The \\&quot;max coverage concealer\\&quot; brush adds way too much make up. If I use it I end up with splotchy areas where you can really tell I have make up on.    Redness coverage is not very good.</li>
            <li> I bought the starter kit online about 7 months.  I have to say that I love a lot of things about this makeup, but it is not quite the miracle worker they claim it it.  Things I love about it:  Definitely gives me an airbrushed finish.  Feels very light.  Lasts a long time.  Evens out my skin tone.  Things I don&#x27;t like:  I have never watched the DVD,but if you watch the informercial a couple of times, the concept is not hard to pick up.  I have very fair skin, it is very oily, and I live in Florida.  The makeup did not keep my skin from being shiny within a few hours, even when I used the recommended mineral veil under and over the foundation.  When I did the double on the mineral veil, my skin also looked too cakey.  So I switched back to mineral veil just over the foundation.  Even with that, my skin still had a powder look, so to make it look really natural, I put the mineral veil on, take a tissue and very lightly rub it over my makeup to take off extra powder and after that it looks great, but that&#x27;s just an extra step, which is inconvenient.  Like many people mentioned, I had to blend the light and fairly light foundation to get it to match my skin tone.  The warmth is waaaay too dark for pale skintones, I don&#x27;t understand why they included it in the light skintone kit.  I just use whatever is left on the lid without putting any in, and see a barely noticeable difference, but that is not a big deal.  The brushes aren&#x27;t great, but they do the job, I don&#x27;t ever use the kabuku brush because it puts the makeup on waay too heavy for my liking.  I just use the powder brush for both the foundation and the mineral veil.  I actually don&#x27;t really use the concealer brush with foundation, but I do use it to put on eyeshawdow and found that I really like it.  It puts on the powder eyeshadow quickly, great coverage.      Biggest drawbacks (and the reason for the 2 star rating)  1.  I have medium sized pores near my nose and even with the foundation and veil on, does not camoflauge them, and actually brings them out more.  2.  Does not control the shine and the makeup does not blend at all with my mattifying lotion, so can&#x27;t use them together.  3.  Messy, especially if you travel, which I do a lot.    4.  It causes me to breakout just like other regular makeup.  Even the mineral veil causes breakouts.  I do not have bad acne, but I am prone to breakouts because my skin is oily and therefore pores get clogged quicker.  This makeup does clog my pores, definitely!!!  I have to make sure to wash it off every night and use an exfoliator.  The few times I slept in it, I broke out a lot the very next day.     4.  BIGGEST DRAWBACK: makes my skin intensly itchy whenever I sweat even a small bit.  First of all, I live in Florida and about 6 months out of the year, I will start sweating within 10 minutes of being outside.  The makeup completely agrivates my skin.  Second of all, if I go dancing with  my friends and start sweating, it does the same thing.  I&#x27;ve even had to leave friends early in order to go to the bathroom to wash the makeup off, otherwise I was going to be clawing at my face and after I&#x27;ve washed the makeup off, my whole face looks red and irritated.  At first, I thought this was because the makeup was having an adverse interaction with my face lotions.  I tried switching lotions 4 times.  I&#x27;ve tried wearing it on numerous occasions without lotion at all, and it still has the same effect.  If I am not sweating, the makeup stays great, but it&#x27;s not practicle, and I find myself being weary to wear it if I might be in a situation to sweat, which sort of defeats the purpose of owning the makeup in the first place.      Conclusion: I definitely like the feel and look of mineral makeup and I am hoping that it is not the minerals that are making my skin itchy, so I will try other mineral makeup products, such as Sheer Cover, but I am not tempted to buy Bare Escentuals again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks and feels but I have an oily t-zone and the mineral veil has no staying power. It will only work for a few minutes then the shine comes thru worse than regular liquid makeup and powder.  I can actually see little oil droplets form. ICK. It also makes my pores look large.  If they could solve the staying power and oil control problem I would by this again but until then I will not buy it.</li>
            <li> The coverage was great and it was easy to use; I was extremely pleased with the results for about four days.  But by the end of the fourth day, I realized my face was absolutely covered with tons of little bumps. I&#x27;m not even sure if this is acne or something else, but it&#x27;s very unpleasant.  I&#x27;m also not sure if it was caused by the powder or by the gel/lotion-type stuff you put on first (which comes with the kit).  Big disappointment. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m not overly prone to acne; I&#x27;ve never had problems with drugstore makeup that&#x27;s labeled as non-comedigenic/non-acnegenic (which this product is not!).</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation that I have ever used - hand&#x27;s down.  As a makeup junkie, I have tried every brand of foundation: origins, smashbox, stila, etc.   This is the first time that I ever used a loose powder foundation and I have been totally converted.   The kit comes with all the brushes you need, two foundation shades, a bronzer, a primer, and mineral veil (makes you look poreless).   I never thought that I would be able to ween myself away from liquid foundation.  Bare Escentuals offers full coverage with a totally natural look.  My husband loves how I look and comments frequently about how my skin looks flawless but not fake.</li>
            <li> In my over twenty years of trying numerous foundations, I have yet to see anything cover and perfect all while allowing the natural radiance of your skin to shine through. This powdery foundation is like powdered gold. Not only do the crushed minerals shimmer ever so delicately, they are magical once they touch your skin. If you have even lighter skin than this kit allows for, you can order the FAIR foundation to compliment this kit. It is lighter than the Fairly Light and Light foundations. The Fairly Light seems to work for me, but having an even lighter shade is helpful in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lightness of the product is fascinating and you feel as if you are not wearing foundation. The free feeling and the beautiful complexion you achieve through the use of Bare Escentuals may make you want to try all their products. The kits are a good way to introduce your skin to the products because they include the brushes you need to apply this powdery foundation. The brushes in this kit are luxurious and include the Full Coverage Kabuki, Flawless Face and Max Coverage Concealer Brush. Once you order your kit, you may also find many other brushes you want to order and try, but these three will give you your powder foundation coverage. Brushes for eye makeup are not included in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Artist in you will love the way you apply this makeup. Each container of powder has many possibilities. You can blend more warmth or add a touch of summer shimmer. Once you have your foundation on, the possibilities are endless. This kit includes the Mineral Veil, Fairly Light and Light Foundation. The Bare Minerals Face Color 36077 Warmth is also included. An instruction guide/how-to brochure and DVD is also included to get you on your way to becoming your own makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is free of preservatives, talc, oil, fragrance, dyes and irritating chemicals. Once I put on this makeup, I thought I was dreaming. My skin adores this product and liquid makeup is history! The mineral veil also keeps away shine and is the perfect compliment to the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other items I&#x27;ve enjoyed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passionate Plum Eye Shadow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Escape Blush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Reviewliquid makeup is history!

            <li> I found this make-up just searching through Amazon and ordered it directly from the company because they give you a 30-day moneyback guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the make-up (I&#x27;m not sure what the guarantee is if you buy it through Amazon -- they might still offer the same).  You do have to pay shipping that way, but I thought the peace of mind the money back guarantee gave was worth it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 26 and have had combination skin my whole life while living in both dry and humid climates.  I&#x27;ve also had acne prone skin and gone through two rounds of Acutane.  My problem with make-up has always been that it looks great for the first hour that I put it on and then literally slides off me throughout the day (and I used expensive department store brands).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t perfected getting the make-up on in \\&quot;just five minutes\\&quot; for the basics like the video tells me I can, but the end results of the longer time are worth it in my book.  I will admit that this make-up did not cover as well as I thought it would, but I have very fair skin and trying to cover dark circles or acne scarring is difficult with any makeup.  I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars, though, and writing my first review on Amazon, because I am so impressed with how it feels and how it makes my skin feel.  Make-up no longer slides off my skin by the end of the day, and my skin is not oily even when I have slept in my make-up.  If you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants to look like you have fake airbrushed skin and have people comment that your make-up job is beautiful, then this is not the make-up you&#x27;re looking for.  But if you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants to look like the peasant girls in the movies who look like they woke up looking naturally beautiful and have people comment that YOU look beautiful, this make-up is for you.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in make-up beyond just the basics of foundation, then I suggest buying one of the larger expanded kits directly from the Bare Escentuals website so that you can get the money-back guarantee.  If you order the basic kit and like it, Sephora also has \\&quot;beauty at any age\\&quot; kits by decade that are a great value for add-ons.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help my acne and cover the redness that comes along with it. However, I found that the Bare Escentuals did not not really cover my acne at all (I have no idea how they covered the birthmarks and redness on TV). In addition, it made my face incredibly shiny. I tried everything from applying the mineral veil first and then applying after everything else, or just applying the mineral veil first or just applying the mineral veil last. I really wish this product would have worked for me....but I think if you have moderate to severe acne and are oily...you shouldn&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> First off, I absolutely love this stuff.  But before I go into a rave review let me address some of the drawbacks people have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle in a jar (though if this works for you than you&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s just that).  You have to put in the time and effort to take care of your skin properly to get the best possible effect.  Cleanse, exfoliate and definitely moisturize.  If you can&#x27;t find a regimen that works for you, go to a spa or a dermatologist and get a consultation done, it&#x27;s well worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Some people say it feels cakey.  These people may have overly oily skin and used too much.  Believe me it doesn&#x27;t take much, when you&#x27;re first starting out use a little bit at a time until you get an idea of how much you need.  If you have oily skin, try dusting some of the mineral veil over the oily spots first before applying the foundation then dust another light layer of mineral veil on top of everything for added shine protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brushes shed and seem low quality.  They definitely aren&#x27;t low quality, but the first time you use most makeup brushes they shed.  When I used the ones in my set the first time they shed a little bit.  It&#x27;s totally normal and all you need to do is take your index finger and thumb and lightly pluck the brush to get the loose hairs out and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It burned and stung and totally broke out my face.  Unfortunately not everything works for everyone.  Some people have very, very sensitive skin and have allergies to things that may not bother the vast majority of others.  As I said, go see a dermatologist or use what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my personal experience.  I was reading these reviews online last night and was a little nervous because of the bad reviews even though the majority were positive.  I took the advice of one reviewer and made a trip to an actual Sephora store to test it out before dropping the cash.  I am SO glad I did.  For one, like others with very fair skin, I needed the Fair color foundation and Bare Escentuals doesn&#x27;t make a Get Started Kit with the Fair foundation so I had to purchase it seperately.  The upside being that by purchasing the Fairly Light/Light Kit I can use the Fairly Light in the summer when my color darkens a bit or if I go tanning.  Bottom line, if you have a store anywhere near you it is worth the trip to get your color matched by a pro.  On the way home, it was pouring down rain and I thought there was something wrong with one of my tires.  I got out to check it and got half soaked, but my makeup didn&#x27;t flinch.  It still looked amazing without feeling heavy or dirty.  I have mild-moderate acne on my chin, jawline and forehead and even with the bare minerals you can still see a couple of the spots, but just barely.  My face overall looks more even, soft and radiant than ever.  With liquid makeup the foundation would cling to the driest spots I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and I felt like if I smiled my face would \\&quot;crack\\&quot; and my liquid foundation would make me look like an old painting.  The instructional DVD is a great help and you will be amazed at how versatile all of the additional products are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest to God, I feel like a supermodel with this stuff on and I can&#x27;t wait to start getting the eye, cheek and lip colors, too!  If nothing else, go to a Sephora store and give it a try.  I think you&#x27;ll be amazed and happy that you did.  Plus, you&#x27;ll save on shipping!I am SO glad I did.

            <li> I was really excited to try Bare Escentuals, and used it for about two weeks.  That was when my skin started breaking out.  I normally have good skin with no acne.  After trying Bare Escentuals I continually had clogged pores and horrible breakouts on my chin.  When I tried covering the breakouts the colors were way to orange for my fair skin tone.  I looked online for other reports of acne and clogged pores after using Bare Escentuals, and found out that one of the ingredients (bismuth oxychloride) actually can cause breakouts in some individuals.  I have stopped using this product and my skin has since cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a make up junkie - have shoeboxes full of make up that I \\&quot;play\\&quot; with, but on a daily basis, I really don&#x27;t wear much as I don&#x27;t like feeling all cakey and maskey.  I have been hearing about mineral make up for ages, and I even bought some of the drugstore brands of it, just to try it, and never noticed anything.  I also got weirded out about the idea of powder foundation - I splurge on foundation in general and always get the \\&quot;good\\&quot; stuff, not from the drugstore, and I didn&#x27;t think a powder could do much in the way of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then at the mall I went into Sephora and checked out this line, and decided to try it.  I also bought another seasonal set of eye colors and lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took everything apart and placed it on the counter and got to work seeing how this all went together.  After spending 20 minutes learning how to put it on, I presented my face to my hubby for comments.  He said, \\&quot;I absolutely love the finish, but you need to learn how to put in on better.  It&#x27;s too brown.\\&quot;  So every day since then I&#x27;ve been getting better, and I always check with him, and he examines my face in natural light.  If you&#x27;re fair, the \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot; that&#x27;s included in the kit is probably going to be too much.  I use just a teensy tiny bit.  I also use a bit of \\&quot;glee\\&quot;, which came with another kit I bought, and I would recommend it to even out the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; and give a truly rosy glowing look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mineral Veil is really great.  But I also recommend checking out the \\&quot;sheer radiance\\&quot; (which again, was included in another kit I got) - it reflects light and makes your skin look dewy and so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea that powder could give me this kind of coverage.  It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t cover up blemishes as well as a liquid might, but the payoff is that the rest of my skin looks absolutely amazing, so I don&#x27;t mind the one blemish that might not be covered.  Also, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any make up at all, and I think that having 90% amazing skin and not feeling masky is worth having a zit or two not covered up as well.  Also, I haven&#x27;t yet mastered using the concealer brush, so maybe as I get better, I&#x27;ll be able to cover up more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love looking at my skin when I&#x27;m wearing this make up, and my hubby says that it is completely worth the money and he thinks it makes my skin look great, too.  So I&#x27;m going to put all the other shoe boxes of make up in a closet somewhere, and maybe just take them out to play with occasionally!  But from now on, I&#x27;m a Bare Escentuals girl!having 90% amazing skin and not feeling masky is worth having a zit or two not covered up as well.

            <li> I have just about every skin issue there is.  Rosacea, large pores, dry spots, acne, all topped off with really pale skin that freckles.  But the biggest problem I have on my face is my birthmark, on the right side of my lower lip.  The thing will not leave.  I had surgury to get rid of it, but the mark is still there.  I decided to try Bare Escentuals, based on the recommendation of a friend.  It worked--I even found a color for my extremely pale skin.  My uneven, overly red cheeks now fade into the rest of my face.  The huge pores on my nose are invisible, the circles under my eyes are gone.  It is now impossible to see acne on my face thanks to this product.  But best of all, my birthmark is gone.  It truely is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I bought the Bare Minerals Starter Kit while on break from college and I&#x27;d heard so many great reviews from random people in the store going to buy more. I decided, \\&quot;Hey, if it sounds like an informercial in real life, why not?\\&quot; So I splurged a little. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I used the swirl-tap-buff method and it was so easy. It took so little time (which is always a plus, because personally, I&#x27;m busy from almost 0600 to 2300 every day, and I never have to spend more than five minutes (that&#x27;s eyes, too!) on my makeup) and I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about blending the liquid foundation in, or worry about powder or liquid lines at the jaw because it&#x27;s so light. I love the concealer brush; it&#x27;s my absolute favorite. I have light acne and it will even cover most of that, just like a liquid or stick concealer, but looks so much more natural! I thought that was *amazing*.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warmth is an awesome product; as long as you don&#x27;t use any more than about a pinhead, you come out looking sunkissed and beautiful. Glee is also really fun, and adds that rosy-happy look to your cheeks. I also *love* the Mineral Veil; it&#x27;s a really neat product that adds a great finished look while being totally see through and light. It polishes your final look and really give it that soft, smooth final touch we so desire in makeup. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, and I really recommend it for others with it. It softens and mattes the appearance of shine and makes it look healthy and glowing, not shiny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The whole Bare Minerals line, if used correctly, will probably give everyone that soft, natural, beautiful look most people crave but can&#x27;t get from heavy liquids and powders that don&#x27;t ever really match. The minerals are so light they don&#x27;t have to, they just have to be close, and your original skin tone does the rest! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have ever had with this product is the fact that if you travel with the pots they will become top heavy and whenyou open them or try to tap into the lid they may spill. Be careful of this if you have them! Always try to get most of it back through the holes by lightly tapping on the bottom if you have this problem. Sifting may also work if you have the cap on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, I absolutely *love* this line. I think it is absolutely amazing and so different from anything else. I also love that it includes two shades because let&#x27;s face it, our faces never stay the same color too long, and you can always mix and match, unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried (and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried *a lot*). I&#x27;ve even noticed a change in my acne without changing my cleaning/washing routine. I guess, if anything, the Bare Minerals nourish my skin! I sincerely hope everyone out there can get the same results as I did. If you do, you will never turn back.</li>
            <li> I will be 40 on my next birthday.  I now have to fight my adult acne AND wrinkles....what a great age to be!  I have tried many types of foundations and the Bare Minerals is the best by far.  The coverage is very nice and soft....it \\&quot;fills in\\&quot; my pores but it doesn&#x27;t hide my freckles....which I LOVE!  I haven&#x27;t had one break out since I began using either and a few times I even slept with it on, which is a definate no-no....but I had no problems.  Its pricey, but I don&#x27;t care.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy my shoes at Payless instead of Jimmy Chu&#x27;s....but I will never go back to Drugstore foundations!</li>
            <li> Hmmm, I beleived all the hype and watched all the infomercials and ordered what I thought would be the \\&quot;Ultimate Makeup\\&quot; and to my dissappointment it happened again the well known \\&quot;addition to the junk drawer\\&quot;. First let me say that I have good skin just a little oily and this product seemed to stick to those areas alot. Also had a huge problem with itching, I mean little twitches here and there (annoying),and not to mention the fact that the bristles of the application brush were all over me and its been 3 months of \\&quot;testing\\&quot; this product. I say this if it works for you - more power to you -, but it just didnt do it for me. I see there are new companies with this same mineral idea and I guess ill keep testing and trying till I find what I need or just keep to the liquid foundation that we all have been using till now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re like me - doing all the research before buying the product. I&#x27;m not a make-up professional by any means, and a wide variety of colors or brushes has been known to confuse me. But this looked fool-proof and \\&quot;good\\&quot; for my skin. And I hate liquid makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Way it Feels:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals every day since I received it early this week. I have fair skin (always buying the lightest foundation shade) that gets very dry in the winter...tight, but not flaky. The minerals do feel drying and I can tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup all day. It even seems to dry my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also gotten a few blemishes since using the product and look forward to washing my face by the end of the day. It is lightweight, but definitely noticeable. It&#x27;s much better than any liquid foundations I&#x27;ve tried and is comparable to any other pressed powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Way it Looks:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that this does cover redness and blemishes. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve figured out the technique for totally concealing under-eye circles. If you look close, it tends to look a little \\&quot;crepey\\&quot; or \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; under my eyes. But what concealer doesn&#x27;t? (I&#x27;m 26.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband told me it didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing any makeup and I agreed...except that I noticed that it did even out my skin tone. I was pleased by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; is nice, but the \\&quot;mineral veil\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me. My kit also came with \\&quot;well-rested\\&quot; and \\&quot;radiance.\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t found much use for these, yet--Radiance didn&#x27;t show up when I applied it and Well-Rested was the same as simply using the foundation to even the color around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brushes&lt;br /&gt;My first thought when I saw the brushes was that they are cheap. The handles are light plastic. But the brushes do feel soft and work well. The Buki brush and Concealer brushes are my favorites. The dual blending brush seems unnecessary to me. I haven&#x27;t had problems with bristles falling out. My least favorite brush is the \\&quot;Flawless Face.\\&quot; I feel like the bristles go into the pores of my skin and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Handy Buki brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The containers that the minerals come in also feel like cheap plastic...definitely not what I was expecting after putting down $75 for the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instructional DVD&lt;br /&gt;The How-To DVD was a helpful reminder of what I&#x27;ve seen in all the infomercials. Nothing new. It didn&#x27;t discuss how to use \\&quot;well-rested\\&quot; or \\&quot;radiance.\\&quot; It does advertise other products, like the Skin Rev-ver Upper and Basic Eye kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll send the product back because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for foundation, but I think I&#x27;ll shop around a little more before I buy a second time from Bare Escentuals.

            <li> I saw this infomercial and was skeptical. But I have very oily skin, frequent breakouts, and brown spots (melasma), and I have been searching for years to find something to deal with these issues. I ordered the Get Started Kit, have been using it for a month, and will never, ever go back to regular makeup. This stuff really does cover up your problem spots, and my skin has cleared up a lot. It&#x27;s also not greasy anymore. I&#x27;ll admit, I still use my Corn Silk powder to top it all off (a must for people with oily skin!), but even without my Corn Silk my skin isn&#x27;t nearly as oily as it used to be. This doesn&#x27;t feel cakey, and it has a natural look to it - you won&#x27;t go out in the natural light and discover your face is a different color than the rest of your body!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the net.  Used the dvd and just found it too hard to figure out.  It was so much trouble.  I just like using clinque because it was explained to me in the store and now I can order it online.  While I love buying everything online I just found this too combersome.  Perhaps it is not, but I just thought it was and there is no store in my city so I can fiture it out.  I just will stick with my bare skin and my clinique.  Hate this Hate this Hate this.  It is just more complicated than other makeup.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing foundation but because I have less than perfect skin I don&#x27;t feel comfortable going without it. I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands and types of foundation but have never found anything I was satisfied with.  That is until I tried Bare Escentuals.  I absolutely love this make-up (and I&#x27;ve never said that about a cosmetic product before).  It&#x27;s easy to apply, covers well, and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make-up at all.  I&#x27;d recommend starting with a kit which has an instruction DVD since applying this make-up is different than most others.  I&#x27;m definitely buying more and can&#x27;t wait to try their eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product before I shelled out the $60.  I would have to say the product is not worth the cost.  I have an oily T zone and it did keep that area dry most days but that was about all it did.  I tried Neutrogena mineral sheers ($12) for awhile before I tried the Bare Escentuals, for the money I would have to say it was a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have bad skin but I noticed an increase in clogged pores and blackheads while using this makeup. I would never sleep in makeup so I can not speak to that aspect of the manufactures claims.  If you don&#x27;t mind putting up $60 for makeup it is an okay product but if you would rather spend you money on other items (shoes, clothes, jewlery etc) then there are other products out there that are just as good.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic....Prescriptives,Nars,Lancome,Bobbi Brown,Clinique,you name it.I&#x27;ve always use liquid foundation for my combination skin,but when I saw all the Bare E. ads,I thought:\\&quot;Whoopee\\&quot;,makeup in a minute!\\&quot;.When it came ,I followed the instructions to the word.When finished I went out with friends,one of whom said\\&quot;What is on your face,you look really cakey?\\&quot;I ran to the ladies,looked close &amp; was appalled.My pores looked like craters(and I don&#x27;t have large pores), every tiny line exaggerated &amp; my entire face looked coated with colored flour.I did a quick wash up,redid my makeup with foundation from my purse &amp; salvaged the evening.The point is ,B. Minerals is JUST POWDER.NO MAGICAL PROPERTIES,BUT I guess you could use it to flour a cake pan!I gave it one star becauseI can use the brush at least!</li>
            <li> I started using this after my best friend purchased it and I tried it. My boyfriend had always complained that I wore foundation, saying that I didn&#x27;t need it and it didn&#x27;t look natural. When I started wearing this, he thought I wasn&#x27;t even wearing makeup. It looks so natural!!</li>
            <li> my skin is probably about average, a bit oily, a bit dry, redness across my nose, dark circles under my eyes, etc. i am quite pale.  i have never been able to find a lightweight coverage that worked, but bare minerals does! it is as fabulous as all the informercials say it is. i watched the first part of the video, and after about 1 minute putting on the fairly light makeup, i was simply AMAZED. my nose isn&#x27;t red, my dark circles are gone, it barely looks like i am wearing anything at all. i have never found such complete, color-matched coverage from so little makeup. and the warmth does a nice job as eyeshadow, although i am tempted to buy their eye kit too.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals products are all I use.  However, if you have the chance to go to a Bare Escentuals store, or Sephora, or a store that carries this line, then go in and have them match your skin to the proper color. It&#x27;s just like any other foundation -- you really have to use the proper shade for your skin to look good.      That said, I am a Bare Escentuals fan.  It&#x27;s the only make-up I use except for mascara.  When you put the right color on, your skin will look radiant. It does provide coverage but you can&#x27;t expect miracles from any foundation.  So if you have acne or scars, you will still get coverage but it won&#x27;t revert your skin to a pre-acne look!  My daughter is 16 and has acne. This provides the best coverage she has had and does not clog her pores like liquid foundations.      So, my advice is really to go to a professional make-up counter that carries this line, and let them help you find your color.</li>
            <li> With so many infomercials, I had to try this product.  Well, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  If you have medium to large pores, any blackheads or wrinkles, this product seeps into them.  Really not good for me.  Plus, the powder gets everywhere.  You have to hand it to BE for great marketing hype, but unfortunately, the product just doesn&#x27;t live up to it.  I stronly recommend trying it out in-store at Sephora or Bare Escentuals stores before buying it.</li>
            <li> This kit is an amazing value. However, for very fair skinned ladies like myself even the fairly light/light is a tad dark. I ended up having to purchase the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; foundation separately and mix the fairly light and light with Everyday Minerals colors I already owned to get a color that is appropriate for my face.    The brushes are awesome! &amp; considering the fact that 1 brush by itself is 0ver $20 this really is a good deal. The concealer brush is amazing and does a great job at covering fine lines and concealing blemishes. Make sure that you put on moisturizer and/or the skin revver upper before applying the foundation.    The Skin Revver Upper smells funny but it is a nice base for the make up.    Warmth is simply too dark for my porcelain skin with pink undertones-and I use it in the method consistent with the dvd, which is a tiny amount like a pin head of a few grains of salt.     For anyone who is interested in trying BE this is the way to go. It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and looks natural.</li>
            <li> This made my face extremely shiny, even after several layers of the mineral veil. also, the fairly light and light are not that light. One makes me orange and the other makes me yellow and both were way too dark. The coverage is good. I think if you have normal/combo skin type and can find the right shade then it&#x27;s great but if your like me (fair and oily) or even a little oily then don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
