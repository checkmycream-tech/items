            <li>I love that one 100 times more</li>
            <li>The product itself seemed to work fine.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not irritate the eye if you accidentally get it in there.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the am/pm face serum (which is what was originally posted on the page) and got this.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing with a light herbal sent !</li>
            <li>Eclos is a great product; however, this eye cream does not appear to be as beneficial as the other products Eclos makes.  </li>
            <li>The dark circles and bags have greatly improved to the point where friends and family noticed.</li>
            <li>she was impressed by how soft her skin feels after a few days of use</li>

            <li>I love the product and may try other things in the Eclos  line</li>
            <li>; however, it seems pretty clear that I am allergic to this particular forumula if any of it inadvertantly comes into contact with my eye.</li>
            <li>Too thick doesn&#x27;t soak in good and leaves a white film just get the restorative eye cream by eclos</li>
            <li>I looked at the ingredients more closely, and it is to be noted that this product contains oils from a lot of different flowers and plants including geraniums, willow, rosemarry, rosewood, and some other plants I am simply unfamilar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this product, I do not find any of the claims to be apparent for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin must be sensitive to something in it, but I doubt I&#x27;m the only person with this sensitivity.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ordered this for my girlfreind n she was impressed by how soft her skin feels after a few days of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 y/o this month and have minimal lines, no sagging and slight puffiness under my eyes. This product keeps my eyes looking bright and the skin around them taut. Now if I could just stop the incipient jowling in my lower face....hmmmm.</li>
            <li> Nothing was in the container. Disappointing because I really wanted to try this product.</li>
            <li> It lightens the dark circles under my eyes and reduces the puffiness. I&#x27;m really glad I bought this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love the Eclos skin products. Inexpensive, and very effective. If you haven&#x27;t already tried it, you should use this in conjunction with the Eclos face scrub!!</li>
            <li> Eclos is a great product; however, this eye cream does not appear to be as beneficial as the other products Eclos makes.  After using this product, I do not find any of the claims to be apparent for me.  It is a decent moisturizer at best.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see an improvement. And I gave it 1 month.  Every face is different I guess. For me was not the one</li>
            <li> I feel this product hides dark circles well. I dont believe this product will make this problem better over time.</li>
            <li> Very creamy.  I do love the Eclos line and wish they&#x27;d stop discontinuing products!</li>
            <li> You must use everyday.  It works.  Use with the other products and you will  be amazed.  word word word word</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and does not irritate the eye if you accidentally get it in there. Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in darkness, but it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference after my wife uses it for one month. Maybe it needs more time.  I guess that everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> Love all the products this company makes none of which break me out or irritate my skin ! Very soothing with a light herbal sent !</li>
            <li> I agree with the 5 star reviews that it reduced bags and  brightened the darkness under my eyes.  I wish I could have continued using it.  However after a week or so, red sore patches,  one  under each eye, started to form.  I looked worse than when I started, although it was doing what it promised.  It just did more--a couple unwanted bonuses.  My skin must be sensitive to something in it, but I doubt I&#x27;m the only person with this sensitivity.  I&#x27;d advise any friend with puffy eyes to try it but also to be on the look out for side effects.  Proceed with eyes wide open, so to speak.</li>
            <li> I love Eclos....  Keeps my skin clean and just looking great.</li>
            <li> Too thick doesn&#x27;t soak in good and leaves a white film just get the restorative eye cream by eclos I love that one 100 times more</li>
            <li> The product itself seemed to work fine. It moisturized around my eyes very well and didn&#x27;t seem to have any problems. Unfortunately, approximately an hour after I applied the eye cream, one of my eyes started to water profusely and became very red and irritated. It continued to water and started to sting. Eventually, after wiping my eye off and washing it out, the problem resolved. I assumed it was my seasonal allergies flaring up (but I have never had that kind of reaction to seasonal allergies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening, I applied the cream again. Please note that I was not using copious amounts. Once again, about 30 minutes later, both eyes started to water and become even more irritated. Very unpleasant. At this point, I suspected this was not related to seasonal allergies. I looked at the ingredients more closely, and it is to be noted that this product contains oils from a lot of different flowers and plants including geraniums, willow, rosemarry, rosewood, and some other plants I am simply unfamilar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try this product possibly one or two more time just to confirm it is not another environmental cause; however, it seems pretty clear that I am allergic to this particular forumula if any of it inadvertantly comes into contact with my eye. My skin does not seem to react to the product at all, fortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion for anyone that has any kind of seasonal allergies to buy this product with caution. I gave the product two stars because it seems to work appropriately, but I just happen to be sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that really works !!! After I used the first bottle ( lasted a month ) I was impressed w/ the results.  The dark circles and bags have greatly improved to the point where friends and family noticed. I have bought products that were 4 x&#x27;s the price w/ no results. I love the product and may try other things in the Eclos  line</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything different with this product.  I have ordered the am/pm face serum (which is what was originally posted on the page) and got this.  Tried twice on amazon.  Must of discontinued that product and replaced with this.</li>
