            <li>I bought a year ago and LOVE this pumpkin SMELL</li>
            <li>so ignore some of their paranoia however&amp;#62; This product (like so many) you put on with your hands...</li>
            <li>I really love this leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner...</li>
            <li>So I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way...and the BEST part is that since it&#x27;s a leave-in conditioner, you get whiffs of the light delicious pumpkin scent all day!  </li>
            <li>Love this product smells great and my hair is so soft and has so much volume I have already ordered more</li>
            <li>and I straighten it and blahblah and SO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>The smallest sizes cause not too much is needed! :)</li>
            <li>This product will absolutely not effect the health of your hair in any noticeable way,  If youre looking for something moisturizing to repair damage, or to keep your hair looking healthy and gorgeous please look up my review of MATRIX BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM.</li>
            <li>so we are sleeping on pillows full of products.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and my hair is soft!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about all the Pumpkin Sexy Hair Products!</li>
            <li>My hair is silky after using it combined with the big sexy shampoo.</li>
            <li>First off how can I rate this?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super tiny, but has lasted me for several months (I just use it to get a nice autumn scent in my hair).</li>
            <li>Smell is yummy and it leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>You can comb this through your hair and even blow dry it after and the smell stays in your hair for many hours.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it manageable and easy to style after ibblow dry my curly hair straight!</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t help my hair at all.</li>
            <li>skin absorbs chemicals FAST.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it really helped my hair.  </li>
            <li>They need to make the pumpkin line all full sized, because unless you barely have any hair, this won&#x27;t cover much.</li>
            <li>This was the main reason I bought this product...  </li>
            <li>When I first received tiny bottle</li>
            <li>THIS is the only HSH out of the whole pumpkin line that has longevity as far as the fragrance goes.</li>
            <li>It is OBVIOUSLY old and expired.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, although I am not sure how well it actually moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Use the right amount or it will make hair weighted down but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Morrocan Oil is NOT just oil - The famous brand is one of the worse toxic loaders.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So even though it&#x27;s small, I don&#x27;t even need to use too much, just a teeny bit in the palm of my hand</li>
            <li> This bottle has last a long time which amazes me.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair!</li>
            <li> not really in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> A little much for very small size.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a trial version or something, seems too small to be an actual product, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> If anything, it dried it out.  </li>
            <li> i was durprised at how small it was for the price</li>
            <li> Very small bottle, the directions were hard to read.</li>
            <li> Methylparaben partically the worse.</li>
            <li> , it comes in a beat up box, it&#x27;s 1.7 measly ounces, and it paid a small fortune for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love this product. Smells great. My hair is silky after using it combined with the big sexy shampoo. will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Ahem... So even though it&#x27;s small, I don&#x27;t even need to use too much, just a teeny bit in the palm of my hand and I have long hair! I put it in my damp hair after I get out of the shower and I straighten it and blahblah and SO SMOOTH. I love love love it! And then i also add fekkai brilliant glossing cream and my hair feels like I just came out of the salon! So I&#x27;d def. recommend getting both of those! The smallest sizes cause not too much is needed! :)</li>
            <li> i was durprised at how small it was for the price but ive loved this stuff forever!!</li>
            <li> Great product and perfect scent for the season. Great smelling and adds a nice easy to style softness to your hair. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner going as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  A little goes a long way...and the BEST part is that since it&#x27;s a leave-in conditioner, you get whiffs of the light delicious pumpkin scent all day!  Love it, Love it, LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very small bottle, the directions were hard to read. It really didn&#x27;t help my hair at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great! Use the right amount or it will make hair weighted down but not greasy. A little much for very small size.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, although I am not sure how well it actually moisturizes. I feel like this is a trial version or something, seems too small to be an actual product, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> First off how can I rate this? I waited 3-5 days for it, it comes in a beat up box, it&#x27;s 1.7 measly ounces, and it paid a small fortune for it. I bet I&#x27;ll get one usage out of it. I&#x27;m very disappointed. This should&#x27;ve said travel sized on it. They need to make the pumpkin line all full sized, because unless you barely have any hair, this won&#x27;t cover much.</li>
            <li> I bought a year ago and LOVE this pumpkin SMELL but then I read label. After being diao with fibroids I threw out all these PARABEN, hormone disrupting poisons. Methylparaben partically the worse. Go to EWG web site. I don&#x27;t have scent allergies so ignore some of their paranoia however&amp;#62; This product (like so many) you put on with your hands... skin absorbs chemicals FAST. I shower and wash my hair before bed so we are sleeping on pillows full of products. And surprise:  Morrocan Oil is NOT just oil - The famous brand is one of the worse toxic loaders. Chemical soup! READ ladies!</li>
            <li> I really love this leave in conditioner.  It smells like pumpkins (which smells wonderful) and leaves my hair shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li> Love this product smells great and my hair is so soft and has so much volume I have already ordered more</li>
            <li> Buying the big bottle! Love the smell and my hair is soft! Leaves it manageable and easy to style after ibblow dry my curly hair straight!</li>
            <li> Best Scent Ever! I can&#x27;t say enough about all the Pumpkin Sexy Hair Products! And this one is no different!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is simply the best....smells great and pumpkin is great for the hair.....adds shine and body. I purchase this each year for a family member....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super tiny, but has lasted me for several months (I just use it to get a nice autumn scent in my hair). Awesome.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner on my curly hair to help diminish the frizz.  It also smells wonderful.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I first received tiny bottle I was upset but I discovered a dime size amount each use is all I need. This bottle has last a long time which amazes me. Smell is yummy and it leaves my hair super soft! My frizzy hair is manageable! I highly recommend this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner...</li>
            <li> I ran across this product and ordered.  It is OBVIOUSLY old and expired.  It has a hint of pumpkin smell and scent but it has no conditioning properties whatsoever.  I asked for a refund and sent in somments but never got a reply or refund.</li>
            <li> THIS is the only HSH out of the whole pumpkin line that has longevity as far as the fragrance goes. You can comb this through your hair and even blow dry it after and the smell stays in your hair for many hours.  This was the main reason I bought this product...  So I am pleased.  Moisturizing? meh. not really in my opinion.  But the smell is AMAZING. This product will absolutely not effect the health of your hair in any noticeable way,  If youre looking for something moisturizing to repair damage, or to keep your hair looking healthy and gorgeous please look up my review of MATRIX BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM. ((but AVOID the ULTRA versions of BIOLAGE as they have CONES.  Ultra is a newer formulation&gt; Buyer Beware)</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner without weight. Detangles even color treated hair.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it really helped my hair.  If anything, it dried it out.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  Yuck yuck</li>
