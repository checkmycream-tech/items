            <li>Veet has a fan for sure!!</li>
            <li>and OMG it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I tested a patch on my leg, and was thrilled when it worked!  </li>

            <li>The results were remarkable.  </li>
            <li>“I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.” I love Veet because it give me the best quality in hair removal.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very strong and chemical; use in ventilated area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Excellent on legs, use on bikini area at your own discretion...with a lot of care.</li>
            <li>I have a good amount of hair on my arms</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good thing about this was the timing.</li>
            <li>loved this product.</li>
            <li>have been using Veet for years now, way before I even owned a computer and have loved it.</li>
            <li>Good, a bit too floral smell.</li>
            <li>Good one..</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product</li>

            <li>which was great all around including a better smell</li>

            <li>I tried this in hope that I could stop waxing and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Will be buying more!</li>
            <li>I just love this product!</li>
            <li>but, I love it!</li>
            <li>Your not supposed to leave it on for more than 10 minutes but even leaving it on for the max ammount of time, it just didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer needs to do something about the faulty top!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>lot better than shaving!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>cream also works amazingly on arms (including armpits), legs and bikini line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, leaves your skin baby smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>and after you epilate in your own system of choice i.e. shaving, plucking, waxing, etc, just rub that cream on and it doubles your time of being hairless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and after you epilate in your own system of choice i.e. shaving, plucking, waxing, etc, just rub that cream on and it doubles your time of being hairless.       </li>
            <li>it kind of scratches the skin..</li>
            <li>it kind kind of soothes.</li>
            <li>Also, the product leaves your skin kind of sticky for a while, even after you wash with a body wash after.</li>
            <li>Also, the product leaves your skin kind of sticky for a while, even after you wash with a body wash after.</li>
            <li>tried this a while ago and liked it...</li>
            <li>it is not as effective on these areas</li>
            <li>I used a washcloth and warm water to take off the lotion.</li>
            <li>had no reaction and great hair removal success!</li>
            <li>At that time I knew that she was very satisfied with this item :)</li>
            <li>thing I would like to point out is that the cream has a very strong salon chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t burn or itch at all and actually smells good!  </li>
            <li>I have tried every hair removal product on the market for manscaping and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and it was more effective than shaving.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li>One tube has lasted me more than 5 uses.</li>
            <li>Using that principal I found that this product works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a benefit</li>
            <li>The smell actually isn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
            <li>but when I used it on my underarms and legs, it didn&#x27;t remove more than 1/4 to 1/2 of my hair</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Veet, though, was like magic.  </li>
            <li>However, the directions say to turn the top of the pump counter clockwise to release</li>
            <li>and I turned and turned and turned some more and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea you can just apply this product, and have hair free legs for up to a week and not have to bother with shaving every day!</li>
            <li>Apply more than you think you need.</li>
            <li>It did now, however, do a better job than shaving.</li>
            <li>my skin after looks shiney and healthy.</li>
            <li>The hair is not removed as closely as waxing would achieve but, in a matter of minutes, most of the hair  was gone.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure not to exceed the time limit (I keep it on for a maximum of thirteen minutes) or else it will cause the skin to break.  </li>
            <li>It works more as a trimmer than a razor.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair remover for my legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly satisfied, and would recommend</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t get most of the hair.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using it too. :-)</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>and if you decided to be a daredevil like me and use it on your face make sure you DO NOT leave it on longer than 5 mins.</li>
            <li>the cream worked as it said and my wife is more than satisfied by the product</li>
            <li>Please for the love of all that is holy, heed my tale of woe.</li>
            <li>So much better than shaving and Nair.</li>
            <li>I love the results</li>
            <li>it was okay.  </li>
            <li>2) Safe For All Colorfast Washables And Works In All Temperatures.</li>
            <li>On Garments For More Than 5 Minutes May</li>
            <li>8)</li>
            <li>The stench would linger for days after using the product, no matter how many baths I took.</li>
            <li>This cream smells okay and does not leave an after smell</li>
            <li>It may decrease as I become more used to the cream, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I have to put it on a bit thicker than my instincts want me to. :)</li>
            <li>It is a much better alternative than shaving.</li>
            <li>like i&#x27;m sure most people have.</li>
            <li>I waited a couple more minutes before rinsing it off and wiping it off with a textured towel, in circular motions.</li>
            <li>my bikini area was mostly hair-free.</li>
            <li>Have been using veet for more than 7years</li>
            <li>; so the sugar helped make that feel better.  </li>
            <li>So, if I have to use this stuff - and it&#x27;s better than shaving and cheaper than waxing</li>
            <li>What more could I ask?</li>
            <li>I have a fair amount of hair and this cuts right through</li>
            <li>Great stuff, did the job as promised and left skin smooth and silky; loved the product.  </li>
            <li>First, I loved the bottle with the pump.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it works fast, but I did not think it did an amazing job at removing some of the hair from the roots (as stated in the description).</li>
            <li>The hair removed easily and I used it on many places (legs, feet, hands, body) and it worked well throughout.</li>
            <li>Ok things I do like about this are that it&#x27;s in an easy to use bottle with spout.</li>
            <li>(for people that isn&#x27;t allergic to it), I don&#x27;t present any allergies or reaction to it so for me it works wonderful: hair free in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m sure it will work for others that have fine hair.</li>
            <li>but most importantly, (well for ME anyways...</li>
            <li>it allowed more free hands to spread on skin</li>
            <li>The good news is that most of the hair was gone on the first try and didn&#x27;t even leave it on the full 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and ive had to be really easy and use lots of shaveing cream when I shaved my legs.</li>
            <li>pump style container makes it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>Remove hair very quickly~</li>
            <li>- I like the easy application pump bottle and product</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend keeping it off of your testicles/labia</li>
            <li>Iv used plenty of veet products but this one the smell is so strong.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend wearing gloves when using this.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy this kind of hair remover.</li>
            <li>so I just washed it off in the shower with my hands and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like roses, but shower and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>so guys it works on thicker hair fine</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and was easy to remove</li>
            <li>My hair is medium to fine.</li>
            <li>My legs are super smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone about to attempt a huge shave after not &amp;#34;keeping up&amp;#34; with their hair, as it&#x27;s a lot easier and quicker than trimming + shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought, but it made a huge difference in the way the cream smelled and felt.</li>
            <li>I was shocked,and smooth.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend using this because it works so great</li>
            <li>Some portions of my legs were gloriously smooth....</li>
            <li>and now I have silky smooth skin.      </li>
            <li>I have been hair FREE for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>I tested a few times and this is great!</li>
            <li>Spreads smooth.  </li>
            <li>so I give them a five star for my five star smooth legs and underarms</li>
            <li>I just jump in the shower right after and use an old washcloth and just wipe off the cream and all the hair comes with it and your legs are silky smooth and look AMAZING!</li>
            <li>others still had significant stubble.</li>
            <li>No more nicks when shaving is the best part of this product</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time yesterday; I read the instructions on the bottle, where it said it could be used safely on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>1/3-2/3&#x27;s product would have been in accessible because of the defective pumps.  </li>
            <li>Then wash with cool water and you&#x27;ll be hair free.</li>
            <li>and I like the boys clean but</li>
            <li>Let hair grow out a bit if looking for super smooth areas.</li>
            <li>This one was even better because it was more effective in less time &#x3D; happier skin.</li>
            <li>I do feel thatit is unfortunate that I had a reaction, because I will say that my legs came out wonderfully, and it was very easy to achieve.  </li>
            <li>It did a very good job at removing unwanted hair from my body, and also left it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate really good just like any hair removal method to make sure you don&#x27;t get those bumps, plus when you scrub hard it gets all the hair off, even the ones you missed with the spatula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works fast &amp; is pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, Veet is just as good as Nair, nothing different.</li>
            <li>Because i use nair before, I waited two week before Veeting my full legs.</li>
            <li>Slower hair growth, possibly, but my legs are only smooth for a day at best.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t terribly good about paying attention to the timer and left it on for 1-2 minutes longer in some spots.</li>
            <li>I will blame this on the skin being more sensitive in some areas, however I strongly recommend you test the product out before you use it</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t irritate me at all, and the smell is significantly improved over the last time i tried this kind of product (8 years?)</li>
            <li>I have been using this product recently, and am very glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Not only did it NOT fail, it smelled good too.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that if you want fast, easy hair removal...give it a try.</li>
            <li>One nice thing it did was exfoliate beautifully - I was shocked and horrified by the number of ingrown hairs on my calves that it revealed after melting the top layers of my skin off.</li>
            <li>please try it first!</li>
            <li>for the first time i think that is great considering the other products i have used.</li>
            <li>Leave the cream on for 5 to 7 minutes if you have \\&quot;thicker hair\\&quot; and then wipe off (or use the cheap plastic thing that doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as fast or well like a face towel).</li>
            <li>I love having smooth arms, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>I got this one instead of the sensitive skin formula because this one got better reviews</li>
            <li>is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t decided if the expense is worth it--</li>
            <li>It was only smooth for 3-4 days, but that&#x27;s better than shaving.</li>
            <li>I think the sensitive one would work better for me....</li>
            <li>Its worth it.</li>
            <li>certainly worth a try but dont count on it before  abig event</li>
            <li>In 20 more years I&#x27;ll be too old to care about hair on my legs</li>
            <li>There is a smell after using it, but it&#x27;s far better than the smell of Nair anything.</li>
            <li>This cream works wonders, Now, I am completely hairless and so much more</li>
            <li>While Stain Is Still Fresh. 5)</li>
            <li>Most of the hair was gone, though I could feel soft, peachy hairs on my legs and</li>
            <li>Yes you read that right 5 WEEKS.</li>
            <li>It works like it says and the hair comes right off of my legs.</li>
            <li>In fact, the description on the page right now gives directions for getting stains out with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full length of time, and was pleased to see the hair removed.</li>
            <li>but i did and o am i glad the smell isnt that bad no burning and the best part</li>
            <li>So I definitely recommend using a body scrub instead right after, and then you will be able to get all of the residue off.</li>
            <li>So I definitely recommend using a body scrub instead right after, and then you will be able to get all of the residue off.</li>
            <li>You run out of this stuff pretty quickly because you have to use so much of it.</li>
            <li>No mess, easy use.</li>
            <li>It works best if the hairs are not too long so, for those using it on the bikini area, trim a little if the hairs down there are at a length you are able to easily braid.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim from my grocery store for about 2 bucks MORE then it&#x27;s currently selling for on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Works at first, after just two weeks stopped working</li>
            <li>I use this to remove the hair on my arms, &amp; it really works!  </li>
            <li>Veet makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>So I tried it on my arms first</li>
            <li>All my friends told me that Veet is better than nair that it would last days longer.</li>
            <li>Make sure to leave it on only 5-6 minutes though</li>
            <li>I assumed this would be more of the same, but I have no issues.</li>
            <li>The Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream was the first hair removal cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>definitely works better than nair.</li>
            <li>I used it on my chest took it off after 6 minutes with the spatula at first</li>
            <li>I set a timer, slathered it on (legs first, then underarms), and waited.  </li>
            <li>This is causing some definite discomfort for today, as I won&#x27;t dare put on any deodorant, let alone wear a shirt that will touch the area, until it is better healed.</li>
            <li>The point of getting this stuff is to get rid of hair better than shaving and have it last for longer.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done first time.</li>
            <li>At first I was scared of using it for the first time I thought it will give me allergies</li>
            <li>I thought maybe 20+ years later, they might work better....</li>
            <li>Well they smell better, but still work about the same for me anyway....</li>
            <li>Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair!</li>
            <li>Simple Magical...</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say this cream is not intended for the face.</li>
            <li>I guess it was my first time with it</li>
            <li>the past, I have successfully used Sally Hansen Cream Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li>I first tried hair remover creams about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to give them another try and have been fairly pleased that I did.</li>
            <li>perfect for getting all the hair out it worked absolutely well although there were a few strands left,</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>(no matter what, I&#x27;ve tried many things) leaves my skin irritated and later I get tons of ingrown hairs, which is what I was trying to avoid!</li>
            <li>The first thing my husband asked when he got home was, &amp;#34;Did you use depilatory?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair!</li>
            <li>I winced as I wiped it clean and dabbed warm water on the area, the stinging almost unbearable to touch in these raw areas.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s more convenient to shave since you can do it in the shower although, this is really good for hard to shave hair like on your stomach, lower back, feet, ect.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised, doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious odor, and is gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does have a mild burn to it</li>
            <li>Worked the first time around and much better than I expected and in 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>it lasts longer then shaving and is easy to apply and get off and actually does when its supposed to.</li>
            <li>However, I would still recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have terribly sensitive skin and is looking for a quick hair removal option.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
            <li>Then you take the little scraper tool they gave you, and kind of rub the product (and in theory, the hair) off of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe because I was scraping so hard trying to get the hair off, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good look.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I was scraping so hard trying to get the hair off, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good look.</li>
            <li>, it really just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>so I tried veet and it really does work.</li>
            <li>BOY HAS THIS STUFF REALLY CHANGED</li>
            <li>so much I wish I had a lifetime supply of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please give it a try, you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>and I forgot one important detail, after the regrowth the hair came back lighter and finer than ever before!</li>
            <li>so much I wish I had a lifetime supply of it.</li>
            <li>Please give it a try, you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>and I forgot one important detail, after the regrowth the hair came back lighter and finer than ever before!</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>and this is the cheapest, hassle free, no waxing or getting cut open, way to do it.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think this would work for me</li>
            <li>I remember using the pink bottle many years ago</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>It really works and i already found something to avoid the irritation on my legs..</li>
            <li>and you cannot beat the silkly smooth legs that you are left with.</li>
            <li>I love my pubic area completely devoid of hair.  </li>
            <li>but I never gave to do much work after I use it</li>
            <li>I have used this hair removal cream on my whole body and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li>Used on my legs after shaving with electric razor and couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair it still removed.</li>
            <li>so I have very course hair.</li>
            <li>but i guess roses really do smell like booboo so .......</li>
            <li>If you read the directions carefully it would work much better and lighter.</li>
            <li>Absolutely removes hair and keeps it off longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>The hear doesn&#x27;t grow as fast.</li>
            <li>Product was received on time and works very well.</li>
            <li>the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still keep buying this, but probably only for weekly use on my forearms, which I like smooth.</li>
            <li>No fumbling with the bottle or squeezing out too much at once, just one press of the pump</li>
            <li>All the hair disappeared and my skin was left smooth.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>It was not fully effective in moving all of the hair and ended up being a waste of money.</li>
            <li>overall, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive and want to give this a try, it may or may not work ok for you.</li>
            <li>overall, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive and want to give this a try, it may or may not work ok for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I finally found a depilatory that I can use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is effective for removing hair in unwanted areas, but after the hair was removed, I noticed that some areas were left with irritation, a rash, or red bumps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use if you need to get bits of hair out of the way, but nothing too thick.</li>
            <li>This works much better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying some other product, but don&#x27;t buy Veet</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and only used a washcloth like some suggested after leaving it on actually about 10 minutes and the hair came off my legs, armpits and bikini area avoiding the sensitive private areas and my hair is actually fine not the prickly kind many have.</li>
            <li>, I will say that I also appeared to have an allergic reaction to the stuff; my legs, (which I will add, are smooth and lovely thanks to the product), did break out in hives a few different places.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Target and saw the Veet Supreme Essence Gel Cream Pump for 7.99 and saw the &#x27;moisturizing, new, silky smooth, essential oils&#x27; and etc and decided ah, what the hell</li>
            <li>When I read this had essential oils I wasn&#x27;t in party mode, nothing special</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly like most other peoples do after it&#x27;s been shaved or waxed or in this case epilated, so</li>
            <li>I will use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>I left it on for the full 10 minutes and, while I didn&#x27;t break out in a rash like a lot of people on here seem to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to give it another try, but my first impression is that I had to follow up with a standard razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li>I put on a good thin layer without rubbing it in much like you would do with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>works well especially for those who are not ready to shave their own legs yet</li>
            <li>particularly if you&#x27;re gonna use it for a bikini or a Brazilian...</li>
            <li>works fast and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>However, I have very sensitive skin that becomes irritated fast.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work out that great for me, but its possibly it is a users error (mine) or that someone with a different hair/skin type might have better luck with this</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It stank to high heaven, and it didn&#x27;t remove my hair adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping this would work a little bit better</li>
            <li>Underarms are a little bit more tricky because the hair is thicker, so have to put this Veet on twice on my underarms.</li>
            <li>It give me a lot of troubles and i ask for my doctor and eat a lot of anti-allergic drug and now after about 11 days, my face feel better, but still a lot of erythema exist, and sometimes feel a little itch on my face.</li>
            <li>It was so much easier to use than those gels and creams that come in tubes since it was a lot less messier and made for easy storage.</li>
            <li>and it was really soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving and was really scared of trying any products as I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The applicator works ok for for legs but used under the arm is just a waste of time.</li>
            <li>; but I used it on my top lip for a few seconds - 20secs MAX - and had no irritations what so ever.</li>
            <li>Normally I would be holding my breath in the bathroom because the chemical odor is just unbearable</li>
            <li>Experienced a slight chemical burn with the 10 minutes session, and still had a little stubble just as if I had shaved.  </li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>It says no more than the maximum of 6 minutes... which should tell you how strong this thing is!</li>
            <li>It works VERY quickly, and there&#x27;s a definite difference between 6 minutes and 7 minutes - a mistake I made last night when I used it &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  I was on fire after rinsing it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Makes sense since fingernails are made out of similar stuff as hair, right?)</li>
            <li>I normally have very sensitive,  eczema prone skin</li>
            <li>i put it on when my skin when its super dry and leave it for about 4 mins and then shave it off.</li>
            <li>But then again, my hair grows back very fast...</li>
            <li>Most of the products I used in the past required a 10 minute wait.  </li>
            <li>It smelled faintly floral, which was washed away after I rinsed and left a nice light fragrant</li>
            <li>but, I have no redness or red bumps which is a first.</li>
            <li>The product does work a lot better than its past incarnations, but if you&#x27;re looking for keeping the hair away for awhile you may as well go get it waxed off.</li>
            <li>And when I tried to use this product on my already sensitive armpits, OMG!</li>
            <li>After the first time I had stuble the next day (just like I would have with a razor)</li>
            <li>This is going to last a longtime and I love how much easier it actually did seem compared to shaving after the time spent doing it</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, this product can make a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It was more mess and trouble than it was worth.</li>
            <li>It was more mess and trouble than it was worth.</li>
            <li>i cant even begin to tell you how much money ive wasted on trying to find a razor and cream that works and doesnt leave me with itchy red irritated legs and red bumbs that are less attractive than just not shaving at all.</li>
            <li>There is plenty of product left in this large jar, so I will try again when hair grows  a little longer- hopefully with better results next time!</li>
            <li>There is a little more stubble than I get with shaving, but overall it is quicker and easier to use the</li>
            <li>The one think you really need to make sure you do with these types of creams is definitely not use to little cream to where you are trying to stretch it to a larger area that it is somewhat causing you to rub it in.</li>
            <li>please do not apply it anywhere near your genitalia</li>
            <li>and WOW</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Veet Fast Acting Gel Cream Hair burn my skin.</li>
            <li>I will probably wait and see how far this bottle goes.</li>
            <li>I tested this and the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, I wold avoid this product altogether!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove all that much hair, in fact I had to go back over my legs with a razor after I used it for the recommended time.</li>
            <li>I understand that this could possibly attribute to what happened with my underarms and that it very well might not be the case for everyone.  </li>
            <li>But if you have even slightly sensitive skin...go for the sensitive Veet gel cream instead.</li>
            <li>the only reason i gave it a three was it is really conditioning.</li>
            <li>On the sensitive skin along the inside of the labia, smear with petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>but it worked really well actually.</li>
            <li>Spray Onto The Stain, Covering It Completely.</li>
            <li>Spray Onto The Stain, Covering It Completely.</li>
            <li>I had no irritation and it was fast acting.</li>
            <li>however I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I purchased the sensitive version of this cream and used it on my legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li>I have had friends get yeast infections because they applied it to areas too sensitive.</li>
            <li>My legs have never been so soft in my life.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I only have to leave it on for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about my hairy arms, so I decided to give it a shot one more time, a few years later, with this product.</li>
            <li>Once I learned to apply this product thickly, and for the maximum amount of time, this product would just work ok.</li>
            <li>Some other hair remove cream leaves me feeling itchy, but this one had no effects and left me with just smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I first bought this item from the local drug store, a smaller version.  </li>
            <li>I finally just took the top of and scooped the cream out with a small spoon.  </li>
            <li>Smell was probably better than the original version but still unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Apparently my skin was to sensitive.</li>
            <li>I normally use nair and have no problem with burning,but my hair grow back in  20 hours to 25 hours.</li>
            <li>That went back to normal after a week but caused some discomfort.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend keeping the area you use this on covered in lotion for the first few days after hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Much better now; in fact hardly noticed it!  </li>
            <li>it gets the job done (usually) shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li>overall this is a SUPERB product for those who hate shaving/tweezing and don&#x27;t want to wax.</li>
            <li>It left my legs hair free for a week and a half!</li>
            <li>Works fast and not irritating to my skin but do a test first to see if it&#x27;s irritating for yours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Veet hair remover for years - no other hair remover comes close to working as well.  </li>
            <li>I also remember getting a slight rash the first time i used it, but my skin seems to have toughened up over time with repeated use (and i have sensitive skin to begin with).</li>
            <li>Maybe someone with finer hair would have better luck, but for me it is not worth it to subject my skin to chemicals and still have stubble.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is also big enough to use all over your body and still have enough for a few more times.</li>
            <li>Not only does this get rid of hair, but apparently it makes your skin soft as hell!</li>
            <li>Consistency of gel and design of the bottle keeps everything generally neat during application.</li>
            <li>Works not good enough, you&#x27;re better off waxing or shaving or even epilating.</li>
            <li>I clearly didn&#x27;t investigate by reading reviews, so I guess it&#x27;s on me that I can&#x27;t get my money back.  </li>
            <li>I get much smoother legs with Nair, and even with shaving (though that doesn&#x27;t last as long.)</li>
            <li>This stuff does not work, I had it on for the maximum time and it barely took off the hair.</li>
            <li>So my basic principal for using this product is: leave it on for 10 minutes in not so sensitive areas (legs, underarms, etc.) and 5 minutes for sensitive areas (upper lip, chin, etc.)</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work at all and actually left a chemical burn on my skin near my underarm where it had transferred accidentally.  </li>
            <li>It definitely did not burn me the same way Nair did as long as I don&#x27;t take a shower first.</li>
            <li>My entire chest was left with stubble, which as most of you men out there know really sucks after about a day.</li>
            <li>I actually bought it for my 10 year old daughter that goes to gymnastics.</li>
            <li>Ive only tryed it on my legs so far  </li>
            <li>Barely works.</li>
            <li>Only place it worked was near belly button.</li>
            <li>so most methods of hair removal are not attractive options for me.  </li>
            <li>ok, to start it off fellas, this is soooo much easier that razors or clippers (less painful and no irritation) ive used it pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend using the product just for legs (at least at first!) and immediately ceasing use at any sign of pain, burning, or tingling!</li>
            <li>better smell than the other veet products i&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Waxing is a whole other thing.</li>
            <li>the pain I&#x27;ll have for the next few days weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I either didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough or my leg hairs were too long because it still left quite a bit of stubble.  </li>
            <li>I usually epilate my arms and legs (with an occasional shave if I need to do it quick).</li>
            <li>If you used enough cream, the hair should come off with barely any rubbing at all.</li>
            <li>However, the pump on each container is consistently defective and wastes the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently pregnant and it&#x27;s hard to stay groomed with a razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this Veet Gel when I was pregnant and finding it hard to do all those contortionist acts just to shave my legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li>but, it isn&#x27;t bad and many said it does the first time</li>
            <li>I put a thick layer on my legs and left it on for the full six minutes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you get a good sized bottle and it goes a very long way since you only need literally one pump per leg, and one pump for both arms together, and it only needs a very very very thin layer, so this stuff lasts a long time, and I love this stuff</li>

            <li> I followed up with Epil Stop which worked great and no irritation.</li>
            <li> So I had to find a way to remove hair Stat Lol.</li>
            <li> My sister had used this and had great results, so I took the plunge.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, smells nice and no chemical burns.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Worked great with no burns or anything.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great Buy.</li>
            <li> Works great though when you have the time.</li>
            <li> so happy i took the chance and bought this.</li>
            <li> Works great for the longer (~1/2&amp;#34; or longer) hairs, almost as great as a wax.</li>
            <li> Veet has a fan for sure!!</li>
            <li> and OMG it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I tested a patch on my leg, and was thrilled when it worked!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what the hair on my legs is made out of, honestly!  </li>
            <li> The results were remarkable.  </li>
            <li> “I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.” I love Veet because it give me the best quality in hair removal.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is very strong and chemical; use in ventilated area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Excellent on legs, use on bikini area at your own discretion...with a lot of care.</li>
            <li> I have a good amount of hair on my arms</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good thing about this was the timing.</li>
            <li> loved this product.</li>
            <li> have been using Veet for years now, way before I even owned a computer and have loved it.</li>
            <li> Good, a bit too floral smell.</li>
            <li> Good one..</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product</li>
            <li> search for a good hair remover continues.</li>
            <li> I LOVET IT GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> but this product is really really good</li>
            <li> This product does a really good job.</li>
            <li> this product its good..</li>
            <li> The product is good and is better than shaving!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is healthier and more attractive.  </li>
            <li> which was great all around including a better smell</li>
            <li> lol :)</li>
            <li> I tried this in hope that I could stop waxing and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I just love this product!</li>
            <li> but, I love it!</li>
            <li> Your not supposed to leave it on for more than 10 minutes but even leaving it on for the max ammount of time, it just didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer needs to do something about the faulty top!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> lot better than shaving!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> cream also works amazingly on arms (including armpits), legs and bikini line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves your skin baby smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> and after you epilate in your own system of choice i.e. shaving, plucking, waxing, etc, just rub that cream on and it doubles your time of being hairless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and after you epilate in your own system of choice i.e. shaving, plucking, waxing, etc, just rub that cream on and it doubles your time of being hairless.       </li>
            <li> it kind of scratches the skin..</li>
            <li> it kind kind of soothes.</li>
            <li> Also, the product leaves your skin kind of sticky for a while, even after you wash with a body wash after.</li>
            <li> Also, the product leaves your skin kind of sticky for a while, even after you wash with a body wash after.</li>
            <li> tried this a while ago and liked it...</li>
            <li> it is not as effective on these areas</li>
            <li> I used a washcloth and warm water to take off the lotion.</li>
            <li> had no reaction and great hair removal success!</li>
            <li> At that time I knew that she was very satisfied with this item :)</li>
            <li> thing I would like to point out is that the cream has a very strong salon chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t burn or itch at all and actually smells good!  </li>
            <li> I have tried every hair removal product on the market for manscaping and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> and it was more effective than shaving.</li>
            <li> I love it, and will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> One tube has lasted me more than 5 uses.</li>
            <li> Using that principal I found that this product works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a benefit</li>
            <li> The smell actually isn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
            <li> but when I used it on my underarms and legs, it didn&#x27;t remove more than 1/4 to 1/2 of my hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Veet, though, was like magic.  </li>
            <li> However, the directions say to turn the top of the pump counter clockwise to release</li>
            <li> and I turned and turned and turned some more and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea you can just apply this product, and have hair free legs for up to a week and not have to bother with shaving every day!</li>
            <li> Apply more than you think you need.</li>
            <li> It did now, however, do a better job than shaving.</li>
            <li> my skin after looks shiney and healthy.</li>
            <li> The hair is not removed as closely as waxing would achieve but, in a matter of minutes, most of the hair  was gone.  </li>
            <li> Also, be sure not to exceed the time limit (I keep it on for a maximum of thirteen minutes) or else it will cause the skin to break.  </li>
            <li> It works more as a trimmer than a razor.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair remover for my legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly satisfied, and would recommend</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t get most of the hair.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using it too. :-)</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> and if you decided to be a daredevil like me and use it on your face make sure you DO NOT leave it on longer than 5 mins.</li>
            <li> the cream worked as it said and my wife is more than satisfied by the product</li>
            <li> Please for the love of all that is holy, heed my tale of woe.</li>
            <li> So much better than shaving and Nair.</li>
            <li> I love the results</li>
            <li> it was okay.  </li>
            <li> 2) Safe For All Colorfast Washables And Works In All Temperatures.</li>

            <li> 8)</li>
            <li> The stench would linger for days after using the product, no matter how many baths I took.</li>
            <li> This cream smells okay and does not leave an after smell</li>
            <li> It may decrease as I become more used to the cream, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I have to put it on a bit thicker than my instincts want me to. :)</li>
            <li> It is a much better alternative than shaving.</li>
            <li> like i&#x27;m sure most people have.</li>
            <li> I waited a couple more minutes before rinsing it off and wiping it off with a textured towel, in circular motions.</li>
            <li> my bikini area was mostly hair-free.</li>
            <li> Have been using veet for more than 7years</li>
            <li> ; so the sugar helped make that feel better.  </li>
            <li> So, if I have to use this stuff - and it&#x27;s better than shaving and cheaper than waxing</li>
            <li> What more could I ask?</li>
            <li> I have a fair amount of hair and this cuts right through</li>
            <li> Great stuff, did the job as promised and left skin smooth and silky; loved the product.  </li>
            <li> First, I loved the bottle with the pump.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it works fast, but I did not think it did an amazing job at removing some of the hair from the roots (as stated in the description).</li>
            <li> The hair removed easily and I used it on many places (legs, feet, hands, body) and it worked well throughout.</li>
            <li> Ok things I do like about this are that it&#x27;s in an easy to use bottle with spout.</li>
            <li> (for people that isn&#x27;t allergic to it), I don&#x27;t present any allergies or reaction to it so for me it works wonderful: hair free in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m sure it will work for others that have fine hair.</li>
            <li> but most importantly, (well for ME anyways...</li>
            <li> it allowed more free hands to spread on skin</li>
            <li> The good news is that most of the hair was gone on the first try and didn&#x27;t even leave it on the full 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and ive had to be really easy and use lots of shaveing cream when I shaved my legs.</li>
            <li> pump style container makes it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> Remove hair very quickly~</li>
            <li> - I like the easy application pump bottle and product</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend keeping it off of your testicles/labia</li>
            <li> Iv used plenty of veet products but this one the smell is so strong.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend wearing gloves when using this.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy this kind of hair remover.</li>
            <li> so I just washed it off in the shower with my hands and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like roses, but shower and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> it works fine</li>
            <li> so guys it works on thicker hair fine</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and was easy to remove</li>
            <li> My hair is medium to fine.</li>
            <li> My legs are super smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone about to attempt a huge shave after not &amp;#34;keeping up&amp;#34; with their hair, as it&#x27;s a lot easier and quicker than trimming + shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought, but it made a huge difference in the way the cream smelled and felt.</li>
            <li> I was shocked,and smooth.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend using this because it works so great</li>
            <li> Some portions of my legs were gloriously smooth....</li>
            <li> and now I have silky smooth skin.      </li>
            <li> I have been hair FREE for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I tested a few times and this is great!</li>
            <li> Spreads smooth.  </li>
            <li> so I give them a five star for my five star smooth legs and underarms</li>
            <li> I just jump in the shower right after and use an old washcloth and just wipe off the cream and all the hair comes with it and your legs are silky smooth and look AMAZING!</li>
            <li> others still had significant stubble.</li>
            <li> No more nicks when shaving is the best part of this product</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time yesterday; I read the instructions on the bottle, where it said it could be used safely on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> 1/3-2/3&#x27;s product would have been in accessible because of the defective pumps.  </li>
            <li> Then wash with cool water and you&#x27;ll be hair free.</li>
            <li> and I like the boys clean but</li>
            <li> Let hair grow out a bit if looking for super smooth areas.</li>
            <li> This one was even better because it was more effective in less time &#x3D; happier skin.</li>
            <li> I do feel thatit is unfortunate that I had a reaction, because I will say that my legs came out wonderfully, and it was very easy to achieve.  </li>
            <li> It did a very good job at removing unwanted hair from my body, and also left it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate really good just like any hair removal method to make sure you don&#x27;t get those bumps, plus when you scrub hard it gets all the hair off, even the ones you missed with the spatula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works fast &amp; is pretty effective.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, Veet is just as good as Nair, nothing different.</li>
            <li> Because i use nair before, I waited two week before Veeting my full legs.</li>
            <li> Slower hair growth, possibly, but my legs are only smooth for a day at best.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t terribly good about paying attention to the timer and left it on for 1-2 minutes longer in some spots.</li>
            <li> I will blame this on the skin being more sensitive in some areas, however I strongly recommend you test the product out before you use it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t irritate me at all, and the smell is significantly improved over the last time i tried this kind of product (8 years?)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product recently, and am very glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Not only did it NOT fail, it smelled good too.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that if you want fast, easy hair removal...give it a try.</li>
            <li> One nice thing it did was exfoliate beautifully - I was shocked and horrified by the number of ingrown hairs on my calves that it revealed after melting the top layers of my skin off.</li>
            <li> please try it first!</li>
            <li> for the first time i think that is great considering the other products i have used.</li>
            <li> Leave the cream on for 5 to 7 minutes if you have \\&quot;thicker hair\\&quot; and then wipe off (or use the cheap plastic thing that doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as fast or well like a face towel).</li>
            <li> I love having smooth arms, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> I got this one instead of the sensitive skin formula because this one got better reviews</li>
            <li> is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t decided if the expense is worth it--</li>
            <li> It was only smooth for 3-4 days, but that&#x27;s better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I think the sensitive one would work better for me....</li>
            <li> Its worth it.</li>
            <li> certainly worth a try but dont count on it before  abig event</li>
            <li> In 20 more years I&#x27;ll be too old to care about hair on my legs</li>
            <li> There is a smell after using it, but it&#x27;s far better than the smell of Nair anything.</li>
            <li> This cream works wonders, Now, I am completely hairless and so much more</li>
            <li> While Stain Is Still Fresh. 5)</li>
            <li> Most of the hair was gone, though I could feel soft, peachy hairs on my legs and</li>
            <li> Yes you read that right 5 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> It works like it says and the hair comes right off of my legs.</li>
            <li> In fact, the description on the page right now gives directions for getting stains out with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left it on for the full length of time, and was pleased to see the hair removed.</li>
            <li> but i did and o am i glad the smell isnt that bad no burning and the best part</li>
            <li> So I definitely recommend using a body scrub instead right after, and then you will be able to get all of the residue off.</li>
            <li> So I definitely recommend using a body scrub instead right after, and then you will be able to get all of the residue off.</li>
            <li> You run out of this stuff pretty quickly because you have to use so much of it.</li>
            <li> No mess, easy use.</li>
            <li> It works best if the hairs are not too long so, for those using it on the bikini area, trim a little if the hairs down there are at a length you are able to easily braid.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim from my grocery store for about 2 bucks MORE then it&#x27;s currently selling for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works at first, after just two weeks stopped working</li>
            <li> I use this to remove the hair on my arms, &amp; it really works!  </li>
            <li> Veet makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> So I tried it on my arms first</li>
            <li> All my friends told me that Veet is better than nair that it would last days longer.</li>
            <li> Make sure to leave it on only 5-6 minutes though</li>
            <li> I assumed this would be more of the same, but I have no issues.</li>
            <li> The Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream was the first hair removal cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> definitely works better than nair.</li>
            <li> I used it on my chest took it off after 6 minutes with the spatula at first</li>
            <li> I set a timer, slathered it on (legs first, then underarms), and waited.  </li>
            <li> This is causing some definite discomfort for today, as I won&#x27;t dare put on any deodorant, let alone wear a shirt that will touch the area, until it is better healed.</li>
            <li> The point of getting this stuff is to get rid of hair better than shaving and have it last for longer.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done first time.</li>
            <li> At first I was scared of using it for the first time I thought it will give me allergies</li>
            <li> I thought maybe 20+ years later, they might work better....</li>
            <li> Well they smell better, but still work about the same for me anyway....</li>
            <li> Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair!</li>
            <li> Simple Magical...</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say this cream is not intended for the face.</li>
            <li> I guess it was my first time with it</li>
            <li> the past, I have successfully used Sally Hansen Cream Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li> I first tried hair remover creams about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to give them another try and have been fairly pleased that I did.</li>
            <li> perfect for getting all the hair out it worked absolutely well although there were a few strands left,</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> (no matter what, I&#x27;ve tried many things) leaves my skin irritated and later I get tons of ingrown hairs, which is what I was trying to avoid!</li>
            <li> The first thing my husband asked when he got home was, &amp;#34;Did you use depilatory?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair!</li>
            <li> I winced as I wiped it clean and dabbed warm water on the area, the stinging almost unbearable to touch in these raw areas.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s more convenient to shave since you can do it in the shower although, this is really good for hard to shave hair like on your stomach, lower back, feet, ect.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised, doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious odor, and is gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does have a mild burn to it</li>
            <li> Worked the first time around and much better than I expected and in 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> it lasts longer then shaving and is easy to apply and get off and actually does when its supposed to.</li>
            <li> However, I would still recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have terribly sensitive skin and is looking for a quick hair removal option.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Then you take the little scraper tool they gave you, and kind of rub the product (and in theory, the hair) off of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe because I was scraping so hard trying to get the hair off, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good look.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I was scraping so hard trying to get the hair off, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good look.</li>
            <li> , it really just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> so I tried veet and it really does work.</li>
            <li> BOY HAS THIS STUFF REALLY CHANGED</li>
            <li> so much I wish I had a lifetime supply of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please give it a try, you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> and I forgot one important detail, after the regrowth the hair came back lighter and finer than ever before!</li>

            <li> and I forgot one important detail, after the regrowth the hair came back lighter and finer than ever before!</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> and this is the cheapest, hassle free, no waxing or getting cut open, way to do it.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this would work for me</li>
            <li> I remember using the pink bottle many years ago</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> It really works and i already found something to avoid the irritation on my legs..</li>
            <li> and you cannot beat the silkly smooth legs that you are left with.</li>
            <li> I love my pubic area completely devoid of hair.  </li>
            <li> but I never gave to do much work after I use it</li>
            <li> I have used this hair removal cream on my whole body and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Used on my legs after shaving with electric razor and couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair it still removed.</li>
            <li> so I have very course hair.</li>
            <li> but i guess roses really do smell like booboo so .......</li>
            <li> If you read the directions carefully it would work much better and lighter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely removes hair and keeps it off longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> The hear doesn&#x27;t grow as fast.</li>
            <li> Product was received on time and works very well.</li>
            <li> the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still keep buying this, but probably only for weekly use on my forearms, which I like smooth.</li>
            <li> No fumbling with the bottle or squeezing out too much at once, just one press of the pump</li>
            <li> All the hair disappeared and my skin was left smooth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> It was not fully effective in moving all of the hair and ended up being a waste of money.</li>
            <li> overall, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive and want to give this a try, it may or may not work ok for you.</li>
            <li> overall, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive and want to give this a try, it may or may not work ok for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I finally found a depilatory that I can use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is effective for removing hair in unwanted areas, but after the hair was removed, I noticed that some areas were left with irritation, a rash, or red bumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use if you need to get bits of hair out of the way, but nothing too thick.</li>
            <li> This works much better than other brands.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying some other product, but don&#x27;t buy Veet</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and only used a washcloth like some suggested after leaving it on actually about 10 minutes and the hair came off my legs, armpits and bikini area avoiding the sensitive private areas and my hair is actually fine not the prickly kind many have.</li>
            <li> , I will say that I also appeared to have an allergic reaction to the stuff; my legs, (which I will add, are smooth and lovely thanks to the product), did break out in hives a few different places.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Target and saw the Veet Supreme Essence Gel Cream Pump for 7.99 and saw the &#x27;moisturizing, new, silky smooth, essential oils&#x27; and etc and decided ah, what the hell</li>
            <li> When I read this had essential oils I wasn&#x27;t in party mode, nothing special</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly like most other peoples do after it&#x27;s been shaved or waxed or in this case epilated, so</li>
            <li> I will use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for the full 10 minutes and, while I didn&#x27;t break out in a rash like a lot of people on here seem to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to give it another try, but my first impression is that I had to follow up with a standard razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> I put on a good thin layer without rubbing it in much like you would do with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> works well especially for those who are not ready to shave their own legs yet</li>
            <li> particularly if you&#x27;re gonna use it for a bikini or a Brazilian...</li>
            <li> works fast and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> However, I have very sensitive skin that becomes irritated fast.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work out that great for me, but its possibly it is a users error (mine) or that someone with a different hair/skin type might have better luck with this</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It stank to high heaven, and it didn&#x27;t remove my hair adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping this would work a little bit better</li>
            <li> Underarms are a little bit more tricky because the hair is thicker, so have to put this Veet on twice on my underarms.</li>
            <li> It give me a lot of troubles and i ask for my doctor and eat a lot of anti-allergic drug and now after about 11 days, my face feel better, but still a lot of erythema exist, and sometimes feel a little itch on my face.</li>
            <li> It was so much easier to use than those gels and creams that come in tubes since it was a lot less messier and made for easy storage.</li>
            <li> and it was really soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving and was really scared of trying any products as I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The applicator works ok for for legs but used under the arm is just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> ; but I used it on my top lip for a few seconds - 20secs MAX - and had no irritations what so ever.</li>
            <li> Normally I would be holding my breath in the bathroom because the chemical odor is just unbearable</li>
            <li> Experienced a slight chemical burn with the 10 minutes session, and still had a little stubble just as if I had shaved.  </li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> It says no more than the maximum of 6 minutes... which should tell you how strong this thing is!</li>
            <li> It works VERY quickly, and there&#x27;s a definite difference between 6 minutes and 7 minutes - a mistake I made last night when I used it &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  I was on fire after rinsing it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Makes sense since fingernails are made out of similar stuff as hair, right?)</li>
            <li> I normally have very sensitive,  eczema prone skin</li>
            <li> i put it on when my skin when its super dry and leave it for about 4 mins and then shave it off.</li>
            <li> But then again, my hair grows back very fast...</li>
            <li> Most of the products I used in the past required a 10 minute wait.  </li>
            <li> It smelled faintly floral, which was washed away after I rinsed and left a nice light fragrant</li>
            <li> but, I have no redness or red bumps which is a first.</li>
            <li> The product does work a lot better than its past incarnations, but if you&#x27;re looking for keeping the hair away for awhile you may as well go get it waxed off.</li>
            <li> And when I tried to use this product on my already sensitive armpits, OMG!</li>
            <li> After the first time I had stuble the next day (just like I would have with a razor)</li>
            <li> This is going to last a longtime and I love how much easier it actually did seem compared to shaving after the time spent doing it</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, this product can make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> It was more mess and trouble than it was worth.</li>
            <li> It was more mess and trouble than it was worth.</li>
            <li> i cant even begin to tell you how much money ive wasted on trying to find a razor and cream that works and doesnt leave me with itchy red irritated legs and red bumbs that are less attractive than just not shaving at all.</li>
            <li> There is plenty of product left in this large jar, so I will try again when hair grows  a little longer- hopefully with better results next time!</li>
            <li> There is a little more stubble than I get with shaving, but overall it is quicker and easier to use the</li>
            <li> The one think you really need to make sure you do with these types of creams is definitely not use to little cream to where you are trying to stretch it to a larger area that it is somewhat causing you to rub it in.</li>
            <li> please do not apply it anywhere near your genitalia</li>
            <li> and WOW</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Veet Fast Acting Gel Cream Hair burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I will probably wait and see how far this bottle goes.</li>
            <li> I tested this and the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, I wold avoid this product altogether!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove all that much hair, in fact I had to go back over my legs with a razor after I used it for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> I understand that this could possibly attribute to what happened with my underarms and that it very well might not be the case for everyone.  </li>
            <li> But if you have even slightly sensitive skin...go for the sensitive Veet gel cream instead.</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave it a three was it is really conditioning.</li>
            <li> On the sensitive skin along the inside of the labia, smear with petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> but it worked really well actually.</li>
            <li> Spray Onto The Stain, Covering It Completely.</li>
            <li> Spray Onto The Stain, Covering It Completely.</li>
            <li> I had no irritation and it was fast acting.</li>
            <li> however I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sensitive version of this cream and used it on my legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have had friends get yeast infections because they applied it to areas too sensitive.</li>
            <li> My legs have never been so soft in my life.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I only have to leave it on for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about my hairy arms, so I decided to give it a shot one more time, a few years later, with this product.</li>
            <li> Once I learned to apply this product thickly, and for the maximum amount of time, this product would just work ok.</li>
            <li> Some other hair remove cream leaves me feeling itchy, but this one had no effects and left me with just smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I first bought this item from the local drug store, a smaller version.  </li>
            <li> I finally just took the top of and scooped the cream out with a small spoon.  </li>
            <li> Smell was probably better than the original version but still unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Apparently my skin was to sensitive.</li>
            <li> I normally use nair and have no problem with burning,but my hair grow back in  20 hours to 25 hours.</li>
            <li> That went back to normal after a week but caused some discomfort.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend keeping the area you use this on covered in lotion for the first few days after hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Much better now; in fact hardly noticed it!  </li>
            <li> it gets the job done (usually) shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li> overall this is a SUPERB product for those who hate shaving/tweezing and don&#x27;t want to wax.</li>
            <li> It left my legs hair free for a week and a half!</li>
            <li> Works fast and not irritating to my skin but do a test first to see if it&#x27;s irritating for yours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Veet hair remover for years - no other hair remover comes close to working as well.  </li>
            <li> I also remember getting a slight rash the first time i used it, but my skin seems to have toughened up over time with repeated use (and i have sensitive skin to begin with).</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with finer hair would have better luck, but for me it is not worth it to subject my skin to chemicals and still have stubble.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is also big enough to use all over your body and still have enough for a few more times.</li>
            <li> Not only does this get rid of hair, but apparently it makes your skin soft as hell!</li>
            <li> Consistency of gel and design of the bottle keeps everything generally neat during application.</li>
            <li> Works not good enough, you&#x27;re better off waxing or shaving or even epilating.</li>
            <li> I clearly didn&#x27;t investigate by reading reviews, so I guess it&#x27;s on me that I can&#x27;t get my money back.  </li>
            <li> I get much smoother legs with Nair, and even with shaving (though that doesn&#x27;t last as long.)</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work, I had it on for the maximum time and it barely took off the hair.</li>
            <li> So my basic principal for using this product is: leave it on for 10 minutes in not so sensitive areas (legs, underarms, etc.) and 5 minutes for sensitive areas (upper lip, chin, etc.)</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work at all and actually left a chemical burn on my skin near my underarm where it had transferred accidentally.  </li>
            <li> It definitely did not burn me the same way Nair did as long as I don&#x27;t take a shower first.</li>
            <li> My entire chest was left with stubble, which as most of you men out there know really sucks after about a day.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it for my 10 year old daughter that goes to gymnastics.</li>
            <li> Ive only tryed it on my legs so far  </li>
            <li> Barely works.</li>
            <li> Only place it worked was near belly button.</li>
            <li> so most methods of hair removal are not attractive options for me.  </li>
            <li> ok, to start it off fellas, this is soooo much easier that razors or clippers (less painful and no irritation) ive used it pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend using the product just for legs (at least at first!) and immediately ceasing use at any sign of pain, burning, or tingling!</li>
            <li> better smell than the other veet products i&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Waxing is a whole other thing.</li>
            <li> the pain I&#x27;ll have for the next few days weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I either didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough or my leg hairs were too long because it still left quite a bit of stubble.  </li>
            <li> I usually epilate my arms and legs (with an occasional shave if I need to do it quick).</li>
            <li> If you used enough cream, the hair should come off with barely any rubbing at all.</li>
            <li> However, the pump on each container is consistently defective and wastes the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant and it&#x27;s hard to stay groomed with a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this Veet Gel when I was pregnant and finding it hard to do all those contortionist acts just to shave my legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li> but, it isn&#x27;t bad and many said it does the first time</li>
            <li> I put a thick layer on my legs and left it on for the full six minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you get a good sized bottle and it goes a very long way since you only need literally one pump per leg, and one pump for both arms together, and it only needs a very very very thin layer, so this stuff lasts a long time, and I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you get a good sized bottle and it goes a very long way since you only need literally one pump per leg, and one pump for both arms together, and it only needs a very very very thin layer, so this stuff lasts a long time, and I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Works really well, sometimes there&#x27;s little hairs here</li>
            <li> No bumps, hair grows back soft not harsh and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle lasts a couple months if only used every few weeks!</li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair on my legs and using this works somewhat, but the hair comes right back within a few days, and I find that even if it&#x27;s about 5 minutes shorter to do it the Veet way, the cost doesn&#x27;t make it worth it.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell to it, but it&#x27;s not strong and it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li> I have noticed a very light stinging sensation when using it, but it is nowhere near as bad as the burning I remember from ten years ago!</li>
            <li> Used it in other areas first with little or no problems but the boys didn&#x27;t fare so well.</li>
            <li> client returned 2 weeks later and his skin was red, dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like It may shorten it but not near enough to make it unseen.</li>
            <li> As I said, I left the product on too long which irritated &amp;</li>
            <li> So anyways after I used the convenient little pink plastic razor-like thing to scrape off the stuff, I was amazed at the smooth, soft skin that was left behind.</li>
            <li> Even though some say it burns it didn&#x27;t burn my private parts ..but don&#x27;t leave for more than 5 minutes..and use cold water to remove the cream ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a high maintenance type of girl, so I usually only shave once or twice per week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other people will have the same results since everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other people will have the same results since everyone is different.</li>
            <li> And do not wait too long.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t use the scraper that comes with this because I don&#x27;t prefer it and feel it takes to long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get away from shaving for a long time since I always manage to cut myself.  </li>
            <li> but, I did reapply on my armpits and bikini area for minor touchup for a couple minutes</li>
            <li> It just does not completely work for me.</li>
            <li> Again,  the hair comes off, but not completely or at all in some areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth a try as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> this is just another one in a long line of failures.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this on my skin for long and it stung like hell.</li>
            <li> I was worried about leaving it on too long and jumped in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had fairly long hair before using this product.</li>
            <li> It removes most of the hair the razor usually leaves behind.</li>
            <li> results last for a while because if you use enough cream, the hair is removed under your skin and down to the root of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs would always be a little red/raw looking after using this hair remover, but that only last a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs would always be a little red/raw looking after using this hair remover, but that only last a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives you a timeframe of 3-5 mins but by minute 4 it&#x27;s starting to sting (again other veet products dnt).</li>
            <li> but when i used a towel to dry it off the rest came off too.</li>
            <li> Do Not Let Dry On Garments.</li>
            <li> I like Veet because unlike Nair, it leaves skin feeling smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave as harsh of a chemical smell behind.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a month and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back dark or with that stubble look.</li>
            <li> Almost blondish, and I&#x27;m a mixed race with naturally dark brown/black hair, so this is freakin&#x27; awesome.***ter</li>
            <li> Almost blondish, and I&#x27;m a mixed race with naturally dark brown/black hair, so this is freakin</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you know the importance of trying a small area-</li>
            <li> For no reason I could think of, it would leave random patches of hair still on my legs no matter what, while other areas of my leg were hair free.</li>
            <li> It is messy, smells strange and in my opinion, the effect does not last as long as it says it should.</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed</li>
            <li> I would try  a product like this again, but not necessarily this one.ould leave scratches down my legs that would take days to disappear.</li>
            <li> It did manage to get over half of the hairs out, so I can&#x27;t entirely say it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a burn, maybe a sting but skin gets back up nothing to worry about, its fancy but not super efficient.</li>
            <li> well left smooth points on my leg but didn&#x27;t get totally everything..quite disappointed in this product..</li>
            <li> But anyways Veet has come a very long way within the last few years</li>
            <li> But anyways Veet has come a very long way within the last few years</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 5-6 minutes and started to use the little plastic spatula to remove it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try anyways!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find time to use it and the hair grows back the next day just like shaving.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no irritation</li>
            <li> For roughly between 35-40 days with no sign of regrowth till about the 37th day.</li>
            <li> so going back to shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> grows back in few days ..just like shaving but without cuts....</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries of using this product to figure that out</li>
            <li> I promptly took a few benedryl to stop the reaction, but it was obvious it was to the cream.  </li>
            <li> ive never really found a product that does what it says...</li>
            <li> I used hair removal products years ago and never really had any luck with them...</li>
            <li> BUT, takes a while to put on and take off as expected.</li>
            <li> This product works but not very well on me anyways..</li>
            <li> i had absolutely no reaction</li>
            <li> I lightly wet both areas before applying the cream and waited six minutes before hopping into the shower.</li>
            <li> I used it to give myself a brazilian and have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Plus it left behind soft skin.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of the dark marks that were constantly being made by frequent tweezing.(I&#x27;m AA)</li>
            <li> After following all of the instruction, my hair didnt come out that easily, the smell was horrible, and just 3 days later, my hair grew back again (darker).</li>
            <li> Or risk looking like a raw naked now rat</li>
            <li> The next day my leg hair felt rougher then normal and the rash was worse, like I had slid across pavement on my legs!</li>
            <li> had major thick stubble, let it set on my leg for 8 minutes and used the scraper that comes with it...</li>
            <li> Left it on for even a bit longer than supposed to but still very little hair removed.</li>
            <li> and there is no real accuracy involved with applying and removing!</li>
            <li> and I had to apply it every other day</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all it didn&#x27;t stink like other depilatories do.</li>
            <li> test this on your skin and small bit on the skin of your private parts before you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Due to being on a blood thinner.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I use the Spatula that comes with this</li>
            <li> Some hair is removed but not smoothly or consistent throughout the area.</li>
            <li> To top it off, it didn&#x27;t even remove all the hair from the area &gt;:(.</li>
            <li> Decided to try the Veet as it wasn&#x27;t supposed to burn like Nair or other products (though I&#x27;ve heard it still burns for some people).</li>
            <li> I read other customer reviews and I followed up with epil stop after I used it.  </li>
            <li> (I tried a test spot on the pit of the other side of my elbow)</li>
            <li> Still would recommend it to anyone over the other products out their.</li>
            <li> says it does not change the other</li>
            <li> May Be Used With Other Laundry Additives.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t blast it all away, and you can&#x27;t get rid of all that slimy product if you don&#x27;t use SOMETHING other than water.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and smells like a wet dog!</li>
            <li> So I researched a lot about this product and read a lot of reviews in Amazon and other websites.</li>
            <li> In an effort to make it work, I vigorously rubbed the little spatula on my skin and only a few hairs came off.</li>
            <li> This stuff, though it doesn&#x27;t destroy the entire hair or slow down hair growth rate, it does reduce the amount of hair, makes it much lighter and less &#x27;hard&#x27;.</li>
            <li> But  since I have incredibly sensitive skin, that it did not result in a horrific rash or bumpy red angry skin is certainly a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> and also I&#x27;ve had many bad reactions to Veet in the past as well.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time it takes.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t do what I have done a couple of times and leave it on for even a minute too long, or you&#x27;ll be in trouble!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time, money or effort.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> but I also have thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> okay, i hate hair.</li>
            <li> However, my skin was not  smooth as expected.</li>
            <li> gently used the scraper (and I mean gently) in a small area, and was alarmed to find that blood was coming off with the small bit of cream I was attempting to remove.  </li>
            <li> It would leave scratches down my legs that would take days to disappear.</li>
            <li> my 1 down side is when you take the product off you feel like you have a waxy cover on your skin, but you just have to use a luffa.</li>
            <li> using a razor down there makes me nervous.  </li>
            <li> i got the method down.  </li>
            <li> how strong the chemical smell is to :(</li>
            <li> The applicator was just a hassle to use, getting the product everywhere in my bathroom, and I wound up giving up on using it about half way through the process.</li>
            <li> I have used Nair products on my legs before and it literally did nothing but make my bathroom and myself smell like the typical \\&quot;Nair-smell\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When the time came to start removing it, I started on my legs, but noticed a slight tingling from my underarms, perhaps from the motions.  </li>
            <li> but I had a slight stinging on my legs during the process.</li>
            <li> I have slightly thicker-than-average hair</li>
            <li> my a$$. its less rotten eggs tho.</li>
            <li> But overall I give this product a 5/5 star review because I have extremely retarded skin which can&#x27;t handle really anything other than shaving cream and a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall I give this product a 5/5 star review because I have extremely retarded skin which can&#x27;t handle really anything other than shaving cream and a razor.     </li>
            <li> I tried Veet because it seemed a little less harsh.</li>
            <li> Next morning I discovered that my left nipple was burned so bad that the nip itself was gone and just had raw flesh/scab left.</li>
            <li> I used a loofa sponge to remove the hair instead of the little spatula they give you.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair grow out a little on my legs..</li>
            <li> I something I care about so little.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I applied it, waited a few minutes, and</li>
            <li> So i am feel so sad that this product did not remind customers on its marked place that using it on face is prohibited.</li>
            <li> so I wasted money</li>
            <li> I really disliked this product.</li>
            <li> but it worked and in a few ways it felt like razor shave.</li>
            <li> Just apply it, wait a few minutes, use the applicator to remove the cream.</li>
            <li> Of course it took me a few tryes b4</li>
            <li> Not suitable for anything other then legs and arm pits.</li>
            <li> But I am really annoyed that I have to go back with a razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> I have average thick black hair and it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> The hair that did come off would usually stay off maybe 4 days (not a full week).</li>
            <li> The hair that did come off would usually stay off maybe 4 days (not a full week).</li>
            <li> Now under each arm, I have a streak going right across the middle of raw, very painful burns/wounds.  </li>
            <li> It stunk to high heaven and in burned the ish outta my skin like crazy.</li>
            <li> I had these weird patches where it had removed the hair (which immediately turned to stubble 24 hours later) and then clusters where it hadn&#x27;t worked at all, probably an uneven application (which I blame on that little plastic applicator/remover thing).</li>
            <li> Being a man, I have dark thick hair</li>
            <li> Smells weird and has to be left a little longer than instructed.</li>
            <li> So sad such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I figured I didn&#x27;t need to check how it was doing because it says you can only leave on a maximum of 6 minutes away, but maybe that is where I failed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nair in the past and it did nothing more than irritate my skin and had a absolutely horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> and I was in a small bathroom</li>
            <li> Ok, I was hesitant since years ago this stuff smelled horrible.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s better than a horrible chemical smell, which is NOT what you will get with this product!</li>
            <li> I do have to leave it on past the recommended time though (about 8 - 10 mins).</li>
            <li> As an aesthetician I usually wax clients.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s left feels weird.</li>
            <li> This proved to be a very messy</li>
            <li> I had no irritation and very, very few ingrown hairs after.  </li>
            <li> One thing I like about it is that I can get all the hairs on my legs easily (especially around the knees) without cutting myself or missing spots.  </li>
            <li> Then after you done removing all hair on your body ..have a shower with cold water and use a shower pouf to remove the left over hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I fully expected it to fail like all the others.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Immediately upon applying the gel, he complained it was burning his skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I recommend this hair remover product over all others - the depilatories at least.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called SLOW GROW by GiGi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called SLOW GROW by GiGi</li>
            <li> I put on a thick layer and at 4 minutes, no hair is removed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, you apply the cream to wherever you are removing hair THICKLY.</li>
            <li> Some of these products work, but this one does not (at least with thick hair).</li>
            <li> Removes stubborn hair, and thick body hair with ease.</li>
            <li> and I mean all over.  </li>
            <li> I mean ALL locations.</li>
            <li> *NOT* grow back thick and ugly if trimmed with an electric nose hair trimmer thing).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like seriously that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Like seriously that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> and made them ridiculously silky feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this halfheartedly, remembering my bad experience the last time I used a depilatory cream.</li>
            <li> Not only that, the cream smells bad.</li>
            <li> my client returned after the bad Veet experience, I took my remaining Sally Hansen containers, laid them on waxing paper on the floor and smashed them open with a waxing can to break the pump and get to the product.  </li>
            <li> Not a good feeling.  </li>
            <li> Also smells absolutely horrible but at the end of the day, the convinience is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only hairs that were removed by Nair were the nose hairs I lost due to the HORRIBLE smell.  </li>
            <li> First off, I just got over a nasty infection from an ingrown hair on my stomach from shaving, so</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty awful as well.</li>
            <li> Needless to say we were not able to remove any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ladies, get rid of that thick arm hair!</li>
            <li> but it was irritating my skin</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This was extremely frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I am not allowed to shave because I get a cellutis infection, but I get tired of having hairy legs.  </li>
            <li> Background: I am tan with a lot of thin brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair removal creams before and had bad results.</li>
            <li> scent isn&#x27;t bad, but it is a bit odd smelling.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, but I have absolutely no complaints for this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, however, the scraper irritated my skin, so I used a scrubbie washcloth to remove it.  </li>
            <li> Ya&#x27;know the smell, the chemical, suffocating smell...</li>
            <li> A HAIRLESS, CARELESS SUMMER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they were wrong.</li>
            <li> It does smell faintly of chemicals but it is not unbearable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I get razor bumps and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I have used bleach on the hair before, and it burned my skin and was extremely uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Useless and stinky, won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s honestly irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, once each container is opened, the remover is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would give this product 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t have such an awful odor.  </li>
            <li> and it burned and just left my skin awful</li>
            <li> It took off 75% of the hair leaving me with a bunch of random patches of hair that wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> Not because I expected a hair remover NOT to have an awful odor, but because Veet claims this product has a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought Veet because I was tired of needing to shave my legs and sick of buying overpriced razors...</li>
            <li> my legs are healed but I afraid  </li>
            <li> If you can use cold water to remove the cream..</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> A HAIRLESS, CARELESS SUMMER!      </li>
            <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> Smell is bad on this though.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, or smell bad.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it was just bad.</li>
            <li> As it works well on the arm, so I tried it on my face, then terrible thing happened, my face swell, feel sore, burning, and the superficial skin was broken and some ooze appear from my face.</li>
            <li> the smell isnt awful, but not great.</li>
            <li> But thought I would share my client&#x27;s painful</li>
            <li> And I got sick from the smell.</li>
            <li> My Vascular Surgeon told me I cannot shave anymore :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results,  I will no longer use this and cough up the money for waxing or put up with the smell of nair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid, this stuff is not going to burn your skin off!</li>
            <li> And I know this sounds weird, but then I used an alcohol-free rosemary and sage conditioner to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my skin to get rid of the product residue - and to get rid of that awful hair remover odor.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid, this stuff is not going to burn your skin off!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, I always managed to cut myself.  </li>
            <li> but I hate the smell</li>
            <li> I really hate wasting time and money</li>
            <li> Nair smells horribly, but I was in the bathroom, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nair for a bit of time, and hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that awful \\&quot;permed hair\\&quot; smell that lots of hair removal products seem to have.  </li>
            <li> Hate this!</li>
            <li> It was a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I get horrible rashes from waxing and shaving.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells disgusting, and feels slimy when it rinses off.</li>
            <li> I rather just shave worst part</li>
            <li> My experiences were horrible: the creams burned and they smelled disgusting.</li>
            <li> and the gunk is horrible</li>

    <ol>
            <li> yes it does remove course pubic hair. please do not apply it anywhere near your genitalia you will have  chemical burnS... And do not wait too long.YoYou will get chemical burns. Just leave it on for four to seven minutes and bam no hair</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work, I had it on for the maximum time and it barely took off the hair.</li>
            <li> I got this product a yesterday and I&#x27;m amazed at how well this worked. I&#x27;m currently pregnant and it&#x27;s hard to stay groomed with a razor. Not with this! I love it, and will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> I bought Veet because I was tired of needing to shave my legs and sick of buying overpriced razors... I left it on for the full 10 minutes and, while I didn&#x27;t break out in a rash like a lot of people on here seem to, it really just didn&#x27;t work. I had these weird patches where it had removed the hair (which immediately turned to stubble 24 hours later) and then clusters where it hadn&#x27;t worked at all, probably an uneven application (which I blame on that little plastic applicator/remover thing). The applicator was just a hassle to use, getting the product everywhere in my bathroom, and I wound up giving up on using it about half way through the process. In the end I wound up throwing out about 3/4 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Shaving hurts so I tried veet and it really does work. I was shocked,and smooth. Try it out and see the results</li>
            <li> I have a good amount of hair on my arms and I used to get my arms waxed about every 2-3 months. Problem: it costs about $20 each time, you can only go to places that you trust, and I&#x27;m a college student. I have used Nair products on my legs before and it literally did nothing but make my bathroom and myself smell like the typical \\&quot;Nair-smell\\&quot;. I tried this in hope that I could stop waxing and I am so glad I did! I won&#x27;t go back to waxing again. This product works wonders! I use it about once a month and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back dark or with that stubble look. One tube has lasted me more than 5 uses. Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> I have used both Veet and Nair with no side effects like burning or anything. The one think you really need to make sure you do with these types of creams is definitely not use to little cream to where you are trying to stretch it to a larger area that it is somewhat causing you to rub it in. 4-6 pumps is a correct amount for one leg. You always need enough cream on your leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t use the scraper that comes with this because I don&#x27;t prefer it and feel it takes to long. I just jump in the shower right after and use an old washcloth and just wipe off the cream and all the hair comes with it and your legs are silky smooth and look AMAZING! If you used enough cream, the hair should come off with barely any rubbing at all. maybe a couple swipes with the washcloth to get all the cream off and it should be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results last for a while because if you use enough cream, the hair is removed under your skin and down to the root of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend using this because it works so great and there is no real accuracy involved with applying and removing!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim from my grocery store for about 2 bucks MORE then it&#x27;s currently selling for on Amazon. I applied it, checked the time and after 6 minutes started scraping away. I figured I didn&#x27;t need to check how it was doing because it says you can only leave on a maximum of 6 minutes away, but maybe that is where I failed. Some portions of my legs were gloriously smooth....others still had significant stubble. One nice thing it did was exfoliate beautifully - I was shocked and horrified by the number of ingrown hairs on my calves that it revealed after melting the top layers of my skin off. Didn&#x27;t irritate me at all, and the smell is significantly improved over the last time i tried this kind of product (8 years?) I&#x27;m willing to give it another try, but my first impression is that I had to follow up with a standard razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> Really only worked for 3-4 days. Not worth the time it takes.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, I always managed to cut myself.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to get away from shaving for a long time since I always manage to cut myself.  I&#x27;ve used Nair in the past and it did nothing more than irritate my skin and had a absolutely horrible smell.  I keep hearing about Veet, so I bought some in Target.        I tested a patch on my leg, and was thrilled when it worked!  The directions say to use it for 3 minutes, not to exceed 6. I needed 5.  Unfortunately, however, the scraper irritated my skin, so I used a scrubbie washcloth to remove it.  It worked so well I used it on both legs and now I have silky smooth skin.      I&#x27;ll never have to shave my legs again!    I haven&#x27;t tried it on my underarms yet, I&#x27;m thinking I need to get the stuff especially made for that area.  Maybe I can get rid of my razor entirely!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find time to use it and the hair grows back the next day just like shaving. Honestly, it&#x27;s more convenient to shave since you can do it in the shower although, this is really good for hard to shave hair like on your stomach, lower back, feet, ect. If you happen to be a hairy girl.</li>
            <li> So my basic principal for using this product is: leave it on for 10 minutes in not so sensitive areas (legs, underarms, etc.) and 5 minutes for sensitive areas (upper lip, chin, etc.) Using that principal I found that this product works fantastic! Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Works at first, after just two weeks stopped working and I had to apply it every other day</li>
            <li> Ladies, get rid of that thick arm hair! I use this to remove the hair on my arms, &amp; it really works!  It doesn&#x27;t have that awful \\&quot;permed hair\\&quot; smell that lots of hair removal products seem to have.  I love the fact that I only have to leave it on for a few minutes.  Most of the products I used in the past required a 10 minute wait.  I love having smooth arms, especially in the summer.  Veet makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> I first bought this item from the local drug store, a smaller version.  It worked on me well so I decided to buy the bigger version.</li>
            <li> Hate this! Used it and kept checking to see if hair was gone and it wasnt, so I had it on for the maximum 10 minutes. After getting it all off my legs burned, and NO hair was removed! It also left a rash all over my legs that looked like it was eating away at my skin! The next day my leg hair felt rougher then normal and the rash was worse, like I had slid across pavement on my legs! Its been 3 days now and the rash is still there and ive had to be really easy and use lots of shaveing cream when I shaved my legs. I would not recommend this product for anyone!</li>
            <li> I have always had reactions to depilatories like Nair, GiGi, etc. and also I&#x27;ve had many bad reactions to Veet in the past as well. But then again this was like 7 years ago when I was 13. Times have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last 7 years I have resorted to shaving my legs, and trimming my arm hair with an electric razor. (Hair DOES *NOT* grow back thick and ugly if trimmed with an electric nose hair trimmer thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Target and saw the Veet Supreme Essence Gel Cream Pump for 7.99 and saw the &#x27;moisturizing, new, silky smooth, essential oils&#x27; and etc and decided ah, what the hell, I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I&#x27;ve only got 8 bucks to lose. So I tried it on my arms first and WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!! BOY HAS THIS STUFF REALLY CHANGED OR WHAT?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all it didn&#x27;t stink like other depilatories do. Ya&#x27;know the smell, the chemical, suffocating smell... This didn&#x27;t have that at all. It smelled faintly floral, which was washed away after I rinsed and left a nice light fragrant aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this was the timing. Before switching to this I used GiGi&#x27;s hair removal cream from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and that stuff had to stay on my skin for a minimum of 8 minutes. It stunk to high heaven and in burned the ish outta my skin like crazy. I looked like I had some sort of Rubella disease or something. It was a horrible experience. Anyways, back to Veet, I only had to leave this thing on for 3 minutes. It says no more than the maximum of 6 minutes... which should tell you how strong this thing is! So anyways after I used the convenient little pink plastic razor-like thing to scrape off the stuff, I was amazed at the smooth, soft skin that was left behind. I had absolutely no irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but most importantly, (well for ME anyways...) I have been hair FREE for 5 weeks. Yes you read that right 5 WEEKS. For roughly between 35-40 days with no sign of regrowth till about the 37th day. My hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly like most other peoples do after it&#x27;s been shaved or waxed or in this case epilated, so I don&#x27;t know if other people will have the same results since everyone is different. I&#x27;m happy it works for me though. BUT I know something from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply that DOES work painlessly to prevent hair regrowth. It&#x27;s called SLOW GROW by GiGi and after you epilate in your own system of choice i.e. shaving, plucking, waxing, etc, just rub that cream on and it doubles your time of being hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle. Like seriously that&#x27;s it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you get a good sized bottle and it goes a very long way since you only need literally one pump per leg, and one pump for both arms together, and it only needs a very very very thin layer, so this stuff lasts a long time, and I love this stuff so much I wish I had a lifetime supply of it. But anyways Veet has come a very long way within the last few years and I hope they continue to improve. But overall I give this product a 5/5 star review because I have extremely retarded skin which can&#x27;t handle really anything other than shaving cream and a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give it a try, you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose. Except 8 bucks. But it&#x27;s totally worth it I promise!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU VEET FOR GIVING ME A HAIRLESS, CARELESS SUMMER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***OH and I forgot one important detail, after the regrowth the hair came back lighter and finer than ever before! Almost blondish, and I&#x27;m a mixed race with naturally dark brown/black hair, so this is freakin&#x27; awesome.***ter it&#x27;s been shaved or waxed or in this case epilated, so I don&#x27;t know if other people will have the same results since everyone is different.

            <li> I will not use again. I used it and it gave me a burn. Apparently my skin was to sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for probably over 10 years for pubic hair removal.  It works very well.  I strongly recommend keeping it off of your testicles/labia but for the surrounding area it is fine--just follow the standard directions.  I highly recommend keeping the area you use this on covered in lotion for the first few days after hair removal.  I also remember getting a slight rash the first time i used it, but my skin seems to have toughened up over time with repeated use (and i have sensitive skin to begin with).</li>
            <li> I just love this product!</li>
            <li> I like Veet because unlike Nair, it leaves skin feeling smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave as harsh of a chemical smell behind. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> ok, to start it off fellas, this is soooo much easier that razors or clippers (less painful and no irritation) ive used it pretty much everywhere (chest, shoulders, lower back and even with manscapeing.) yes i know you probably shouldn&#x27;t do it, but my girlfriend loves it. Its not \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; to keep yourself well maintained. and this is the cheapest, hassle free, no waxing or getting cut open, way to do it. time to man up guys.</li>
            <li> Its VEET .. ..it gets the job done (usually) shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li> Wow. I really didn&#x27;t think this would work for me but it did. I left it on for about 5-6 minutes and started to use the little plastic spatula to remove it but it was irritating my skin so I just washed it off in the shower with my hands and it worked just fine. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t smell good. Just smells how chemicals should smell hah. I&#x27;m really glad I got this one instead of the sensitive skin formula because this one got better reviews and it definitely lived up to them. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my friend. She told me: &amp;#34; Why does the producer has a wonderful product like this&amp;#34;. At that time I knew that she was very satisfied with this item :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product. It removed hair and the pump made it easier to disperse as you were using it and distributing out a specific amount. it allowed more free hands to spread on skin and it was really soft and gentle on the skin. The hair removed easily and I used it on many places (legs, feet, hands, body) and it worked well throughout.</li>
            <li> Great experience! I received the product on time and had no issues with the seller or Amazon. In my opinion, Veet is just as good as Nair, nothing different. Leave the cream on for 5 to 7 minutes if you have \\&quot;thicker hair\\&quot; and then wipe off (or use the cheap plastic thing that doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as fast or well like a face towel). It does not smell like roses, but shower and you&#x27;ll be fine. The product is good and is better than shaving!</li>
            <li> Veet Fast Acting Gel Cream Hair burn my skin. All my friends told me that Veet is better than nair that it would last days longer. they were wrong.The parts of my legs and thigh that were not burn had hair the next day. I normally use nair and have no problem with burning,but my hair grow back in  20 hours to 25 hours. Because i use nair before, I waited two week before Veeting my full legs. I left the product on for 3 min and it still burn.  What i learn from this that i shouldn&#x27;t listen to my friends about hair remover creams and when you find a product that work for you to keep using that product. my legs are healed but I afraid  that now that any hair remover cream will burn me. so going back to shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> After following all of the instruction, my hair didnt come out that easily, the smell was horrible, and just 3 days later, my hair grew back again (darker).</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product. It did a very good job at removing unwanted hair from my body, and also left it feeling smooth and soft. Some other hair remove cream leaves me feeling itchy, but this one had no effects and left me with just smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I remember using the pink bottle many years ago and I don&#x27;t think I like it but, this came march 17th and I just used it today so it&#x27;s been a few weeks but, I love it! I read other reviews and only used a washcloth like some suggested after leaving it on actually about 10 minutes and the hair came off my legs, armpits and bikini area avoiding the sensitive private areas and my hair is actually fine not the prickly kind many have. I did go without shaving anywhere for a week or so and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a benefit but, I did reapply on my armpits and bikini area for minor touchup for a couple minutes and it&#x27;s awesome. The smell actually isn&#x27;t overwhelming and I was in a small bathroom but, the door was open. I put on a good thin layer without rubbing it in much like you would do with shaving cream. This is going to last a longtime and I love how much easier it actually did seem compared to shaving after the time spent doing it is so worth it. I have sensitive skin and it does have a mild burn to it but, it isn&#x27;t bad and many said it does the first time but, I have no redness or red bumps which is a first.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; the price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> Ok, I was hesitant since years ago this stuff smelled horrible.  Much better now; in fact hardly noticed it!  I left the product on my legs for 4 minutes and used the spatuala to remove.  I followed up with Epil Stop which worked great and no irritation.</li>
            <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t bad at all and there was no burning or tingeling but when I used it on my underarms and legs, it didn&#x27;t remove more than 1/4 to 1/2 of my hair, I still had to shave, kind of disappointed but I also have thick coarse hair so I was hoping this would work a little bit better and I wanted to try this before waxing but it appears that is the route I will be going! Your not supposed to leave it on for more than 10 minutes but even leaving it on for the max ammount of time, it just didn&#x27;t work for me! But i&#x27;m sure it will work for others that have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work whatsoever!</li>
            <li> It burned my nipples and it still hurts after  2 days! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it works fine every where else,I used this to remove hair on my private parts! Even though some say it burns it didn&#x27;t burn my private parts ..but don&#x27;t leave for more than 5 minutes..and use cold water to remove the cream .. test this on your skin and small bit on the skin of your private parts before you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair grows back in few days ..just like shaving but without cuts....try not to use the scraper if you can ..it kind of scratches the skin..If you can use cold water to remove the cream..it kind kind of soothes. Then after you done removing all hair on your body ..have a shower with cold water and use a shower pouf to remove the left over hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just don&#x27;t keep it on skin for than 5-6 minutes or it will burn..trust me it hurts!</li>
            <li> works fast and makes your skin very soft. totally recommending it. i got no skin allergies or itching afterwords. the bottle is big too.</li>
            <li> I tried this twice on my legs and nothing happened. I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and only scarce amount of hair appeared. I am not happy with the product. It went in the trash that night.</li>
            <li> I have tried every hair removal product on the market for manscaping and this is by far the best. Make sure to leave it on only 5-6 minutes though or you will get a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that using this product would leave my legs smoother longer, but no luck.  Slower hair growth, possibly, but my legs are only smooth for a day at best.  The first time I used it I either didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough or my leg hairs were too long because it still left quite a bit of stubble.  By the third time, I had figured it out and all the hair was gone.  I used a loofa sponge to remove the hair instead of the little spatula they give you.  One thing I like about it is that I can get all the hairs on my legs easily (especially around the knees) without cutting myself or missing spots.  I tried it once on my underarms but it didn&#x27;t work at all and actually left a chemical burn on my skin near my underarm where it had transferred accidentally.  I will be using this product for my legs only from now on.  I&#x27;m not a high maintenance type of girl, so I usually only shave once or twice per week and I have been using this product with about the same frequency.  I haven&#x27;t decided if the expense is worth it-- I will probably wait and see how far this bottle goes.</li>
            <li> I tested a few times and this is great! I get horrible rashes from waxing and shaving. I assumed this would be more of the same, but I have no issues. I tested this and the sensitive formula. This one was even better because it was more effective in less time &#x3D; happier skin. It was only smooth for 3-4 days, but that&#x27;s better than shaving. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells disgusting, and feels slimy when it rinses off. It was not fully effective in moving all of the hair and ended up being a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have tried other hair removal creams before and had bad results. ( burning and rashes ) My Vascular Surgeon told me I cannot shave anymore :( Due to being on a blood thinner. So I had to find a way to remove hair Stat Lol. My sister had used this and had great results, so I took the plunge. It left my legs hair free for a week and a half! Plus it left behind soft skin. It does smell faintly of chemicals but it is not unbearable.</li>
            <li> works well especially for those who are not ready to shave their own legs yet</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works like it says and the hair comes right off of my legs. Underarms are a little bit more tricky because the hair is thicker, so have to put this Veet on twice on my underarms. Other than that, I use the Spatula that comes with this and it works amazingly well. No razor needed!!! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone including men. Smell is bad on this though. But it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I applied it, waited a few minutes, and bam! Not only does this get rid of hair, but apparently it makes your skin soft as hell! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone about to attempt a huge shave after not &amp;#34;keeping up&amp;#34; with their hair, as it&#x27;s a lot easier and quicker than trimming + shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t bad, but it is a bit odd smelling. I suppose that&#x27;s better than a horrible chemical smell, which is NOT what you will get with this product!</li>
            <li> It did manage to get over half of the hairs out, so I can&#x27;t entirely say it doesn&#x27;t work. It just does not completely work for me. But  since I have incredibly sensitive skin, that it did not result in a horrific rash or bumpy red angry skin is certainly a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> The product does work a lot better than its past incarnations, but if you&#x27;re looking for keeping the hair away for awhile you may as well go get it waxed off. It&#x27;s good to use if you need to get bits of hair out of the way, but nothing too thick.</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.  That being said, the following review is TOTALLY true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the hair on my legs is made out of, honestly!  Leg hair just sat there smirking at Sally Hansen, then waved good-bye.  The only hairs that were removed by Nair were the nose hairs I lost due to the HORRIBLE smell.  Veet, though, was like magic.  I fully expected it to fail like all the others.  Not only did it NOT fail, it smelled good too.  I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> Perhaps my hair is too stubborn as this product only worked partially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve used Nair without issue besides the smell.  I tried Veet because it seemed a little less harsh. I tried it on under arms and legs as well as bikini area.  I put on a thick layer and at 4 minutes, no hair is removed. I tried  another time (a month or so later) and waited 10 minutes. Some hair is removed but not smoothly or consistent throughout the area. I&#x27;ve tried a 3rd time,  again after a month or so and waited 15 min. This time I felt tingling, went into the shower and removed the cream with the paddle and a washcloth.  Again,  the hair comes off, but not completely or at all in some areas.  My legs had a patch of hair that I know was covered. Underarms were the same thing.  The areas where the hair was removed still felt like stubble. Disappointed with the results,  I will no longer use this and cough up the money for waxing or put up with the smell of nair.</li>
            <li> Strong!!!!!  Boy.. . .. . Use vaseline in the folds ....particularly if you&#x27;re gonna use it for a bikini or a Brazilian... ... Or risk looking like a raw naked now rat</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you know the importance of trying a small area- please try it first! These things are not for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no reaction and great hair removal success!</li>
            <li> It really works and i already found something to avoid the irritation on my legs..</li>
            <li> Great stuff, did the job as promised and left skin smooth and silky; loved the product.  However, the directions say to turn the top of the pump counter clockwise to release and I turned and turned and turned some more and nothing happened.  Tried turning it clockwise but no dice.  Tried turning it again counter clockwise...nothing.  This was extremely frustrating.  I finally just took the top of and scooped the cream out with a small spoon.  This proved to be a very messy but I got the job done.  The manufacturer needs to do something about the faulty top!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy this kind of hair remover. On the arm and leg it works well, yet,it does not give me an obvious caution notice on the direction which remind us that this hair remover is prohibited using on face. As it works well on the arm, so I tried it on my face, then terrible thing happened, my face swell, feel sore, burning, and the superficial skin was broken and some ooze appear from my face. It give me a lot of troubles and i ask for my doctor and eat a lot of anti-allergic drug and now after about 11 days, my face feel better, but still a lot of erythema exist, and sometimes feel a little itch on my face. I doubt my face could not recover as before. So i am feel so sad that this product did not remind customers on its marked place that using it on face is prohibited.</li>
            <li> The Veet Gel Hair Remover Cream was the first hair removal cream I have tried. I love the idea you can just apply this product, and have hair free legs for up to a week and not have to bother with shaving every day! Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work out that great for me, but its possibly it is a users error (mine) or that someone with a different hair/skin type might have better luck with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, you apply the cream to wherever you are removing hair THICKLY. You literally want to see this product on your skin, you don&#x27;t want to rub it in. It took a couple of tries of using this product to figure that out (they don&#x27;t give you the best directions on the bottle). Apply more than you think you need. Then leave it on for the time they say. I always left it on for the maximum amount of time. If I left it on for the minimum amount, nothing would happen at all. Then you take the little scraper tool they gave you, and kind of rub the product (and in theory, the hair) off of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this product can make a huge mess. I recommend applying it in the shower. Wash your hand immediately after application. Also, when you are scraping the product off, it will probably clog your drain. So maybe have a few paper towels ready so that you can just wipe the product on those, and throw them away. This will help to avoid some of the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how this product works, not so well for me. Once I learned to apply this product thickly, and for the maximum amount of time, this product would just work ok. I could get some of the hair off on some of my legs. For no reason I could think of, it would leave random patches of hair still on my legs no matter what, while other areas of my leg were hair free. And when I tried to use this product on my already sensitive armpits, OMG! I had a rash for over a week!!! So if you have sensitive skin, I wold avoid this product altogether!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I just want to mention that scraper. It would leave scratches down my legs that would take days to disappear. Maybe because I was scraping so hard trying to get the hair off, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good look. Also, the product leaves your skin kind of sticky for a while, even after you wash with a body wash after. So I definitely recommend using a body scrub instead right after, and then you will be able to get all of the residue off. My legs would always be a little red/raw looking after using this hair remover, but that only last a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive and want to give this a try, it may or may not work ok for you. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend it from my experience. It was more mess and trouble than it was worth. It took only some of the hair off my legs, leaving the rest (along with scratches) on my legs. The hair that did come off would usually stay off maybe 4 days (not a full week). I would try  a product like this again, but not necessarily this one.ould leave scratches down my legs that would take days to disappear.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nair for a bit of time, and hated it. This stuff, though it doesn&#x27;t destroy the entire hair or slow down hair growth rate, it does reduce the amount of hair, makes it much lighter and less &#x27;hard&#x27;. It&#x27;s also very simple to apply with the pump. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Marvelous product! (for people that isn&#x27;t allergic to it), I don&#x27;t present any allergies or reaction to it so for me it works wonderful: hair free in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> definitely works better than nair. I used it on my chest took it off after 6 minutes with the spatula at first i didnt think it was all gone but when i used a towel to dry it off the rest came off too. so guys it works on thicker hair fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. It definitely did not burn me the same way Nair did as long as I don&#x27;t take a shower first. It was easier to get rid of hair on legs and underarms than the traditional razor. Didn&#x27;t work so well on my bikini line though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, smells nice and no chemical burns. I&#x27;m really glad I finally found a depilatory that I can use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely smells like rotten eggs. Didn&#x27;t remove all that much hair, in fact I had to go back over my legs with a razor after I used it for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> It says let on 6 mins do not exceed ten well I tried 6/10 n than some this product does not work I dont know whats up with these it works reviews but it does not I rather just shave worst part is u can not return this product so I wasted money</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this! Works great, doesn&#x27;t burn or itch at all and actually smells good!  I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.&lt;br /&gt;but don&#x27;t let that cloud your judgement of this product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Veet for years now, way before I even owned a computer and have loved it. No more nicks when shaving is the best part of this product and you cannot beat the silkly smooth legs that you are left with.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time yesterday; I read the instructions on the bottle, where it said it could be used safely on legs and underarms.  I set a timer, slathered it on (legs first, then underarms), and waited.  When the time came to start removing it, I started on my legs, but noticed a slight tingling from my underarms, perhaps from the motions.  Recalling what the bottle said, I immediately went to my underarms to check/remove the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gently used the scraper (and I mean gently) in a small area, and was alarmed to find that blood was coming off with the small bit of cream I was attempting to remove.  I dropped the plastic remover and elected for a washcloth instead, hoping that would be softer.  It did remove the cream, but the damage to my skin couldn&#x27;t be helped, despite the cream only sitting on it for maybe 4 minutes.  I winced as I wiped it clean and dabbed warm water on the area, the stinging almost unbearable to touch in these raw areas. Now under each arm, I have a streak going right across the middle of raw, very painful burns/wounds.  To top it off, it didn&#x27;t even remove all the hair from the area &gt;:(. This is causing some definite discomfort for today, as I won&#x27;t dare put on any deodorant, let alone wear a shirt that will touch the area, until it is better healed. BEWARE OF USING THIS ON YOUR UNDERARMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will say that I also appeared to have an allergic reaction to the stuff; my legs, (which I will add, are smooth and lovely thanks to the product), did break out in hives a few different places.  I promptly took a few benedryl to stop the reaction, but it was obvious it was to the cream.  I understand that this could possibly attribute to what happened with my underarms and that it very well might not be the case for everyone.  But do be cautious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend using the product just for legs (at least at first!) and immediately ceasing use at any sign of pain, burning, or tingling! I do feel thatit is unfortunate that I had a reaction, because I will say that my legs came out wonderfully, and it was very easy to achieve.  But might recommend to just stick with razors for underarms...the pain I&#x27;ll have for the next few days weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this a while ago and liked it...sort of. It went on smooth and was easy to remove but I had a slight stinging on my legs during the process. I think the sensitive one would work better for me....It removed 95% of the hair on my legs. and made them ridiculously silky feeling. I give this four stars...because of the stinging I felt...and because I found that my hair did not take noticeably longer to grow back. It was back the next day. But then again, my hair grows back very fast...so that might just be a MY PROBLEM thing lol To wrap this up...I would recommend that if you want fast, easy hair removal...give it a try. Its worth it. But if you have even slightly sensitive skin...go for the sensitive Veet gel cream instead.</li>
            <li> The point of getting this stuff is to get rid of hair better than shaving and have it last for longer. I&#x27;ve shaved my chest once in my life and it sucked. Decided to try the Veet as it wasn&#x27;t supposed to burn like Nair or other products (though I&#x27;ve heard it still burns for some people). I have slightly thicker-than-average hair so I followed the directions and kept the stuff on for six minutes. Used the plastic thing that came with the package to wipe it all off after. Indeed, my chest hair did come off. It did now, however, do a better job than shaving. My entire chest was left with stubble, which as most of you men out there know really sucks after about a day. I washed the rest of the stuff off and took a shower. Next morning I discovered that my left nipple was burned so bad that the nip itself was gone and just had raw flesh/scab left. That went back to normal after a week but caused some discomfort. Some of these products work, but this one does not (at least with thick hair).</li>
            <li> Good, a bit too floral smell.</li>
            <li> I thought it was like waxing but its no different than shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is growing back 3 days into the shave</li>
            <li> Good one..Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Works fast and not irritating to my skin but do a test first to see if it&#x27;s irritating for yours.  Spreads smooth.  Gets the job done first time.</li>
            <li> okay, i hate hair. arm hair, leg hair, armpit hair...etc. it all grosses me out. ive never really found a product that does what it says...this is just another one in a long line of failures. it didnt get the hair off at all. the only reason i gave it a three was it is really conditioning. i put it on when my skin when its super dry and leave it for about 4 mins and then shave it off. my skin after looks shiney and healthy. the smell isnt awful, but not great. roses my a$$. its less rotten eggs tho.</li>
            <li> I love my pubic area completely devoid of hair.  It is healthier and more attractive.  Unfortunately, I get razor bumps and ingrown hairs so most methods of hair removal are not attractive options for me.  I turned to Veet in the hope of a miracle.  I read other customer reviews and I followed up with epil stop after I used it.  The results were remarkable.  The hair is not removed as closely as waxing would achieve but, in a matter of minutes, most of the hair  was gone.  I had no irritation and very, very few ingrown hairs after.  I will use this product as long as it is available.  It works best if the hairs are not too long so, for those using it on the bikini area, trim a little if the hairs down there are at a length you are able to easily braid.  Also, be sure not to exceed the time limit (I keep it on for a maximum of thirteen minutes) or else it will cause the skin to break.  I know they warn not to use it beyond the bikini line but I learnt a trick from another reviewer which has enabled me to cover my entire pubic area with the cream.  On the sensitive skin along the inside of the labia, smear with petroleum jelly.  It creates a barrier between the cream and your skin preventing harm.  However, it is imperative that, if used this way, the recommended stay-time is not exceeded.</li>
            <li> Ok things I do like about this are that it&#x27;s in an easy to use bottle with spout. But that&#x27;s about it. Iv used plenty of veet products but this one the smell is so strong. It gives you a timeframe of 3-5 mins but by minute 4 it&#x27;s starting to sting (again other veet products dnt). The applicator works ok for for legs but used under the arm is just a waste of time. I&#x27;ll be going back to the &amp;#34;Fast Acting Gel Cream Hair Remover by Veet for Women - 6.78 oz Hair Remover&amp;#34; which was great all around including a better smell</li>
            <li> I really disliked this product. It is messy, smells strange and in my opinion, the effect does not last as long as it says it should.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to use it. I think I need to leave it on longer.  I think it is a good product</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews on here. After the first time I had stuble the next day (just like I would have with a razor) i wonder maybe I did not have it on think enough. I do not know but am going to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not break out or anything and the smell was nothing compared to Nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its certainly worth a try but dont count on it before  abig event I would try it ahead of time</li>
            <li> Even when I leave it on over 6 minutes, it does not remove all the hair.  And I can&#x27;t stand the smell!</li>
            <li> At first I was scared of using it for the first time I thought it will give me allergies but it worked really well actually. It removes most of the hair the razor usually leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t remove hair closer than shaving. U would get way closer to the skin with a razor. So sad such a waste of money. It works more as a trimmer than a razor. Like It may shorten it but not near enough to make it unseen. I&#x27;d look for something else.</li>
            <li> Works really well, sometimes there&#x27;s little hairs here and there so I browse around with a razor after but I never gave to do much work after I use it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair remover for my legs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used this hair removal cream on my whole body and it works like a dream. Using a razor always left my skin with irritation bumps, but this cream doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or leave it irritated. (I tried a test spot on the pit of the other side of my elbow) Being a man, I have dark thick hair but Veet has no problem removing any of it. I do have to leave it on past the recommended time though (about 8 - 10 mins). Make sure you exfoliate really good just like any hair removal method to make sure you don&#x27;t get those bumps, plus when you scrub hard it gets all the hair off, even the ones you missed with the spatula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to point out is that the cream has a very strong salon chemical smell. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but you can smell it for about 24 hours in the bathroom after use. Not a big enough issue to take a star, so this product remains at 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly satisfied, and would recommend</li>
            <li> Used on my legs after shaving with electric razor and couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair it still removed. Worked great with no burns or anything. Tried on mustache hairs and got 2 burns on my face for trying. Still would recommend it to anyone over the other products out their.</li>
            <li> I bought this halfheartedly, remembering my bad experience the last time I used a depilatory cream. It stank to high heaven, and it didn&#x27;t remove my hair adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about my hairy arms, so I decided to give it a shot one more time, a few years later, with this product. So glad I did. It worked PERFECTLY. I have used bleach on the hair before, and it burned my skin and was extremely uncomfortable to use. This didn&#x27;t hurt a bit, and it took every last bit of hair off my arms. So happy! Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Works not good enough, you&#x27;re better off waxing or shaving or even epilating. This stuff smells so bad and it took me 30 minutes to do both my legs. And it didn&#x27;t get most of the hair. I had to shave afterwards. And I got sick from the smell. Literally. My stomach is so upset from inhaling the rotten egg smelling chemicals.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it for my 10 year old daughter that goes to gymnastics. I&#x27;ve been arguing with her because I don&#x27;t agree on her shaving, although she has been caught clipping her hairs with the scissors. I bought the item, used it as cream, waited about 4 minutes and voila. Now I&#x27;m using it too. :-)</li>
            <li> I used hair removal products years ago and never really had any luck with them...I thought maybe 20+ years later, they might work better....Well they smell better, but still work about the same for me anyway....In 20 more years I&#x27;ll be too old to care about hair on my legs lol :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and play outdoor beach sports so I need to be groomed. First off, I just got over a nasty infection from an ingrown hair on my stomach from shaving, so this stuff is a Godsend. It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, or smell bad. If you follow the instructions you should get excellent results at hair removal. Your skin will feel dry-like for a couple of days afterwards.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid, this stuff is not going to burn your skin off! Guys and ladies, this works like a dream. I&#x27;ve used it on my entire lower body, chest, and underarms with no problems. Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair! I hate shaving, but I have absolutely no complaints for this. BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, even though I had it on for well over the recommended time. Will not purchase again but that&#x27;s just me. It may work for you. I have average thick black hair and it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Purchased the version of this with the &amp;#62; 6min. &amp;#60; max time and the scraper with the pliable edges. Worked the first time around and much better than I expected and in 6 minutes. Wasn&#x27;t terribly good about paying attention to the timer and left it on for 1-2 minutes longer in some spots. No irritation, bumps or redness after use. Strongly recommend wearing gloves when using this. There is a smell after using it, but it&#x27;s far better than the smell of Nair anything. Consistency of gel and design of the bottle keeps everything generally neat during application.</li>
            <li> Removes stubborn hair, and thick body hair with ease. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great Service!</li>
            <li> this product is the best idea ever. it lasts longer then shaving and is easy to apply and get off and actually does when its supposed to. my 1 down side is when you take the product off you feel like you have a waxy cover on your skin, but you just have to use a luffa. price cheeper then the store. and will buy again!</li>
            <li> You run out of this stuff pretty quickly because you have to use so much of it. It also eat away at your fingernails a bit. (Makes sense since fingernails are made out of similar stuff as hair, right?) But it works, and it works well!</li>
            <li> I tried it and it was just bad. I left it on for the maximum amount of time and still the product didn&#x27;t remove any hair. In an effort to make it work, I vigorously rubbed the little spatula on my skin and only a few hairs came off. Not only that, the cream smells bad. Useless and stinky, won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have chronic lymphedema, a genetic malformation of the lymphatic system in my legs.  I am not allowed to shave because I get a cellutis infection, but I get tired of having hairy legs.  3 mins and the 1/2 inch of hair on my legs were gone!  The spatula worked wonders.  My legs are super smooth! Nair smells horribly, but I was in the bathroom, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.  I will never use another product.  Veet has a fan for sure!!</li>
            <li> Simple Magical...but I hate the smell</li>
            <li> Removes hair at surface. Same as shaving. No difference. Leaves region red and burning for hours after use. I will stick to shaving. Never had a razor burn. Never had any problems at all.</li>
            <li> Background: I am tan with a lot of thin brown hair. I usually epilate my arms and legs (with an occasional shave if I need to do it quick). Today: I used the cream for 10 minutes on my arms and it took everything off! My skin was red for about a minute or 2 after the hair came off but it didn&#x27;t hurt at all! There is a slight smell to it, but it&#x27;s not strong and it&#x27;s not a bad smell so it&#x27;s honestly irrelevant. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say this cream is not intended for the face. However, being the daredevil I am, I decided to try it anyway. And I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always suffered from embarrassing facial hair on my chin, cheeks and neck and I was tired of the dark marks that were constantly being made by frequent tweezing.(I&#x27;m AA) so I have very course hair. This cream works wonders, Now, I am completely hairless and so much more confident.&lt;br /&gt;This cream also works amazingly on arms (including armpits), legs and bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is, this cream will burn you if you leave it on longer than 10mins and if you decided to be a daredevil like me and use it on your face make sure you DO NOT leave it on longer than 5 mins. You can repeat again an hour or so later if all the hair is not removed.&lt;br /&gt;But overall this is a SUPERB product for those who hate shaving/tweezing and don&#x27;t want to wax. I&#x27;ll never shave again!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product but the scent is not that great. Says it&#x27;s supposed to smell like roses but smells like #2 but i guess roses really do smell like booboo so .......</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this on my skin for long and it stung like hell. The scent is pretty awful as well.</li>
            <li> the cream worked as it said and my wife is more than satisfied by the product says it does not change the other</li>
            <li> I guess it was my first time with it but it worked and in a few ways it felt like razor shave. If you read the directions carefully it would work much better and lighter. There is a bit of a burn, maybe a sting but skin gets back up nothing to worry about, its fancy but not super efficient. Takes a while but the job gets done. Great Buy.</li>
            <li> Used this and it was more effective than shaving. BUT, takes a while to put on and take off as expected. Works great though when you have the time.</li>
            <li> I tried this product,  even though hair removers have not worked well on my coarse hair. I left it on for the full length of time, and was pleased to see the hair removed. However, my skin was not  smooth as expected. The area treated was covered with prickly stubble. Not a good feeling.  There is plenty of product left in this large jar, so I will try again when hair grows  a little longer- hopefully with better results next time!</li>
            <li> Absolutely removes hair and keeps it off longer than shaving. Also smells absolutely horrible but at the end of the day, the convinience is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insiders tip. If you choose to ignore the warning and remove your pubic hair via chemical burn, DO NOT put lotion on it. Please for the love of all that is holy, heed my tale of woe.</li>
            <li> No mess, easy use. The hear doesn&#x27;t grow as fast. Pleasant smell. Will buy it again for myself and my sisters.</li>
            <li> So much better than shaving and Nair.</li>
            <li> The best hair removal cream I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried plenty.  It delivers what it promise and that&#x27;s all I ask.</li>
            <li> “I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.” I love Veet because it give me the best quality in hair removal. I love the results so I give them a five star for my five star smooth legs and underarms</li>
            <li> Product was received on time and works very well. I will order again it also smells.better than Nair and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star rating because it does somewhat work, but it&#x27;s definitely not the solution that&#x27;s going to make me throw out my razor any time soon. I have thick dark hair on my legs and using this works somewhat, but the hair comes right back within a few days, and I find that even if it&#x27;s about 5 minutes shorter to do it the Veet way, the cost doesn&#x27;t make it worth it. I&#x27;ll still keep buying this, but probably only for weekly use on my forearms, which I like smooth.</li>
            <li> As an aesthetician I usually wax clients.  However, I have a male client who prefers have his hair removed to the \\&quot;ripping\\&quot; of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not purchase Veet Gel Cream Pump Hair Remover from Amazon.  But thought I would share my client&#x27;s painful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately upon applying the gel, he complained it was burning his skin.  I removed the gel and added lavender oil, which is well known to create a soothing barrier for the skin, without effecting bleach, hair color, etc.  I applied the \\&quot;oil-added\\&quot; gel and we had the same results within 2 minutes.  Needless to say we were not able to remove any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My client returned 2 weeks later and his skin was red, dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have successfully used Sally Hansen Cream Hair Remover.  However, the pump on each container is consistently defective and wastes the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my client returned after the bad Veet experience, I took my remaining Sally Hansen containers, laid them on waxing paper on the floor and smashed them open with a waxing can to break the pump and get to the product.  What I found inside was 1/3-2/3&#x27;s product would have been in accessible because of the defective pumps.  Unfortunately, once each container is opened, the remover is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for a good hair remover continues.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I searched Amazon for &amp;#34;facial depilatory creams&amp;#34; and this was listed.  The information doesn&#x27;t say not to use it on the face, so I took for granted it was okay.  I clearly didn&#x27;t investigate by reading reviews, so I guess it&#x27;s on me that I can&#x27;t get my money back.  It&#x27;s getting so you have to read everything printed to know what you&#x27;re being offered.  In fact, the description on the page right now gives directions for getting stains out with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Directions&lt;br /&gt;Keep Out Of Reach Of Childrendirections: 1. Turn Nozzle To &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; Position. 2. Spray Onto The Stain, Covering It Completely. 3. Wait 5 Minutes Maximum. 4. Rub Into Stain. 5.

            <li> does what its supposed to do. better smell than the other veet products i&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great value for money!!</li>
            <li> Used on bikini area, this product does not get any closer, smoother or last any longer than regular shaving.  One part of the directions say to leave on for 3 to 6 minutes, but no longer than 6.  Another part of the directions say no longer than 10 minutes.  I tried all, going up to 10 minutes.  Experienced a slight chemical burn with the 10 minutes session, and still had a little stubble just as if I had shaved.  Maybe someone with finer hair would have better luck, but for me it is not worth it to subject my skin to chemicals and still have stubble.  Jenny</li>
            <li> This product works but not very well on me anyways..I let my hair grow out a little on my legs..had major thick stubble, let it set on my leg for 8 minutes and used the scraper that comes with it...well left smooth points on my leg but didn&#x27;t get totally everything..quite disappointed in this product..&lt;br /&gt;Hate how strong the chemical smell is to :(</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. This product is effective for removing hair in unwanted areas, but after the hair was removed, I noticed that some areas were left with irritation, a rash, or red bumps. I will blame this on the skin being more sensitive in some areas, however I strongly recommend you test the product out before you use it and then believe you can go about your business as the irritation can cause some itching.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product recently, and am very glad I got it. I have a fair amount of hair and this cuts right through it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again and recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Have it on subscribe and save and it comes perfectly on time!&lt;br /&gt;A lot better than shaving! No bumps, hair grows back soft not harsh and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle lasts a couple months if only used every few weeks!</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a guy and I like the boys clean but using a razor down there makes me nervous.  The good news is that most of the hair was gone on the first try and didn&#x27;t even leave it on the full 10 minutes.  But it also took off a layer of skin.  Pain like I&#x27;ve never felt before.  Used it in other areas first with little or no problems but the boys didn&#x27;t fare so well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try anyways! I applied the cream to my arm to test it out just in case it would irritate my skin and OMG it&#x27;s amazing! I love it! I had no irritation and it was fast acting. I know it says hair remover for &amp;#34;legs and body&amp;#34; but I used it on my top lip for a few seconds - 20secs MAX - and had no irritations what so ever. I don&#x27;t recommend using this product for your facial hair. This was my decision and I knew what the consequences would be. LOL.Over all I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ll never shave or pluck again! 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> Works well, does what it shouldl.</li>
            <li> I first tried hair remover creams about 10 years ago. My experiences were horrible: the creams burned and they smelled disgusting. The stench would linger for days after using the product, no matter how many baths I took. I recently decided to give them another try and have been fairly pleased that I did. This cream smells okay and does not leave an after smell (I even had my husband sniff me after the bath and he couldn&#x27;t detect anything). It gets rid of the hair and leaves behind fairly smooth legs. There is a little more stubble than I get with shaving, but overall it is quicker and easier to use the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump style container makes it easy to dispense. No fumbling with the bottle or squeezing out too much at once, just one press of the pump and you get the same amount of cream every time. I have noticed a very light stinging sensation when using it, but it is nowhere near as bad as the burning I remember from ten years ago! It may decrease as I become more used to the cream, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest giving this product a try if you&#x27;ve been on the fence. It looks like hair removal formulas have definitely improved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this. I&#x27;m never going to shave again! I&#x27;ve noticed I have to put it on a bit thicker than my instincts want me to. :)</li>
            <li> I used this on my arms and it works perfectly. All the hair disappeared and my skin was left smooth. It is a much better alternative than shaving. Just apply it, wait a few minutes, use the applicator to remove the cream. Then wash with cool water and you&#x27;ll be hair free.</li>
            <li> perfect for getting all the hair out it worked absolutely well although there were a few strands left, for the first time i think that is great considering the other products i have used. i had absolutely no reaction and i had to use a sponge afterwards to wash the hair all off. Leaves the skin smooth and soft. Sticking to this one</li>
            <li> I used as directed on my legs. My hair is medium to fine. I left on for about 5 minutes, then tried to use the scraper to remove, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work. I was worried about leaving it on too long and jumped in the shower. Only some hair was removed. What&#x27;s left feels weird. I&#x27;m going to have to shave. Shaving always (no matter what, I&#x27;ve tried many things) leaves my skin irritated and later I get tons of ingrown hairs, which is what I was trying to avoid! I really hate wasting time and money I something I care about so little.</li>
            <li> Throughout my life I have tried just about every hair removal method possible like i&#x27;m sure most people have. However, I have very sensitive skin that becomes irritated fast. I bought this Veet Gel when I was pregnant and finding it hard to do all those contortionist acts just to shave my legs and bikini area. First, I loved the bottle with the pump. It was so much easier to use than those gels and creams that come in tubes since it was a lot less messier and made for easy storage. The bottle is also big enough to use all over your body and still have enough for a few more times. When I read this had essential oils I wasn&#x27;t in party mode, nothing special I thought, but it made a huge difference in the way the cream smelled and felt. Normally I would be holding my breath in the bathroom because the chemical odor is just unbearable however I was pleasantly surprised. I used this on my legs, arms, underarms and bikini area and left it on for about 5 minutes or until I saw the hair withering off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it works fast, but I did not think it did an amazing job at removing some of the hair from the roots (as stated in the description). I still saw a lot of stubble, and my skin did turn red only after 1 minute of applying this. However, I would still recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have terribly sensitive skin and is looking for a quick hair removal option.</li>
            <li> I LOVET IT GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I purchased the sensitive version of this cream and used it on my legs and bikini area. I lightly wet both areas before applying the cream and waited six minutes before hopping into the shower. I waited a couple more minutes before rinsing it off and wiping it off with a textured towel, in circular motions. Most of the hair was gone, though I could feel soft, peachy hairs on my legs and my bikini area was mostly hair-free. The stray hairs came off later when I applied baby lotion to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: if you have very coarse hair (bikini area, armpits, etc.) it is not as effective on these areas&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from ingrown hairs, wait for the bumps to heal and try this instead of shaving to keep bumps at bay&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong and chemical; use in ventilated area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Excellent on legs, use on bikini area at your own discretion...with a lot of care. I have had friends get yeast infections because they applied it to areas too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Remove hair very quickly~</li>
            <li> Have been using veet for more than 7years and I probably always will. Great product, leaves your skin baby smooth</li>
            <li> This works much better than other brands.  I used it everywhere,  and I mean all over.  No issues whatsoever.  I normally have very sensitive,  eczema prone skin and this didn&#x27;t aggravate it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Veet hair remover for years - no other hair remover comes close to working as well.  But don&#x27;t do what I have done a couple of times and leave it on for even a minute too long, or you&#x27;ll be in trouble!  It works VERY quickly, and there&#x27;s a definite difference between 6 minutes and 7 minutes - a mistake I made last night when I used it &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  I was on fire after rinsing it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and although it says not to rub it off (or use soap), there&#x27;s no way you can remove the hair without rubbing it off - even the strongest rinse from a handheld shower head won&#x27;t blast it all away, and you can&#x27;t get rid of all that slimy product if you don&#x27;t use SOMETHING other than water.  To avoid irritation (plus get my washcloth covered with yucky hair), I mixed up brown sugar and olive oil before I got in the shower and used that to rub off the area.  As I said, I left the product on too long which irritated &amp;#34;certain areas,&amp;#34; so the sugar helped make that feel better.  And I know this sounds weird, but then I used an alcohol-free rosemary and sage conditioner to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my skin to get rid of the product residue - and to get rid of that awful hair remover odor.  (No matter what these companies tell you, there&#x27;s no getting away from that odor.)  I had to use Bactine afterward to soothe my skin, but as I said, totally my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t have such an awful odor.  Not because I expected a hair remover NOT to have an awful odor, but because Veet claims this product has a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent.  The first thing my husband asked when he got home was, &amp;#34;Did you use depilatory?&amp;#34;  That should tell you something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I recommend this hair remover product over all others - the depilatories at least.  Waxing is a whole other thing.</li>
            <li> So, if I have to use this stuff - and it&#x27;s better than shaving and cheaper than waxing - I like the easy application pump bottle and product works fast &amp; is pretty effective.  The included plastic remover helps too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything. That being said it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is always a plus</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing im never buying a razor again i cant even begin to tell you how much money ive wasted on trying to find a razor and cream that works and doesnt leave me with itchy red irritated legs and red bumbs that are less attractive than just not shaving at all. I rember trying Nair and the smell and the gunk is horrible and it burned and just left my skin awful so of course i said never again it doesnt work for me back to razors it is. My friend told me about veet and i was like no way am i trying stuff like that again but i did and o am i glad the smell isnt that bad no burning and the best part is it works. My legs have never been so soft in my life. Of course it took me a few tryes b4 i got the method down.  Ive only tryed it on my legs so far  I Im so happy i took the chance and bought this.</li>
            <li> Smells weird and has to be left a little longer than instructed.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised, doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious odor, and is gentle on my skin.  What more could I ask?</li>
            <li> My legs felt silky after using it. Not suitable for anything other then legs and arm pits. Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I had fairly long hair before using this product. I tend not to shave often because I don&#x27;t wear shorts and I&#x27;m not dating anyone at the moment. I put a thick layer on my legs and left it on for the full six minutes. I used a washcloth and warm water to take off the lotion. It took off 75% of the hair leaving me with a bunch of random patches of hair that wouldn&#x27;t budge. In addition to that, where the hair was removed, my skin felt slighty stubbly, as it would the day after shaving. I get much smoother legs with Nair, and even with shaving (though that doesn&#x27;t last as long.) The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this one star is because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like Nair does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a pinch, I might use it again, because it is easier than shaving when my leg hair gets out of control. But I am really annoyed that I have to go back with a razor to finish the job. You only have one job, Veet, and you need a razor to help you? Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and smells like a wet dog! You&#x27;re better off buying some other product, but don&#x27;t buy Veet it doesn&#x27;t work! The spatula doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> Barely works. Forget putting it on your legs/arms. Only place it worked was near belly button.</li>
            <li> Works great for the longer (~1/2&amp;#34; or longer) hairs, almost as great as a wax. Let hair grow out a bit if looking for super smooth areas. I used this on all locations. I mean ALL locations. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Left it on for even a bit longer than supposed to but still very little hair removed. Smell was probably better than the original version but still unpleasant. Not worth the time, money or effort.</li>
            <li> Ok. So I researched a lot about this product and read a lot of reviews in Amazon and other websites. There was a lot of negatives and positives feedbacks but I decided to risk it and pay the money. This is the best product I have ever tried. I have been shaving and was really scared of trying any products as I have sensitive skin but this product is really really good and it did not hurt or burn my skin at all. This product does a really good job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid, this stuff is not going to burn your skin off! Guys and ladies, this works like a dream. I&#x27;ve used it on my entire lower body, chest, and underarms with no problems. Just be sure you leave it on for ten minutes so that it can get all the hair! I used it to give myself a brazilian and have absolutely no complaints. BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> this product its good..does the job...not too fond of the smell but hey it works,,,will be buyin this product again</li>
