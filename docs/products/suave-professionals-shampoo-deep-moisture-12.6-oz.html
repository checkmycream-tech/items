    <ol>
            <li>It just feels so good!!</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a great affordable product!</li>
            <li>It is excellent!</li>
            <li>this shampoo is one of the best shampoos out there for a great price.</li>
            <li>A great find for the price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works great.  </li>
            <li>Works amazing and a great price!</li>
            <li>also a great selection of products</li>
            <li>This is impressively good shampoo - and great price - compared to the Nexxus equivalent.</li>
            <li>but this has now been reformulated and is not as good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am very glad for my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is my very favorite product that I ever bought for my hair.</li>
            <li>It is ok shampoo, but a great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this shampoo when I run out!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even feel like my own hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite enjoyable and nice.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but I love Suave Humectant.</li>
            <li>I wished I could return but will cost me more than $4 for shipping as amazon will not consider this my fault.</li>
            <li>and I did like it better than the Almond and Shea Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this conditioner to those trying to keep their hair healthy but may be on a budget and want drug store brands.</li>
            <li>I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; brands.  </li>
            <li>Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an \\&quot;under 4 oz.\\&quot; size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and I would most definately buy again.</li>
            <li>I love this product from Suave.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it makes my hair feel and the way that my hair looks after using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean after I use this shampoo</li>
            <li>The shampoo works fine</li>
            <li>The texture feels wonderful on your hair and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely not dried out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok as a shampoo, doesn&#x27;t lather as well or smell as nice as the old formula.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable and the smell of this shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to, but also because it was cheap</li>
            <li>So I really like how this shampoo leave my hair feeling amazingly smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>had no problem rinsing the shampoo out of my hair after I had thoroughly washed my scalp and hair, all the shampoo came right out.</li>
            <li>Very value priced shampoo, great for thick frizzy hair, good value for the money, would definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>Makes my dry hair shiny and more smooth.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am extremely happy with this purchase, and it&#x27;s so cheap too!</li>
            <li>and it really does great to help restore moisture to my dead ends.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and easy to brush even without using conditioner.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this shampoo particularly moisturizing, but it did what it was supposed to do, clean my hair.</li>
            <li>I have liked Suave&#x27;s imitation Nexxus products for years</li>
            <li>The smell lingers in my hair long after my shower which I really love.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it very moisturizing, hence the 3 star rating.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would purchase this product again and again.</li>
            <li>Other Suave lines have worked better for me.</li>
            <li>I was throughly surprised the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>and they leave my hair in decent condition.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying some place like Walmart though, because it&#x27;s a little more pricey here.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on accident, thinking it was the humectant conditioner by Suave that I normally use.</li>
            <li>I find the shampoo does not leave hair very soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying since it&#x27;s much cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using this shampoo with Pantene Smoothing Conditioner for Dry Hair, which also works well for me.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky and so soft.</li>
            <li>Also, the price for one smaller bottle was $5.99, far more expensive than available in any store.  </li>
            <li>Picture is completely misleading.</li>
            <li>My 18 yr old daughter loves it, also.  </li>
            <li>Next, I&#x27;ll try Suave Professional Humectant Conditioner, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li>It turns out that, I paid more than 2 times for a product which was less than half in volume.</li>
            <li>I am a guy, I generally don&#x27;t bother with conditioner.</li>
            <li>But after using this shampoo, I never want to go back to my old ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li>I generally use various volumizing shampoos, so I never would have bought something like this on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dye my hair every 8 weeks, so naturally it can get somewhat dry.</li>
            <li>Product arrived earlier than expected, and was in brand new condition like stated.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Usually I have a difficult time finding a Shampoo or Conditioner that is right for my hair but I love Suave Humectant. It makes my hair feel silky and so soft. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I paid $ 5.99 for 12.6 fl oz of this product. After I ordered, I later realized that Walmart sells 32 Fl Oz of it at $ 2.74. It turns out that, I paid more than 2 times for a product which was less than half in volume. I did not expect this from an order fulfilled by amazon. I wished I could return but will cost me more than $4 for shipping as amazon will not consider this my fault.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on accident, thinking it was the humectant conditioner by Suave that I normally use. I generally use various volumizing shampoos, so I never would have bought something like this on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am very glad for my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair every 8 weeks, so naturally it can get somewhat dry. I use a lot of products to combat the dryness... heat shields, hair masks, etc. and they leave my hair in decent condition. But after using this shampoo, I never want to go back to my old ones. Instead of taking it back to the store, I ended up using it and the difference in my hair is unbelievable. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like my own hair. My hair is so soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it. It just feels so good!! It&#x27;s never been like this before. Needless to say, I am extremely happy with this purchase, and it&#x27;s so cheap too! I&#x27;d recommend buying some place like Walmart though, because it&#x27;s a little more pricey here.</li>
            <li> * The shampoo works fine and I did like it better than the Almond and Shea Shampoo.  * A great find for the price.</li>
            <li> I randomly got this conditioner when I saw it was only a 1.50 on sale. I was throughly surprised the first time I used it. The scent is quite enjoyable and nice. The texture feels wonderful on your hair and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely not dried out. I would recommend this conditioner to those trying to keep their hair healthy but may be on a budget and want drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I find the shampoo does not leave hair very soft it feels very coarse.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The picture of the item shows 3 bottles, however it is really only one.  It is the smaller 12.6 oz bottle. not the larger 32 oz bottle that is often sold in stores.  Also, the price for one smaller bottle was $5.99, far more expensive than available in any store.  Priced yesterday at Walgreens for $1.99.  Picture is completely misleading.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo to help revive my dry dead ends. The price is very affordable and the smell of this shampoo is amazing. The smell lingers in my hair long after my shower which I really love. My hair feels very clean after I use this shampoo and it really does great to help restore moisture to my dead ends. A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way. I find that it lathers up well with about a quarter (pocket change) size amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem rinsing the shampoo out of my hair after I had thoroughly washed my scalp and hair, all the shampoo came right out. My hair was soft and easy to brush even without using conditioner. I will be purchasing more of this shampoo when I run out!</li>
            <li> The shampoo works great.  The only dissapointment was that I didn&#x27;t read the title correctly, so I thought I was getting 3 bottles at the $5.99 price.  Bummer for me.</li>
            <li> Other Suave lines have worked better for me. This line isn&#x27;t terrible, but it&#x27;s just your average shampoo. At least that&#x27;s how it was for me. It&#x27;s worth trying since it&#x27;s much cheaper than other brands. I did notice it slightly dried my  already-dry hair out. I didn&#x27;t find it very moisturizing, hence the 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> Very value priced shampoo, great for thick frizzy hair, good value for the money, would definitely buy again.  Recommended product!</li>
            <li> I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; brands.  Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an \\&quot;under 4 oz.\\&quot; size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some shampoo.  I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip.  (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand.  I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference!  Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip.  I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc.  That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since.  I haven&#x27;t found a single one that I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;ve saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners.  Two thumbs up for this product!</li>
            <li> Love love love this! Works amazing and a great price! Thank you for making a great affordable product!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  Makes my dry hair shiny and more smooth.  My 18 yr old daughter loves it, also.  Right now I&#x27;m using this shampoo with Pantene Smoothing Conditioner for Dry Hair, which also works well for me.  Next, I&#x27;ll try Suave Professional Humectant Conditioner, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> I have liked Suave&#x27;s imitation Nexxus products for years but this has now been reformulated and is not as good. It&#x27;s definitely not like Nexxus humectress shampoo. It&#x27;s ok as a shampoo, doesn&#x27;t lather as well or smell as nice as the old formula. So it&#x27;s ok but if you want a Nexxus imitation, this is no longer it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than expected, and was in brand new condition like stated. I highly recommend the product and I would most definately buy again.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is one of the best shampoos out there for a great price. also a great selection of products</li>
            <li> I am a guy, I generally don&#x27;t bother with conditioner. So I really like how this shampoo leave my hair feeling amazingly smooth and clean. I have a \\&quot;fade\\&quot; haircut, so the results may be different for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li> This is impressively good shampoo - and great price - compared to the Nexxus equivalent. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just your average shampoo. I didn&#x27;t find this shampoo particularly moisturizing, but it did what it was supposed to do, clean my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would purchase this product again and again. I love this product from Suave. It is my very favorite product that I ever bought for my hair. I love the way that it makes my hair feel and the way that my hair looks after using this product. It is excellent! A must-have for everybody!</li>
            <li> It is ok shampoo, but a great value for the price.  I recommend it for people who are on a budget.</li>
