    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Revlon, the maker of Mitchum deodorant/antiperspirant, used to be an excellent company.</li>
            <li>This SmartSolid unscented is the best they ever made, so I&#x27;m buying it up wherever I see it.</li>
            <li>Best antipersperant on the market.  </li>
            <li>excellent service and product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s awesome that I can buy online now.</li>
            <li>5-star, two thumbs up IMPRESSED!  </li>
            <li>The best way to describe it is after you put the antiperspirant on it</li>
            <li>and this is the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It also has no scent to it which is great</li>
            <li>This deodorant works great for me.  </li>
            <li>This has been a great replacement.</li>
            <li>Great at stopping sweat and body odor.</li>
            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>great job keep up the good work....</li>
            <li>I loved Mitchum&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>This is good deodorant and it worked well for me, the problem I kept having was it would break off halfway through.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t companies just leave a good product alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbie</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented, which I love, and is great for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it is a very effective anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many!  </li>
            <li>Besides that, it caused my arm pits to sweat even more!</li>
            <li>When the Clinical Performance stick was introduced I realized that what was already good has become even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the performance of Mitchum.</li>
            <li>Now they mark a deodorant that contains the effective ingredient I&#x27;m looking for, Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly, \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; when in fact it contains fragrance.</li>
            <li>it is effective all day.  </li>
            <li>any* kind of waxy residue in your pits, because it&#x27;s water-based.</li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t find it to be effective with perspiration.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m concerned about these potentially hazardous side effects.</li>
            <li>It is the absolute best deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best deodorant that&#x27;s ever been made.  </li>
            <li>It does have a kind of sticky, bordering on glue like, consistancy.  </li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>The original that&#x27;s been around for decades did NOT stain clothes and was great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I made the switch from Sure to this.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is buy far the best.  </li>
            <li>Also, I like the stick better than the gel.</li>
            <li>I tried this one and it made me sweat more</li>
            <li>That means it contains the scent to which so many of us are allergic.</li>
            <li>I fell in love.    </li>
            <li>it is beyond me - must be trying to make shelf space for some more of the cheaper stuff.  </li>
            <li>Mitchum makes better deoderant products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other brands of clinical strength seem to mostly apply in a click cream, that comes out of the top of the container in a grid.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes, it&#x27;s unscented, and it works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, the top shelf of my computer desk reads like a medicine cabinet..</li>
            <li>More pluses include no sticky residue</li>
            <li>This is a 1/3 of the price of the clinical brand, and works just better.  </li>
            <li>...can&#x27;t say enough great things about this!!!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I should have known better and just stuck with the gels</li>
            <li>Now I am finding strong stenches (fragrances are stenches to someone whose allergies are triggered by them) even in Revlon&#x27;s rouges and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Best deodorant ever made, hands down...</li>
            <li>This stuff gets the job done as an antiperspirant, and dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, but most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave *</li>
            <li>I then switched to the solid, great stuff but the residue sucked.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is placed in the men&#x27;s deodorant area, but I have used it for years for 3 reasons: it works great and keeps me from both sweating and stinking; it is unscented, unlike some of the women&#x27;s stinky scents; and IT DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE MARKS ON CLOTHING.</li>
            <li>WHY did they do away with a fantastic product that worked well?  </li>
            <li>You just lightly make contact w/ the skin and swipe across.</li>
            <li>I used the old Mitchum solid (unscented) for over 20 years and loved it; it was a really great product.</li>
            <li>Again, this is the best deodorant in the history of time, and yes, I&#x27;ve had a few drinks before writing this review.</li>
            <li>if it does, I hope I can get an advanced warning so I can buy a lifetime supply of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I just make sure I apply right when I get out of the shower and by the time I finish the rest of my routine</li>
            <li>the most important feature is being unscented, not many unscented deodorant in the market, very good performance  in controling sweat, congratulations</li>
            <li>After researching it and asking my doctor, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Just figure out how many you need a month and save money doing it, while you get exactly what you want.</li>
            <li>If we ever find another one like the old Mitchum Solid, we will&lt;br /&gt;be very happy!</li>
            <li>one works great, lasts a long time, has a smaller skinnier more portable container, and best of all you can really control the application better than the other &amp;#</li>
            <li>I have been using this kind of deodorant literally almost forever, and just recently the stores in my city stopped carrying this deodorant, luckily I was able to find it right away here on Amazon and ordered right away, and its just as advertised!</li>
            <li>No rash, as other reviewers experienced, no film or residue</li>
            <li>I searched the internet (Google \\&quot;mitchum deodorant scabs\\&quot;) and found that many, many people had the same problem.</li>
            <li>Works great but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>While I found it effective against perspiration and odor this summer, the new (?) formula for the \\&quot;Smart Solid\\&quot; makes it rather brittle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most deodorant irritates my skin within an hour or so of putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best antiperspirant deodorant on the market, so far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had hit a gold mine when I first purchased this product!</li>
            <li>The issue here is it applies so light and smart</li>
            <li>It is powerful.  </li>
            <li>Think about it there is perfume in laundry detergent and softener, perfume in soap, shampoo, mouthwash, toothpaste, deodorant, and everything I just want to smell like fresh air which has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>when Sure discontinued it&#x27;s soft unscented deodorant.</li>
            <li>am so disappointedin this product and also I bought a years worth.  </li>
            <li>there was \\&quot;enough\\&quot; stench stopper coming out and even then, it&#x27;s very light and barely visible.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen anything even half as good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s keeps you nice and dry.</li>
            <li>The first one broke and crumbled after some use and after that it continued to break off into pieces.</li>
            <li>I opened the first one and every time I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years, its the first one I tried that did not cause a rash.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it works for some, but just be aware that it can potentially cause a rash.</li>
            <li>However, this deodorant breaks off in chunks, sometimes almost after the first swipe, which is very costly and wasteful!</li>
            <li>I got the scented type and would rub it back and forth over and over to make sure it was covered.  </li>
            <li>It is actually unscented, unlike many products that claim to be unscented but still smell.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be switching back to Sure unscented.</li>
            <li>In the world of clinical strength, this is now my first preference.</li>
            <li>First time customer of Mitchum Revlon products:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all (literally and unfortunately), and this is still the best.</li>
            <li>Thus, I lost a good portion of it and, therefore, I consider it wasted money.</li>
            <li>In fact, the whole top broke off in one big chunk.  </li>
            <li>and what is best is it is generally half the price of other clinical strength deodorants!</li>
            <li>(Just make sure your pits or whatever else is dry)</li>
            <li>This Mitchum solid is strong, works all day and no stained shirts.</li>
            <li>Mitchum SMART solid unscented is like a super ATHLETE that comes to perform!</li>
            <li>Keep it just above the plastic rim, and you will be completely fine.</li>
            <li>It works very well, lasts all day even through outdoor rooftop work.</li>
            <li>It is because you use too much.  </li>
            <li>This one is the real deal.</li>
            <li>People are having a real problem with this formulation.</li>
            <li>and it really stops the sweating.</li>
            <li>A real shame, too, since this stick lasts much longer than implied by its 2.5 ounces.  </li>
            <li>Why do the peeps at Revlon think everybody wants to have a scent.  </li>
            <li>It worked REALLY well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this two stars because it DOES work really well.</li>
            <li>After that, no matter how gentle I was in applying it, chunks would break off and have to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>it does not hold up for a whole day, and the stick WILL break when applying it.</li>
            <li>I felt I needed to write this review for ppl who really wanted what is written on the label.</li>
            <li>My dr. gave me a prescription for xerac ac which is only available by prescription</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>you wish to avoid offending your colleagues, this product may very well help.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve found the unscented clinical strength, which is kind of irritating, but it&#x27;s nice to get a discount on it.</li>
            <li>GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA</li>
            <li>BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL STUFF AND FIRE</li>
            <li>I was dry, great underarm protection, and there was no white residue left on my clothing under my armpits.</li>
            <li>The Mitchum gel, while equally as effective, doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the stick.</li>
            <li>NONE OF THEM WERE SMART, SMART, SMART like Mitchum SMART solid unscented!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They may not have trendy advertisements showing how you can conquer the female sex with the other wood chopping brands, but this one really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant is not only SMART, it is a LIFE SAVER for you and a Bad-smell killer for bacteria!!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how I apply it - light pressure, heavier pressure, dry skin, or straight-out-of-the-shower-damp.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dry, it&#x27;s not powdery, not sticky and has no annoying perfumes.</li>
            <li>This is a classic case of \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>This one is different, and is more like a solid.</li>
            <li>The Mitchum Smart Solid is not so smart it keeps breaking which ends up in the GARBAGE!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Not messy like the gels they came out with, but as close to the original solid as I can find.</li>
            <li>It works more effectively than the other brands, keeping me dry and free of odor all day, and it isn&#x27;t at all irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li>I used to use normal strength antiperspirant, but faced with a slew of job interviews and not wanting to show up looking...</li>
            <li>I have tried several anti-perspirants over the years with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s themagic of it and to top it off, it just takes a few strokes for all-day protection.  </li>
            <li>It just washes right off in the shower; I&#x27;m a total convert.</li>
            <li>I used to use the cream, great stuff but a little messy.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; - the New Coke of antiperspirant/deodorants.</li>
            <li>I have used another clinical brand for years, and Mitchum just got a new customer.  </li>
            <li>I see that some people are unhappy because an old formula was discontinued, and I have experienced that sadness in many other products.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works great but the last four sticks I&#x27;ve purchased have all broken off before they were even halfway finished.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t turn them up too high, only as high as I need to to avoid scraping my armpits with the plastic when putting it on but the deodorant itself just doesn&#x27;t hold together very well.</li>
            <li>I love it because it works, but can&#x27;t afford to purchase it again because of the waste!</li>
            <li>the only thing close to the original can only be found with stinky perfumes added.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION OF MITCHUM SOLID.</li>
            <li>I have to click 3 for the first arm and 2 for the second, every time, because after I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;warmed it</li>
            <li>I simply am not buying any more until they&#x27;ve acknowledged this problem and made a public statement via news release or in an ad that the strength of the solid stick has improved to prevent breaking.</li>
            <li>I was used to old type anti-perspirant sticks that you had to cake on just to get them to last the day, so when I first started using this stuff</li>
            <li>I figure I was able to use only half the product because of breakage.  </li>
            <li>but I would not purchase the Smart Solid (for women)again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>but when I saw the smart solid it had all the makings of the hydro stuff.</li>
            <li>Well, they need to go back to basics and quit trying to be so smart about it.</li>
            <li>I switched to Mitchum Smart Solid Unscented Anti-Perspirant about 2 years ago on the recommendation of a friend when I started breaking out in a rash with my old anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>Even though it hardly fel like I had used any, it still works better than anything I had ever tried.  </li>
            <li>This Smart Solid Clinical Performance, however, is a great disappointment and Revlon should be ashamed to sell it.</li>
            <li>It works great to prevent sweat stains, but after using it for 2 months, I got a weird brown, scab-like line rash under my left armpit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The water based deodorant goes on completely clear, and provides all day protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SENSITIVE SKINNED PEOPLE BEWARE.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant works as well as any of the clinical types but this solid is very crumbly -- I&#x27;ve had to toss pieces of it away.</li>
            <li>Count me as another person who developed a persistent underarm rash when using this anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not too far from my life.     </li>
            <li>My pits were completely arid; my clothes had no stains.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve looked everywhere to find the old stuff, with no luck.</li>
            <li>as you did the old stuff.</li>
            <li>I have hyperhydrosis* and also has extremely sensitive skin, this is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t screw the product up too far, as the solid is soft and it can break off if you make it too high.</li>
            <li>In fact, it prompted me to try the MITCHUM CLINICAL SOFT SOLID which is expensive, but AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a deodorant with no messy white residue and this one was rated highly.  </li>
            <li>I tried everything under the sun, even all the clinical stuff which even had the same main ingredient as this one:</li>
            <li>I was not a long term user of Mitchum, though I had used it before, so for me, this is considered a &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; and I rate it on it&#x27;s merits alone as a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and have gotten multiple people converted to it after recommending they try it.</li>
            <li>Curiously, the same feature hasn&#x27;t developed on my right armpit.</li>
            <li>And I wonder how many people get headaches, rashes, mental confusion, inability to breathe, etc., and don&#x27;t realize that they actually have an allergy to perfumes, aftershaves and other scented products?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned it breaking off in chunks - the ONLY time this has ever happened to me is if I&#x27;ve rolled the stick out too far.</li>
            <li>This product works very well - keeps me dry and odor-free, no irritation problem that others have mentioned - but I will never buy it again because the stuff breaks off in big hunks.  </li>
            <li>For those coming from the old Mitchum, you have to use 1/4 or less as much of this</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it had been left on the shelf too long at the store, but I&#x27;ve gone to several stores to purchase it since then, and the same thing happens.</li>
            <li>I think the other peopel were having was just using too much of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>so I can at least get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>Prevents sweat and smell all day long in hot temps and NO white residue due to its &amp;#34;wet solid&amp;#34; formula.</li>
            <li>I almost always have sweat rings by the end of the day, even with my old clinical stuff, but with this I have dry underarms</li>
            <li>The people who complain about rashes and allergies should not be counted on for these reviews because those examples are atypical, but for the TYPICAL person, this SMART solid is a no brainer!!!  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Revlon, the maker of Mitchum deodorant/antiperspirant, used to be an excellent company.</li>

            <li> This is good deodorant and it worked well for me, the problem I kept having was it would break off halfway through.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t companies just leave a good product alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbie</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented, which I love, and is great for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it is a very effective anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many!  </li>
            <li> Besides that, it caused my arm pits to sweat even more!</li>
            <li> When the Clinical Performance stick was introduced I realized that what was already good has become even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the performance of Mitchum.</li>
            <li> Now they mark a deodorant that contains the effective ingredient I&#x27;m looking for, Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly, \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; when in fact it contains fragrance.</li>
            <li> it is effective all day.  </li>
            <li> any* kind of waxy residue in your pits, because it&#x27;s water-based.</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t find it to be effective with perspiration.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m concerned about these potentially hazardous side effects.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute best deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best deodorant that&#x27;s ever been made.  </li>
            <li> It does have a kind of sticky, bordering on glue like, consistancy.  </li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> The original that&#x27;s been around for decades did NOT stain clothes and was great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I made the switch from Sure to this.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is buy far the best.  </li>
            <li> Also, I like the stick better than the gel.</li>
            <li> I tried this one and it made me sweat more</li>
            <li> That means it contains the scent to which so many of us are allergic.</li>
            <li> I fell in love.    </li>
            <li> it is beyond me - must be trying to make shelf space for some more of the cheaper stuff.  </li>
            <li> Mitchum makes better deoderant products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other brands of clinical strength seem to mostly apply in a click cream, that comes out of the top of the container in a grid.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes, it&#x27;s unscented, and it works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, the top shelf of my computer desk reads like a medicine cabinet..</li>
            <li> More pluses include no sticky residue</li>
            <li> This is a 1/3 of the price of the clinical brand, and works just better.  </li>
            <li> ...can&#x27;t say enough great things about this!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I should have known better and just stuck with the gels</li>
            <li> Now I am finding strong stenches (fragrances are stenches to someone whose allergies are triggered by them) even in Revlon&#x27;s rouges and lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever made, hands down...</li>
            <li> This stuff gets the job done as an antiperspirant, and dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, but most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave *</li>
            <li> I then switched to the solid, great stuff but the residue sucked.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is placed in the men&#x27;s deodorant area, but I have used it for years for 3 reasons: it works great and keeps me from both sweating and stinking; it is unscented, unlike some of the women&#x27;s stinky scents; and IT DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE MARKS ON CLOTHING.</li>
            <li> WHY did they do away with a fantastic product that worked well?  </li>
            <li> You just lightly make contact w/ the skin and swipe across.</li>
            <li> I used the old Mitchum solid (unscented) for over 20 years and loved it; it was a really great product.</li>
            <li> Again, this is the best deodorant in the history of time, and yes, I&#x27;ve had a few drinks before writing this review.</li>
            <li> if it does, I hope I can get an advanced warning so I can buy a lifetime supply of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I just make sure I apply right when I get out of the shower and by the time I finish the rest of my routine</li>
            <li> the most important feature is being unscented, not many unscented deodorant in the market, very good performance  in controling sweat, congratulations</li>
            <li> After researching it and asking my doctor, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Just figure out how many you need a month and save money doing it, while you get exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> If we ever find another one like the old Mitchum Solid, we will&lt;br /&gt;be very happy!</li>
            <li> one works great, lasts a long time, has a smaller skinnier more portable container, and best of all you can really control the application better than the other &amp;#</li>
            <li> I have been using this kind of deodorant literally almost forever, and just recently the stores in my city stopped carrying this deodorant, luckily I was able to find it right away here on Amazon and ordered right away, and its just as advertised!</li>
            <li> No rash, as other reviewers experienced, no film or residue</li>
            <li> I searched the internet (Google \\&quot;mitchum deodorant scabs\\&quot;) and found that many, many people had the same problem.</li>
            <li> Works great but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> While I found it effective against perspiration and odor this summer, the new (?) formula for the \\&quot;Smart Solid\\&quot; makes it rather brittle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most deodorant irritates my skin within an hour or so of putting it on.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best antiperspirant deodorant on the market, so far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had hit a gold mine when I first purchased this product!</li>
            <li> The issue here is it applies so light and smart</li>
            <li> It is powerful.  </li>
            <li> Think about it there is perfume in laundry detergent and softener, perfume in soap, shampoo, mouthwash, toothpaste, deodorant, and everything I just want to smell like fresh air which has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li> when Sure discontinued it&#x27;s soft unscented deodorant.</li>
            <li> am so disappointedin this product and also I bought a years worth.  </li>
            <li> there was \\&quot;enough\\&quot; stench stopper coming out and even then, it&#x27;s very light and barely visible.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen anything even half as good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeps you nice and dry.</li>
            <li> The first one broke and crumbled after some use and after that it continued to break off into pieces.</li>
            <li> I opened the first one and every time I used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years, its the first one I tried that did not cause a rash.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it works for some, but just be aware that it can potentially cause a rash.</li>
            <li> However, this deodorant breaks off in chunks, sometimes almost after the first swipe, which is very costly and wasteful!</li>
            <li> I got the scented type and would rub it back and forth over and over to make sure it was covered.  </li>
            <li> It is actually unscented, unlike many products that claim to be unscented but still smell.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be switching back to Sure unscented.</li>
            <li> In the world of clinical strength, this is now my first preference.</li>
            <li> First time customer of Mitchum Revlon products:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all (literally and unfortunately), and this is still the best.</li>
            <li> Thus, I lost a good portion of it and, therefore, I consider it wasted money.</li>
            <li> In fact, the whole top broke off in one big chunk.  </li>
            <li> and what is best is it is generally half the price of other clinical strength deodorants!</li>
            <li> (Just make sure your pits or whatever else is dry)</li>
            <li> This Mitchum solid is strong, works all day and no stained shirts.</li>
            <li> Mitchum SMART solid unscented is like a super ATHLETE that comes to perform!</li>
            <li> Keep it just above the plastic rim, and you will be completely fine.</li>
            <li> It works very well, lasts all day even through outdoor rooftop work.</li>
            <li> It is because you use too much.  </li>
            <li> This one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> People are having a real problem with this formulation.</li>
            <li> and it really stops the sweating.</li>
            <li> A real shame, too, since this stick lasts much longer than implied by its 2.5 ounces.  </li>
            <li> Why do the peeps at Revlon think everybody wants to have a scent.  </li>
            <li> It worked REALLY well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this two stars because it DOES work really well.</li>
            <li> After that, no matter how gentle I was in applying it, chunks would break off and have to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> it does not hold up for a whole day, and the stick WILL break when applying it.</li>
            <li> I felt I needed to write this review for ppl who really wanted what is written on the label.</li>
            <li> My dr. gave me a prescription for xerac ac which is only available by prescription</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> you wish to avoid offending your colleagues, this product may very well help.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve found the unscented clinical strength, which is kind of irritating, but it&#x27;s nice to get a discount on it.</li>
            <li> GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA</li>
            <li> BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL STUFF AND FIRE</li>
            <li> I was dry, great underarm protection, and there was no white residue left on my clothing under my armpits.</li>
            <li> The Mitchum gel, while equally as effective, doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the stick.</li>
            <li> NONE OF THEM WERE SMART, SMART, SMART like Mitchum SMART solid unscented!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They may not have trendy advertisements showing how you can conquer the female sex with the other wood chopping brands, but this one really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant is not only SMART, it is a LIFE SAVER for you and a Bad-smell killer for bacteria!!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how I apply it - light pressure, heavier pressure, dry skin, or straight-out-of-the-shower-damp.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry, it&#x27;s not powdery, not sticky and has no annoying perfumes.</li>
            <li> This is a classic case of \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> This one is different, and is more like a solid.</li>
            <li> The Mitchum Smart Solid is not so smart it keeps breaking which ends up in the GARBAGE!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not messy like the gels they came out with, but as close to the original solid as I can find.</li>
            <li> It works more effectively than the other brands, keeping me dry and free of odor all day, and it isn&#x27;t at all irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use normal strength antiperspirant, but faced with a slew of job interviews and not wanting to show up looking...</li>
            <li> I have tried several anti-perspirants over the years with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s themagic of it and to top it off, it just takes a few strokes for all-day protection.  </li>
            <li> It just washes right off in the shower; I&#x27;m a total convert.</li>
            <li> I used to use the cream, great stuff but a little messy.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; - the New Coke of antiperspirant/deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have used another clinical brand for years, and Mitchum just got a new customer.  </li>
            <li> I see that some people are unhappy because an old formula was discontinued, and I have experienced that sadness in many other products.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great but the last four sticks I&#x27;ve purchased have all broken off before they were even halfway finished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t turn them up too high, only as high as I need to to avoid scraping my armpits with the plastic when putting it on but the deodorant itself just doesn&#x27;t hold together very well.</li>
            <li> I love it because it works, but can&#x27;t afford to purchase it again because of the waste!</li>
            <li> the only thing close to the original can only be found with stinky perfumes added.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION OF MITCHUM SOLID.</li>
            <li> I have to click 3 for the first arm and 2 for the second, every time, because after I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;warmed it</li>
            <li> I simply am not buying any more until they&#x27;ve acknowledged this problem and made a public statement via news release or in an ad that the strength of the solid stick has improved to prevent breaking.</li>
            <li> I was used to old type anti-perspirant sticks that you had to cake on just to get them to last the day, so when I first started using this stuff</li>
            <li> I figure I was able to use only half the product because of breakage.  </li>
            <li> but I would not purchase the Smart Solid (for women)again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> but when I saw the smart solid it had all the makings of the hydro stuff.</li>
            <li> Well, they need to go back to basics and quit trying to be so smart about it.</li>
            <li> I switched to Mitchum Smart Solid Unscented Anti-Perspirant about 2 years ago on the recommendation of a friend when I started breaking out in a rash with my old anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> Even though it hardly fel like I had used any, it still works better than anything I had ever tried.  </li>
            <li> This Smart Solid Clinical Performance, however, is a great disappointment and Revlon should be ashamed to sell it.</li>
            <li> It works great to prevent sweat stains, but after using it for 2 months, I got a weird brown, scab-like line rash under my left armpit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The water based deodorant goes on completely clear, and provides all day protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SENSITIVE SKINNED PEOPLE BEWARE.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant works as well as any of the clinical types but this solid is very crumbly -- I&#x27;ve had to toss pieces of it away.</li>
            <li> Count me as another person who developed a persistent underarm rash when using this anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not too far from my life.     </li>
            <li> My pits were completely arid; my clothes had no stains.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked everywhere to find the old stuff, with no luck.</li>
            <li> as you did the old stuff.</li>
            <li> I have hyperhydrosis* and also has extremely sensitive skin, this is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t screw the product up too far, as the solid is soft and it can break off if you make it too high.</li>
            <li> In fact, it prompted me to try the MITCHUM CLINICAL SOFT SOLID which is expensive, but AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deodorant with no messy white residue and this one was rated highly.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything under the sun, even all the clinical stuff which even had the same main ingredient as this one:</li>
            <li> I was not a long term user of Mitchum, though I had used it before, so for me, this is considered a &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; and I rate it on it&#x27;s merits alone as a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and have gotten multiple people converted to it after recommending they try it.</li>
            <li> Curiously, the same feature hasn&#x27;t developed on my right armpit.</li>
            <li> And I wonder how many people get headaches, rashes, mental confusion, inability to breathe, etc., and don&#x27;t realize that they actually have an allergy to perfumes, aftershaves and other scented products?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned it breaking off in chunks - the ONLY time this has ever happened to me is if I&#x27;ve rolled the stick out too far.</li>
            <li> This product works very well - keeps me dry and odor-free, no irritation problem that others have mentioned - but I will never buy it again because the stuff breaks off in big hunks.  </li>
            <li> For those coming from the old Mitchum, you have to use 1/4 or less as much of this</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it had been left on the shelf too long at the store, but I&#x27;ve gone to several stores to purchase it since then, and the same thing happens.</li>
            <li> I think the other peopel were having was just using too much of the stuff.  </li>
            <li> so I can at least get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> Prevents sweat and smell all day long in hot temps and NO white residue due to its &amp;#34;wet solid&amp;#34; formula.</li>
            <li> I almost always have sweat rings by the end of the day, even with my old clinical stuff, but with this I have dry underarms</li>
            <li> The people who complain about rashes and allergies should not be counted on for these reviews because those examples are atypical, but for the TYPICAL person, this SMART solid is a no brainer!!!  </li>
            <li> This may be because I do not store my deodorant in the oven and tend to exert a little less than my full herculean strength when applying bath products.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have a complaint about is the Smart Solid.  </li>
            <li> If you are feeling wet from the application, or getting a reaction, chances are you could/should be using far less than you&#x27;re using and far less than the old Mitchum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only one that works for me all day long.</li>
            <li> It is the tiniest bit wet for me, but not wet like the cream click up style deodorants</li>
            <li> it would break off and there was dry, crumbly, white bits under my arms.  </li>
            <li> deodorant has some kind of ugly STICKY chemical.  </li>
            <li> I used mitchum for a long time</li>
            <li> As long as I can find this product, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried that even remotely helps w/ the sweating.</li>
            <li> After reading other accounts of similar problems, I decided to switch deodorants.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is that there&#x27;s always that last little bit that you can&#x27;t use at the bottom of the stick, but nobody else seems to have solved that problem either.    </li>
            <li> I got certain-dry, arrid, Sure, Secret clinical and NONE of them work like this SMART(mitchum)!!  </li>
            <li> Other deodorants I had to apply several times a day to feel like they made any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on perfectly dry as one other review noted, but the stuff is really dry within maybe 30-60 seconds, so no big deal.  </li>
            <li> While I DO like the fact that it kept me dry and there was no residue, it kept breaking apart as I used it.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant works well and keeps you dry</li>
            <li> It leaves no residue on my clothes, is virtually scentless, and keeps me generally dry and void of offensive odors throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Goes on wet and sticky like a roll-on turning tacky then turning back wet.</li>
            <li> it earned only 2 stars because it will keep odor down for about 4 hours, thats it.</li>
            <li> this stuff feels like your walking around with wet rags under you</li>
            <li> So now they come up with this stuff that goes on wet and stays wet.  </li>
            <li> It also crumbles when you put it on and is wet</li>
            <li> The other negative reviewers obviously had an allergic reaction which is possible for practically any product.</li>
            <li> THis stuff is hard to find and it IS THE TOUGHEST deodorant out there , no wet sticky days with this stuff ..</li>
            <li> I had my lips blister and peel due to one of them.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Btw, I&#x27;m not one that sweats a ton, but I had ruined shirts due to other &amp;#34;maximum protection&amp;#34; residue.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works just as well as all the other clinicals I&#x27;ve used-- varying</li>
            <li> have had lots of breakouts and rashes from other brands, but after 3 weeks of using this no signs of any reactions to this one.</li>
            <li> This is the deodorant to have if one is physically active throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Fast forward a couple of months later: I&#x27;m still using it, but my left armpit has developed terrible brown scabs.</li>
            <li> To keep it from breaking, just take care of it by not pressing too hard and have faith you are getting enough because it is coming out</li>
            <li> There are other clinical strength deodorants out there, but they make a mess of your shirts.</li>
            <li> and I mean none since it&#x27;s water-based, you don&#x27;t have this sticky goo you have to cleanup the next morning in the shower with soap!!  </li>
            <li> I wonder how many people, reading the label that says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; in big letters, fail to check the small print and buy this stuff only to discover that they react badly to it?</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with excessive armpit sweating and could never find a product that would keep my dry until this.</li>
            <li> feels a little like a liquid band aid.</li>
            <li> But the formulation must have changed because this Mitchum product caused lines of thin black scabs to form along the creases in my left armpit.</li>
            <li> This new \\&quot;smart solid\\&quot; is terrible: my armpits feel damp and sticky from it all day (even when I&#x27;m careful to apply it to bone-dry skin), and pieces crack off all the time causing wasted product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a big box store perspective, this one is also less expensive than the other</li>
            <li> I stopped for a few years until I saw this one....</li>
            <li> That was messy and a waist of my money.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the market, then a few Rite Aid&#x27;s, now Amazon (since I can&#x27;t find it at any retail location).  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sorry for those who lost their old deodorant.</li>
            <li> I mean seriously, you can rub this stuff 3 times back and forth and then sweat all day and wake up in the morning and still have no BO.  </li>
            <li> I know how painful that is when you have a long term relationship with a product that goes away.hose who lost their old deodorant.</li>
            <li> Also, the consistency is very sticky and unpleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> read the negative reviews, and I can&#x27;t comment on this product in comparison to the previous formula.  </li>
            <li> I mean like up, down, up.  </li>
            <li> I started applying very little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum deodorant for the past 30 years.</li>

            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with this.  </li>
            <li> It usually works for 2 days for me.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t break apart like some have said unless you press it too hard.  </li>
            <li> but this product gave me a fungal infection that felt like hard scabs and was about the diameter of a quarter.</li>
            <li> IT SUCKS</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum deodorant for the past 30 years. From time to time I&#x27;ve tried another brand, only to come back to Mitchum. It works more effectively than the other brands, keeping me dry and free of odor all day, and it isn&#x27;t at all irritating to my skin. When the Clinical Performance stick was introduced I realized that what was already good has become even better. This is the deodorant to have if one is physically active throughout the day. Also, I like the stick better than the gel. The Mitchum gel, while equally as effective, doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the stick.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for years.  My mother got me using it. The only thing I have a complaint about is the Smart Solid.  I bought 2 of them.  The first one broke and crumbled after some use and after that it continued to break off into pieces. I tried the second one and after awhile it did the very same thing. I had to throw out both because they were impossible to use.  I do like Mitchum but I would not purchase the Smart Solid (for women)again.</li>
            <li> This is either very poor quality deodorant, or it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for years.  I opened the first one and every time I used it it would break off and there was dry, crumbly, white bits under my arms.  So I thought maybe it was just one bad one.  I then opened a second one and.....voila.....the same thing happened......it broke off every time I screwed it up just a fraction of an inch.  I&#x27;ll never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used mitchum for a long time then I started getting this painful, dark, bumpy rash. I stopped for a few years until I saw this one.... gave it a try and yup I was dumb sure.enough here comes to nasty bumpy rash. It is only in the crease of my underarm which is weird but I have learned my lesson to never give this brand a third try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand of deodorant out there. This is the only one that works for me all day long. There are other clinical strength deodorants out there, but they make a mess of your shirts. This Mitchum solid is strong, works all day and no stained shirts. I&#x27;ve sworn by this for years.</li>
            <li> It works great to prevent sweat stains, but after using it for 2 months, I got a weird brown, scab-like line rash under my left armpit.  After researching it and asking my doctor, I&#x27;m pretty sure the cause is the deodorant.  Others have reported getting a similar rash as well using Mitchum&#x27;s deodorant.  I&#x27;m going back to Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years, its the first one I tried that did not cause a rash.  It works very well, lasts all day even through outdoor rooftop work.</li>
            <li> great job keep up the good work....pls continue the unscented solid.....thx</li>
            <li> I loved Mitchum&#x27;s. I used to use the cream, great stuff but a little messy. I then switched to the solid, great stuff but the residue sucked. Then they came out with some Hydro or was it Hybrid protection and I LOVED IT. I guess they discontinued it but when I saw the smart solid it had all the makings of the hydro stuff. ITS NOT THE SAME. I tried this one and it made me sweat more, I know that doesnt seem to make sense but I have the sweat stains to prove it. I came home today and jumped in the shower because I was so sweaty and itchy (itchy?). Once I got out of the shower I realized my arm pits hurt and were red and swollen. IT SUCKS lol. So I threw some Gold Bond on it and did a search and here I am.   I am sure it works for some, but just be aware that it can potentially cause a rash. SENSITIVE SKINNED PEOPLE BEWARE.  Bring back the hyrdo (or whatever it was called).    -C</li>
            <li> I thought I had hit a gold mine when I first purchased this product! I was dry, great underarm protection, and there was no white residue left on my clothing under my armpits. However, this deodorant breaks off in chunks, sometimes almost after the first swipe, which is very costly and wasteful! At first, I thought it had been left on the shelf too long at the store, but I&#x27;ve gone to several stores to purchase it since then, and the same thing happens. I love it because it works, but can&#x27;t afford to purchase it again because of the waste!</li>
            <li> I have always hated sticks that mess up your t-shirts.  I hate gel because they never seem to work.  This stuff is awesome.  I noticed some people complaining that it actually caused a rash and I will admit that this has happened.  It is because you use too much.  I was used to old type anti-perspirant sticks that you had to cake on just to get them to last the day, so when I first started using this stuff I got the scented type and would rub it back and forth over and over to make sure it was covered.  I used to get a rash about once every 30 days and would have to stop using it for a week and then come back to it.  But here is the deal.  I started applying very little.  I mean like up, down, up.  3 swipes and that is it.  Even though it hardly fel like I had used any, it still works better than anything I had ever tried.  Stopped getting rashes and then switched to unscented.  I mean seriously, you can rub this stuff 3 times back and forth and then sweat all day and wake up in the morning and still have no BO.  I have never seen anything even half as good.  the problem I think the other peopel were having was just using too much of the stuff.  It is powerful.  I have been using this for about 3 years and will never use anything else.  Used to get it at Target but they stopped carrying it so here I am.</li>
            <li> This product works very well - keeps me dry and odor-free, no irritation problem that others have mentioned - but I will never buy it again because the stuff breaks off in big hunks.  Doesn&#x27;t matter how I apply it - light pressure, heavier pressure, dry skin, or straight-out-of-the-shower-damp.  I figure I was able to use only half the product because of breakage.  I&#x27;ve used Mitchum products for years - theirs are the only ones that can keep me odor-free - and I will continue to buy their products.  This Smart Solid Clinical Performance, however, is a great disappointment and Revlon should be ashamed to sell it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is placed in the men&#x27;s deodorant area, but I have used it for years for 3 reasons: it works great and keeps me from both sweating and stinking; it is unscented, unlike some of the women&#x27;s stinky scents; and IT DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE MARKS ON CLOTHING. I have tried umpteen deodorants that claim to not leave white marks, but do. This one is the real deal. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I freaked out when I could no longer find this in the stores.  I am a woman, and this is the only deoderant I like.  I have tried many!  It is actually unscented, unlike many products that claim to be unscented but still smell.  And it works.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great but the last four sticks I&#x27;ve purchased have all broken off before they were even halfway finished. I don&#x27;t turn them up too high, only as high as I need to to avoid scraping my armpits with the plastic when putting it on but the deodorant itself just doesn&#x27;t hold together very well.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for my girlfriend and we can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the performance of Mitchum. The deodorant works as well as any of the clinical types but this solid is very crumbly -- I&#x27;ve had to toss pieces of it away. As I have rolled it up chunks have broken off and can&#x27;t be used. I won&#x27;t ever buy this solid variety again... I&#x27;d rather use the roll on so I can at least get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> Read the ingredient list, it says \\&quot;parfum\\&quot;. That&#x27;s French for perfume. That means it contains the scent to which so many of us are allergic. I wonder how many people, reading the label that says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; in big letters, fail to check the small print and buy this stuff only to discover that they react badly to it? And I wonder how many people get headaches, rashes, mental confusion, inability to breathe, etc., and don&#x27;t realize that they actually have an allergy to perfumes, aftershaves and other scented products?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revlon, the maker of Mitchum deodorant/antiperspirant, used to be an excellent company. But across the board they have started messing with products that used to be reliable. How foolish. And how very inconvenient for those of us who thought we had figured out what worked for us. Now I am finding strong stenches (fragrances are stenches to someone whose allergies are triggered by them) even in Revlon&#x27;s rouges and lipsticks. I had my lips blister and peel due to one of them. Now they mark a deodorant that contains the effective ingredient I&#x27;m looking for, Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly, \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; when in fact it contains fragrance. Maybe I should call the FDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revlon, why don&#x27;t you simply return to making the liquid roll-on that contains Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly and leave out the scent? Read the other reviews. People are having a real problem with this formulation.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is buy far the best.  No white residue or gel globs under your arm.  You can tell when you are wearing it, land it is effective all day.  No sweat no smell.</li>
            <li> I was swear a lot and it really stops the sweating. It&#x27;s keeps you nice and dry. It also has no scent to it which is great</li>
            <li> This stuff gets the job done as an antiperspirant, and dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, but most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave *any* kind of waxy residue in your pits, because it&#x27;s water-based. It just washes right off in the shower; I&#x27;m a total convert.</li>
            <li> This solid stick has the consistency of egg whites. I had to throw it away after my 2nd use because application torn the \\&quot;solid\\&quot; apart. Also didn&#x27;t find it to be effective with perspiration.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever made, hands down...but unfortunately, Mitchum has decided to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; their deodorant and repackage it. Well, they need to go back to basics and quit trying to be so smart about it. This SmartSolid unscented is the best they ever made, so I&#x27;m buying it up wherever I see it.</li>
            <li> Count me as another person who developed a persistent underarm rash when using this anti-perspirant.  A real shame, too, since this stick lasts much longer than implied by its 2.5 ounces.  It lasted me 3 months.  But don&#x27;t like the rash so I&#x27;ll be switching back to Sure unscented.</li>
            <li> Goes on wet and sticky like a roll-on turning tacky then turning back wet. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with wetness under my arms but this stuff feels like your walking around with wet rags under you pits all day. GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA YOU MORONS!!! IT&#x27;S OBVIOUS NOBODY LIKES THIS CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> WHY did they do away with a fantastic product that worked well?  The original that&#x27;s been around for decades did NOT stain clothes and was great.  So now they come up with this stuff that goes on wet and stays wet.  WTH  the only thing close to the original can only be found with stinky perfumes added.  Why do the peeps at Revlon think everybody wants to have a scent.  I prefer not have any smell at all.  I don&#x27;t want people to know where I&#x27;ve been or that I am coming before I get there with the perfumes added to everything.  Think about it there is perfume in laundry detergent and softener, perfume in soap, shampoo, mouthwash, toothpaste, deodorant, and everything I just want to smell like fresh air which has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL STUFF AND FIRE THE NUMSKULL THAT DID AWAY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> My sweating is unstoppable. Those commercials where the guy lifts his arms and a hydrant sprays out? That&#x27;s not too far from my life.     I used to use normal strength antiperspirant, but faced with a slew of job interviews and not wanting to show up looking... moist... I picked up a stick of Mitchum SmartSolid. It worked REALLY well. My pits were completely arid; my clothes had no stains. I fell in love.    Fast forward a couple of months later: I&#x27;m still using it, but my left armpit has developed terrible brown scabs. Curiously, the same feature hasn&#x27;t developed on my right armpit. I searched the internet (Google \\&quot;mitchum deodorant scabs\\&quot;) and found that many, many people had the same problem. Several have contact the company, which does not seem to care. I&#x27;ve immediately stopped using this product.     I&#x27;m giving this two stars because it DOES work really well. But I&#x27;m concerned about these potentially hazardous side effects. Are the scabs harmful? Dangerous? I can&#x27;t recommend this antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Not messy like the gels they came out with, but as close to the original solid as I can find.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great for me.  It&#x27;s unscented, which I love, and is great for me.  I have very sensitive skin and most deodorant irritates my skin within an hour or so of putting it on.  I&#x27;ve never had that issue with Mitchum.  On top of that, it is a very effective anti-perspirant.  I have no sweating problems with it.  I&#x27;m very glad I made the switch from Sure to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female, and this is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used for years now. It is the absolute best deodorant I have found. Prevents sweat and smell all day long in hot temps and NO white residue due to its &amp;#34;wet solid&amp;#34; formula. The other negative reviewers obviously had an allergic reaction which is possible for practically any product. 99% of people will not have this problem. Another reviewer mentioned it breaking off in chunks - the ONLY time this has ever happened to me is if I&#x27;ve rolled the stick out too far. Keep it just above the plastic rim, and you will be completely fine. I highly recommend this product, and have gotten multiple people converted to it after recommending they try it. A+</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deodorant with no messy white residue and this one was rated highly.  While I DO like the fact that it kept me dry and there was no residue, it kept breaking apart as I used it. In fact, the whole top broke off in one big chunk.  After that, no matter how gentle I was in applying it, chunks would break off and have to be thrown away. So annoying!</li>
            <li> No residue, no more underarm stains, no more pit-stained expensive name-brand t-shirts. Tried ALL others before this one after  ruining pricey t-shirts. Been using it for months, haven&#x27;t seen ANY crumbling/breaking apart(like others mentioned). You don&#x27;t apply pressure when using it. You just lightly make contact w/ the skin and swipe across. Btw, I&#x27;m not one that sweats a ton, but I had ruined shirts due to other &amp;#34;maximum protection&amp;#34; residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kind of deodorant literally almost forever, and just recently the stores in my city stopped carrying this deodorant, luckily I was able to find it right away here on Amazon and ordered right away, and its just as advertised! I would recommend to anyone who likes mitchum.</li>
            <li> I changed over to this when Sure discontinued it&#x27;s soft unscented deodorant. This has been a great replacement.</li>
            <li> This thing costs $16 dollars??  What is it made out of??&lt;br /&gt;This is the nastiest deodorant i have ever used.  When i put it on it feels like i just put GLUE on my arm pets.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant has some kind of ugly STICKY chemical.  it is just terrible.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I even gave them away to find out this didn&#x27;t work for others either.</li>
            <li> I have tried several anti-perspirants over the years with varying degrees of success.  I switched to Mitchum Smart Solid Unscented Anti-Perspirant about 2 years ago on the recommendation of a friend when I started breaking out in a rash with my old anti-perspirant.  A couple days after switching, my rash disappeared and I was experiencing unmatched odor and wetness protection.  Why the local Wal-Mart stopped carrying it is beyond me - must be trying to make shelf space for some more of the cheaper stuff.  As long as I can find this product, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant but I stopped ordering it because it always seems to break into small chunks.</li>
            <li> This is good deodorant and it worked well for me, the problem I kept having was it would break off halfway through. It&#x27;s really annoying! I  bought several of these and they kept breaking off. I switched to a different Mitchum deodorant and I have had no problems since.</li>
            <li> Mitchim SmartSolid C.P. did not preform well it does not hold up for a whole day, and the stick WILL break when applying it. This happened with two sticks. That was messy and a waist of my money. I felt I needed to write this review for ppl who really wanted what is written on the label. it earned only 2 stars because it will keep odor down for about 4 hours, thats it.</li>
            <li> Best antipersperant on the market.  I used to buy this at the market, then a few Rite Aid&#x27;s, now Amazon (since I can&#x27;t find it at any retail location).  Great at stopping sweat and body odor.</li>
            <li> Great product, but it&#x27;s not built for all day performance, at least for me.  Mitchum makes better deoderant products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have been very satisfied with the results. Keeps me dry, it&#x27;s not powdery, not sticky and has no annoying perfumes.</li>
            <li> I switched from regular deodorant to Mitchum 2 years back to avoid breaking out from the things in regular deodorants. I was using a different one for awhile but saw this one and decided to try it out. Literally after one day both of my armpits have giant rashes all over and it&#x27;s terrible. Probably going to avoid Mitchum all together for awhile now.</li>
            <li> excellent service and product. For some reason the stores around here don&#x27;t carry &#x27;unscented&#x27;. I&#x27;ll order again</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum off and on for years and never had a problem with it. But the formulation must have changed because this Mitchum product caused lines of thin black scabs to form along the creases in my left armpit. After reading other accounts of similar problems, I decided to switch deodorants. Within three weeks, the scabs were gone. I&#x27;ll never buy Mitchum again.</li>
            <li> I used the old Mitchum solid (unscented) for over 20 years and loved it; it was a really great product. This new \\&quot;smart solid\\&quot; is terrible: my armpits feel damp and sticky from it all day (even when I&#x27;m careful to apply it to bone-dry skin), and pieces crack off all the time causing wasted product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked everywhere to find the old stuff, with no luck. This is a classic case of \\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; - the New Coke of antiperspirant/deodorants. I will be switching brands with my next purchase. PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION OF MITCHUM SOLID.</li>
            <li> I sweat horribly, but only under my arms. My dr. gave me a prescription for xerac ac which is only available by prescription and it didnt stop me from sweating. I decided I would try mitchum clinical because i was so embarrassed and desperate. I had tried degree clinical before and it didnt work. this product works! and what is best is it is generally half the price of other clinical strength deodorants!</li>
            <li> In the world of clinical strength, this is now my first preference. I see that some people are unhappy because an old formula was discontinued, and I have experienced that sadness in many other products. I was not a long term user of Mitchum, though I had used it before, so for me, this is considered a &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; and I rate it on it&#x27;s merits alone as a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other brands of clinical strength seem to mostly apply in a click cream, that comes out of the top of the container in a grid. This one is different, and is more like a solid. This deodorant works just as well as all the other clinicals I&#x27;ve used-- varying brands-- but what I prefer about this one is that it is in a goes-on-clear solid. It is the tiniest bit wet for me, but not wet like the cream click up style deodorants are, which is all clinicals that I&#x27;ve tried up to now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works great, lasts a long time, has a smaller skinnier more portable container, and best of all you can really control the application better than the other &amp;#34;click up&amp;#34; clinicals. The others don&#x27;t click up in equal proportions. I have to click 3 for the first arm and 2 for the second, every time, because after I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;warmed it up&amp;#34; 3-2 combination is how I get the equal amount on each arm. Annoying and strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one literally can take one swipe up or down your arm, maybe two if you&#x27;re feeling insecure.  For those coming from the old Mitchum, you have to use 1/4 or less as much of this as you did the old stuff. It takes literally nothing. If you are feeling wet from the application, or getting a reaction, chances are you could/should be using far less than you&#x27;re using and far less than the old Mitchum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a big box store perspective, this one is also less expensive than the other clinicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no inhibitions recommending this one if you&#x27;re using another clinical and don&#x27;t like the price, smell, or application texture. And I&#x27;m sorry for those who lost their old deodorant. I know how painful that is when you have a long term relationship with a product that goes away.hose who lost their old deodorant. I know how painful that is when you have a long term relationship with a product that goes away.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best deodorant that&#x27;s ever been made.  If deodorants hand &#x27;generations&#x27; like computers and cell phones and such, this would be ten generations ahead of anything else out there.  It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes, it&#x27;s unscented, and it works flawlessly.  The only thing I would change is that there&#x27;s always that last little bit that you can&#x27;t use at the bottom of the stick, but nobody else seems to have solved that problem either.    Again, this is the best deodorant in the history of time, and yes, I&#x27;ve had a few drinks before writing this review.</li>
            <li> Never have to go to the store for deodorant again or run out! Just figure out how many you need a month and save money doing it, while you get exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> This product needs rethinking by Revlon. While I found it effective against perspiration and odor this summer, the new (?) formula for the \\&quot;Smart Solid\\&quot; makes it rather brittle. I&#x27;ve had two sticks in a row break off as I applied it. Thus, I lost a good portion of it and, therefore, I consider it wasted money. Breaking once might be a fluke; twice is once too often and indicates a manufacturing or formula fault. I am contacting Revlon and voicing my dissatisfaction. I am NOT looking for \\&quot;money-off\\&quot; coupons. I simply am not buying any more until they&#x27;ve acknowledged this problem and made a public statement via news release or in an ad that the strength of the solid stick has improved to prevent breaking.</li>
            <li> Mitchum Clinical Strength deodorant has provided with the potency required to fend off body odor and sweating consistently.&lt;br /&gt;They may not have trendy advertisements showing how you can conquer the female sex with the other wood chopping brands, but this one really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with this.  I purchased a (4?) pack here on Amazon and it&#x27;s not the same as what I would buy in the store.  I discontinued using it.  In fact, it prompted me to try the MITCHUM CLINICAL SOFT SOLID which is expensive, but AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This had been my go to deodorant for about for years and it&#x27;s awesome that I can buy online now. I used to have problems with excessive armpit sweating and could never find a product that would keep my dry until this. The fact that it doesnt stain is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> THis stuff is hard to find and it IS THE TOUGHEST deodorant out there , no wet sticky days with this stuff .. 5stars for being a bad A#*</li>
            <li> the most important feature is being unscented, not many unscented deodorant in the market, very good performance  in controling sweat, congratulations</li>
            <li> First time customer of Mitchum Revlon products: 5-star product and I&#x27;m 5-star, two thumbs up IMPRESSED!  Let me tell you, the top shelf of my computer desk reads like a medicine cabinet..I got certain-dry, arrid, Sure, Secret clinical and NONE of them work like this SMART(mitchum)!!  NOT ONE PEOPLE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ANTIPERSPIRANT SAVED MY LIFE!!  It stopped the ODOR which was causing allergies.  I tried everything under the sun, even all the clinical stuff which even had the same main ingredient as this one: Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly.  NONE OF THEM WERE SMART, SMART, SMART like Mitchum SMART solid unscented!  This antiperspirant is not only SMART, it is a LIFE SAVER for you and a Bad-smell killer for bacteria!!  You dont even have to be a micro-biologist to reap its rewards!! Mitchum SMART solid unscented is like a super ATHLETE that comes to perform! It does it CROSS-TRAINER style because it&#x27;s a solid but kinda feels like a quasi or \\&quot;half\\&quot; roll-on but DRIES INSTANTLY!!  (Just make sure your pits or whatever else is dry) Man, does it stop the ODOR.  I hope my bacteria doesn&#x27;t adjust to it but if it doesn&#x27;t, I am a CUSTOMER for life.  WTH, I am already a customer for LIFE!  I hope I  don&#x27;t have to worry about it being discontinued EVER and if it does, I hope I can get an advanced warning so I can buy a lifetime supply of this stuff.  I will buy stock in the company if I have to!  More pluses include no sticky residue and I mean none since it&#x27;s water-based, you don&#x27;t have this sticky goo you have to cleanup the next morning in the shower with soap!!  I don&#x27;t know what some others are talking about, it doesn&#x27;t break apart like some have said unless you press it too hard.  The issue here is it applies so light and smart, it feels like nothing is actually coming out and you&#x27;re not getting enough. I had to put some on my fingers just to prove my mind there was \\&quot;enough\\&quot; stench stopper coming out and even then, it&#x27;s very light and barely visible.  That&#x27;s themagic of it and to top it off, it just takes a few strokes for all-day protection.  To keep it from breaking, just take care of it by not pressing too hard and have faith you are getting enough because it is coming out and it is protecting you!!  It is unscented so I don&#x27;t know why some here are saying it has a perfume odor, I don&#x27;t smell crap! *no pun intended* because it keeps you from smelling like crap!  The people who complain about rashes and allergies should not be counted on for these reviews because those examples are atypical, but for the TYPICAL person, this SMART solid is a no brainer!!!  *no pun intended*!  Revlon hit a home-run!  And knocked out my body-odor! I&#x27;m definitely a MITCH_\\&quot;CHUM\\&quot; for life haha lol</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant works well and keeps you dry but it feels a bit sticky. The best way to describe it is after you put the antiperspirant on it feels a little like a liquid band aid. It also crumbles when you put it on and is wet so you can&#x27;t put a shirt on immediately after putting on the antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I have used another clinical brand for years, and Mitchum just got a new customer.  This is a 1/3 of the price of the clinical brand, and works just better.  It does have a kind of sticky, bordering on glue like, consistancy.  I just make sure I apply right when I get out of the shower and by the time I finish the rest of my routine it has dried and ready to go.  I almost always have sweat rings by the end of the day, even with my old clinical stuff, but with this I have dry underarms all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had lots of breakouts and rashes from other brands, but after 3 weeks of using this no signs of any reactions to this one.</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum for years.  They do not sell the Mitchum I use to buy and had to buy this.  This is aweful.  It breaks each time I use it and I have crumbles of deodorant all over my floor and yes I must say, it does NOT keep me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointedin this product and also I bought a years worth.  Why can&#x27;t companies just leave a good product alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbie</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best antiperspirant deodorant on the market, so far as I can tell.  It leaves no residue on my clothes, is virtually scentless, and keeps me generally dry and void of offensive odors throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews, and I can&#x27;t comment on this product in comparison to the previous formula.  However, I can say that I did not have problems with it crumbling.  This may be because I do not store my deodorant in the oven and tend to exert a little less than my full herculean strength when applying bath products.  Should crumbling issues arise in the future, I will amend my review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wish to avoid offending your colleagues, this product may very well help.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Mitchum Smart Solid is not so smart it keeps breaking which ends up in the GARBAGE! Works great but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Considering this deodorant is made by Mitchum&#x27;s, I was really disappointed. The deodorant itself cracked and broke off in pieces after just a month. Also, the consistency is very sticky and unpleasant to apply. I&#x27;d never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be fading in strength and &amp;#34;feel.&amp;#34; No longer use.</li>
            <li> We bought this on Maui while visiting my family...got back to WA &amp; it was impossible to find...Amazon to the rescue!!!! Love love LOVE this product!! No rash, as other reviewers experienced, no film or residue...can&#x27;t say enough great things about this!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It usually works for 2 days for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this product at all.  Its slimy and breaks apart repeatedly and chunks fall on the floor.  My husband and I&lt;br /&gt;both used the Unscented Mitchum Solid for ten years and now we can&#x27;t find it.  It seems all the deoderants are going to&lt;br /&gt;super scented gel type sticks which are not what we want.  If we ever find another one like the old Mitchum Solid, we will&lt;br /&gt;be very happy!</li>
            <li> As someone who sweats a lot *I have hyperhydrosis* and also has extremely sensitive skin, this is a miracle product. It&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried that even remotely helps w/ the sweating. I only use it once a day, and that&#x27;s plenty. Other deodorants I had to apply several times a day to feel like they made any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water based deodorant goes on completely clear, and provides all day protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve found the unscented clinical strength, which is kind of irritating, but it&#x27;s nice to get a discount on it. And buying as a 4 pack saves me from ordering it all the time. I definitely recommend this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Junk unworthy of the Mitchum name.  I am returning my purchase.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible! It caused me to have terrible red bumpy rash the same day and my arm pits are still itchy and painful 3 days later! I will NEVER try this product again. It made my life miserable for 3 days now. Besides that, it caused my arm pits to sweat even more!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> Very good. Beats gel.</li>
            <li> no white or sweat patches but chunks break off the stick</li>
            <li> I like this because it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. I bought a different brand and it stained my polo shirts which are now ruined.</li>
            <li> I got tired of heavy fragrance deodorants and tried this one out.  It doesn&#x27;t go on perfectly dry as one other review noted, but the stuff is really dry within maybe 30-60 seconds, so no big deal.  There is almost no detectable odor, and you almost can&#x27;t perceive by feel that you&#x27;re wearing it.  I almost inadvertently go re-apply it from time to time because I can&#x27;t recall if I&#x27;ve used it yet or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like deodorant that doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t gunk up the armpits of your clothes, and yet work as you want it to, and this is the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> sadly- this is my second try with this stick.  While the deodrnt works well you lose 1/2 the product with use as it just sort of crumbles when you apply it.  Done trying with this one</li>
            <li> I should have known better and just stuck with the gels but we had some of this and I use the gels for when I&#x27;m traveling abroad (and didn&#x27;t want to use up all of the 3oz containers while at home) but this product gave me a fungal infection that felt like hard scabs and was about the diameter of a quarter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all (literally and unfortunately), and this is still the best. Just don&#x27;t screw the product up too far, as the solid is soft and it can break off if you make it too high.</li>
