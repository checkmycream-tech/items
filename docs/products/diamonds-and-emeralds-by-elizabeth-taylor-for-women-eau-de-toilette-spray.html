            <li>All of Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s products for men and women are excellent, plus an extra benefit is that a portion of the profits of each sale goes to further AIDS research and treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>She recommends it to everyone who loves the original White Diamonds.</li>
            <li>VERY OLD PERFUME.  </li>
            <li>actually put some of this product on myself (even though I am a guy) to test it and notice it isn&#x27;t overpowering like many other perfumes and colognes.  </li>
            <li>It has a floral fragrance little strong though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recomend this fragance for girls 20 years old and over, my husband and my lil one loves it...</li>
            <li>and I am under 30 years old.</li>
            <li>White was around before I was born and it continues to live up to its name</li>

            <li> This is the sweeter one of all of the Elizabeth Taylor Diamond perfumes. I love this one the most and I am under 30 years old. It&#x27;s really sweet &amp; powdery and smells fresh and pretty. This is the special occasion perfume :)</li>
            <li> Good one. It has a floral fragrance little strong though. Vintage collection. It is good to have one. Can try.</li>
