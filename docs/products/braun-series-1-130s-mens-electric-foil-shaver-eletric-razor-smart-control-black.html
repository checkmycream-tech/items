            <li>I have been using it for about a month and am happy with it.</li>
            <li>so I figured this was a great time to try one out.</li>
            <li>Great plug-in shaver.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and works great</li>
            <li>My shaver work&#x27;s great</li>

            <li>If cords do not bother you, then great value for this item without the additional price for the battery operated one.</li>

            <li>and I personly think this is a great product everything on it works great</li>
            <li>Great shavers for the price.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a great aspect for the shaver.</li>
            <li>Also, I have experienced no razor burn with this shaver with either foil.  </li>
            <li>These work great overseas too, automatically adjusting to the voltage without having to use a transformer...just a country-specific plug.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 130s was a welcome change.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver is great and has to be the best of its kind.  </li>
            <li>It was a good shave- not the best of my life -but good.</li>
            <li>It shaved smooth and close I truly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice shaver with one exception.</li>
            <li>it is very nice.</li>
            <li>brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nicely made product</li>
            <li>I do love the trimmer that&#x27;sthe best part.</li>
            <li>It takes me about two minutes more to shave with these than my Remingtons, but they do an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>And even then, I had to go over it with a razor afterward to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets fairly close.</li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed with the fit and finish of the shaver.</li>
            <li>have never used an electric razor before so thought it would be a good opportunity to see what it is like to use one.  </li>
            <li>good feature is the built in trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It was a good shave, and fulfilled its purpose.</li>
            <li>But I believe this does as good a job of shaving as anything I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(15) had great results and liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are looking for an electric for a beginner to shaving this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you are looking for that already grown in look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard good things about Braun&#x27;s razors</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good performer.</li>
            <li>Power cord needs to is not attached good to the machine</li>
            <li>It gave a really surprising close shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li>Thats about all the good I have to say regarding this model.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor free to review and have to say I&#x27;m fairly impressed.</li>
            <li>So Trying out the electric razor seemed like a good plan since it would help with having to always be re-buying the cartridges for razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works well and fairly priced.</li>
            <li>Good shaver does the job.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer also worked good for my sideburns and hair around my ears.</li>
            <li>I also used this to trim my body hair and it did a good job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave really good.</li>
            <li>Now that I have tried it I am so happy and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Works great and glad it doesn&#x27;t need batteries.  </li>
            <li>My impressions: light weight and feels real nice when shaving</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I think it works best when you DON&#x27;T wash your face first</li>
            <li>It gave me a pretty close shave that worked perfect with the style I like to keep.</li>
            <li>Braun includes oil with this, but I greatly prefer spray lubricant that is available in just about any razor department.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if the razor was amazing...</li>
            <li>Honestly it does the job.</li>
            <li>This opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li>I own a cordless rotary shaver</li>
            <li>I received this product from the brand in return for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice if I could shave over the hair once</li>
            <li>Not terrible, I prefer a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a nice inexpensive option that gives me what i need.  </li>
            <li>It provides a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>They sent me the razor and to be honest</li>
            <li>It gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>my bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I liked about the razor was the sleek design.</li>
            <li>it looks like a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is nice and easy to pick up and go (with a cord) but takes quite a while to get a good shave with it compared to not electric blades.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and are looking for a nice budget razor this is a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li>It did a good job and was easy for him to use.</li>
            <li>Super value at a great price.</li>
            <li>The price, though I got this shaver for free to review, I think this is a good price-point for this shaver.    </li>
            <li>This is a good cheap razor for a beginner.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a cheap, inexpensive shaver this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>opened this thing up and discovered it’s extremely light, which is good if you travel</li>
            <li>It is nice and helpful, even though most shavers have a washable feature.    </li>
            <li>The shaver does a good job on the areas of my face where I do not want my beard to grow.&lt;br /&gt;The feature to be able to run the shaver under warm water to clean</li>
            <li>The best thing about this razor is that it comes apart quickly and easily for cleaning right under the faucet!  </li>
            <li>Braun sent this to me as a promotion, and it&#x27;s great for exactly what it&#x27;s advertised for,</li>
            <li>The first couple of shaves were great.</li>
            <li>Although it is nice that it is easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>It was quick, and got surprisingly close.</li>
            <li>so I can get away with not shaving as much, this shaver is perfect for those quick shaves between beard trimmings and/or shower shaves with a blade razor.    </li>
            <li>, I can feel it roll all over the contours of my face and neck, it was real easy to clean, compared to the entry level Norelco, it did a better job.</li>
            <li>Received this from the brand and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>For an electric razor, it&#x27;s actually the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>i rent to keep it plugged since it has more power that way</li>
            <li>I received it as a promotion from the company and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it</li>
            <li>, it does an okay job shaving my face</li>
            <li>I think it is an okay shaver for the money, fix the issue with the cord falling out</li>
            <li>but you are better off with  trying something else.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was impressed ith the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than using my razor.</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one thing I love about</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m glad I did not pay for this razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely my favorite razor ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I was impressed that it actually came with oil!</li>
            <li>I have had many electric razors and none of them have come with the oil that is supposed to be used with the razor to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this razor is more intended for boys than girls, but I had her use it anyways.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have room for the AC plug.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li>The M-60 shaves better.  </li>
            <li>It just stubbornly refused to cut many of the hairs even after working that area repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their shavers for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>: Got it free from BzzzAgent, but my review is my own.</li>
            <li>Work really good is easy,light and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>received this shaver for free form BzzAgent in lieu of providing an honest review.</li>
            <li>Most shavers are recharge battery powered that will need replacing.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you spend more you could get a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love it.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s the best in it&#x27;s category and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>, as I mentioned, is it taking a couple of minutes more than the Remington.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I got this free from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than having to buy disposables and gets the job</li>
            <li>The longer they get, the lower the chance it can cut them, even if you go over the spot many times in many directions.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades cost more than that.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the washable feature though.</li>
            <li>I give this shaver four stars because I&#x27;m overall impressed with it.</li>
            <li>but it sure beats waiting for a cordless to charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably a great razor for a high school kid who is just learning how to shave and who&#x27;s family doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good</li>
            <li>The new foil is great and helps pick up all the troublesome whiskers.</li>
            <li>is quick, and seems to be popular</li>
            <li>This shaver did an okay job of removing hair without pulling, it comes apart easily for cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A last note, the trimmer feature is handy and works great.</li>
            <li>My nephew who has softer facial hair tried it and found it to be very good for his hair type.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I received this for free as opposed to spending money on the product.</li>
            <li>But it works great so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done a really good job of giving me a really close shave.</li>
            <li>a great first shaver(printed right on the box).</li>
            <li>Not bad!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean as you can just pop the top off and run it under the tap.  </li>
            <li>As one user stated the cord does seem to pop out of this rather easily; one solution to that is a dab of silicon glue.  </li>
            <li>This is to ensure that you&#x27;re getting an easy shave.</li>
            <li>I figured with Amazon its so easy to replace it</li>
            <li>The cord easily falls out.</li>
            <li>It was easy to keep my neck line trimmed with it.</li>
            <li>Cord falls out easily when using this shaver, takes way longer to shave with this as compared to a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy Peazy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a fast and easy way to keep myself clean shaven and looking good for work.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and has a liquid cleaning system, but I found it shaves the same, for me, as this $20 model...and eventually, the 9095cc will have to have its battery replaced.  </li>
            <li>I wasn’t overly impressed by the ability of the shaver to provide a clean shave with minimal effort or time.</li>
            <li>The shaver was detailed, and worked about as good as a high price electric shaver.</li>
            <li>the beard trimmer seems to work fine...</li>
            <li>I tested out this shaver a half dozen times before deciding it is best used as a backup shaver.  </li>
            <li>it is light and easy to use</li>
            <li>it is light and so easy to use that it makes me wonder why I had not been using one before now.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with it overall.</li>
            <li>the shaver would be fine but for the every day shaver i would not recommend it</li>
            <li>It helps to remove hairs more quickly than the tradition</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun 130S Smart Control Shaver from the manufacturer as part of a promotional offer that gives you the opportunity to try the razor and provide honest feedback about your experience.</li>
            <li>returned this shaver and am switching to cheap razors.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face really smooth.</li>
            <li>I have to say I like the precision attachment for precise trims.</li>
            <li>The package and everything was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I do find that I have to go over my skin twice, to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Pros are: size, convenience, clipper, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I received this shaver free from Braun to try and give my opinion on as part of a word of mouth campaign.  </li>
            <li>Works best if you prefer to shave everyday vs letting you face grow out.  </li>
            <li>I like the foil head which was comfortable, but the lack of speed is a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer on the back works great though, and</li>
            <li>The razor cuts smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li>Easy for him to take apart and clean too.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun 130s Shaver to try for free in exchange for a review, but all opinions in this review are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received my Braun 130 free to try and review.</li>
            <li>Because it does not attach to the shaver securely it continuously disconnected itself.  </li>
            <li>but I thought hey I will try it since it was free.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and i gave this one a shot i got it or free in return for this review, and ater using it for two weeks</li>
            <li>I got this through a free program.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as a free product to test and review all in all it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The Remingtons are still available on Amazon by the way as of today (1/15/16).  </li>
            <li>I loves thats it trims and gives you a close shave thank you Braun for let me try this for free</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to persons with a light beard growth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I got this product free from Braun)</li>
            <li>like I got slap-chopped by an NFL linebacker, or will this thing deliver a smooth, painless shave without the afterburn?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i did not find the braun to provide a great shave either - pehaps it takes some getting used to, which was not going to happen with the short cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the Braun 130 for free to try and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun just bought themselves a life-long Customer with such a Great Product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my head moderately smooth for a shaver.</li>
            <li>It does not provide a close smooth shave and also pulled the hair often.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Still not as smooth as a blade razor, but very nice for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to clean, lightweight, easy to manuever.  </li>
            <li>Overall a very nice product, just not for me.</li>
            <li>The shaver is great for younger gentleman reaching that special time of life, and I appreciate the fact that the razor is corded.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>gives a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I also purchased, on Amazon, two brand new Remington Microscreen DA-57 cord only electric shavers that are superb.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver for quick convenient shaves when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time or when shaving outside the shower.  </li>
            <li>The razor feels good in your hand and is comfortable to use, much more comfortable than the other electric razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Obviously a higher class Braun razor is going to be better</li>
            <li>change the original rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One is the original round-hole design.  </li>
            <li>I used this razor for the past two weeks and would best describe it as a beginners or entry level electric razor.    </li>
            <li>After getting the 130s in the mail I was quite excited.</li>
            <li>It was my first electric razor which so I wasn&#x27;t sure if i was just me</li>
            <li>i work a job that requires me to be clean shaven and hygienic</li>
            <li>like how you can clean this one by rinsing it with water,</li>
            <li>I like how you can wash it off to clean it.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a snap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for most my adult life until I received this Braun electric shaver from BzzAgent,and I  truly love using it.</li>
            <li>However, these Brauns (of which I bought 4) are outstanding value, high quality, strong warranty, and work worldwide.  </li>
            <li>I love my Braun smart control 130s.</li>
            <li>Braun is a great brand and this isn&#x27;t my first time using their brand, won&#x27;t be the last either.</li>
            <li>I received this shaver as a promotion from the company, and it was a good product overall.</li>
            <li>I got this razor through a promotion with Braun and BzzAgent, Overall it is a good beginner</li>
            <li>good out of my expect， somebody said it low power to shave</li>
            <li>responds weakly to a full cut.  </li>
            <li>Used it several times with good results..</li>
            <li>For a person who is just starting to shave this is a good piece.  </li>
            <li>it got a close shave and left my face feeling good with no irritation like a standerd razor</li>
            <li>Overall the shaver is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll for me, I can grow a full beard and the razor</li>
            <li>Recently,I picked up a Braun 130-S (corded only) for just $29.95 and it shaves just as good and</li>
            <li>Most of the time I just ended up busting out the straight razor....</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good razor</li>
            <li>but good enough to be rated as a pro rather than a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Full Disclosure, I received this product from the manufacturer as part of a test /</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it’s not a bad razor.  </li>
            <li>I was so lucky to be able to try the Braun 130S straight from the Braun manufactory.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great razor for a young man starting to shave (probably 5 star- great value, good product, seems well made and will last).  </li>
            <li>Other than that - it is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>head has excellent movement and the screen has very small micro holes eliminating alot of the &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; that you might get with some of the 3 head razors that have longer slots in the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think this no frills razor would be perfect for a teen who is just starting to shave.  </li>
            <li>Stick with a regular razor or spend the money to invest one of their better models, which are hopefully better products.</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun for such a great product.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t cut the hair on your face, but every now and then if you are lucky it will pull some of the hair out for you.</li>
            <li>Unless I need a super close shave, I&#x27;ll pick up the 130s before</li>
            <li>It does shave and get in pretty close, and the price is quite cheap.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suspect these pure electric shavers will outlast their two-year warranty.  </li>
            <li>I get razor burn extremely easy and was ready to test this \\&quot;foil\\&quot; style razor.</li>
            <li>For the life of me, I can&#x27;t think of a single reason why this is good.  </li>
            <li>It cuts clean, no Irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Included mini-brush, to keep the Razor clean, and ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Corded</li>
            <li>I got the Braun Smart Control Shaver 130 S from Braun for free.</li>
            <li>I received a Braun Smart Control 130s-1 Shaver free from the company to test and review.</li>
            <li>Great little corded razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a very thick beard and even though this was the best and closest shave of them all, it still took quite a while.</li>
            <li>I find it quite useful still.</li>
            <li>It did well on armpits, and ok on her legs but is clearly designed for the flatter surface of a face than the rounded surface of legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have yet to be able to complete one shave without having the cord &amp;#34;pull out&amp;#34; of the shaver.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to pay even the $30 for this, the cheapest of Braun shavers, but I figured brand name must be worth it.</li>
            <li>with that being said its a pretty good shaver besides that minor deault</li>
            <li>This product is great for a teen or young man.</li>
            <li>Very simple and effective design.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to clean and spray my razor at least once a week; it keeps it running nice and</li>
            <li>good feature of the the Smart Control shaver is that the shaved hair stays in the shaver (the old Braun leaked shaved hair even when it was new).</li>
            <li>But once I let my beard grow out a little more this became more of a project then a quick task...</li>
            <li>It just pushes right up into place.</li>
            <li>and he saw much better results and a nice close shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li>The fact i can rinse it under running water makes for a much easier clean up as well.</li>
            <li>like being able to clean the razor by running it under hot water, no doubt a benefit of the low voltage.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to use but the shave is just as smooth as it was with the blade.  </li>
            <li>I personally use a Double edge razor and I have great success with it.</li>
            <li>have a full beard and really like the trimmer attachment on the shaver.</li>
            <li>Probably best for those that keep little to no facial hair.</li>
            <li>My advice: save a little more money and go for a better version.</li>
            <li>but this one will do the job for a new shaver or someone with light growth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take apart and clean which is another big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight, Not Messy, and Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Takes a bit longer, not battery operated, and I had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li>it seemed to come loose alot and fall out of the shaver but other than that the prouduct works great!!!</li>
            <li>The shaver left my face nice and smooth but it took more than a few times of going over and over.</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer to get a nice clean shave then</li>
            <li>While the instructions themselves and the product seems easy enough to use it would have been nice to actually use the product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re older than 20 and growing full beards, leave this one for others.</li>
            <li>The new Braun gets a very close shave and is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I got a real smooth close shave with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>For the price range it is great for a secondary shaving method.  </li>
            <li>so you get consistent power throughout your shave.  </li>
            <li>Using it made me wish for the first few good weeks of a battery operated shaver.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t have to shave again for over a week.</li>
            <li>and i found this product gave me a closer shave then most electric razors but left me feeling itchier...</li>
            <li>This shaver in my opinion is designed  for the first time users of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>the charge lasts fairly long and the razor is extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I will never bother with an electric razor again.  </li>
            <li>The result is a razor that catches more hairs (even nose and ear hairs if we wanna get graphic...</li>
            <li>The razor seems pretty well built also, so I believe it will hold up well to the abuse a teenager will put it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For my first time using it, I was in my bathroom and after 10 minutes, ended up just switching to a manual shave.  </li>
            <li>First up, the power cord.  </li>
            <li>only works with a cord which is ok with me.  </li>
            <li>If Braun would make the M-60 a corded razor rather than replaceable batteries only then they would have a winning shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to put up with this problem to avoid the cost of replacing rechargeable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one does not cut well and since you have to go over the same area so many time, it irritates my face.</li>
            <li>For the last couple of years I have been using a razor for my shaving needs, but for many years used a variety of electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that the hair doesn&#x27;t end up in the sink and is early cleaned under running water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coupled with a larger motor and the fact that there isn&#x27;t an arc in power according to the charge level this will give you a more consistent shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted with the &amp;#34;corded&amp;#34; foil shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself does a decent job but the foil on it is super flimsy.</li>
            <li>Maybe a higher level razor.</li>
            <li>Overall I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with this razor because of its insufficient power and problems with the cord.</li>
            <li>So looking at the big picture, I&#x27;m definitely glad I got this razor.</li>
            <li>I tried various outlets and reading the instructions many times but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty well and close.</li>
            <li>(More on that in the next section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are a fully grown man (or sasquatch) this is most likely not the razor for you.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I can ever remember seeing any device with a separate button to turn it off.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close, though it is not like the razor where you can just do a swipe.  </li>
            <li>It’s my first electric in over 10 years, and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted in a shaver.</li>
            <li>A lot better than the last store brand that I bought.</li>
            <li>this has a trimmer that can be quickly popped out to get the long ones, which then easily shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most shavers have only one button which can wear out because it&#x27;s used to turn the shaver both on and off, but the two dedicated buttons are a smart idea.  </li>
            <li>Back then, I never found one that gave a good close shave, so I&#x27;ve always relied on a regular razor.</li>
            <li>I tested it out on some shorter finer hair on my forearm and it easily shaved it down smooth with one</li>
            <li>It is light but does not feel cheap like other shavers that I have owned.</li>
            <li>I have always shaved with a straight edge razor and this was my first experience with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>shave very close first pass on finer, softer hair&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>
            <li>/&gt;its pretty hard to find good corded shavers at this time.  </li>
            <li>The actual shaver could be a lil better it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would normally like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet , and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s normal Braun quality, it should last many years</li>
            <li>They are also quiet, easy to hold in my hand, and very easy to clean as they are single blade only.  </li>
            <li>The single cutter doesn&#x27;t pull like my dual Remington Microscreens can; however, it still takes a couple of minutes more to shave than with the Remington.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like the Braun Smart Control 130 s Shaver, and can forgive it for its flaws.</li>
            <li>bought the Smart Control shaver, even though it is made in China, because I will no longer buy rechargeable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I have gotten the Braun Smart Control 130s Shaver, I never have to use the styptic pencil again.  </li>
            <li>however, it is a long-lasting one, certainly longer than any battery rechargeable shaver.  </li>
            <li>Nice little razor but pay attention, this one is NOT battery operated.</li>
            <li>daughter (13) laughed a little at the power button when it &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; and called it old style.</li>
            <li>bigger problem with the Smart Control shaver is that it takes me at least 5 passes to get a good shave (but that shave is better than the shave with the old Braun).</li>
            <li>bought the mS2-100 after an older micro-screen needed new heads that cost more than the $19.95 clearance sale price at Big Lots,(I believe).</li>
            <li>The 3rd, and critically huge, issue is the biggest design flaw and hazard</li>
            <li>A very close shave is how I would describe it.</li>
            <li>very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did let my brother use this shaver since he has much fairer hair than I</li>
            <li>The razor works very when shaving a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>When it comes to razors you can spend as much money and get as fancy as you want.  </li>
            <li>because it gives you a very un-even shave, you&#x27;ll have patches everywhere.</li>
            <li>Misses hairs, does a real shotty job.</li>
            <li>This gave such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>He likes it but tells me how much work it is to get his beard shaved the way he wants it.</li>
            <li>It performs really well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like rechargeable because they are usually so much heavier.</li>
            <li>replacement heads are very cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>that maybe they are sending the real razor soon to my house.</li>
            <li>I found that this razor pulled as much as it cut sometimes.  </li>
            <li>it also did not offer a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>There are plenty of options in all three categories with the straight razor being the hardest and the foil being the easiest to use, but the quality of shaves go in the reverse direction.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t provide fast shave.</li>
            <li>very convenient.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another feature I really like about this shaver is that it has both an On and Off button.  </li>
            <li>After about two years, my Brauns are still doing very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much of a fan of electric razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Closeness – (You know, If I shave before work will I look like a beach bum by close of business, or will I still be smooth enough to snuggle up to my lady when I get home?)</li>
            <li>The product really delivered in this regard.</li>
            <li>Really leaves no stubble to spill out of the screen.</li>
            <li>Now I am really puzzled at why</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver for 2 weeks straight now-daily</li>
            <li>I wanted to be as detailed as possible about its advantages and disadvantages.    </li>
            <li>i received this shaver from braun when used it does not seem to leave a very close shave about a five o clock shadow and the cord likes to fall out every once in a while</li>
            <li>it has a good name and you can&#x27;t go wrong with a promotional free price  ...</li>
            <li>This replaced a similar old inexpensive Braun made-in-Germany shaver that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li>First time i had used an electric shaver in atleast 10 years, need less to say last one wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Light, easy to handle, small for packing/travel, no worries as to state of charge as in rechargeable sister products.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the fact that it came with a cleaning utensil, it&#x27;s simple to clean and the rinse under water feature is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li>The razor does a decent job to get rid of large beard growth but not for a close shave like you get in a barber shop.</li>
            <li>I used the Remington triple round-head to get the longer whiskers because the original Brauns-- with their micro-hole screen heads-- simply didn&#x27;t pick up the longer hairs.  </li>
            <li>The foil cut does require a few passes to catch most of the hair, but the shave is pretty close and resulted in absolute no burn.  </li>
            <li>I had never used an electric shaver prior to trying this shaver and was excited to see if it would work for me.  </li>
            <li>and I could never get the shave as clean as when using a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>It did a really nice job as long as my beard was kept relatively short.  </li>
            <li>For somebody who needs a close shave every day I would recommend either a high end foil razor, a safety razor or a straight razor.</li>
            <li>The AC plug is HUGE - fully four inches long.</li>
            <li>and it gets in pretty close and its not heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li>Now Remington offers numerous rechargeable versions which I won&#x27;t buy since I never had one that I liked but no corded only version.</li>
            <li>finally got the SP-69 Foil and Cutter replaced properly and the good ole MS2-100 is back in business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally, I use a straight razor.</li>
            <li>find the market for this razor is going to be teenagers, college age adults, or adults with fine soft facial hair that don&#x27;t mind the limitations that a corded shaver might provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky to pay less than $20 for these as they are more expensive, but these are a high quality, good shaving, no battery, no hassle shaver.</li>
            <li>+ times to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>Decent shave, but</li>
            <li>The most recent, the M-60,  worked on replaceable batteries only.  </li>
            <li>good news is I only wasted $30.  </li>
            <li>sure enough the same problem</li>
            <li>man...it still should shave at lease decent.</li>
            <li>I received this shaver from Braun and it was a decent shaver for the suggested price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For what it costs to the  consumer it is decent, but save up for a little better razor.</li>
            <li>It had a few good shaves at high power with new batteries then not enough power.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little longer than most shavers.</li>
            <li>your hair tends to be a little more course than the rest of the population</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice hard case.</li>
            <li>It works, but I would rather spend a few more dollars on one that is made to handle tasks like my beard a little better.</li>
            <li>Some say it is for beginners, but I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver since high school (50 years ago) and this works great for me with an average beard, but I do shave everyday.  </li>
            <li>I received this new Braun Smart Controls Shaver directly from the company.</li>
            <li>Norelco still offers a corded shaver but doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as fast as a micro-screen.</li>
            <li>I normally use my Norelco but have always wanted to try the Braun&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is too short to be useful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both as I have been able to still buy the round hole foils.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a close shave,it&#x27;s quieter than normal shavers.</li>
            <li>Save your money and go with an upgrade as this thing will most likely end up in junior&#x27;s grooming kit in the long run.</li>
            <li>As part of my normal shaving routine I shave immediately after exiting the shower and use shaving cream and a mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li>(I have a nice thick beard)    </li>
            <li>If used daily or every other depending on facial hair growth this thing does dang good.</li>
            <li>When I got the shaver, I plugged it right in, and tested it out the next morning.</li>
            <li>But it barely cuts the hair at all, and definitely doesn&#x27;t give anything even close to a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this just to try out the new design... and because it&#x27;s corded.. and because it&#x27;s corded.</li>
            <li>This is his new razor now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying a new retail item.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new shaver</li>
            <li>power tools always have more raw POWER than Battery-powered</li>
            <li>I have used mainly Remington Shavers since the early 60&#x27;s when I got a RollaMatic which I still have in</li>
            <li>It definitely takes time to figure this razor out, as I had to shave against the grain,but overall I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this razor has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>The round hole design is quicker but the Smart Foil does better where whiskers grow in different directions or in hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really just not a fan of electric razors in general.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it as the other electric razor I&#x27;ve used had the three circular heads.</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;d save the Braun for last because once the hairs were short enough it shaved much more closely than the triple-heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had it plugged in the first time for 8 hours, then 12 hours and finally 20 hours.</li>
            <li>With that said I&#x27;m a grown man, and definitely don&#x27;t fall into the category of having my first shaver.</li>
            <li>You have instant power and consistent power.  </li>
            <li>I have owned much better shavers in the past, and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not purchase item as I have coarse facial hair and even though it is shaved daily this razor did not work well.  </li>
            <li>Yes the shave was comfortable but it was neither close enough or fast enough for me to use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was looking for a new shaver to replace my old beat up Norelco</li>
            <li>They are brand new but old stock as Remington doesn&#x27;t make them anymore.  </li>
            <li>Typically I grow my beard and just trim, but I was excited to try a new type I haven&#x27;t used before, when I received it as a promotion from braun.  </li>
            <li>Pros to using this electric shaver include a hassle free shave session with out the mess of creams or need for running water.</li>
            <li>On softer hair it seemed to shave quickly and almost as well as more expensive razor that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Model 130 has a huge plug/transformer, so if you have a tight place to plug it in - be forwarned</li>
            <li>/&gt;However with this Smart Control shaver they&#x27;ve changed the head design so the holes are enlongated and facing different directions.  </li>
            <li>; however, Braun now only sells the shaver with the Smart Control design.  </li>
            <li>cord for the shaver is much too short (about 4 feet before it comes unplugged)</li>
            <li>I like the Shaver so far</li>
            <li>and I have very course facial hair.  </li>
            <li>the crappy foil cover pops off and nearly cuts my face as the blades under the foil don&#x27;t turn off when the cover comes undone.</li>
            <li>but really who buys this for only that function.  </li>
            <li>addition, the plug keep popping out of the razor if I moved too far from the outlet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FAR . .</li>
            <li>Bought it for my husband as an early father&#x27;s day gift.  </li>
            <li>After all, it&#x27;s a Braun just like my old 105.  </li>
            <li>My old model 55 was replaced because the on/off switch died.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>and i think is a really god present for this christmas.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a 13 year old just beginning to shave.  </li>
            <li>There has been much discussion about the two different foils this shaver has had since its introduction.  </li>
            <li>I don’t think this would be a problem if the outlet was near the mirror that is being used to shave with or if this model eventually comes with a rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Jokingly I ran it across my beard and eyebrows and nothing happened,  a complete was of time.</li>
            <li>I found it takes me a wee bit longer to shave with this device, but then again you don’t have to deal with lather and such when getting ready.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not shaving , I still need to use my old shaver to do the job</li>
            <li>/&gt;- - - - Cons - - - -&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up Trimmer is under-powered, meaning I must use my old Shaver on my Thicker Hair (Beard)&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you prefer rechargeable they&#x27;re only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>While shaving my face it didn&#x27;t do very well, keeping in mind my beard grows in pretty thick and it is labeled &amp;#34;Perfect first shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li>On the other hand if you&#x27;re looking for an economical corded razor or a travel razor you wouldn&#x27;t be upset about loosing then this is for you.</li>
            <li>Must pass over a few times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>you younger ones will understand when you get older).  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t they just sell a simple corded shaver that shaves close and has the power to do the job, like they did so many times in the past?</li>
            <li>The power is good and consistent but the shave is only adequate not great on my tough beard.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and the wide head covers more area so it helps cut down the shave time a bit.  </li>
            <li>I guess for the price they are selling it, its not a bad little guy.</li>
            <li>will still buy them because of the design, a singe cutter head which no other maker does it seem to matter to!</li>
            <li>But I did find out that as long as it is plugged in, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The cord sometimes will pull right out of the wall if not careful (due to length).  </li>
            <li>This is a no frills basic shaver but given this fact it has some benefits over the trend of new cordless shavers on the market today.</li>
            <li>UNTIL I FOUND ON THE PACKAGE IN NOT LARGE PRINT KIND OF HARD</li>
            <li>My old Braun 105 was getting old and starting to fall apart</li>
            <li>The old Braun had this problem occasionally, but not nearly as often as with the Smart Control shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are just entering the shaving world and do not grow a full beard in a few days, this would be a great starting razor for the price if you can get past the few minor annoyances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I simply do not have half an hour to shave my face in the morning, and it does not do a good enough job of being used as a trimmer to keep my beard relatively tame.</li>
            <li>, it is a little short and coiled kind of tight</li>
            <li>-The package came with a small brush and oil to help clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li>If I had no other razor except this one, I&#x27;d look like I barely shaved at all.</li>
            <li>after a few uses it seems you can never get an electric razor clean with only brushing it, and that it comes with the oil to follow up cleaning it.</li>
            <li>On average, daily shaving of yesterday’s stubble took about ten minutes and had to pass about 5 -6 times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>only major downfall I&#x27;ve noticed thus far has been then power cord.</li>
            <li>a little irratated afterwards but overall not a bad shaver.</li>
            <li>Not satisifed, the information for it wasn&#x27;t clear that it&#x27;s a corded razor only, and when plugged in it doesn&#x27;t peform well.</li>
            <li>old school plug-in only works with euro220v no batteries to die</li>
            <li>It does the bare minimum of what I need.</li>
            <li>But I use the better Norelco and this Braun shaver did a poor job of shaving compare to it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t have super long facial hair and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have been super annoyed with the cord, it consistently falls out.</li>
            <li>If you only is a new teenager starting doing it , that´s the product&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I rotate these with my other shavers so really haven&#x27;t had to change the foil or cutter.  </li>
            <li>-It takes way too long to shave, which completely eliminates the convenience factor.</li>
            <li>First off I shave everyday with a razor</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a pretty close shave but it takes a few passes to get it there.</li>
            <li>Even your cheapest product should be functional; selling something like this shows you want to make a quick buck by ripping people off of their hard earned money for products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have some &amp;#34;super whiskers&amp;#34; so any decent new shaver should work, they have in the past.</li>
            <li>The cord is not long enough.  </li>
            <li>my outlet is just a foot or so from my sink/mirror, but the cord would regularly pull out from the shaver because its not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first two days, the razor burn this razor caused was extremely hard to bare.</li>
            <li>For a beginner who didn&#x27;t really know any better, and for the relatively low price, I guess it&#x27;s not that bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>

            <li> That said, it is an awesome BEGINNER shaver.</li>

            <li> so I figured this was a great time to try one out.</li>

            <li> Great shavers for the price.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a great aspect for the shaver.</li>
            <li> Also, I have experienced no razor burn with this shaver with either foil.  </li>
            <li> These work great overseas too, automatically adjusting to the voltage without having to use a transformer...just a country-specific plug.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 130s was a welcome change.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great and has to be the best of its kind.  </li>
            <li> It was a good shave- not the best of my life -but good.</li>
            <li> It shaved smooth and close I truly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver with one exception.</li>
            <li> it is very nice.</li>
            <li> brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nicely made product</li>
            <li> I do love the trimmer that&#x27;sthe best part.</li>
            <li> It takes me about two minutes more to shave with these than my Remingtons, but they do an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> And even then, I had to go over it with a razor afterward to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets fairly close.</li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed with the fit and finish of the shaver.</li>
            <li> have never used an electric razor before so thought it would be a good opportunity to see what it is like to use one.  </li>
            <li> good feature is the built in trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It was a good shave, and fulfilled its purpose.</li>
            <li> But I believe this does as good a job of shaving as anything I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (15) had great results and liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for an electric for a beginner to shaving this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you are looking for that already grown in look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard good things about Braun&#x27;s razors</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good performer.</li>
            <li> Power cord needs to is not attached good to the machine</li>
            <li> It gave a really surprising close shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li> Thats about all the good I have to say regarding this model.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor free to review and have to say I&#x27;m fairly impressed.</li>
            <li> So Trying out the electric razor seemed like a good plan since it would help with having to always be re-buying the cartridges for razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works well and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> Good shaver does the job.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer also worked good for my sideburns and hair around my ears.</li>
            <li> I also used this to trim my body hair and it did a good job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave really good.</li>
            <li> Now that I have tried it I am so happy and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Works great and glad it doesn&#x27;t need batteries.  </li>
            <li> My impressions: light weight and feels real nice when shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I think it works best when you DON&#x27;T wash your face first</li>
            <li> It gave me a pretty close shave that worked perfect with the style I like to keep.</li>
            <li> Braun includes oil with this, but I greatly prefer spray lubricant that is available in just about any razor department.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if the razor was amazing...</li>
            <li> Honestly it does the job.</li>
            <li> This opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li> I own a cordless rotary shaver</li>
            <li> I received this product from the brand in return for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be nice if I could shave over the hair once</li>
            <li> Not terrible, I prefer a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a nice inexpensive option that gives me what i need.  </li>
            <li> It provides a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> They sent me the razor and to be honest</li>
            <li> It gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> my bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I liked about the razor was the sleek design.</li>
            <li> it looks like a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is nice and easy to pick up and go (with a cord) but takes quite a while to get a good shave with it compared to not electric blades.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and are looking for a nice budget razor this is a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li> It did a good job and was easy for him to use.</li>
            <li> Super value at a great price.</li>
            <li> The price, though I got this shaver for free to review, I think this is a good price-point for this shaver.    </li>
            <li> This is a good cheap razor for a beginner.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a cheap, inexpensive shaver this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> opened this thing up and discovered it’s extremely light, which is good if you travel</li>
            <li> It is nice and helpful, even though most shavers have a washable feature.    </li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job on the areas of my face where I do not want my beard to grow.&lt;br /&gt;The feature to be able to run the shaver under warm water to clean</li>
            <li> The best thing about this razor is that it comes apart quickly and easily for cleaning right under the faucet!  </li>
            <li> Braun sent this to me as a promotion, and it&#x27;s great for exactly what it&#x27;s advertised for,</li>
            <li> The first couple of shaves were great.</li>
            <li> Although it is nice that it is easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> It was quick, and got surprisingly close.</li>
            <li> so I can get away with not shaving as much, this shaver is perfect for those quick shaves between beard trimmings and/or shower shaves with a blade razor.    </li>
            <li> , I can feel it roll all over the contours of my face and neck, it was real easy to clean, compared to the entry level Norelco, it did a better job.</li>
            <li> Received this from the brand and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> For an electric razor, it&#x27;s actually the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i rent to keep it plugged since it has more power that way</li>
            <li> I received it as a promotion from the company and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it</li>
            <li> , it does an okay job shaving my face</li>
            <li> I think it is an okay shaver for the money, fix the issue with the cord falling out</li>
            <li> but you are better off with  trying something else.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was impressed ith the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than using my razor.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one thing I love about</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m glad I did not pay for this razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely my favorite razor ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I was impressed that it actually came with oil!</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors and none of them have come with the oil that is supposed to be used with the razor to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this razor is more intended for boys than girls, but I had her use it anyways.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have room for the AC plug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> The M-60 shaves better.  </li>
            <li> It just stubbornly refused to cut many of the hairs even after working that area repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their shavers for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li> : Got it free from BzzzAgent, but my review is my own.</li>
            <li> Work really good is easy,light and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> received this shaver for free form BzzAgent in lieu of providing an honest review.</li>
            <li> Most shavers are recharge battery powered that will need replacing.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you spend more you could get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love it.</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s the best in it&#x27;s category and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> , as I mentioned, is it taking a couple of minutes more than the Remington.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I got this free from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than having to buy disposables and gets the job</li>
            <li> The longer they get, the lower the chance it can cut them, even if you go over the spot many times in many directions.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades cost more than that.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love the washable feature though.</li>
            <li> I give this shaver four stars because I&#x27;m overall impressed with it.</li>
            <li> but it sure beats waiting for a cordless to charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably a great razor for a high school kid who is just learning how to shave and who&#x27;s family doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good</li>
            <li> The new foil is great and helps pick up all the troublesome whiskers.</li>
            <li> is quick, and seems to be popular</li>
            <li> This shaver did an okay job of removing hair without pulling, it comes apart easily for cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A last note, the trimmer feature is handy and works great.</li>
            <li> My nephew who has softer facial hair tried it and found it to be very good for his hair type.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I received this for free as opposed to spending money on the product.</li>
            <li> But it works great so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done a really good job of giving me a really close shave.</li>
            <li> a great first shaver(printed right on the box).</li>
            <li> Not bad!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean as you can just pop the top off and run it under the tap.  </li>
            <li> As one user stated the cord does seem to pop out of this rather easily; one solution to that is a dab of silicon glue.  </li>
            <li> This is to ensure that you&#x27;re getting an easy shave.</li>
            <li> I figured with Amazon its so easy to replace it</li>
            <li> The cord easily falls out.</li>
            <li> It was easy to keep my neck line trimmed with it.</li>
            <li> Cord falls out easily when using this shaver, takes way longer to shave with this as compared to a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy Peazy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a fast and easy way to keep myself clean shaven and looking good for work.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and has a liquid cleaning system, but I found it shaves the same, for me, as this $20 model...and eventually, the 9095cc will have to have its battery replaced.  </li>
            <li> I wasn’t overly impressed by the ability of the shaver to provide a clean shave with minimal effort or time.</li>
            <li> The shaver was detailed, and worked about as good as a high price electric shaver.</li>
            <li> the beard trimmer seems to work fine...</li>
            <li> I tested out this shaver a half dozen times before deciding it is best used as a backup shaver.  </li>
            <li> it is light and easy to use</li>
            <li> it is light and so easy to use that it makes me wonder why I had not been using one before now.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with it overall.</li>
            <li> the shaver would be fine but for the every day shaver i would not recommend it</li>
            <li> It helps to remove hairs more quickly than the tradition</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun 130S Smart Control Shaver from the manufacturer as part of a promotional offer that gives you the opportunity to try the razor and provide honest feedback about your experience.</li>
            <li> returned this shaver and am switching to cheap razors.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face really smooth.</li>
            <li> I have to say I like the precision attachment for precise trims.</li>
            <li> The package and everything was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I do find that I have to go over my skin twice, to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Pros are: size, convenience, clipper, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I received this shaver free from Braun to try and give my opinion on as part of a word of mouth campaign.  </li>
            <li> Works best if you prefer to shave everyday vs letting you face grow out.  </li>
            <li> I like the foil head which was comfortable, but the lack of speed is a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on the back works great though, and</li>
            <li> The razor cuts smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li> Easy for him to take apart and clean too.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun 130s Shaver to try for free in exchange for a review, but all opinions in this review are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my Braun 130 free to try and review.</li>
            <li> Because it does not attach to the shaver securely it continuously disconnected itself.  </li>
            <li> but I thought hey I will try it since it was free.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and i gave this one a shot i got it or free in return for this review, and ater using it for two weeks</li>
            <li> I got this through a free program.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a free product to test and review all in all it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The Remingtons are still available on Amazon by the way as of today (1/15/16).  </li>
            <li> I loves thats it trims and gives you a close shave thank you Braun for let me try this for free</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to persons with a light beard growth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I got this product free from Braun)</li>
            <li> like I got slap-chopped by an NFL linebacker, or will this thing deliver a smooth, painless shave without the afterburn?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;i did not find the braun to provide a great shave either - pehaps it takes some getting used to, which was not going to happen with the short cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the Braun 130 for free to try and review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun just bought themselves a life-long Customer with such a Great Product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my head moderately smooth for a shaver.</li>
            <li> It does not provide a close smooth shave and also pulled the hair often.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Still not as smooth as a blade razor, but very nice for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to clean, lightweight, easy to manuever.  </li>
            <li> Overall a very nice product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great for younger gentleman reaching that special time of life, and I appreciate the fact that the razor is corded.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> gives a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I also purchased, on Amazon, two brand new Remington Microscreen DA-57 cord only electric shavers that are superb.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for quick convenient shaves when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time or when shaving outside the shower.  </li>
            <li> The razor feels good in your hand and is comfortable to use, much more comfortable than the other electric razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Obviously a higher class Braun razor is going to be better</li>
            <li> change the original rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One is the original round-hole design.  </li>
            <li> I used this razor for the past two weeks and would best describe it as a beginners or entry level electric razor.    </li>
            <li> After getting the 130s in the mail I was quite excited.</li>
            <li> It was my first electric razor which so I wasn&#x27;t sure if i was just me</li>
            <li> i work a job that requires me to be clean shaven and hygienic</li>
            <li> like how you can clean this one by rinsing it with water,</li>
            <li> I like how you can wash it off to clean it.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a snap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for most my adult life until I received this Braun electric shaver from BzzAgent,and I  truly love using it.</li>
            <li> However, these Brauns (of which I bought 4) are outstanding value, high quality, strong warranty, and work worldwide.  </li>
            <li> I love my Braun smart control 130s.</li>
            <li> Braun is a great brand and this isn&#x27;t my first time using their brand, won&#x27;t be the last either.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a promotion from the company, and it was a good product overall.</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a promotion with Braun and BzzAgent, Overall it is a good beginner</li>
            <li> good out of my expect， somebody said it low power to shave</li>
            <li> responds weakly to a full cut.  </li>
            <li> Used it several times with good results..</li>
            <li> For a person who is just starting to shave this is a good piece.  </li>
            <li> it got a close shave and left my face feeling good with no irritation like a standerd razor</li>
            <li> Overall the shaver is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll for me, I can grow a full beard and the razor</li>
            <li> Recently,I picked up a Braun 130-S (corded only) for just $29.95 and it shaves just as good and</li>
            <li> Most of the time I just ended up busting out the straight razor....</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good razor</li>
            <li> but good enough to be rated as a pro rather than a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Full Disclosure, I received this product from the manufacturer as part of a test /</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it’s not a bad razor.  </li>
            <li> I was so lucky to be able to try the Braun 130S straight from the Braun manufactory.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great razor for a young man starting to shave (probably 5 star- great value, good product, seems well made and will last).  </li>
            <li> Other than that - it is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> head has excellent movement and the screen has very small micro holes eliminating alot of the &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; that you might get with some of the 3 head razors that have longer slots in the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do think this no frills razor would be perfect for a teen who is just starting to shave.  </li>
            <li> Stick with a regular razor or spend the money to invest one of their better models, which are hopefully better products.</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun for such a great product.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t cut the hair on your face, but every now and then if you are lucky it will pull some of the hair out for you.</li>
            <li> Unless I need a super close shave, I&#x27;ll pick up the 130s before</li>
            <li> It does shave and get in pretty close, and the price is quite cheap.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suspect these pure electric shavers will outlast their two-year warranty.  </li>
            <li> I get razor burn extremely easy and was ready to test this \\&quot;foil\\&quot; style razor.</li>
            <li> For the life of me, I can&#x27;t think of a single reason why this is good.  </li>
            <li> It cuts clean, no Irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Included mini-brush, to keep the Razor clean, and ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Corded</li>
            <li> I got the Braun Smart Control Shaver 130 S from Braun for free.</li>
            <li> I received a Braun Smart Control 130s-1 Shaver free from the company to test and review.</li>
            <li> Great little corded razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and even though this was the best and closest shave of them all, it still took quite a while.</li>
            <li> I find it quite useful still.</li>
            <li> It did well on armpits, and ok on her legs but is clearly designed for the flatter surface of a face than the rounded surface of legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have yet to be able to complete one shave without having the cord &amp;#34;pull out&amp;#34; of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to pay even the $30 for this, the cheapest of Braun shavers, but I figured brand name must be worth it.</li>
            <li> with that being said its a pretty good shaver besides that minor deault</li>
            <li> This product is great for a teen or young man.</li>
            <li> Very simple and effective design.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to clean and spray my razor at least once a week; it keeps it running nice and</li>
            <li> good feature of the the Smart Control shaver is that the shaved hair stays in the shaver (the old Braun leaked shaved hair even when it was new).</li>
            <li> But once I let my beard grow out a little more this became more of a project then a quick task...</li>
            <li> It just pushes right up into place.</li>
            <li> and he saw much better results and a nice close shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> The fact i can rinse it under running water makes for a much easier clean up as well.</li>
            <li> like being able to clean the razor by running it under hot water, no doubt a benefit of the low voltage.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to use but the shave is just as smooth as it was with the blade.  </li>
            <li> I personally use a Double edge razor and I have great success with it.</li>
            <li> have a full beard and really like the trimmer attachment on the shaver.</li>
            <li> Probably best for those that keep little to no facial hair.</li>
            <li> My advice: save a little more money and go for a better version.</li>
            <li> but this one will do the job for a new shaver or someone with light growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take apart and clean which is another big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight, Not Messy, and Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Takes a bit longer, not battery operated, and I had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li> it seemed to come loose alot and fall out of the shaver but other than that the prouduct works great!!!</li>
            <li> The shaver left my face nice and smooth but it took more than a few times of going over and over.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to get a nice clean shave then</li>
            <li> While the instructions themselves and the product seems easy enough to use it would have been nice to actually use the product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re older than 20 and growing full beards, leave this one for others.</li>
            <li> The new Braun gets a very close shave and is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got a real smooth close shave with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> For the price range it is great for a secondary shaving method.  </li>
            <li> so you get consistent power throughout your shave.  </li>
            <li> Using it made me wish for the first few good weeks of a battery operated shaver.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t have to shave again for over a week.</li>
            <li> and i found this product gave me a closer shave then most electric razors but left me feeling itchier...</li>
            <li> This shaver in my opinion is designed  for the first time users of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> the charge lasts fairly long and the razor is extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I will never bother with an electric razor again.  </li>
            <li> The result is a razor that catches more hairs (even nose and ear hairs if we wanna get graphic...</li>
            <li> The razor seems pretty well built also, so I believe it will hold up well to the abuse a teenager will put it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For my first time using it, I was in my bathroom and after 10 minutes, ended up just switching to a manual shave.  </li>
            <li> First up, the power cord.  </li>
            <li> only works with a cord which is ok with me.  </li>
            <li> If Braun would make the M-60 a corded razor rather than replaceable batteries only then they would have a winning shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to put up with this problem to avoid the cost of replacing rechargeable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one does not cut well and since you have to go over the same area so many time, it irritates my face.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I have been using a razor for my shaving needs, but for many years used a variety of electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that the hair doesn&#x27;t end up in the sink and is early cleaned under running water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coupled with a larger motor and the fact that there isn&#x27;t an arc in power according to the charge level this will give you a more consistent shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted with the &amp;#34;corded&amp;#34; foil shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself does a decent job but the foil on it is super flimsy.</li>
            <li> Maybe a higher level razor.</li>
            <li> Overall I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with this razor because of its insufficient power and problems with the cord.</li>
            <li> So looking at the big picture, I&#x27;m definitely glad I got this razor.</li>
            <li> I tried various outlets and reading the instructions many times but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty well and close.</li>
            <li> (More on that in the next section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you are a fully grown man (or sasquatch) this is most likely not the razor for you.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I can ever remember seeing any device with a separate button to turn it off.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close, though it is not like the razor where you can just do a swipe.  </li>
            <li> It’s my first electric in over 10 years, and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted in a shaver.</li>
            <li> A lot better than the last store brand that I bought.</li>
            <li> this has a trimmer that can be quickly popped out to get the long ones, which then easily shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most shavers have only one button which can wear out because it&#x27;s used to turn the shaver both on and off, but the two dedicated buttons are a smart idea.  </li>
            <li> Back then, I never found one that gave a good close shave, so I&#x27;ve always relied on a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I tested it out on some shorter finer hair on my forearm and it easily shaved it down smooth with one</li>
            <li> It is light but does not feel cheap like other shavers that I have owned.</li>
            <li> I have always shaved with a straight edge razor and this was my first experience with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> shave very close first pass on finer, softer hair&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>
            <li> /&gt;its pretty hard to find good corded shavers at this time.  </li>
            <li> The actual shaver could be a lil better it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would normally like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet , and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s normal Braun quality, it should last many years</li>
            <li> They are also quiet, easy to hold in my hand, and very easy to clean as they are single blade only.  </li>
            <li> The single cutter doesn&#x27;t pull like my dual Remington Microscreens can; however, it still takes a couple of minutes more to shave than with the Remington.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like the Braun Smart Control 130 s Shaver, and can forgive it for its flaws.</li>
            <li> bought the Smart Control shaver, even though it is made in China, because I will no longer buy rechargeable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I have gotten the Braun Smart Control 130s Shaver, I never have to use the styptic pencil again.  </li>
            <li> however, it is a long-lasting one, certainly longer than any battery rechargeable shaver.  </li>
            <li> Nice little razor but pay attention, this one is NOT battery operated.</li>
            <li> daughter (13) laughed a little at the power button when it &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; and called it old style.</li>
            <li> bigger problem with the Smart Control shaver is that it takes me at least 5 passes to get a good shave (but that shave is better than the shave with the old Braun).</li>
            <li> bought the mS2-100 after an older micro-screen needed new heads that cost more than the $19.95 clearance sale price at Big Lots,(I believe).</li>
            <li> The 3rd, and critically huge, issue is the biggest design flaw and hazard</li>
            <li> A very close shave is how I would describe it.</li>
            <li> very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did let my brother use this shaver since he has much fairer hair than I</li>
            <li> The razor works very when shaving a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> When it comes to razors you can spend as much money and get as fancy as you want.  </li>
            <li> because it gives you a very un-even shave, you&#x27;ll have patches everywhere.</li>
            <li> Misses hairs, does a real shotty job.</li>
            <li> This gave such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> He likes it but tells me how much work it is to get his beard shaved the way he wants it.</li>
            <li> It performs really well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like rechargeable because they are usually so much heavier.</li>
            <li> replacement heads are very cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> that maybe they are sending the real razor soon to my house.</li>
            <li> I found that this razor pulled as much as it cut sometimes.  </li>
            <li> it also did not offer a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of options in all three categories with the straight razor being the hardest and the foil being the easiest to use, but the quality of shaves go in the reverse direction.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t provide fast shave.</li>
            <li> very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another feature I really like about this shaver is that it has both an On and Off button.  </li>
            <li> After about two years, my Brauns are still doing very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a fan of electric razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Closeness – (You know, If I shave before work will I look like a beach bum by close of business, or will I still be smooth enough to snuggle up to my lady when I get home?)</li>
            <li> The product really delivered in this regard.</li>
            <li> Really leaves no stubble to spill out of the screen.</li>
            <li> Now I am really puzzled at why</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for 2 weeks straight now-daily</li>
            <li> I wanted to be as detailed as possible about its advantages and disadvantages.    </li>
            <li> i received this shaver from braun when used it does not seem to leave a very close shave about a five o clock shadow and the cord likes to fall out every once in a while</li>
            <li> it has a good name and you can&#x27;t go wrong with a promotional free price  ...</li>
            <li> This replaced a similar old inexpensive Braun made-in-Germany shaver that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> First time i had used an electric shaver in atleast 10 years, need less to say last one wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Light, easy to handle, small for packing/travel, no worries as to state of charge as in rechargeable sister products.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the fact that it came with a cleaning utensil, it&#x27;s simple to clean and the rinse under water feature is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> The razor does a decent job to get rid of large beard growth but not for a close shave like you get in a barber shop.</li>
            <li> I used the Remington triple round-head to get the longer whiskers because the original Brauns-- with their micro-hole screen heads-- simply didn&#x27;t pick up the longer hairs.  </li>
            <li> The foil cut does require a few passes to catch most of the hair, but the shave is pretty close and resulted in absolute no burn.  </li>
            <li> I had never used an electric shaver prior to trying this shaver and was excited to see if it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> and I could never get the shave as clean as when using a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> It did a really nice job as long as my beard was kept relatively short.  </li>
            <li> For somebody who needs a close shave every day I would recommend either a high end foil razor, a safety razor or a straight razor.</li>
            <li> The AC plug is HUGE - fully four inches long.</li>
            <li> and it gets in pretty close and its not heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li> Now Remington offers numerous rechargeable versions which I won&#x27;t buy since I never had one that I liked but no corded only version.</li>
            <li> finally got the SP-69 Foil and Cutter replaced properly and the good ole MS2-100 is back in business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, I use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> find the market for this razor is going to be teenagers, college age adults, or adults with fine soft facial hair that don&#x27;t mind the limitations that a corded shaver might provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky to pay less than $20 for these as they are more expensive, but these are a high quality, good shaving, no battery, no hassle shaver.</li>
            <li> + times to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> Decent shave, but</li>
            <li> The most recent, the M-60,  worked on replaceable batteries only.  </li>
            <li> good news is I only wasted $30.  </li>
            <li> sure enough the same problem</li>
            <li> man...it still should shave at lease decent.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver from Braun and it was a decent shaver for the suggested price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For what it costs to the  consumer it is decent, but save up for a little better razor.</li>
            <li> It had a few good shaves at high power with new batteries then not enough power.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little longer than most shavers.</li>
            <li> your hair tends to be a little more course than the rest of the population</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice hard case.</li>
            <li> It works, but I would rather spend a few more dollars on one that is made to handle tasks like my beard a little better.</li>
            <li> Some say it is for beginners, but I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver since high school (50 years ago) and this works great for me with an average beard, but I do shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> I received this new Braun Smart Controls Shaver directly from the company.</li>
            <li> Norelco still offers a corded shaver but doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as fast as a micro-screen.</li>
            <li> I normally use my Norelco but have always wanted to try the Braun&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is too short to be useful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both as I have been able to still buy the round hole foils.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave,it&#x27;s quieter than normal shavers.</li>
            <li> Save your money and go with an upgrade as this thing will most likely end up in junior&#x27;s grooming kit in the long run.</li>
            <li> As part of my normal shaving routine I shave immediately after exiting the shower and use shaving cream and a mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li> (I have a nice thick beard)    </li>
            <li> If used daily or every other depending on facial hair growth this thing does dang good.</li>
            <li> When I got the shaver, I plugged it right in, and tested it out the next morning.</li>
            <li> But it barely cuts the hair at all, and definitely doesn&#x27;t give anything even close to a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to try out the new design... and because it&#x27;s corded.. and because it&#x27;s corded.</li>
            <li> This is his new razor now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a new retail item.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver</li>
            <li> power tools always have more raw POWER than Battery-powered</li>
            <li> I have used mainly Remington Shavers since the early 60&#x27;s when I got a RollaMatic which I still have in</li>
            <li> It definitely takes time to figure this razor out, as I had to shave against the grain,but overall I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this razor has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> The round hole design is quicker but the Smart Foil does better where whiskers grow in different directions or in hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really just not a fan of electric razors in general.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it as the other electric razor I&#x27;ve used had the three circular heads.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;d save the Braun for last because once the hairs were short enough it shaved much more closely than the triple-heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had it plugged in the first time for 8 hours, then 12 hours and finally 20 hours.</li>
            <li> With that said I&#x27;m a grown man, and definitely don&#x27;t fall into the category of having my first shaver.</li>
            <li> You have instant power and consistent power.  </li>
            <li> I have owned much better shavers in the past, and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not purchase item as I have coarse facial hair and even though it is shaved daily this razor did not work well.  </li>
            <li> Yes the shave was comfortable but it was neither close enough or fast enough for me to use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a new shaver to replace my old beat up Norelco</li>
            <li> They are brand new but old stock as Remington doesn&#x27;t make them anymore.  </li>
            <li> Typically I grow my beard and just trim, but I was excited to try a new type I haven&#x27;t used before, when I received it as a promotion from braun.  </li>
            <li> Pros to using this electric shaver include a hassle free shave session with out the mess of creams or need for running water.</li>
            <li> On softer hair it seemed to shave quickly and almost as well as more expensive razor that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> Model 130 has a huge plug/transformer, so if you have a tight place to plug it in - be forwarned</li>
            <li> /&gt;However with this Smart Control shaver they&#x27;ve changed the head design so the holes are enlongated and facing different directions.  </li>
            <li> ; however, Braun now only sells the shaver with the Smart Control design.  </li>
            <li> cord for the shaver is much too short (about 4 feet before it comes unplugged)</li>
            <li> I like the Shaver so far</li>
            <li> and I have very course facial hair.  </li>
            <li> the crappy foil cover pops off and nearly cuts my face as the blades under the foil don&#x27;t turn off when the cover comes undone.</li>
            <li> but really who buys this for only that function.  </li>
            <li> addition, the plug keep popping out of the razor if I moved too far from the outlet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> FAR . .</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband as an early father&#x27;s day gift.  </li>
            <li> After all, it&#x27;s a Braun just like my old 105.  </li>
            <li> My old model 55 was replaced because the on/off switch died.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> and i think is a really god present for this christmas.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 13 year old just beginning to shave.  </li>
            <li> There has been much discussion about the two different foils this shaver has had since its introduction.  </li>
            <li> I don’t think this would be a problem if the outlet was near the mirror that is being used to shave with or if this model eventually comes with a rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Jokingly I ran it across my beard and eyebrows and nothing happened,  a complete was of time.</li>
            <li> I found it takes me a wee bit longer to shave with this device, but then again you don’t have to deal with lather and such when getting ready.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not shaving , I still need to use my old shaver to do the job</li>
            <li> /&gt;- - - - Cons - - - -&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up Trimmer is under-powered, meaning I must use my old Shaver on my Thicker Hair (Beard)&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you prefer rechargeable they&#x27;re only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> While shaving my face it didn&#x27;t do very well, keeping in mind my beard grows in pretty thick and it is labeled &amp;#34;Perfect first shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li> On the other hand if you&#x27;re looking for an economical corded razor or a travel razor you wouldn&#x27;t be upset about loosing then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Must pass over a few times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> you younger ones will understand when you get older).  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t they just sell a simple corded shaver that shaves close and has the power to do the job, like they did so many times in the past?</li>
            <li> The power is good and consistent but the shave is only adequate not great on my tough beard.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and the wide head covers more area so it helps cut down the shave time a bit.  </li>
            <li> I guess for the price they are selling it, its not a bad little guy.</li>
            <li> will still buy them because of the design, a singe cutter head which no other maker does it seem to matter to!</li>
            <li> But I did find out that as long as it is plugged in, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The cord sometimes will pull right out of the wall if not careful (due to length).  </li>
            <li> This is a no frills basic shaver but given this fact it has some benefits over the trend of new cordless shavers on the market today.</li>
            <li> UNTIL I FOUND ON THE PACKAGE IN NOT LARGE PRINT KIND OF HARD</li>
            <li> My old Braun 105 was getting old and starting to fall apart</li>
            <li> The old Braun had this problem occasionally, but not nearly as often as with the Smart Control shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are just entering the shaving world and do not grow a full beard in a few days, this would be a great starting razor for the price if you can get past the few minor annoyances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I simply do not have half an hour to shave my face in the morning, and it does not do a good enough job of being used as a trimmer to keep my beard relatively tame.</li>
            <li> , it is a little short and coiled kind of tight</li>
            <li> -The package came with a small brush and oil to help clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li> If I had no other razor except this one, I&#x27;d look like I barely shaved at all.</li>
            <li> after a few uses it seems you can never get an electric razor clean with only brushing it, and that it comes with the oil to follow up cleaning it.</li>
            <li> On average, daily shaving of yesterday’s stubble took about ten minutes and had to pass about 5 -6 times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> only major downfall I&#x27;ve noticed thus far has been then power cord.</li>
            <li> a little irratated afterwards but overall not a bad shaver.</li>
            <li> Not satisifed, the information for it wasn&#x27;t clear that it&#x27;s a corded razor only, and when plugged in it doesn&#x27;t peform well.</li>
            <li> old school plug-in only works with euro220v no batteries to die</li>
            <li> It does the bare minimum of what I need.</li>
            <li> But I use the better Norelco and this Braun shaver did a poor job of shaving compare to it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t have super long facial hair and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have been super annoyed with the cord, it consistently falls out.</li>
            <li> If you only is a new teenager starting doing it , that´s the product&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I rotate these with my other shavers so really haven&#x27;t had to change the foil or cutter.  </li>
            <li> -It takes way too long to shave, which completely eliminates the convenience factor.</li>
            <li> First off I shave everyday with a razor</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a pretty close shave but it takes a few passes to get it there.</li>
            <li> Even your cheapest product should be functional; selling something like this shows you want to make a quick buck by ripping people off of their hard earned money for products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have some &amp;#34;super whiskers&amp;#34; so any decent new shaver should work, they have in the past.</li>
            <li> The cord is not long enough.  </li>
            <li> my outlet is just a foot or so from my sink/mirror, but the cord would regularly pull out from the shaver because its not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first two days, the razor burn this razor caused was extremely hard to bare.</li>
            <li> For a beginner who didn&#x27;t really know any better, and for the relatively low price, I guess it&#x27;s not that bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> minor problem with the Smart Control shaver is the cord popping out of the shaver, typically 1 or 2 times per shave.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after trying the shaver I found that it did not give me a very clean shave, I tried on a number of occasions using different techniques</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find true electric shavers (cord only).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The more expensive units may have stronger and faster motors, so remember that quality is remembered long after low price is forgotten and invest in your comfort zone.  </li>
            <li> (I can only assume its for a different model), it is actually a corded razor so there is no need to worry about losing power unless you are not near an outlet.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver a little over a month ago from Braun and had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> It takes me a long time with this to shave my head, as opposed to a traditional razor, but it definitely does work.</li>
            <li> and it was too long for the shaver, yet too short for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> We will see how long these last...</li>
            <li> thing that I found is that given the small micro screen it doesn&#x27;t shave my really coarse wiry hair as well as my older Norelco 3 head which has the slots in the screen.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not really like is that its connection is very short.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and when I got this from Braun, I never thought it would work correctly, especially because I am not a big fan of electric razors in general.  </li>
            <li> The same design, and same mechanics as thousands of other shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, except the cord is so short that it&#x27;s a real hassle to use, even with the socket right next to the sink.</li>
            <li> FOR NOTHING REMINGTON and thank you Braun for a much needed OVERDUE product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/7/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the late update.</li>
            <li> -Takes too long to charge.</li>
            <li> If you have an AC outlet, you can use this shaver as long as you want.</li>
            <li> Nothing against Braun, I used them for a long time, but this product isn&#x27;t going to change my views.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with traditional wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The attached trimmer is a bonus for tackling long stubble or cleaning up sideburns.</li>
            <li> After multiple tries to charge this product it would not hold a cordless charge at all.</li>
            <li> If this is for a 14 year old who is growing a few whiskers on his chin, buy it for him.    </li>
            <li> Those that are stating it shaves &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; or whatever, either got very lucky, have no real real whiskers to speak of, or perhaps I &amp;#34;just happened&amp;#34; to get a very poorly made one.</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver and there was no battery to run down while shaving or to go bad incl</li>
            <li> and I will say that I&#x27;ve only used one other electric razor.</li>
            <li> keep in midn this thing is way different from other products from the Braun family in that it doesn´t charge by itself.</li>
            <li> as other reviews have indicated, the cord on this is too short.  </li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t shave at all if it was very long not even after 2 days of not shaving.  </li>
            <li> 2nd the cord is so stiff that it unplugs several times per session.</li>
            <li> Single blade shavers also tend not to pull whiskers like dual screens sometimes do.  </li>
            <li> It has to be cheaper to produce a single button power on/off than to put separate buttons for on and off, so</li>
            <li> Single Razer-strip, means this razor does NOT pull your hair.</li>
            <li> Normally this would be a pro and not a con, however, the cord does not seat well into the end of the razor and comes out at least once per shave.</li>
            <li> I guess you try to be as careful and take 5 times as long.</li>
            <li> Unlike rechargeables that will die and have to be thrownout, or force you to buy an expensive battery, these shavers (and the Remington Microscreens) are true electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries running down in the middle of the shave because you forgot to charge it</li>
            <li> It might be slightly under powered for someone that doesn&#x27;t shave on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest this razor to anyone who is looking to start shaving or anyone that is already shaving and not satisfied with their current razor.</li>
            <li> To start with, it took me over 10 minutes to shave under half of my face, and there were whiskers left all over the place.</li>
            <li> but it seemed to take way too long to charge compared to other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Dandy little gem for surprisingly low cost.  </li>
            <li> to get it to even attempt to cut my beard, just marginally well, you have to press it really hard and run over the same spot several times.</li>
            <li> Factor: Pulling/Irritation – (Is my face going to win a painful game of tug-o-war or feel  </li>
            <li> I spent 15 minutes with the Braun trying to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The M-60 has a thinner round head, the same profile from either side of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you try to push harder to get closer the head pops off.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still fairly rough.</li>
            <li> probably will trudge along with this shaver for the next few years until it croaks</li>
            <li> If you have coarse hair or except to use this razor after a few days growth, this is not the product for you, hence the 3 stars as it did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the wonky hairs from way down my neck to the normal ones.</li>
            <li> This thing is not capable of shaving even, due to</li>
            <li> maybe its because i&#x27;m not used to the feeling of an electric razor but other then that one detail</li>
            <li> The BRAUN 130S SHAVER is a shaver by any other definition.</li>
            <li> It replaced my other shaver and the difference is night and day</li>
            <li> -The shaver doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair like a lot of other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The detail shaver is pretty useless for trimming up the area around up my ears.  </li>
            <li> not exactly the look</li>
            <li> Other than that, its alright.</li>
            <li> Braun, Norelco, and Remington make usually one model only.  </li>
            <li> It is likely because the motor in the Braun is a small one.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and thick hair and unfortunately even after multiple times shaving, I was still left with a strong shadow of a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is almost completely useless for me besides the precision trimmer, which happens to give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Being used to the triple head razors my whole life, I was skeptical about the Braun head.</li>
            <li> I have an average beard and this model 130</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.    </li>
            <li> The four star review is based on his experience, but keep in mind that I would give the product one star for its performance with thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick stubble, as do I, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver simply because it doesn&#x27;t have the motor to make the cut, literally.</li>
            <li> The other complaint is, the razor head has came off a few times in the middle of shaving which I&#x27;m sure does the cutting blades no good at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using an electric razor for shaving my face is like trying to cut down a redwood tree with a pocket knife.</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll have to break down and use electrical tape to hold the power cord in.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s often falls down.</li>
            <li> I will make this review short and sweet and not give boring and obvious details as to why I wanted to purchase a razor.</li>
            <li> Once you get too thick, it takes a solid few passes to cut down the scruff.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if you don&#x27;t fully extend the power cord each time, before shaving, it pulls out before you get one half done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only do battery shavers require charging and waiting for them to charge, they often die out in the middle of shaving...and you have to either replace the expensive battery or discard the shaver.  </li>
            <li> But the $30 model used to come with a battery, so I feel this is definitely a black</li>
            <li> 2 new shavers dead on arrival this is not a coincidence!!!!.</li>
            <li> When you push firmly against your face they bog down and go slower.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a good product for that hair type otherwise if you don&#x27;t mind the little extra effort to make it work for you</li>
            <li> No more eight second shaves that leave your face looking like you shaved with a dull spoon.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week now.  </li>
            <li> but it still takes a little to achieve desirable look.</li>
            <li> And the razor does shave close as other Braun&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past do.  </li>
            <li> Someone with little hair, and no experience shaving.</li>
            <li> I am also seeing that the cord pops out of the shaver after a little use.</li>
            <li> This razor for some reason caused me some issues with little bumps under my chin when I shave which I think occurs because I have to repeatedly go over the area.  </li>
            <li> Which should make it easy to wash the blood out of the blades after you get tired of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> You have to either shave very slowly, or go over the same place 5</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and this razor simply does not cut it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be battery operated unless I&#x27;m missing something.</li>
            <li> I was using an electric shave with round heads, so  getting used to this razor head</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday so it just might be that a</li>
            <li> I have a heavy hair growth.</li>
            <li> Though i did let a few days stubble grow</li>
            <li> Would I switch to using this as an everyday razor,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the experience so far has been underwhelming.</li>
            <li> You would have to shave everyday to use this razor.</li>
            <li> The old shaver replaced a series of more-expensive rechargeable shavers that failed early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasted $30.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Performance is not great on really coarse wiry hair&lt;</li>
            <li> Few cord-only shavers like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for a week now with zero problems with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Although it took a few passes I did not experience any pulling or irritation while the razor was on.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is pop off the cover and run it under the water for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I hate that shaver mfgrs only have rechargeable shavers now: the batteries always die and I have to throw away the shaver and get a new one.  </li>
            <li> The thing is though electric razors have all been pretty bad for me.</li>
            <li> This thing provided a pretty close shave that did not leave too bad of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a Braun electric for the past 6 or 7 years before I bought this one a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Braun should feel ashamed for selling such a lame product.  </li>
            <li> The shaver lacked the power to address anything past a five o&#x27;clock shadow.    </li>
            <li> I have to say Braun seems to have taken a couple of steps in the wrong direction with the current model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> all fairness, I had to base my rating on the fact that the razor says that it is a beginner&#x27;s razor right on the box.</li>
            <li> From my experience the corded models don&#x27;t have this fault, you push hard and they just shave closer.  </li>
            <li> The reason I bought it was because it is so hard to find a shaver that is not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
            <li> The trick to this trimmer is to not push too hard.    </li>
            <li> I was surprised this shaver wasn&#x27;t bad, skin was</li>
            <li> The one negative</li>
            <li> It falls out at least 2-3 times per shave....</li>
            <li> this could also be caused but the fact that I have a really thick beard even after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY??  </li>
            <li> I like the razor and need the razor because of the single blade or cutting head, whichever you prefer to call it.</li>
            <li> and that was a little annoying due to the curled cord</li>
            <li> I am VERY DISSAPOINTED and am frankly shocked on just how lousy the shave is!</li>
            <li> This was very inconvenient and added to my overall dissatisfaction of the razor and shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This gets really annoying, especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I shave approximately 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> and the shave became worse.  </li>
            <li> Cons to this product would include the cord, it would constantly disconnect and pull out of the base of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Maybe it had bad Screen/Cutter as it seemed to have slowly gotten dull</li>
            <li> At least Braun tried; unlike you know who!!</li>
            <li> It has a very weak motor to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to electric shavers pulling hair and being all uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the Braun razor.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the fancy, expensive &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; razors by Braun and they don&#x27;t shave well at all.</li>
            <li> Not a huge issue but was extremely annoying when coupled with comment #1.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like this model&#x27;s trimmer which is at a difficult angle to use easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, that should not be a reason to buy a razor.</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> biggest problem though, is that razors are so expensive.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this turned  out not to be one either.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Instructions were useless, but also un-needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cold water and after shave never helped I would always have to get out the styptic pencil to stop the bleeding.  </li>
            <li> kept pulling at my hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong and disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate to write a bad review, and I&#x27;ve been a fan of braun in the past, but this shaver is really, really horrible.</li>
            <li> Oh it was not all bad...</li>
            <li> The bad news it</li>
            <li> the price point is not that bad either.</li>
            <li> i can say its not that bad</li>
            <li> Stupid problem to have.</li>
            <li> The base shaver works quite well.</li>
            <li> Which can be rather annoying....</li>
            <li> not as annoying as replacing batteries</li>
            <li> So disappointed!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s horrible design.</li>
            <li> This damn piece of junk gives a terrible shave!</li>
            <li> But it get&#x27;s very annoying because the cord keeps coming out of the razor when shaving.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it was electric-only.  I hate that shaver mfgrs only have rechargeable shavers now: the batteries always die and I have to throw away the shaver and get a new one.  So I was hoping this would be my last shaver for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the motor is so tiny on this unit, it practically stops while shaving.  You have to either shave very slowly, or go over the same place 5+ times to get a decent shave.  And even then, I had to go over it with a razor afterward to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this shaver and am switching to cheap razors.</li>
            <li> Received this from the brand and LOVE it. Leaves my face really smooth. A great purchase, and I&#x27;d recommend to any guy. Makes a terrific holiday gift.</li>
            <li> For an electric razor, it&#x27;s actually the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m really just not a fan of electric razors in general. Using an electric razor for shaving my face is like trying to cut down a redwood tree with a pocket knife. I have to say I like the precision attachment for precise trims. Also, it appears you need the cord for it to work. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be battery operated unless I&#x27;m missing something. I left it plugged in for quite some time and it still wouldn&#x27;t work w/out the cord. That&#x27;s also a bummer because it&#x27;s fallen out of the razor while shaving enough times to annoy me. The shave itself however, is the closest I&#x27;ve had w/ any electric razor.</li>
            <li> Braun sent me this as a promotion. Honestly it does the job. A very close shave is how I would describe it. It removed all my facial hair and did not leave it feeling prickly. I also enjoy the fact that it came with a cleaning utensil, it&#x27;s simple to clean and the rinse under water feature is definitely a plus. The only thing I did not really like is that its connection is very short. Although it is nice that it is easy to assemble. The package and everything was fantastic. I would definitely give it to somebody as a gift!</li>
            <li> This shaver is almost completely useless for me besides the precision trimmer, which happens to give a very close shave. I have a very thick beard and thick hair and unfortunately even after multiple times shaving, I was still left with a strong shadow of a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord for the shaver is much too short (about 4 feet before it comes unplugged) so you need an outlet very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did let my brother use this shaver since he has much fairer hair than I and he saw much better results and a nice close shave with very little irritation. The four star review is based on his experience, but keep in mind that I would give the product one star for its performance with thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from the brand.  This opinion is all my own. It works pretty good i rent to keep it plugged since it has more power that way and it gets in pretty close and its not heavy or bulky. Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was giving this shaver to try out. It has taken me a while to get use to the shave.I was using an electric shave with round heads, so  getting used to this razor head took some getting used too. Its easy to use, keeps a good charge. I do find that I have to go over my skin twice, to get a smooth shave. I have to shave everyday so it just might be that a I have a heavy hair growth. I have been using it for about a month and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> old school plug-in only works with euro220v no batteries to die</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for quick convenient shaves when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time or when shaving outside the shower.  It gets fairly close. For the price range it is great for a secondary shaving method.  I like the size and feel of it, but the cord needs to be longer. The cord sometimes will pull right out of the wall if not careful (due to length).  The best thing about this razor is that it comes apart quickly and easily for cleaning right under the faucet!  I have a beard so I can get away with not shaving as much, this shaver is perfect for those quick shaves between beard trimmings and/or shower shaves with a blade razor.    Pros are: size, convenience, clipper, easy to clean.  Cons: corded, cord too short,    I received this shaver as a promotion from Braun.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t have super long facial hair and use it everyday. I received it as a promotion from the company and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it</li>
            <li> I received this shaver free from Braun to try and give my opinion on as part of a word of mouth campaign.  I have been using it for a little over a week now.  I own a cordless rotary shaver so I have something to compare it to.  I like the Shaver so far, it does an okay job shaving my face and I have very course facial hair.  The following are the pro&#x27;s and cons about the shaver I have found.    Pros:  1. It gives a close shave and the wide head covers more area so it helps cut down the shave time a bit.  2. It is easy to clean as you can just pop the top off and run it under the tap.  3. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries running down in the middle of the shave because you forgot to charge it so you get consistent power throughout your shave.  4. The price, though I got this shaver for free to review, I think this is a good price-point for this shaver.    Cons:  1. The cord is not long enough.  I know it is a coiled cord and it stretches but it is still annoyingly short.  2. The power cord falls out constantly.  This is a corded shaver so it has to be plugged in to work so why make a detachable power cord?  If your going to make a detachable power cord, make it so it clips in somehow.  3. It takes a little longer to get a nice clean shave then my rotary shaver.    All in all I think it is an okay shaver for the money, fix the issue with the cord falling out and I would totally recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean, smooth shave. Works best if you prefer to shave everyday vs letting you face grow out.  Once you get too thick, it takes a solid few passes to cut down the scruff.  Probably best for those that keep little to no facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of electric shavers in my day. For religious reasons, I am forbidden from using a blade shaver, and must instead use an electric. Typically I grow my beard and just trim, but I was excited to try a new type I haven&#x27;t used before, when I received it as a promotion from braun.  I haven&#x27;t yet found a shaver I like, and I&#x27;ve tried all types of heads, but this one definitely almost did the job, although it took quite a bit of time. I like the foil head which was comfortable, but the lack of speed is a problem for me.  The trimmer on the back works great though, and I find it quite useful still.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a new shaver to replace my old beat up Norelco and I figured would get a braun. it has a good name and you can&#x27;t go wrong with a promotional free price  ... boy was I wrong and disappointed.  1st off...to get it to even attempt to cut my beard, just marginally well, you have to press it really hard and run over the same spot several times. 2nd the cord is so stiff that it unplugs several times per session. Using it made me wish for the first few good weeks of a battery operated shaver.  The 3rd, and critically huge, issue is the biggest design flaw and hazard I have ever seen in an electric razor...the crappy foil cover pops off and nearly cuts my face as the blades under the foil don&#x27;t turn off when the cover comes undone. If you don&#x27;t mind worrying about bodily harm I guess you try to be as careful and take 5 times as long. but you are better off with  trying something else.  Oh it was not all bad...the beard trimmer seems to work fine...but really who buys this for only that function.  And it was washable as per it&#x27;s instructions. Which should make it easy to wash the blood out of the blades after you get tired of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I was given this shaver by Braun for a trial. I was immediately impressed with the fit and finish of the shaver. It is light but does not feel cheap like other shavers that I have owned. The shaver is great for younger gentleman reaching that special time of life, and I appreciate the fact that the razor is corded. No more eight second shaves that leave your face looking like you shaved with a dull spoon. The razor works very when shaving a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Overall, I was impressed ith the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I received this product from the brand in return for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this thing. If used daily or every other depending on facial hair growth this thing does dang good. I&#x27;m used to electric shavers pulling hair and being all uncomfortable. This is not that. It&#x27;s the wonky hairs from way down my neck to the normal ones. It&#x27;s pretty awesome. When i run this thing over my face daily it&#x27;s better than using my razor. No shave gel/cream needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Movember wages on it&#x27;s been a godsend to not have to navigate my face with a razor. Though i did let a few days stubble grow and it was too long for the shaver, yet too short for the trimmer. But hey, that trimmer! It just pushes right up into place. no hinges no snaps. Nice, smooth and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars</li>
            <li> I got the Braun Smart Control Shaver 130 S from Braun for free. When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t have to shave again for over a week. It&#x27;s done a really good job of giving me a really close shave. That&#x27;s one thing I love about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like, is that it takes a couple times for it to get all the hair off my face. It would be nice if I could shave over the hair once and it&#x27;s gone, but with this, it takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I&#x27;ve found with it, is the cord pops out of the shaver, multiple times per shave. This gets really annoying, especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry. Also, at times the bigger plug attached to the wall, comes out, It&#x27;s a bit on the heavier side for my wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the Braun Smart Control 130 s Shaver, and can forgive it for its flaws.</li>
            <li> i work a job that requires me to be clean shaven and hygienic and i found this product gave me a closer shave then most electric razors but left me feeling itchier... maybe its because i&#x27;m not used to the feeling of an electric razor but other then that one detail it is a fast and easy way to keep myself clean shaven and looking good for work. This was given to me for review by Braun.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great and has to be the best of its kind.  You cant beat it for the price. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Received this razor from Braun as part of a promotional program. I normally use my Norelco but have always wanted to try the Braun&lt;br /&gt;razors. My impressions: light weight and feels real nice when shaving, I can feel it roll all over the contours of my face and neck, it was real easy to clean, compared to the entry level Norelco, it did a better job. But I use the better Norelco and this Braun shaver did a poor job of shaving compare to it. This shaver in my opinion is designed  for the first time users of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I received this from Braun as I am a Buzzagent. I have always shaved with a straight edge razor and this was my first experience with an electric razor. Not bad!  Would I switch to using this as an everyday razor, no but that&#x27;s my personal preference. I do think this no frills razor would be perfect for a teen who is just starting to shave.  The shave is close and painless. Cleaning is a pleasure as the shaver can be cleaned in the sink. Overall a very nice product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> First off I shave everyday with a razor and I will say that I&#x27;ve only used one other electric razor. Braun sent me the 130s razor to test and give feedback. I was excited to try it as the other electric razor I&#x27;ve used had the three circular heads. I get razor burn extremely easy and was ready to test this \\&quot;foil\\&quot; style razor. I immediately opened the box and gave it a try. The razor cuts smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair. It might be slightly under powered for someone that doesn&#x27;t shave on a regular basis. I used the Braun 130s daily to replace my regular razor. After the first two days, the razor burn this razor caused was extremely hard to bare. I pushed on through and used it for the remainder of the week. Razor burn didn&#x27;t subside, but the razor does cut close. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and are looking for a nice budget razor this is a wonderful choice. the charge lasts fairly long and the razor is extremely easy to clean. The razor feels good in your hand and is comfortable to use, much more comfortable than the other electric razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, I prefer a fairly close shave. The shaver is nice and easy to pick up and go (with a cord) but takes quite a while to get a good shave with it compared to not electric blades. FYI Received it from BzzAgent, and they are awesome!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent so I could use it and give my opinion to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used an electric razor before so thought it would be a good opportunity to see what it is like to use one.  After my first use, I will never bother with an electric razor again.  I spent 15 minutes with the Braun trying to get a close shave.  I did not happen.  I ended up needing to shave a 2nd time with my regular safety razor and shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the plug keep popping out of the razor if I moved too far from the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good feature is the built in trimmer.  It works well for my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m glad I did not pay for this razor.  I&#x27;d be returning it to the store for a refund if I had.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a promotion from the company, and it was a good product overall.The BRAUN 130S SHAVER is a shaver by any other definition. The same design, and same mechanics as thousands of other shavers on the market. It was a good shave, and fulfilled its purpose. The colors I particularity like, but the size is perhaps a bit to bulky. The shaver was detailed, and worked about as good as a high price electric shaver. It was a good shave- not the best of my life -but good.</li>
            <li> I have used both a Remington and Braun razor for years.  I used the Remington triple round-head to get the longer whiskers because the original Brauns-- with their micro-hole screen heads-- simply didn&#x27;t pick up the longer hairs.  Then I&#x27;d save the Braun for last because once the hairs were short enough it shaved much more closely than the triple-heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However with this Smart Control shaver they&#x27;ve changed the head design so the holes are enlongated and facing different directions.  The result is a razor that catches more hairs (even nose and ear hairs if we wanna get graphic... you younger ones will understand when you get older).  However, even this design still leaves the longer hairs untouched.  It seems to be a flaw of the Braun line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving grace:  this has a trimmer that can be quickly popped out to get the long ones, which then easily shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember with any razor it&#x27;s necessary to lubricate it on a regular basis.  Braun includes oil with this, but I greatly prefer spray lubricant that is available in just about any razor department.  I make sure to clean and spray my razor at least once a week; it keeps it running nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the corded version rather than the rechargeable.  I prefer corded because of constant full-power reliability.  If you prefer rechargeable they&#x27;re only a few bucks more. As one user stated the cord does seem to pop out of this rather easily; one solution to that is a dab of silicon glue.  Worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my favorite razor ever used.  Dandy little gem for surprisingly low cost.  When it comes to razors you can spend as much money and get as fancy as you want.  But I believe this does as good a job of shaving as anything I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more expensive units may have stronger and faster motors, so remember that quality is remembered long after low price is forgotten and invest in your comfort zone.  I bought this just to try out the new design... and because it&#x27;s corded.. and because it&#x27;s corded.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion from Braun and I was impressed. It replaced my other shaver and the difference is night and day The new Braun gets a very close shave and is easy on my skin. The fact i can rinse it under running water makes for a much easier clean up as well. I would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a promotion with Braun and BzzAgent, Overall it is a good beginner razor.&lt;br /&gt;Opening up the product I went through everything and I was impressed that it actually came with oil! I have had many electric razors and none of them have come with the oil that is supposed to be used with the razor to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the &amp;#34;precision trimmer&amp;#34; I found it worked well on my thicker hair. While shaving my face it didn&#x27;t do very well, keeping in mind my beard grows in pretty thick and it is labeled &amp;#34;Perfect first shaver&amp;#34; on the box, I had my kids try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son (15) had great results and liked it. It did a good job and was easy for him to use. He didn&#x27;t like the cord tho, it is a little short and coiled kind of tight so he had to plug it back in a couple of times. Easy for him to take apart and clean too. This is his new razor now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (13) laughed a little at the power button when it &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; and called it old style. I&#x27;m sure this razor is more intended for boys than girls, but I had her use it anyways. It did well on armpits, and ok on her legs but is clearly designed for the flatter surface of a face than the rounded surface of legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how you can clean this one by rinsing it with water, after a few uses it seems you can never get an electric razor clean with only brushing it, and that it comes with the oil to follow up cleaning it. The razor seems pretty well built also, so I believe it will hold up well to the abuse a teenager will put it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for an electric for a beginner to shaving this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer than most shavers. It&#x27;s good if you are looking for that already grown in look but it still takes a little to achieve desirable look.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver a little over a month ago from Braun and had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, the experience so far has been underwhelming. I used to use a lot of electric razors but nowadays I use a manual razor. Here are the pros and cons:    Pros:  -The package came with a small brush and oil to help clean the shaver.  -The shaver doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair like a lot of other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  -The sideburns trimmer works well.    Cons:  -It takes way too long to shave, which completely eliminates the convenience factor. For my first time using it, I was in my bathroom and after 10 minutes, ended up just switching to a manual shave.  -As you&#x27;re shaving, it still leaves patches of untouched hair all over your face.  -Takes too long to charge. I don&#x27;t know if this was an issue with just my product but it seemed to take way too long to charge compared to other electric razors.  -You  need to have a mirror to use it. This is to ensure that you&#x27;re getting an easy shave. I tried using this in the car on the way to work but because it gives you a very un-even shave, you&#x27;ll have patches everywhere.</li>
            <li> Misses hairs, does a real shotty job.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun 130s Shaver to try for free in exchange for a review, but all opinions in this review are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked forward to trying out the Braun shaver because I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor since I was a teenager. Back then, I never found one that gave a good close shave, so I&#x27;ve always relied on a regular razor. I&#x27;d heard good things about Braun&#x27;s razors so I figured this was a great time to try one out. When I got the shaver, I plugged it right in, and tested it out the next morning. Despite the manual indicating it would charge while plugged, the razor never charged at all - it won&#x27;t turn on unless the razor is plugged in. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, except the cord is so short that it&#x27;s a real hassle to use, even with the socket right next to the sink. The cord comes out constantly. I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if the razor was amazing... But it barely cuts the hair at all, and definitely doesn&#x27;t give anything even close to a clean, close shave. If I had no other razor except this one, I&#x27;d look like I barely shaved at all. It takes forever to get it to cut any of my beard hair at all. For a beginner who didn&#x27;t really know any better, and for the relatively low price, I guess it&#x27;s not that bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Stick with a regular razor or spend the money to invest one of their better models, which are hopefully better products.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun 130 free to try and review. I was not impressed with the Braun razor. I have very thick facial hair and it wouldn&#x27;t shave at all if it was very long not even after 2 days of not shaving.  You would have to shave everyday to use this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Bausn 130s shaver as part of a promotional program from the manufacturer.  I tested out this shaver a half dozen times before deciding it is best used as a backup shaver.  First up, the power cord.  It is too short to be useful.  Because it does not attach to the shaver securely it continuously disconnected itself.  The shaver…  for some reason this shaver irritated my skin and caused redness.  The detail shaver is pretty useless for trimming up the area around up my ears.  It did not provide enough ‘umph to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> I shave approximately 3 times a week.  This shaver is a nice inexpensive option that gives me what i need.  Its a mid range shaver at a low end price.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> Great plug-in shaver. No batteries to run out of power in the middle of a shave. If you have an AC outlet, you can use this shaver as long as you want. It has a pop-up trimmer. It provides a nice close shave. Only four stars because of the power cord. The AC plug is HUGE - fully four inches long. I included a picture with a tape measure for reference. Make sure you have room for the AC plug. Other than that - it is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> This gave such a smooth shave. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a regular razor again. Thank you bzzagent. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> unit performs well..it is light and easy to use</li>
            <li> Decent shave, but you get what you pay for. With this wired model, I no longer have the power fade issues of the battery model. 100% blade speed at all times.</li>
            <li> The base shaver works quite well. It is . . FAR . . easier to claen than the 340 series Braun, but, being a corded shaver, you have to contend with it not staying plugged it. I have yet to be able to complete one shave without having the cord &amp;#34;pull out&amp;#34; of the shaver. In fact, if you don&#x27;t fully extend the power cord each time, before shaving, it pulls out before you get one half done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll have to break down and use electrical tape to hold the power cord in. Stupid problem to have.</li>
            <li> Not satisifed, the information for it wasn&#x27;t clear that it&#x27;s a corded razor only, and when plugged in it doesn&#x27;t peform well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. I tried to use it and it didn&#x27;t shave off anything at all!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and works great</li>
            <li> Works did not realize it was not a portable, needs to be plugged in.</li>
            <li> My shaver work&#x27;s great it trims great and the shave is awesomely close I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy two.</li>
            <li> Always a good product!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a month ago.  I&#x27;ve had many Braun shavers.  The most recent, the M-60,  worked on replaceable batteries only.  It had a few good shaves at high power with new batteries then not enough power.  I had to replace batteries too often and that&#x27;s expensive.  This one (130s-1) only works with a cord which is ok with me.  The power is good and consistent but the shave is only adequate not great on my tough beard.  The M-60 shaves better.  I think the difference is the head.  The M-60 has a thinner round head, the same profile from either side of the shaver.  The 130s-1 has a fatter head angled toward the front of the razor so you can only shave with that one side.  If Braun would make the M-60 a corded razor rather than replaceable batteries only then they would have a winning shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried the fancy, expensive &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; razors by Braun and they don&#x27;t shave well at all.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband as an early father&#x27;s day gift.  He likes it but tells me how much work it is to get his beard shaved the way he wants it. I think it&#x27;s because when you are of mixed race or African American your hair tends to be a little more course than the rest of the population so it&#x27;s not a good product for that hair type otherwise if you don&#x27;t mind the little extra effort to make it work for you, it&#x27;s a good performer.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I have the following comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t shave well.  I&#x27;m not referring to closeness.  It just stubbornly refused to cut many of the hairs even after working that area repeatedly.  Think patchwork quilt - not exactly the look I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;2) The power cord wouldn&#x27;t stay in.  Not a huge issue but was extremely annoying when coupled with comment #1.&lt;br /&gt;3)  The only reason I gave it any stars is the price point.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try a Braun razor, and at this price, I couldn&#x27;t pass. Being used to the triple head razors my whole life, I was skeptical about the Braun head. It performs really well. I am a believer.</li>
            <li> good out of my expect， somebody said it low power to shave， that i think bacause it 100v in us， but in china 220V ，double power……i bought it for my father， he say it good，so i buy 3another for me</li>
            <li> Nice little razor but pay attention, this one is NOT battery operated. If cords do not bother you, then great value for this item without the additional price for the battery operated one.</li>
            <li> This replaced a similar old inexpensive Braun made-in-Germany shaver that lasted for many years. The old shaver replaced a series of more-expensive rechargeable shavers that failed early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Smart Control shaver, even though it is made in China, because I will no longer buy rechargeable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor problem with the Smart Control shaver is the cord popping out of the shaver, typically 1 or 2 times per shave. The old Braun had this problem occasionally, but not nearly as often as with the Smart Control shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bigger problem with the Smart Control shaver is that it takes me at least 5 passes to get a good shave (but that shave is better than the shave with the old Braun). If not for this problem, I would give the shaver 5 stars. I&#x27;m willing to put up with this problem to avoid the cost of replacing rechargeable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good feature of the the Smart Control shaver is that the shaved hair stays in the shaver (the old Braun leaked shaved hair even when it was new).</li>
            <li> My old Braun 105 was getting old and starting to fall apart so I needed to replace it with a newer shaver.  I don&#x27;t like rechargeables because they just don&#x27;t have the power to get a close shave.  When you push firmly against your face they bog down and go slower.  From my experience the corded models don&#x27;t have this fault, you push hard and they just shave closer.  So, I was hoping this would do as a replacement.  After all, it&#x27;s a Braun just like my old 105.  So disappointed!  It has a very weak motor to begin with.  For some reason it also doesn&#x27;t shave your beard.  You go over and over the same spot and you still feel a 5:00 shadow.  If you try to push harder to get closer the head pops off.  WTF?&lt;br /&gt;The good news is I only wasted $30.  The bad news it I wasted $30.  Braun should feel ashamed for selling such a lame product.  I&#x27;ve used their shavers for more than 20 years.  Can&#x27;t they just sell a simple corded shaver that shaves close and has the power to do the job, like they did so many times in the past?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun razors for over 20 years.  My old model 55 was replaced because the on/off switch died.&lt;br /&gt;This razor does the job but is under powered for a corded razor.  I have an average beard and this model 130 responds weakly to a full cut.  Without a doubt it&#x27;s the low voltage running through this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like being able to clean the razor by running it under hot water, no doubt a benefit of the low voltage.  And the razor does shave close as other Braun&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past do.  This is my 5th Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this model&#x27;s trimmer which is at a difficult angle to use easily.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I only give this model 3 out 5 possible stars.&lt;br /&gt;Judi&#x27;s husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Model 130 has a huge plug/transformer, so if you have a tight place to plug it in - be forwarned</li>
            <li> wow. I hate to write a bad review, and I&#x27;ve been a fan of braun in the past, but this shaver is really, really horrible. The reason I bought it was because it is so hard to find a shaver that is not rechargeable. I really don&#x27;t like rechargeable because they are usually so much heavier. But unfortunately, that should not be a reason to buy a razor. This one does not cut well and since you have to go over the same area so many time, it irritates my face.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I have been using a razor for my shaving needs, but for many years used a variety of electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this razor I was eager to give electric another shot at my shaving needs.  It&#x27;s lightweight and does need to be plugged in, but the coiled cord has enough give and strength as to not come unplugged during use, and enough flexibility to maneuver my face.  The foil cut does require a few passes to catch most of the hair, but the shave is pretty close and resulted in absolute no burn.  I also enjoy that the hair doesn&#x27;t end up in the sink and is early cleaned under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot for work, and the ease of using this razor has resulted in me making the switch from blade to electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Got it free from BzzzAgent, but my review is my own.</li>
            <li> Work really good is easy,light and easy to clean. I received it as promotion from the company and i am very happy with the shaver and i think is a really god present for this christmas.</li>
            <li> This is a no frills basic shaver but given this fact it has some benefits over the trend of new cordless shavers on the market today. It is corded so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the running out of power part of the way through a shave. Coupled with a larger motor and the fact that there isn&#x27;t an arc in power according to the charge level this will give you a more consistent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head has excellent movement and the screen has very small micro holes eliminating alot of the &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; that you might get with some of the 3 head razors that have longer slots in the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I found is that given the small micro screen it doesn&#x27;t shave my really coarse wiry hair as well as my older Norelco 3 head which has the slots in the screen. I tested it out on some shorter finer hair on my forearm and it easily shaved it down smooth with one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the market for this razor is going to be teenagers, college age adults, or adults with fine soft facial hair that don&#x27;t mind the limitations that a corded shaver might provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No worrying about charge level&lt;br /&gt;Does shave very close first pass on finer, softer hair&lt;br /&gt;Head has great movement&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are very cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Performance is not great on really coarse wiry hair&lt;br /&gt;The cord could be longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shaver for free form BzzAgent in lieu of providing an honest review.</li>
            <li> I use to use a styptic pencil a lot of times.  I would shave with a disposable razor and I would always cut or nick my face.  Cold water and after shave never helped I would always have to get out the styptic pencil to stop the bleeding.  Now that I have gotten the Braun Smart Control 130s Shaver, I never have to use the styptic pencil again.  I was so lucky to be able to try the Braun 130S straight from the Braun manufactory.  They sent me the razor and to be honest I was not to big on an electric razor but I thought hey I will try it since it was free.  Now that I have tried it I am so happy and glad I did.  Braun has undone themselves with this razor it is light and so easy to use that it makes me wonder why I had not been using one before now.  Not only is it easy to use but the shave is just as smooth as it was with the blade.  Thanks Braun for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Works well but it does not hold charge. I have to have it plugged. Other than that, its alright. Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 13 year old just beginning to shave.  He didn&#x27;t want a tradiitonl razor so I got him this one.  Great beginniner shaver. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Wal Mart brand electric shaver. I was hesitant to pay even the $30 for this, the cheapest of Braun shavers, but I figured brand name must be worth it. boy was I wrong. Once I tried using this thing for about a month I figured this had to be Braun playing a joke on us- that maybe they are sending the real razor soon to my house. This thing is not capable of shaving even, due to it&#x27;s horrible design. It is basically a plastic screen with unsharpened plastic blades on the inside that move back and forth against the screen. it won&#x27;t cut the hair on your face, but every now and then if you are lucky it will pull some of the hair out for you. If I could get my money back I would. Since I can&#x27;t, I will never buy from this company again. Even your cheapest product should be functional; selling something like this shows you want to make a quick buck by ripping people off of their hard earned money for products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Very good. Not great. Must pass over a few times to get a clean shave. Great that this is Not battery powered!!!!!!!  Most shavers are recharge battery powered that will need replacing.  Few cord-only shavers like this one.</li>
            <li> keep in midn this thing is way different from other products from the Braun family in that it doesn´t charge by itself. It needs to be plugged in to a power outlet. It has almost no HP</li>
            <li> I have ordered it and received a defective non working shaver. I figured with Amazon its so easy to replace it so I did get another one and sure enough the same problem it does not work. Basically its a paper weight so I returned the second one and bough a different brand, I am done with Braun. 2 new shavers dead on arrival this is not a coincidence!!!!.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The shave is close enough for me. I suppose if you spend more you could get a closer shave. It works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great day to be the best buyer</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted with the &amp;#34;corded&amp;#34; foil shave. Just one issue: the trimmer goes parallel to the shave so it&#x27;s hard to use. The trimmer itself does not even extend enough over the shave so when using it to trim your sideburns, for example,  the shave hits your face. Otherwise I love it.</li>
            <li> I received this new Braun Smart Controls Shaver directly from the company. I must say that I am impressed with the device. I like the closeness of the shave as well as the size and design of the device.  I definitely think it&#x27;s the best in it&#x27;s category and the price point is not that bad either. Go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li> For $20 bucks can&#x27;t beat it.  My Braun 1 series 190 s starting to age out, sometimes wouldn&#x27;t  start.  Used it several times with good results..</li>
            <li> This cordless shaver doesn&#x27;t work without the cord. I have had it plugged in the first time for 8 hours, then 12 hours and finally 20 hours. When I unplugged it and turned it on, there was nothing. But I did find out that as long as it is plugged in, it worked very well. So, in my opinion, I would not buy this shaver again and would and will tell others, not to buy this shaver.</li>
            <li> I will make this review short and sweet and not give boring and obvious details as to why I wanted to purchase a razor. This damn piece of junk gives a terrible shave! I can go over and over my face and it&#x27;s still fairly rough. I don&#x27;t have some &amp;#34;super whiskers&amp;#34; so any decent new shaver should work, they have in the past. I am VERY DISSAPOINTED and am frankly shocked on just how lousy the shave is! Yes, it is an inexpensive model, but man...it still should shave at lease decent. Those that are stating it shaves &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; or whatever, either got very lucky, have no real real whiskers to speak of, or perhaps I &amp;#34;just happened&amp;#34; to get a very poorly made one. You have been warned!!</li>
            <li> I was currently on the market or a shaver to replace the one that died on me a ew months ago and i gave this one a shot i got it or free in return for this review, and ater using it for two weeks i can say its not that bad i like how its multi functional u can go from diffrent blades without changing heads which is awesome..only reason im giving three stars is the act that u have to be plugged in to use it, i didnt like that because i like to move around when i shave. with that being said its a pretty good shaver besides that minor deault</li>
            <li> For a person who is just starting to shave this is a good piece.  I found that this razor pulled as much as it cut sometimes.  it also did not offer a very close shave.  this could also be caused but the fact that I have a really thick beard even after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably a great razor for a high school kid who is just learning how to shave and who&#x27;s family doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on it.</li>
            <li> I recived this product from the brand to try out and review and I personly think this is a great product everything on it works great it got a close shave and left my face feeling good with no irritation like a standerd razor altho i had one problem and that was with the cord it seemed to come loose alot and fall out of the shaver but other than that the prouduct works great!!!</li>
            <li> I got this through a free program. For what it costs to the  consumer it is decent, but save up for a little better razor. The shaver itself does a decent job but the foil on it is super flimsy. The foil is supposed to capture all the hairs but because of this the foil will not capture everything. The razor does a decent job to get rid of large beard growth but not for a close shave like you get in a barber shop. Obviously a higher class Braun razor is going to be better but this one will do the job for a new shaver or someone with light growth. For somebody who needs a close shave every day I would recommend either a high end foil razor, a safety razor or a straight razor. There are plenty of options in all three categories with the straight razor being the hardest and the foil being the easiest to use, but the quality of shaves go in the reverse direction. I personally use a Double edge razor and I have great success with it. Nothing against Braun, I used them for a long time, but this product isn&#x27;t going to change my views. Maybe a higher level razor.</li>
            <li> Great shavers for the price. I owned a Braun for 18 years and it is still working. We will see how long these last... Anyway, they are cheaper than the spare foil, so I bought two...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Power cord needs to is not attached good to the machine so it&#x27;s often falls down. Also it doesn&#x27;t provide fast shave. It  takes while to shave in the morning with this machine.</li>
            <li> The cord unplugs sometimes, but over all I like it a lot. I like how you can wash it off to clean it. very convenient.</li>
            <li> Braun sent this to me as a promotion, and it&#x27;s great for exactly what it&#x27;s advertised for, a great first shaver(printed right on the box). I went with out shaving for a couple of days and then tried it. The shaver left my face nice and smooth but it took more than a few times of going over and over. With that said I&#x27;m a grown man, and definitely don&#x27;t fall into the category of having my first shaver. This product is great for a teen or young man. A last note, the trimmer feature is handy and works great.</li>
            <li> Overall the shaver is a good shaver. The trimmer is a great aspect for the shaver. The actual shaver could be a lil better it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would normally like. I received this razor as a free product to test and review all in all it gets the job done. I do love the trimmer that&#x27;sthe best part.</li>
            <li> This is a good cheap razor for a beginner. Someone with little hair, and no experience shaving. It didn&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll for me, I can grow a full beard and the razor kept pulling at my hair instead of cutting it. I&#x27;ll stick with traditional wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I just posted the following review on a Remington MS2-100 page....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the mS2-100 after an older micro-screen needed new heads that cost more than the $19.95 clearance sale price at Big Lots,(I believe). I loved this shaver and there was no battery to run down while shaving or to go bad incl the ones in so called Corded-Cordless ones. When the heads needed replacing on it I got the SP69 kit and neither I nor my son could insert the screen without deforming it so I returned it. I have used mainly Remington Shavers since the early 60&#x27;s when I got a RollaMatic which I still have in it&#x27;s nice hard case. Now Remington offers numerous rechargeable versions which I won&#x27;t buy since I never had one that I liked but no corded only version.After all the remingtons I have had, I feel betrayed. Norelco still offers a corded shaver but doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as fast as a micro-screen. Recently,I picked up a Braun 130-S (corded only) for just $29.95 and it shaves just as good and no stubble leaks out on the sink or my chest!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS FOR NOTHING REMINGTON and thank you Braun for a much needed OVERDUE product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/7/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the late update. The shaver worked well for about 3-4 weeks then got slower and slower and the shave became worse.  Maybe it had bad Screen/Cutter as it seemed to have slowly gotten dull so I returned it for a refund.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result I think the 130S should be rated 3-1/2 stars but could not find a way&lt;br /&gt;to change the original rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got the SP-69 Foil and Cutter replaced properly and the good ole MS2-100 is back in business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someday a mfr will fill this void.  At least Braun tried; unlike you know who!!</li>
            <li> Great little corded razor.  Light, easy to handle, small for packing/travel, no worries as to state of charge as in rechargeable sister products.&lt;br /&gt;Best shaving razor I have had.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these shavers as my battery rechargeable shavers were dying.  Not only do battery shavers require charging and waiting for them to charge, they often die out in the middle of shaving...and you have to either replace the expensive battery or discard the shaver.  It is very hard to find true electric shavers (cord only).  Braun, Norelco, and Remington make usually one model only.  I also purchased, on Amazon, two brand new Remington Microscreen DA-57 cord only electric shavers that are superb.  They are brand new but old stock as Remington doesn&#x27;t make them anymore.  However, these Brauns (of which I bought 4) are outstanding value, high quality, strong warranty, and work worldwide.  It takes me about two minutes more to shave with these than my Remingtons, but they do an excellent job.  They are also quiet, easy to hold in my hand, and very easy to clean as they are single blade only.  Single blade shavers also tend not to pull whiskers like dual screens sometimes do.  Another feature I really like about this shaver is that it has both an On and Off button.  Most shavers have only one button which can wear out because it&#x27;s used to turn the shaver both on and off, but the two dedicated buttons are a smart idea.  Of course, some people always save their buttons by leaving the cord plugged in the shaver and simply plugging/unplugging from the outlet.  There has been much discussion about the two different foils this shaver has had since its introduction.  One is the original round-hole design.  It works well, is quick, and seems to be popular; however, Braun now only sells the shaver with the Smart Control design.  I&#x27;ve used both as I have been able to still buy the round hole foils.  The round hole design is quicker but the Smart Foil does better where whiskers grow in different directions or in hard-to-reach places.  Also, I have experienced no razor burn with this shaver with either foil.  Unlike rechargeables that will die and have to be thrownout, or force you to buy an expensive battery, these shavers (and the Remington Microscreens) are true electric shavers.  The Remingtons are still available on Amazon by the way as of today (1/15/16).  These Brauns and Remingtons will outlast any rechargeable and...no waiting.  You have instant power and consistent power.  These shavers are electric so they will not vibrate like some battery-operated rechargeables.  Finally, I recently tested Braun&#x27;s flagship shaver, the 9095cc.  It is several hundred dollars.  It is beautiful and has a liquid cleaning system, but I found it shaves the same, for me, as this $20 model...and eventually, the 9095cc will have to have its battery replaced.  All in all, this Braun is an excellent shaver.  Some say it is for beginners, but I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver since high school (50 years ago) and this works great for me with an average beard, but I do shave everyday.  The one negative, as I mentioned, is it taking a couple of minutes more than the Remington.  It is likely because the motor in the Braun is a small one.  I would bet, however, it is a long-lasting one, certainly longer than any battery rechargeable shaver.  I strongly suspect these pure electric shavers will outlast their two-year warranty.  Update:  1/21/17:  After about two years, my Brauns are still doing very well.  I rotate these with my other shavers so really haven&#x27;t had to change the foil or cutter.  Super easy to clean, lightweight, easy to manuever.  The single cutter doesn&#x27;t pull like my dual Remington Microscreens can; however, it still takes a couple of minutes more to shave than with the Remington.  These work great overseas too, automatically adjusting to the voltage without having to use a transformer...just a country-specific plug.  I was lucky to pay less than $20 for these as they are more expensive, but these are a high quality, good shaving, no battery, no hassle shaver.</li>
            <li> I never used an electric shaver before so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It didn&#x27;t get all the hairs so I had to use the razor to finish the job. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor as part of a promotion from the brand. It gave me a nice close shave. My girlfriend couldn&#x27;t quit rubbing my cheeks as they were &amp;#34;soft and smooth&amp;#34; to her. It definitely takes time to figure this razor out, as I had to shave against the grain,but overall I enjoy using it. It gives me a close shave,it&#x27;s quieter than normal shavers. Only con is that it only works when plugged in so it could use a longer cord.  Braun is a great brand and this isn&#x27;t my first time using their brand, won&#x27;t be the last either.</li>
            <li> I loves thats it trims and gives you a close shave thank you Braun for let me try this for free it is a awesome shaves for all kinds of occasions.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and when I got this from Braun, I never thought it would work correctly, especially because I am not a big fan of electric razors in general.  It did a really nice job as long as my beard was kept relatively short.  I think it works best when you DON&#x27;T wash your face first and when you use it every day.  It gave a really surprising close shave for an electric.  I was pretty impressed with it overall.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent I received this electric razor from Braun to test and review.    I used this razor for the past two weeks and would best describe it as a beginners or entry level electric razor.    Pros to using this electric shaver include a hassle free shave session with out the mess of creams or need for running water. The attached trimmer is a bonus for tackling long stubble or cleaning up sideburns. The cord means no waiting for recharges and power on demand.    Cons to this product would include the cord, it would constantly disconnect and pull out of the base of the shaver. The shaver lacked the power to address anything past a five o&#x27;clock shadow.    Overall I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with this razor because of its insufficient power and problems with the cord. The shaver required me to repeatably go over and over the same spot to get a marginally close shave. If you have thick stubble, as do I, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver simply because it doesn&#x27;t have the motor to make the cut, literally. On the other hand if you&#x27;re looking for an economical corded razor or a travel razor you wouldn&#x27;t be upset about loosing then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver with one exception. The cord easily falls out. I don’t think this would be a problem if the outlet was near the mirror that is being used to shave with or if this model eventually comes with a rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;I have a full beard and really like the trimmer attachment on the shaver. It was easy to keep my neck line trimmed with it. The shaver does a good job on the areas of my face where I do not want my beard to grow.&lt;br /&gt;The feature to be able to run the shaver under warm water to clean it is very nice. It helps to remove hairs more quickly than the tradition brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nicely made product and I would recommend it to persons with a light beard growth. I tested this product on behalf of the company.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver from Braun and it was a decent shaver for the suggested price. I was unaware it had to be plugged in the entire time and that was a little annoying due to the curled cord but it got the job done. My advice: save a little more money and go for a better version.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use a straight razor. I&#x27;ve never been much of a fan of electric razors. After getting the 130s in the mail I was quite excited. The first couple of shaves were great. It was quick, and got surprisingly close. But once I let my beard grow out a little more this became more of a project then a quick task... Most of the time I just ended up busting out the straight razor....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem though, is that razors are so expensive. If I bought a decent razor, it would cost me almost half the cost of this shaver... Which has definitely outlasted every razor in my house. So looking at the big picture, I&#x27;m definitely glad I got this razor. Unless I need a super close shave, I&#x27;ll pick up the 130s before my bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I liked about the razor was the sleek design. All in all it looks like a nice shaver. It&#x27;s easy to take apart and clean which is another big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major downfall I&#x27;ve noticed thus far has been then power cord. It falls out at least 2-3 times per shave.... Which can be rather annoying....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not as annoying as replacing batteries constantly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, 4 stars. I would definitely recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> I received a Braun Smart Control 130s-1 Shaver free from the company to test and review. After multiple tries to charge this product it would not hold a cordless charge at all. I tried various outlets and reading the instructions many times but nothing worked. I am glad I received this for free as opposed to spending money on the product. While the instructions themselves and the product seems easy enough to use it would have been nice to actually use the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a razor and shaving cream type of guy. I often have a problem with sensitivity. So, I decided to look at an electric shaver.  The Braun 130s was a welcome change. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for a week now with zero problems with sensitivity. It&#x27;s quiet , and easy to use. Clean up is a snap. It perfectly adjusts to the contours of my face. My only problem with it is the coiled &amp;#34;phone style&amp;#34; chord. If its a coiled style chord, it need to be longer. This one is too short. Overall though, I would definitely recommend the Braun 130s shaver, and will be using it every day.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty well and close. It is a nice comfortable shave. But it get&#x27;s very annoying because the cord keeps coming out of the razor when shaving. Overall it is a good razor but they need to fix the cord issue. I do want to mention that I received this razor as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I got this free from BzzAgent! It&#x27;s the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The thing is though electric razors have all been pretty bad for me. I have a very thick beard and even though this was the best and closest shave of them all, it still took quite a while. Also the cord doesn&#x27;t stay in the shaver well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors for most my adult life until I received this Braun electric shaver from BzzAgent,and I  truly love using it. It shaved smooth and close I truly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I like the razor and need the razor because of the single blade or cutting head, whichever you prefer to call it. As for me, Braun needs to greatly improve a couple of problems! The power cord will not stay connected to the power connection in the razor! It simply pulls out without any force at all! The other complaint is, the razor head has came off a few times in the middle of shaving which I&#x27;m sure does the cutting blades no good at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will still buy them because of the design, a singe cutter head which no other maker does it seem to matter to!</li>
            <li> PROS- This shaver did an okay job of removing hair without pulling, it comes apart easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;CONS- Cord falls out easily when using this shaver, takes way longer to shave with this as compared to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a pretty close shave but it takes a few passes to get it there. I am also seeing that the cord pops out of the shaver after a little use. I guess for the price they are selling it, its not a bad little guy. It&#x27;s a lot better than having to buy disposables and gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I got this product free from Braun)</li>
            <li> First time i had used an electric shaver in atleast 10 years, need less to say last one wasn&#x27;t good. I was surprised this shaver wasn&#x27;t bad, skin was a little irratated afterwards but overall not a bad shaver. If your looking for a cheap, inexpensive shaver this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun 130S Smart Control Shaver from the manufacturer as part of a promotional offer that gives you the opportunity to try the razor and provide honest feedback about your experience. After taking it for quite a few test runs, here’s my rundown on the pros and cons that every man wants to know when purchasing an electric razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness – (You know, If I shave before work will I look like a beach bum by close of business, or will I still be smooth enough to snuggle up to my lady when I get home?) This thing provided a pretty close shave that did not leave too bad of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had but good enough to be rated as a pro rather than a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain Factor: Pulling/Irritation – (Is my face going to win a painful game of tug-o-war or feel  like I got slap-chopped by an NFL linebacker, or will this thing deliver a smooth, painless shave without the afterburn?) The product really delivered in this regard. Although it took a few passes I did not experience any pulling or irritation while the razor was on. The only time it pulled was when the cord came out of the end and cut me off mid shave (More on that in the next section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning – (Is this thing gona spill stubble all over my sink or travel bag?) Cleaning this thing was a breeze. All you have to do is pop off the cover and run it under the water for a few seconds. Really leaves no stubble to spill out of the screen. Easy Peazy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effort/ Time – (Is this thing gona cut the forest in one pass, or am I gona be here a while?) I wasn’t overly impressed by the ability of the shaver to provide a clean shave with minimal effort or time. On average, daily shaving of yesterday’s stubble took about ten minutes and had to pass about 5 -6 times to get a clean shave. I can only imagine that the effort would increase if you missed a shave here or there (lookout Movember).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power supply - (Is this thing gona get me through several shaves or shut off while clearing the runway?). Although the manual included with the razor says it is a rechargeable (I can only assume its for a different model), it is actually a corded razor so there is no need to worry about losing power unless you are not near an outlet. Normally this would be a pro and not a con, however, the cord does not seat well into the end of the razor and comes out at least once per shave. This causes the razor to pull and was rather annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, I had to base my rating on the fact that the razor says that it is a beginner&#x27;s razor right on the box. If you are just entering the shaving world and do not grow a full beard in a few days, this would be a great starting razor for the price if you can get past the few minor annoyances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are a fully grown man (or sasquatch) this is most likely not the razor for you. Save your money and go with an upgrade as this thing will most likely end up in junior&#x27;s grooming kit in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a Braun electric for the past 6 or 7 years before I bought this one a few weeks ago.  The one I had was the cheaper model, like this one.  It cost around $30.&lt;br /&gt;  I have to say Braun seems to have taken a couple of steps in the wrong direction with the current model.  The new foil is great and helps pick up all the troublesome whiskers. Thats about all the good I have to say regarding this model.  My gripes are threefold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  no battery.  This is not all that big of an inconvenience.  But the $30 model used to come with a battery, so I feel this is definitely a black mark.&lt;br /&gt;2) The cord socket.  Now I am really puzzled at why the cord, which must be attached at all times to use the shaver (because...you know..no battery) is detachable at all.  But, it is, and life goes on. Except the damned thing keeps falling out.&lt;br /&gt;3) SERIOUSLY??  An OFF button?  This is the first time I can ever remember seeing any device with a separate button to turn it off. For the life of me, I can&#x27;t think of a single reason why this is good.  It has to be cheaper to produce a single button power on/off than to put separate buttons for on and off, so why in the world do it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will trudge along with this shaver for the next few years until it croaks but unless I read that Braun has done an about-face with their budget model, I&#x27;m done with them.</li>
            <li> as other reviews have indicated, the cord on this is too short.  my outlet is just a foot or so from my sink/mirror, but the cord would regularly pull out from the shaver because its not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did not find the braun to provide a great shave either - pehaps it takes some getting used to, which was not going to happen with the short cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its pretty hard to find good corded shavers at this time.  unfortunately, this turned  out not to be one either.</li>
            <li> I DO LIKE THE RAZOR BUT THE PRINTED  INFORMATION IS NOT FOR THE 130-S, WHICH IS A CORDED RAZOR. THE INFORMATION IS FOR A CORDLESS 150 TYPE. BRAUN KNEW THIS AND HAS NOT CORRECTED THE ISSUE. I WAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION I HAD TO CHARGE THE RAZOR-UNTIL I FOUND ON THE PACKAGE IN NOT LARGE PRINT KIND OF HARD TO SEE-THAT IT&#x27;S CORDED NOT A RECHARGEABLE RAZOR!! WAKE UP BRAUN-YOU&#x27;RE DROPPING THE BALL.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free to review and have to say I&#x27;m fairly impressed. It works well gives a clean smooth shave. My skin is very sensitive and this razor has not caused any irritation. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After receiving this I immediately tried it and it did not work at all. It was my first electric razor which so I wasn&#x27;t sure if i was just me but it simply did not work. Jokingly I ran it across my beard and eyebrows and nothing happened,  a complete was of time.</li>
            <li> Full Disclosure, I received this product from the manufacturer as part of a test / trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Experience:  I have been shaving with a default razor for some time now.  So Trying out the electric razor seemed like a good plan since it would help with having to always be re-buying the cartridges for razor.&lt;br /&gt;I opened this thing up and discovered it’s extremely light, which is good if you travel, only bummer is that you do have to plug it in for it to work.  It’s not battery operated.  When I knew it was being sent to me, I didn’t realize that would be corded.  So keep that in mind.  Granted, if you look at the price point, I suppose that makes sense.  That being said until you use the chord enough, it can be a bit “short” feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I’ve used it for a wee bit now.  It shaves pretty close, though it is not like the razor where you can just do a swipe.  Takes a lot of “driving” over the same areas.  I found it takes me a wee bit longer to shave with this device, but then again you don’t have to deal with lather and such when getting ready.  I will say the sideburn trimmer part is quite convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it’s not a bad razor.  It’s my first electric in over 10 years, and it gets the job done.  It does shave and get in pretty close, and the price is quite cheap.  Ultimately, I think I’m going to move back to my default razor method.  This razor for some reason caused me some issues with little bumps under my chin when I shave which I think occurs because I have to repeatedly go over the area.  I guess it’s a bit of personal preference too, I think my default razor gets in closer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Lightweight, Not Messy, and Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Takes a bit longer, not battery operated, and I had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I thought this unit would work without being plugged in.  Also I feel as though that you have to go over the same area about 5 times inorder to get a close shave. I have owned much better shavers in the past, and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun 130 for free to try and review. I had never used an electric shaver prior to trying this shaver and was excited to see if it would work for me.  As part of my normal shaving routine I shave immediately after exiting the shower and use shaving cream and a mach 3 razor.  When I opened the package I was impressed by it&#x27;s look and feel and its features which includes being 100% waterproof/washable and a precision trimmer. Unfortunately after trying the shaver I found that it did not give me a very clean shave, I tried on a number of occasions using different techniques and I could never get the shave as clean as when using a traditional razor.  I do like the precision trimmer to trim and shape the sideburns.</li>
            <li> Works great and glad it doesn&#x27;t need batteries.  Very simple and effective design.  Exactly what I wanted in a shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery is the only problem. The charge remains for only two days. Up to three times use before recharge required. Rechargeable battery technology is not as advertised. Strict battery maintenance is difficult to adhere to by most people.</li>
            <li> The shaver works, but if not used every day, it does not cut the all the (longer) hairs. The longer they get, the lower the chance it can cut them, even if you go over the spot many times in many directions.</li>
            <li> If you only is a new teenager starting doing it , that´s the product&lt;br /&gt;But if not, don´t buy this , you will have to buy another model</li>
            <li> I try it one week and it&#x27;s not shaving , I still need to use my old shaver to do the job and I want to return it back</li>
            <li> I ordered two of them and both had batteries that wouldn&#x27;t take a charge. Returned them and got a refund.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  I Braun shaver for $15!  The replacement blades cost more than that.  But it works great so far.  If it&#x27;s normal Braun quality, it should last many years</li>
            <li> This is a Corded Shaver, NOT a battery-powered one. That is the Reason I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - Cons - - - -&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up Trimmer is under-powered, meaning I must use my old Shaver on my Thicker Hair (Beard)&lt;br /&gt;It Left only a Couple hairs un-shaved.&lt;br /&gt;The Instructions were useless, but also un-needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - Pros - - - -&lt;br /&gt;A Single Razer-strip, means this razor does NOT pull your hair. It cuts clean, no Irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Included mini-brush, to keep the Razor clean, and ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Corded power tools always have more raw POWER than Battery-powered Tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - Bottom-Line - - - -&lt;br /&gt;Braun just bought themselves a life-long Customer with such a Great Product.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a new retail item. but the box was already opened, and something was spilled on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. No battery to die. Plug in only. Works well and fairly priced. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Shipment was received okay.. will not keep a charge.</li>
            <li> Good shaver does the job.  It also has a nice trimmer.  Super value at a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for 2 weeks straight now-daily (I shave my head, and trim beard/shave neck). I wanted to be as detailed as possible about its advantages and disadvantages.    Personally, I have been super annoyed with the cord, it consistently falls out. I probably plug it in twice, every time I use it.    That said, it is an awesome BEGINNER shaver. It does the bare minimum of what I need. It leaves my head moderately smooth for a shaver. Also, I have never pulled out any hairs, which is a plus as well. I know some cheaper beginner shavers, pull out hairs sometimes.    The trick to this trimmer is to not push too hard.    It takes me a long time with this to shave my head, as opposed to a traditional razor, but it definitely does work. It gets relatively close to the skin without irritation.    I love the washable feature though. It is nice and helpful, even though most shavers have a washable feature.    In all, I would not get another one. It works, but I would rather spend a few more dollars on one that is made to handle tasks like my beard a little better. (I have a nice thick beard)    If this is for a 14 year old who is growing a few whiskers on his chin, buy it for him.    If you&#x27;re older than 20 and growing full beards, leave this one for others. Not worth the money.    Also, I received this item from a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I give this shaver four stars because I&#x27;m overall impressed with it. It gave me a pretty close shave that worked perfect with the style I like to keep. The trimmer also worked good for my sideburns and hair around my ears. I also used this to trim my body hair and it did a good job. It never pulled or snagged my hairs. It works very good for the price point. A lot better than the last store brand that I bought. I would recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money or those who like to use the trimmer part. This was given to me to test and I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I love my Braun smart control 130s. It&#x27;s the best razor I ever used. I got a real smooth close shave with minimal effort. I would definitely suggest this razor to anyone who is looking to start shaving or anyone that is already shaving and not satisfied with their current razor. I have already suggested this to all of my family and friends.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave really good.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and this razor simply does not cut it. To start with, it took me over 10 minutes to shave under half of my face, and there were whiskers left all over the place. I simply do not have half an hour to shave my face in the morning, and it does not do a good enough job of being used as a trimmer to keep my beard relatively tame. Yes the shave was comfortable but it was neither close enough or fast enough for me to use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my biggest problem with the razor, outside of the shave quality, is the fact it does not have a battery. On multiple occasions the razor unplugged from the wall and stopped. This was very inconvenient and added to my overall dissatisfaction of the razor and shaving experience.</li>
            <li> i received this shaver from braun when used it does not seem to leave a very close shave about a five o clock shadow and the cord likes to fall out every once in a while but it sure beats waiting for a cordless to charge. I guess for a beginner the shaver would be fine but for the every day shaver i would not recommend it</li>
            <li> Received this razor as a trial from BzzAgent.  I&#x27;m glad I did not purchase item as I have coarse facial hair and even though it is shaved daily this razor did not work well.  It does not provide a close smooth shave and also pulled the hair often.  My nephew who has softer facial hair tried it and found it to be very good for his hair type.  Still not as smooth as a blade razor, but very nice for daily use.  On softer hair it seemed to shave quickly and almost as well as more expensive razor that I have used for years.  Overall this is a great razor for a young man starting to shave (probably 5 star- great value, good product, seems well made and will last).  If you have coarse hair or except to use this razor after a few days growth, this is not the product for you, hence the 3 stars as it did not work well for me.</li>
