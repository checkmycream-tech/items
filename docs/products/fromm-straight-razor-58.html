    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have been very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li>My advices is save you pennies and buy something like a Dove Best Quality or an entry level</li>
            <li>This Razor is not rated as the best quality out there, but it works great for me.</li>
            <li>it comes out to a beautiful edge.  </li>
            <li>razor keeps an edge very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I did so successfully and like to shave every day ...</li>
            <li>I also have a Dovo Astrale, and the Fromm seems just as good a shaver.    </li>
            <li>So, I researched razors that were budget-friendly, but also had a good reputation.</li>
            <li>It will not hold a good edge.</li>
            <li>Be advised, a good, ready-to-shave (</li>
            <li>Some people seem to get a good shave, others don’t.  </li>
            <li>yes I have experience sharpening and honing and stropping my own razor from start to finish.</li>
            <li>I thought this would make a nice gift...</li>
            <li>Appearance-wise it is a nice razor.</li>
            <li>I heard Fromm was a good brand, and was happy to find an economical blade to start out with.</li>
            <li>Even with the protective packaging, that&#x27;s a good thing as a fine edge</li>
            <li>The blade itself seems to be very good, and I find it best to keep the blade well honed by stropping it both just before shaving, and again right after; I wash the blade carefully before doing the post shave stropping.    </li>
            <li>It is very, VERY cheap looking steel and</li>
            <li>I am learning to sharpen it on my own and it works fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>My 5 dollar pocket knife is straighter than this and can be used to shave better ...</li>
            <li>would it be for him to be able to try this out the day he receives it?\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Coinciding with that philosophy, you might as well purchase honing stones to avoid honing maintenance fees to save even more money in the long-term.</li>
            <li>I warped edge also does damage to strops which cost you more</li>
            <li>I was happy when the straight razor arrived.</li>
            <li>This wedge razor is just ok even after having to send it off to be sharpened.  </li>
            <li>I’ve successfully honed to “shave ready” a couple of Dovos,  a TI and even a Gold Dollar.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to sharpen, and gives a close, comfortable save.</li>
            <li>You have to do some light honing to get a shaving edge.</li>
            <li>When I looked into this one, I felt comfortable with the balance between the product reviews and the price.</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving with shaving oil and foam.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>however I sent it off to a honing service and was told it is a cheap razor and would neither hone, nor shave well.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor thinking I would be able to shave with it right away.</li>
            <li>Once sharp, it shaves nice with good balance in hand.</li>
            <li>Nice quality high carbon blade made in Solingen.  </li>
            <li>However, as elegant as the razor looks at first hand, the product is somewhat of a defected one.</li>
            <li>Damascus steel that will take a super fine edge still,</li>
            <li>This straight razor from fromm(lol) is beautiful and I was really looking forward to trying straight shaving.</li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;how cool</li>
            <li>Honing requires either purchasing another set of tools (and learn how to use), taking the razor to a knife shop (good luck finding a local one), or sending it to someone who will hone it for you.</li>
            <li>cool looking,</li>
            <li>He previously had an awesome experience with a straight razor shave at a barber shop and wanted to recreate this at home.</li>
            <li>Then I quickly worked up to #12000 on stones.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s not a huge problem, one of the most attractive reasons for using a straight razor is eliminating costs from continually buying disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you start on a medium diamond hone until you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;ve got it flat, then switch to your wetstone or finer grit diamonds.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to shave for the first time and throw away those cheap razors and also make it save environment.</li>
            <li>It did cost me a little more but receiving it in perfect condition was well worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Razor looked great and decent enough</li>
            <li>I hear some blades come in a state that you can strop them quickly and shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li>However, right after I said this, my husband was inspecting it and</li>
            <li>the FROMM logo just rubbed right off....</li>
            <li>As with many things on the &#x27;Net, too little information is given about this product for an intelligent buying decision.</li>
            <li>I am brand new to straight shaving and to be honest, this blade almost turned me completely off until I thought to come look at the reviews.</li>
            <li>When I got it, I simply made about 15 passes on my strop, and was able to use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving up on this blade as inferior quality and buying a Dovo as I should have in the first place.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT POSIBLE TO GET A CONSISTENT EDGE ON THE RAZOR.</li>
            <li>This means (exactly how it sounds) that it did not arrive in the condition in which it could be shaved with.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>Decent quality blade without a super hefty price tag.</li>
            <li>Had I read these first, I would have ran</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re more likely to bruise yourself than cut yourself with this piece of crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have gone with something better like a Dovo, it would be the same price or cheaper.  </li>
            <li>) strop every few minutes to see if I am good.</li>
            <li>After my own experience with the Fromm and reading other reviews, I conclude that buying a Fromm is a crap-shoot.  </li>
            <li>As I read some of the negative reviews some of the razors came in with cracked handles and/or rusted rivets, as stated above mine came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his first straight razor</li>
            <li>If you want to hone this yourself and have the stones or have it professionally honed, this will end up as good as any other razor.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, and was ground quite well, very straight and even, with some hard work</li>
            <li>and I had to buy a sharpening stone in order to get it ready to shave.</li>
            <li>NO RAZOR WILL COME \\&quot;READY</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NOT GET A STRAIGHT RAZOR</li>
            <li>The morale of the story is when you are shopping for a straight razor, check to see if it is \\&quot;shave ready\\&quot; or not.</li>
            <li>is VERY susceptible to damage.</li>
            <li>My razor came shave ready as claimed on Excalibur&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t list every razor shave ready, they state it in the about section of the website.&lt;br /&gt;The razor</li>
            <li>I purchased this straight razor for my husband and he likes it.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>Is it crummy \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot;, tool steel, or Damascus?</li>
            <li>Honostly this came NOT shave ready.  </li>
            <li>anyway - This particular razor did receive some good reviews; especially from the converts - people switching from the conventional razor to a straight one.</li>
            <li>and he had no complaints about this particular product.</li>
            <li>If they could make flat blades in the middle 19th Century, surely Amazon should refund the purchase price or sell these as \\&quot;seconds\\&quot; or \\&quot;decoratives\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It took a fair amount of time to get it sharp, and I&#x27;m still not sure it is quite right.</li>
            <li>So, my Christmas gift (already un-useful for the passed week) will continue to be so for a few more...</li>
            <li>Then an inexpensive strop, first on the fabric side with compound, and a few minutes on smooth leather.  </li>
            <li>Currently twice as sharp as when purchased but Still not sharp enough for a good shave ...</li>
            <li>You will need to hone a proper bevel from scratch using bench stones the first time.  </li>
            <li>I thought for $40 I would get a blade that was decent enough to give me an idea of how straight shaving works.</li>
            <li>With the blade being warped it is impossible to reach a nice, even, or functional edge that you want for comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li>They should advertise that, it is marked on the blade.</li>
            <li>The blade comes &amp;#34;ultra-sharp&amp;#34; but only for a knife, it&#x27;s not shave ready by any means.  </li>
            <li>Initially you&#x27;ll have to start pretty coarse and remove quite a bit of material to replace the factory edge, and create a new bevel.</li>
            <li>New razors general come not shave-ready.</li>
            <li>I actually get a decent shave with my $12 Gold Dollar.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great razor to get, especially if you plan to bring one for travel as it has the quality blade, but isn&#x27;t rediculously expensive.</li>
            <li>Was not sharp at all, sent it out to get proffestionally sharpened...</li>
            <li>I have received my first shave the other day.</li>
            <li>A few &amp;#34;licks&amp;#34; on the 12000 waterstone fixed it right up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a lot to learn about when getting into straight razor shaving, which is one of the reasons I enjoy making a hobby out of it, but with everything to learn you don&#x27;t want to frustrate yourself by purchasing a warped blade that will render your entire straight shaving repertoire useless.</li>
            <li>German high quality  hand made razor sharp steel blade, ready to shave with.</li>
            <li>It is not straight so you cannot get a straight edge on it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this straight razor because my first, a Kreiger, was a dull piece of junk (very sharp, but not sharp enough to shave with, and the metal was not quality enough to get the required edge on it).  </li>
            <li>The razor has a rounded edge, which makes it a little easier for those just beginning to shave with straight razors.</li>
            <li>only thing I can think of is that there are different batches of metal floating around – some good, some bad – and that’s why we see the disparity in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> only thing I can think of is that there are different batches of metal floating around – some good, some bad – and that’s why we see the disparity in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> it makes me wonder if some of these other companies are selling copy or second quality merchandise.</li>

            <li> Also the plastic handle is somewhat flimsy, so you have to be careful not to push the blade past the handle, you can bow the plastic out and have the blade exposed if you try (but you shouldn&#x27;t).  </li>

            <li> When I tried to hone it with a Norton Waterstone 4/8k, as recommended, I found out that the back of the blade on one side wasn&#x27;t straight, and caused that contact with the cutting edge was irregular and made it impossible to create a decent bevel.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This razor is impossible to sharpen mainly because it was ground down skewed. It is not straight so you cannot get a straight edge on it. There fore not a STRAIGHT razor but a mere blade. My 5 dollar pocket knife is straighter than this and can be used to shave better ...&lt;br /&gt;ANd yes I have experience sharpening and honing and stropping my own razor from start to finish. I did so successfully and like to shave every day ...</li>
            <li> Husband didn&#x27;t like this one compared to others he owns. He said it wouldn&#x27;t get as sharp as his other straight razors</li>
            <li> I purchased this straight razor because my first, a Kreiger, was a dull piece of junk (very sharp, but not sharp enough to shave with, and the metal was not quality enough to get the required edge on it).  I&#x27;ve read other reviews for this razor that have stated it to ship dull, well mine certainly did not.  When I got it, I simply made about 15 passes on my strop, and was able to use it.  I have found that the silver lettering of FROMM on the handle does rub off, and leaves it on your fingers.  That doesn&#x27;t effect how well it cuts though.  Also the plastic handle is somewhat flimsy, so you have to be careful not to push the blade past the handle, you can bow the plastic out and have the blade exposed if you try (but you shouldn&#x27;t).  The blade itself seems to be very good, and I find it best to keep the blade well honed by stropping it both just before shaving, and again right after; I wash the blade carefully before doing the post shave stropping.    Overall, I think this is a great razor to get, especially if you plan to bring one for travel as it has the quality blade, but isn&#x27;t rediculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this razor. It was easy to sharpen, and gives a close, comfortable save. I also have a Dovo Astrale, and the Fromm seems just as good a shaver.    New razors general come not shave-ready. You have to do some light honing to get a shaving edge. If you don&#x27;t know how, send the razor out for $20 to get it honed.    Otto Fromm is a longstanding brand that is well respected for its razors.</li>
            <li> German high quality  hand made razor sharp steel blade, ready to shave with. Be careful with this beauty. My only complaint is the white lettering on the scales disappeared the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor thinking I would be able to shave with it right away. It was dull when I received it and I had to buy a sharpening stone in order to get it ready to shave. It took a fair amount of time to get it sharp, and I&#x27;m still not sure it is quite right. I did a lot of research to figure out how to sharpen it and when I sharpened it, the area on the blade that was worn away - the bevel - was uneven indicating a warped blade. Specifically, one side of the blade has a wider bevel at the ends and the other side has a wider bevel in the middle. I&#x27;m giving up on this blade as inferior quality and buying a Dovo as I should have in the first place. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> NO RAZOR WILL COME \\&quot;READY TO SHAVE\\&quot; THEY MAY NEED A LITTLE WORK ON A HONE, SO IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE AT LEAST 3 STONES (1000,4000,8000)GRIT AND A LEATHER STROP YOU WILL NOT GET A STRAIGHT RAZOR TO WORK FOR YOU. THIS RAZOR CAME WARPED WITCH IS A BIG DEAL. IT IS NOT POSIBLE TO GET A CONSISTENT EDGE ON THE RAZOR. IT&#x27;S USELESS.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband as a Christmas gift. He previously had an awesome experience with a straight razor shave at a barber shop and wanted to recreate this at home. I thought this would make a nice gift...I bought him the razor, strop, strop dressing, shave set, and soap, etc...I thought \\&quot;how cool would it be for him to be able to try this out the day he receives it?\\&quot;...So, I researched razors that were budget-friendly, but also had a good reputation. I kept in mind that he could try this, dislike it, and ultimately change his mind about it - may not like or decide it is not worth doing at home....anyway - This particular razor did receive some good reviews; especially from the converts - people switching from the conventional razor to a straight one. In addition, straight razors can get extremely expensive (several hundred dollars). When I looked into this one, I felt comfortable with the balance between the product reviews and the price. Appearance-wise it is a nice razor. It appears to be constructed well. However, right after I said this, my husband was inspecting it and the FROMM logo just rubbed right off....anyway, I digress.  My disappointment came with the fact that this razor was not \\&quot;shave ready\\&quot;. This means (exactly how it sounds) that it did not arrive in the condition in which it could be shaved with. Even though I had bought my husband the strop (in which you can sharpen the blade), you cannot sharpen a non-\\&quot;shave ready\\&quot; razor (a.k.a. virgin blade) with a strop. You can seriously mess up the blade and/or strop. The bottom line is the razor needs to be honed. Honing requires either purchasing another set of tools (and learn how to use), taking the razor to a knife shop (good luck finding a local one), or sending it to someone who will hone it for you. So, my Christmas gift (already un-useful for the passed week) will continue to be so for a few more...We discovered today that we have to mail it to someone to hone it for us - big let down.The morale of the story is when you are shopping for a straight razor, check to see if it is \\&quot;shave ready\\&quot; or not. If it does not say (like this one did not) ask...I did not know to ask this question. However, other than that, my husband likes the razor...it is just disappointing to not be able to use a gift that you have received.  Hope this helps any potential buyers!    Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> The razor arrived a few days ago, not ready for a shave. When I tried to hone it with a Norton Waterstone 4/8k, as recommended, I found out that the back of the blade on one side wasn&#x27;t straight, and caused that contact with the cutting edge was irregular and made it impossible to create a decent bevel. I have no way of fixing this, so there is over $60 going down the drain. I am pretty disappointed with the product!</li>
            <li> This Razor is not rated as the best quality out there, but it works great for me. I am learning to sharpen it on my own and it works fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> The listing states that the razor come in a case of six.  It came as a single razor and resulted in a refund.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, this razor IS NOT ready to use. Even with the protective packaging, that&#x27;s a good thing as a fine edge is VERY susceptible to damage. A few &amp;#34;licks&amp;#34; on the 12000 waterstone fixed it right up.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I decided to order my Fromm 72r from Excalibur Cutlery. My razor came shave ready as claimed on Excalibur&#x27;s website. They don&#x27;t list every razor shave ready, they state it in the about section of the website.&lt;br /&gt;The razor came in earlier than expected as I had mine monogramed. As I read some of the negative reviews some of the razors came in with cracked handles and/or rusted rivets, as stated above mine came in perfect condition. I ordered the shaving kit which came with the Fromm Strop and a bottle of strop conditioner. it makes me wonder if some of these other companies are selling copy or second quality merchandise. one reviewer said the name was rubbing off the razor, I ran my thumb nail across the name on both sides of the razor and the name stayed. It did cost me a little more but receiving it in perfect condition was well worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;Also this was a birthday gift from my wife.</li>
            <li> This straight razor from fromm(lol) is beautiful and I was really looking forward to trying straight shaving. However, as elegant as the razor looks at first hand, the product is somewhat of a defected one. My first gripe is that the razor is not shave-ready, meaning of course it fails the hanging hair test. So that&#x27;s not a huge problem, one of the most attractive reasons for using a straight razor is eliminating costs from continually buying disposable razors. Coinciding with that philosophy, you might as well purchase honing stones to avoid honing maintenance fees to save even more money in the long-term. Well I did, and using my extra course diamond stone, I honed that baby down until I finally realized that the blade is totally warped! With the blade being warped it is impossible to reach a nice, even, or functional edge that you want for comfortable shaving. I warped edge also does damage to strops which cost you more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot to learn about when getting into straight razor shaving, which is one of the reasons I enjoy making a hobby out of it, but with everything to learn you don&#x27;t want to frustrate yourself by purchasing a warped blade that will render your entire straight shaving repertoire useless.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas after researching lots of razors online. He loves it! The razor has a rounded edge, which makes it a little easier for those just beginning to shave with straight razors. Decent quality blade without a super hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving with shaving oil and foam.&lt;br /&gt;I might recommend this item to my siblings and friends who had plan to buy this item</li>
            <li> It did very well in shaving the finer hairs on the back of my neck, but I was unable to use it to shave my rougher facial hair as the blade just didn&#x27;t seem to have the sharpness required.</li>
            <li> I knew beforehand that I would need to put the shave-ready edge on this before I bought it, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;This razor keeps an edge very nicely.  I will NEVER have to use those stupid rake-type disposables again.</li>
            <li> I am no longer a slave to the gillette corparation</li>
            <li> razor is not worth your time. It will not hold a good edge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this straight razor for my husband and he likes it. It&#x27;s his first straight razor and he had no complaints about this particular product.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more. The razor is handmade in Germany. They should advertise that, it is marked on the blade.</li>
            <li> Nice quality high carbon blade made in Solingen.  Looks good, and was ground quite well, very straight and even, with some hard work it comes out to a beautiful edge.  The blade comes &amp;#34;ultra-sharp&amp;#34; but only for a knife, it&#x27;s not shave ready by any means.  It would scrape hair but not comfortably.  You will need to hone a proper bevel from scratch using bench stones the first time.  Just stropping, even with compound won&#x27;t ever get it done.  Initially you&#x27;ll have to start pretty coarse and remove quite a bit of material to replace the factory edge, and create a new bevel. I&#x27;d recommend a #800/#4000 grit combo whetstone at minimum.  I started with #1000 and it took quite a while to set the bevel so a bit coarser to start would help.  Then I quickly worked up to #12000 on stones.  Then an inexpensive strop, first on the fabric side with compound, and a few minutes on smooth leather.  Now it passes the hanging hair test.  If you want to hone this yourself and have the stones or have it professionally honed, this will end up as good as any other razor.  I won&#x27;t miss it, but the white lettering does rub off the handle.</li>
            <li> As with many things on the &#x27;Net, too little information is given about this product for an intelligent buying decision. Is it crummy \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot;, tool steel, or Damascus? What Rockwell or Brennell Hardness is it? Is it draw tempered or case hardened? No model number from the Otto Fromm catalog is mentioned, unlike my #39 Otto Fromm \\&quot;Red Head\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used almost every morning since I was 15 (1968). The cheap thin plastic scales with no supports or ornamentation, instead of horn or bone with German Silver filigree should be a warning to the low quality. BTW, even at $68-odd dollars, Amazon&#x27;s price is a rip-off as my local barber supply has all of these you&#x27;ll buy for $38. Be advised, a good, ready-to-shave (which really isn&#x27;t) round head hollow ground straight razor will cost a bare minimum of $160, and triple that isn&#x27;t excessive today. I have my Great-grandfather&#x27;s Case Bros. wedge-blade \\&quot;throat-slasher\\&quot; circa 1860 Damascus steel that will take a super fine edge still, and like my round heads I can (and have) shaved in the dark with it. If they could make flat blades in the middle 19th Century, surely Amazon should refund the purchase price or sell these as \\&quot;seconds\\&quot; or \\&quot;decoratives\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Razor looked great and decent enough however I sent it off to a honing service and was told it is a cheap razor and would neither hone, nor shave well. I will try to return it for refund but there goes my hopes on this product and $80 down the p**ser.</li>
            <li> Was not sharp at all, sent it out to get proffestionally sharpened... Currently twice as sharp as when purchased but Still not sharp enough for a good shave ...😤 frustrated .</li>
            <li> After my own experience with the Fromm and reading other reviews, I conclude that buying a Fromm is a crap-shoot.  Some people seem to get a good shave, others don’t.  I’m in the latter category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew before I bought the Fromm it would have to be honed.  No problem.  I’ve successfully honed to “shave ready” a couple of Dovos,  a TI and even a Gold Dollar.  With the Fromm, I’ve tried 3 times to hone it, all three times starting with a 1000 grit through a 4000 grit and ending with an 8000 grit - Norton 4000/8000 and a King 1000.  Then I polished it using CrO2 on a balsa strop.  Finally, I stropped it on a leather strop 100 round trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fromm is a dud.  I actually get a decent shave with my $12 Gold Dollar.  I’ve demoted my Fromm from a straight razor to an expensive garlic slicer, where it performs quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can think of is that there are different batches of metal floating around – some good, some bad – and that’s why we see the disparity in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, it is a crap-shoot if you decided to buy a Fromm.  You might get a razor or a garlic slicer.  My advices is save you pennies and buy something like a Dove Best Quality or an entry level TI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> Yes, my blade was a bit warped upon arrival, but nothing a bit of extra honing couldn&#x27;t take care of. Since this isn&#x27;t a shave-ready razor, you&#x27;re going to be honing it anyway. Just make sure you start on a medium diamond hone until you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;ve got it flat, then switch to your wetstone or finer grit diamonds. Once sharp, it shaves nice with good balance in hand.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, it&#x27;s just not sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hours of trying to hone it, i gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very cool looking, but i can&#x27;t get a sharp edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured paying $40 would at least get me a halfway decent one, but i guess i&#x27;ll have to get one around $200</li>
            <li> I heard Fromm was a good brand, and was happy to find an economical blade to start out with. I am brand new to straight shaving and to be honest, this blade almost turned me completely off until I thought to come look at the reviews. Had I read these first, I would have ran **** away. You should too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warped edge is in fact warped. I thought I had messed up the blade when I \\&quot;honed\\&quot; it for the first time, but it looks like the blade is just bad. It is very, VERY cheap looking steel and the handle is plastic. $40 is a rip-off. I thought for $40 I would get a blade that was decent enough to give me an idea of how straight shaving works. I&#x27;ve spent about 10 minutes on 4000 grit with an occasional few passes on 8000 grit and about 50 passes on a (Fromm, kinda worried now) strop every few minutes to see if I am good. I&#x27;ve tried shaving twice and on the second time, I finally managed to cut something: my face. You&#x27;re more likely to bruise yourself than cut yourself with this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is not shave-ready or even remotely. I hear some blades come in a state that you can strop them quickly and shave right out of the box. 10 minutes of honing and one hundred stropping passes won&#x27;t get you even close. I can put a white-knuckle amount of pressure on this thing and still be unable to cut my fingertip. I was going to try to find a shop in town to bring this blade to and ask if it&#x27;s just a piece of crap before I got discouraged, but I already know, now.</li>
            <li> I was happy when the straight razor arrived. I am not a pro but I wanted to shave for the first time and throw away those cheap razors and also make it save environment. Unfortunately the straight razor was non hone. That mean sharpening and I have to turn to youtube for instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use the strap and it was not working. I purchased a sharpening stone with grit of 4000/8000 for $69.00. I have received my first shave the other day. Take a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> Honostly this came NOT shave ready.  This wedge razor is just ok even after having to send it off to be sharpened.  If I could do it again considering the price of the razor and the price to have it sharpened I would have gone with something better like a Dovo, it would be the same price or cheaper.  So I give this three stars, if you don&#x27;t mind having it initially sharpened.</li>
