            <li>/&gt;Smells like sweet coconut and is a slighlty runny cream base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your old had a body odor, but I can honestly say since she is using this, I don&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>If you wish for this product to have thicker consistency than keep it in a cool temp</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it works it really works</li>
            <li>It has a light coconut smell that keeps my 1st grader smelling fresh, through gym time and recess.  </li>
            <li>This natural deodorant works great for my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>The kids are having fun applying it and they no longer smell - even after sweating and a full day of school etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 7 year old active boy, and I was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>However it does exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews for the Truly brand and was excited to order it and give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a safe deodorant for my 7 year old girl.</li>

            <li>My daughter loves it, I love it because it is all natural</li>
            <li>Love this product for my 8 year old.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>So thrilled, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>Other than that, which we figured out a work around, the stuff seems really good.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive and dry skin with nothing to sting the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural options none being good enough to spend money on</li>
            <li>gone the whole day!</li>
            <li>The smell of coconut is too intense!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Truly&#x27;s deodorant really works!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using adult deodorant on him.</li>
            <li>There is a coconut-y smell at first, but that fades.</li>
            <li>really works for my son!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this because it is made from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The crystal and Tom&#x27;s of Maine kind did not work for the active child who was using it.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old son had developed strong body odor during the summer.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in Truly&#x27;s natural are so simple, but effective - consisting of organic coconut oil, powdered sugar, baking soda and beeswax they&#x27;ve worked together to get us both through these last couple of weeks of very hot and sticky weather without that</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li>The real test came when I myself was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>My son doesn&#x27;t sweat much yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so bummed because I really did like this product and when I used it, it worked well.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>But, let&#x27;s get real -</li>
            <li>I really like it for my son, however HE doesn&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s cream-</li>
            <li>Works really well for my daughter.</li>
            <li>(It kind of smells like laundry soap, but not as heavy)</li>
            <li>If you normally use natural deodorant, I&#x27;m sure you are used to constantly checking your BO level.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first, but when it persisted, I took him to his pediatrician and he was checked for early puberty.</li>
            <li>I resisted letting my little guy use deodorant - there are so many health concerns surrounding traditional deodorant that are running amok, and quite frankly I don&#x27;t care to test whether or not they&#x27;re true.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely works for my 5 year old!</li>
            <li>Really works all natural!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for kids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad that this stuff has to be applied by hand because if it could be made into a stick this stuff would be perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants - but not one has worked to my satisfaction - and I&#x27;d always end up going back to the store bought not natural stuff.</li>
            <li>I went to reach for my degree for women, and I remember I was supposed to pick up a new one at the store.  </li>
            <li>It works and it is all natural!  </li>
            <li>This is the exact same as the adult version.</li>
            <li>First natural deodorant that I have tried that actually works!  </li>
            <li>Yes, it does smell a little like coconut, but it&#x27;s not annoying.</li>
            <li>Turns out he just gets smelly when he plays hard, :).</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8-year old son.  </li>
            <li>I became concerned when my 5 year old started having underarm</li>
            <li>/o completely gone and stays</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lavander Fields Organic &amp; Natural Deodorant:&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>It works as far as deodorant.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 5 yr old son.</li>
            <li>Completely blocks Odor.</li>
            <li>I use this for my 6 year old daughter who has bo.</li>
            <li>I bought the kids version hoping that it would be a bit later on the baking soda, but it proved to be too much.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants: some don&#x27;t even come close to working and</li>
            <li>We were sent some tubs of Truly&#x27;s Natural deodorant to try - crossing my fingers</li>
            <li>, Truly&#x27;s Natural deodorant is moisturizing, soothing and um, keeps those stinky pits where they belong -</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7year old nephew.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Completely meet my expectation.</li>
            <li>After noticing body odor - even after showering - on our twin 8-year-old boys and our 10-year-old girl, I began researching natural deodorants for them.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li>So far, no issues.</li>
            <li>like thick lavender and is like most deodorants you could find at a store.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different natural methods for my twin girls for body odor, including Toms of Maine and even just plain baking soda.</li>
            <li>During the winter i let him bathe every other night and Truly&#x27;s has not failed me!</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re not keen on smelling like a coconut you don&#x27;t have to worry as the scent will be very light and just a little goes a long way!    </li>
            <li>At 7 my little boy has developed more than just that little boy smell, he has developed B.O.!</li>
            <li>It is very soft so take extra care when opening because it will spill.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, but it can be a little messy.</li>
            <li>All natural, has low odour and works for all day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use regular deodorant in him because he&#x27;s so young, so his doctor suggested this.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found a natural deodorant that works and does NOT make you smell like body odor, OR stain your clothes.</li>
            <li>In a state of panic, I recently had the unexpected task of having to shop for deodorant for my toddler.</li>
            <li>I knew she wasn&#x27;t old enough to wear deodorant or even perfume but needed something to help with her very active lifestyle (and very smelly armpits).</li>
            <li>Really keeps odor down although it doesn&#x27;t help with sweat</li>
            <li>It kept my little girl smelling fresh after a long day at school</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you wish for this product to have thicker consistency than keep it in a cool temp</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it works it really works</li>
            <li> It has a light coconut smell that keeps my 1st grader smelling fresh, through gym time and recess.  </li>
            <li> This natural deodorant works great for my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> The kids are having fun applying it and they no longer smell - even after sweating and a full day of school etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 7 year old active boy, and I was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> However it does exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews for the Truly brand and was excited to order it and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a safe deodorant for my 7 year old girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally worry free, and I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, I love it because it is all natural</li>
            <li> Love this product for my 8 year old.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> So thrilled, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Other than that, which we figured out a work around, the stuff seems really good.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive and dry skin with nothing to sting the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural options none being good enough to spend money on</li>
            <li> gone the whole day!</li>
            <li> The smell of coconut is too intense!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Truly&#x27;s deodorant really works!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using adult deodorant on him.</li>
            <li> There is a coconut-y smell at first, but that fades.</li>
            <li> really works for my son!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this because it is made from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The crystal and Tom&#x27;s of Maine kind did not work for the active child who was using it.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old son had developed strong body odor during the summer.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in Truly&#x27;s natural are so simple, but effective - consisting of organic coconut oil, powdered sugar, baking soda and beeswax they&#x27;ve worked together to get us both through these last couple of weeks of very hot and sticky weather without that</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li> The real test came when I myself was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> My son doesn&#x27;t sweat much yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bummed because I really did like this product and when I used it, it worked well.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> But, let&#x27;s get real -</li>
            <li> I really like it for my son, however HE doesn&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s cream-</li>
            <li> Works really well for my daughter.</li>
            <li> (It kind of smells like laundry soap, but not as heavy)</li>
            <li> If you normally use natural deodorant, I&#x27;m sure you are used to constantly checking your BO level.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first, but when it persisted, I took him to his pediatrician and he was checked for early puberty.</li>
            <li> I resisted letting my little guy use deodorant - there are so many health concerns surrounding traditional deodorant that are running amok, and quite frankly I don&#x27;t care to test whether or not they&#x27;re true.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works for my 5 year old!</li>
            <li> Really works all natural!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for kids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that this stuff has to be applied by hand because if it could be made into a stick this stuff would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants - but not one has worked to my satisfaction - and I&#x27;d always end up going back to the store bought not natural stuff.</li>
            <li> I went to reach for my degree for women, and I remember I was supposed to pick up a new one at the store.  </li>
            <li> It works and it is all natural!  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same as the adult version.</li>
            <li> First natural deodorant that I have tried that actually works!  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does smell a little like coconut, but it&#x27;s not annoying.</li>
            <li> Turns out he just gets smelly when he plays hard, :).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8-year old son.  </li>
            <li> I became concerned when my 5 year old started having underarm</li>
            <li> /o completely gone and stays</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lavander Fields Organic &amp; Natural Deodorant:&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> It works as far as deodorant.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yr old son.</li>
            <li> Completely blocks Odor.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 6 year old daughter who has bo.</li>
            <li> I bought the kids version hoping that it would be a bit later on the baking soda, but it proved to be too much.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants: some don&#x27;t even come close to working and</li>
            <li> We were sent some tubs of Truly&#x27;s Natural deodorant to try - crossing my fingers</li>
            <li> , Truly&#x27;s Natural deodorant is moisturizing, soothing and um, keeps those stinky pits where they belong -</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7year old nephew.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Completely meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> After noticing body odor - even after showering - on our twin 8-year-old boys and our 10-year-old girl, I began researching natural deodorants for them.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li> So far, no issues.</li>
            <li> like thick lavender and is like most deodorants you could find at a store.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many different natural methods for my twin girls for body odor, including Toms of Maine and even just plain baking soda.</li>
            <li> During the winter i let him bathe every other night and Truly&#x27;s has not failed me!</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re not keen on smelling like a coconut you don&#x27;t have to worry as the scent will be very light and just a little goes a long way!    </li>
            <li> At 7 my little boy has developed more than just that little boy smell, he has developed B.O.!</li>
            <li> It is very soft so take extra care when opening because it will spill.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural, but it can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> All natural, has low odour and works for all day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use regular deodorant in him because he&#x27;s so young, so his doctor suggested this.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a natural deodorant that works and does NOT make you smell like body odor, OR stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> In a state of panic, I recently had the unexpected task of having to shop for deodorant for my toddler.</li>
            <li> I knew she wasn&#x27;t old enough to wear deodorant or even perfume but needed something to help with her very active lifestyle (and very smelly armpits).</li>
            <li> Really keeps odor down although it doesn&#x27;t help with sweat</li>
            <li> It kept my little girl smelling fresh after a long day at school</li>
            <li> The other kids junior varsity natural deodorant did not work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> After experimenting with some other natural deodorants and doing a bit of research, it turns out that baking soda is the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 8 year old has suffered from over active sweat glands since he was an infant.</li>
            <li> Not only does she not smell after a long day of playing</li>
            <li> Tried a few natural deodorants from the local Herb store and still numerous bumbs under his arms pits.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s little sister along with Lavander Fields Organic &amp; Natural Deodorant from Organic Fields Of Heather.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy a traditional deodorant/anti-persperiant due to their effects on children.  </li>
            <li> (I tried several other homemade recipes, and other natural deodorants and the only common ingredient was the baking soda and after some research i discovered that some people have reactions to baking soda.)</li>
            <li> As protecting against smell, I will say it tries but not completely.</li>
            <li> - I was actually worried about this issue when deodorant deliberations began for my little guy; he likes to go around shirtless at home</li>
            <li> I ended up taking an empty Dove Clinical antiperspirant applicator, cleaning it out, and filling it with Truly&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have never found anything that didn&#x27;t burn, nor lasted longer than a few hours (especially when I wear chiffon)!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and there is no harmful chemicals absolutely no burning when u put it on.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it is a little greasy,  so start with a small amount and adjust the amount needed from there.</li>
            <li> While initially there is that heavenly coconut oil scent, it does dry down to very little scent -</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant for my son ,no more bad smell</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really liked this deodorant but unfortunately after about 4 days of use I developed a bad rash.</li>
            <li> Lasted longer than I expected and works!</li>
            <li> He wears truly no side affects and absolutely NO ODOR!</li>
            <li> and I was tired of trying new options.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was with the applicator or lack there of.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I get a whiff of my 7 year old and it&#x27;s not good!</li>
            <li> I have a very active job and sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been having a little odor under his arms.</li>
            <li> How were we going to deal with Little Man&#x27;s underarm issues?</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to for her</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use anything with harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> We have used this product for a few weeks and no longer have any issues.</li>
            <li> I thought my little boy was going to be the stinky kid in class before I found this product!  </li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m not sure where they belong, but I know they don&#x27;t belong on me or my boy, but</li>
            <li> I tell all of my friends who have small children about this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Also, before i bought her this when I would be over I would notice she had body odor, but lately she has not smelled.</li>
            <li> but she also has very little wetness under her arm!</li>
            <li> I have been using natural deodorant for 10 years, and I hate that feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, this made me break out into a rash underneath both armpits, which is something I&#x27;ve never experienced.</li>
            <li> and though he&#x27;s seven I still pick him up, so I was worried about getting deodorant gunk on my hands (I hate deodorant crud passionately).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird to apply but it works.</li>
            <li> but my son thought it was too weird to use and prefers a roll on.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might be &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Her arm pits would still smell really bad, BUT</li>
            <li> It does work and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> He had bad odor from under his arms</li>
            <li> I hate coconut and the smell of coconut</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of coconut but I surprising like the smell with this.  It has a tropical kind of smell.  I bought this for my 8-year old son.  My only complaint was with the applicator or lack there of.  I ended up taking an empty Dove Clinical antiperspirant applicator, cleaning it out, and filling it with Truly&#x27;s.  Other than that, which we figured out a work around, the stuff seems really good.  My son likes it and he smells nice.</li>
            <li> I became concerned when my 5 year old started having underarm b/o. I didn&#x27;t want to use anything with harsh chemicals so I researched and decided to try this. It&#x27;s a great product! B/o completely gone and stays gone the whole day! Very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> This stuff! I love it! It&#x27;s weird to apply but it works. I have never found anything that didn&#x27;t burn, nor lasted longer than a few hours (especially when I wear chiffon)! This stuff is great! I highly recommend. And will be buying for many years!</li>
            <li> It works and it is all natural!  Finally!  The crystal and Tom&#x27;s of Maine kind did not work for the active child who was using it.  This stuff is great.  I might buy it for myself!</li>
            <li> I do not personally knows if it works.I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s little sister along with Lavander Fields Organic &amp; Natural Deodorant from Organic Fields Of Heather. His mom says they both work. Also, before i bought her this when I would be over I would notice she had body odor, but lately she has not smelled. I believe it is because of the deodorant. I definitely think they both work works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like sweet coconut and is a slighlty runny cream base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavander Fields Organic &amp; Natural Deodorant:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like thick lavender and is like most deodorants you could find at a store. (It kind of smells like laundry soap, but not as heavy)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter because she had started to develop BO in the Florida heat and this works amazingly well!!!! We put it on her in the morning before she goes to school and it lasts all day. It&#x27;s safe for kids and it smells great! Don&#x27;t look any further this is the greatest product out there. Oh and dont let the fact that you have to apply it with your fingers tips turn you off. You wont regret getting this for your stinky one :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that this stuff has to be applied by hand because if it could be made into a stick this stuff would be perfect!</li>
            <li> Love my Truly&#x27;s.  This is the exact same as the adult version.</li>
            <li> Great for stinky kids and adults too! Ingredients you can pronounce. Great product. I love it!</li>
            <li> The other kids junior varsity natural deodorant did not work for my daughter. Her arm pits would still smell really bad, BUT Truly&#x27;s kids deodorant works ALL DAY! I use it too!</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works for my 5 year old! It &amp;#34;truly&amp;#34; lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 7 year old active boy, and I was very happy with the results.  The real test came when I myself was getting ready for work. I went to reach for my degree for women, and I remember I was supposed to pick up a new one at the store.  I figured I would use this to get me by until lunch. Well I will never buy another deodorant again! I truly love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Great product for young children. Lasted longer than I expected and works!</li>
            <li> I like this for my daughter but it always stains her white school shirt on the armpit. As protecting against smell, I will say it tries but not completely.</li>
            <li> The smell of coconut is too intense!</li>
            <li> Seemed to work on my daughter</li>
            <li> This product works well for my child. And love that it is chemical free!</li>
            <li> Really keeps odor down although it doesn&#x27;t help with sweat is it is not a antiperspirant, but will buy again.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells amazing. It works as far as deodorant. My son doesn&#x27;t sweat much yet and he&#x27;s allergic to anti-perspirants so I couldn&#x27;t give any comparisons. But it&#x27;s a good consistency and fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great and natural smells good too</li>
            <li> I really liked this deodorant but unfortunately after about 4 days of use I developed a bad rash. I realized I have a reaction to baking soda. I&#x27;m so bummed because I really did like this product and when I used it, it worked well. I just couldn&#x27;t stand the rash and bumps I got from the baking soda. (I tried several other homemade recipes, and other natural deodorants and the only common ingredient was the baking soda and after some research i discovered that some people have reactions to baking soda.) My daughter now uses this and is totally fine and no longer smells! ;)</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yr old son. He&#x27;s been having a little odor under his arms. I tried switching him from regular milk but realized he was still going to drink it at school so as a last resort I got him this. It works really well.  I no longer smell his funky arm pits and more importantly it didn&#x27;t break him out. I love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Completely blocks Odor.</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant is organic and works so well.  Truly&#x27;s is perfect for my child&#x27;s sensitive skin. It smells great, and is easy to use.  The only draw back is that it is a little greasy,  so start with a small amount and adjust the amount needed from there.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like the fact that it is a cream and not a bar so she did not want to use it. I knew this before buying it so I am not giving it some star because of that, I am actually giving it a one star because I decided to use it myself and after 5 days I have a rash on both of my underarms. Can&#x27;t imagine what it could have done to a kid if that is what happens to me.</li>
            <li> This is an awsome product! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After reading all the halleluja reviews I was still sceptic. Decided to try it, but ordered only one. It does work and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. Yes, it does smell a little like coconut, but it&#x27;s not annoying. Our six your old had a body odor, but I can honestly say since she is using this, I don&#x27;t smell it anymore. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 6 year old daughter who has bo. :) it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Great product all natural and my girls don&#x27;t drink anymore at all!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always write reviews, but am so impressed with this product - I&#x27;m making it a point to write one. I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants - but not one has worked to my satisfaction - and I&#x27;d always end up going back to the store bought not natural stuff. Truly&#x27;s deodorant really works! Even after sweating and at the end of the day - no odor! I&#x27;m sold and will use this forever!</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t smell anymore with this deodorant. I really works.</li>
            <li> This is great!  Got it as a chemical-free option for my 10-year-old daughter, and she loved it!  Smells good!  Works great!  Now, I use it, too, and ordered more from the Truly&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> If you normally use natural deodorant, I&#x27;m sure you are used to constantly checking your BO level. I have been using natural deodorant for 10 years, and I hate that feeling. Truly&#x27;s is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve forgotten to check up on during the day. It really works. I&#x27;m totally worry free, and I love it. Plus, none of the ingredients in here are worrisome, which is great for this nursing mom. I&#x27;ll use this product for life.</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant works great for my 5 year old daughter. It&#x27;s light, lasts all day and has a wonderful smell that she loves.</li>
            <li> Pros: Great company, natural deodorant&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I wish there were an easier way to put it on rather than using your fingers. Also, this made me break out into a rash underneath both armpits, which is something I&#x27;ve never experienced. After experimenting with some other natural deodorants and doing a bit of research, it turns out that baking soda is the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I bought the kids version hoping that it would be a bit later on the baking soda, but it proved to be too much. The search continues!</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I get a whiff of my 7 year old and it&#x27;s not good! I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using adult deodorant on him. This works great. Easy to use, smells lovely (like coconut), and lasts for a couple of days!</li>
            <li> Awesome for my smelly boys. Would buy again</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, I love it because it is all natural</li>
            <li> Thank you love this product....received my package super fast!</li>
            <li> Really good works great for my son.</li>
            <li> At 7 my little boy has developed more than just that little boy smell, he has developed B.O.! Ugh!    I resisted letting my little guy use deodorant - there are so many health concerns surrounding traditional deodorant that are running amok, and quite frankly I don&#x27;t care to test whether or not they&#x27;re true. But, let&#x27;s get real - I&#x27;m not putting up with that stink either! If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve tried natural deodorants: some don&#x27;t even come close to working and some work OK. I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural options none being good enough to spend money on and I was tired of trying new options. How were we going to deal with Little Man&#x27;s underarm issues? We were sent some tubs of Truly&#x27;s Natural deodorant to try - crossing my fingers we gave it a go!    Truly&#x27;s advertises that it&#x27;s not sticky or gummy and it&#x27;s not - I was actually worried about this issue when deodorant deliberations began for my little guy; he likes to go around shirtless at home and though he&#x27;s seven I still pick him up, so I was worried about getting deodorant gunk on my hands (I hate deodorant crud passionately). The ingredients in Truly&#x27;s natural are so simple, but effective - consisting of organic coconut oil, powdered sugar, baking soda and beeswax they&#x27;ve worked together to get us both through these last couple of weeks of very hot and sticky weather without that groddy aroma making it&#x27;s way through! While initially there is that heavenly coconut oil scent, it does dry down to very little scent - so if you&#x27;re not keen on smelling like a coconut you don&#x27;t have to worry as the scent will be very light and just a little goes a long way!    Great for sensitive and dry skin with nothing to sting the skin, Truly&#x27;s Natural deodorant is moisturizing, soothing and um, keeps those stinky pits where they belong - well I&#x27;m not sure where they belong, but I know they don&#x27;t belong on me or my boy, but Truly&#x27;s keeps the stink away from us!    Disclosure: I received this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7year old nephew. He loves it! It is very soft so take extra care when opening because it will spill.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my 8 year old. Outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I hate coconut and the smell of coconut so that&#x27;s the only thing that bothered me about it! If you wish for this product to have thicker consistency than keep it in a cool temp otherwise it turns liquid! However it does exactly what it promises! Love the fact that it works it really works</li>
            <li> I really like it for my son, however HE doesn&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s cream- he makes me put it on his under arms because he doesn&#x27;t want to put his hands in it.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many different natural methods for my twin girls for body odor, including Toms of Maine and even just plain baking soda. I learned about this product on a clothing board forum. So glad I tried it! One of my girls used to smell even after she took a shower earlier that day. We have used this product for a few weeks and no longer have any issues. Great scent too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very mild. Works well for my kids! Only wish it came in an applicator tube or container!</li>
            <li> This is the best idea ever! My daughter is only 6 but sweats like her father! I knew she wasn&#x27;t old enough to wear deodorant or even perfume but needed something to help with her very active lifestyle (and very smelly armpits). I read the reviews on here and was immediately sold! This stuff is magic! It&#x27;s all natural so I am thrilled that I am not using full strength deodorant on her and it works amazing! Not only does she not smell after a long day of playing but she also has very little wetness under her arm! I tell all of my friends who have small children about this deodorant. One jar lasts for about 6 months but I stock up in case they ever decide to discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Completely meet my expectation. All natural, has low odour and works for all day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my seven year old son that had stinky arm pits :)</li>
            <li> It has been really good for my 9 year old son.</li>
            <li> Perfect all natural for a 6 year old girl!!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son had developed strong body odor during the summer. I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first, but when it persisted, I took him to his pediatrician and he was checked for early puberty. Turns out he just gets smelly when he plays hard, :). We tried powder and extra showers...EVERYTHING. I didn&#x27;t want to use regular deodorant in him because he&#x27;s so young, so his doctor suggested this. It works wonderful! We immediately noticed improvement! I love that it is all natural, but it can be a little messy. That&#x27;s my only complaint. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a natural deodorant that works and does NOT make you smell like body odor, OR stain your clothes. I have a very active job and sweat a lot. This product allows you to sweat but you do not smell.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and gorgeous</li>
            <li> After noticing body odor - even after showering - on our twin 8-year-old boys and our 10-year-old girl, I began researching natural deodorants for them. I read all the positive reviews for the Truly brand and was excited to order it and give it a try. It came and it WORKS! There is a coconut-y smell at first, but that fades. The kids are having fun applying it and they no longer smell - even after sweating and a full day of school etc. So thrilled, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Product smells good but my son thought it was too weird to use and prefers a roll on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I thought my little boy was going to be the stinky kid in class before I found this product!  I hesitated to buy a traditional deodorant/anti-persperiant due to their effects on children.  I was so excited to find this because it is made from all natural ingredients.  It has a light coconut smell that keeps my 1st grader smelling fresh, through gym time and recess.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has body odor and I have tried everything to get rid of.it.This stuff is amazing. It lasts all day and there is no harmful chemicals absolutely no burning when u put it on. The only thing I do no not like is its a cream and u do put it on with fingers but it really is no big deal. I would highly recommend for kids.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Really works all natural!</li>
            <li> really works for my son!</li>
            <li> In a state of panic, I recently had the unexpected task of having to shop for deodorant for my toddler. I did a lot of research and settled on Truly&#x27;s. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This is a wonderful product that is organic and safe for my little one. Not only does it smell great, it lasts through a toddler&#x27;s play (over 10 hours) and lasts in water. It&#x27;s a creamy consistency and is applied by hand. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m SO incredibly grateful!!!</li>
            <li> This REALLY WORKS!!! My son is 5 and sweats like a man lol. He had bad odor from under his arms and I wanted something natural. He wears truly no side affects and absolutely NO ODOR! Love this product</li>
            <li> Works really well for my daughter. Took a little getting used to for her but all in all great product, would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant for my son ,no more bad smell</li>
            <li> First natural deodorant that I have tried that actually works!  Yay!</li>
            <li> Smells great. I was afraid it might be &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;. It is not. Goes on easy. Daughter is allergic to all the different deodarents we&#x27;ve tried. So far, no issues.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old has suffered from over active sweat glands since he was an infant. Antiperspirant breaks him out. Tried a few natural deodorants from the local Herb store and still numerous bumbs under his arms pits. Someone suggested Truly&#x27;s and let me tell you this stuff is amazing! During the winter i let him bathe every other night and Truly&#x27;s has not failed me! His under ams spots are even clearing up. Thank you for a product that finally works!</li>
