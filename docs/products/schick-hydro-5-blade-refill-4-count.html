            <li>bought this multi-pack and signed up for Amazon&#x27;s automatic mailing, which saves a great deal of money over the blades purchased in the supermarket or drug store.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money.</li>
            <li>Great price for a quality five blade razor.</li>
            <li>It provides a great shaving experience at lower price than it competitor.</li>
            <li>Great price and value.</li>
            <li>Great razors, get this on subscribe and save..</li>
            <li>Amazon has a great price too.</li>
            <li>I cannot find this price unless there is a great sale... which is never when I need a refill.</li>
            <li>I took a leap of faith and switched brands to the Schick Hydro 5 and am happy with my decision.</li>
            <li>But this was a great price.</li>
            <li>Great prices, and</li>
            <li>As with the mating razor, these do a great job.</li>
            <li>We bought this one and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head too and it did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li>, I have found a razor I can afford and does a great job.</li>
            <li>It does a great job day 1.</li>
            <li>The Shick Hydro 5 blades are great -- I prefer these because of the hydration strip.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li>Great razors for the price, have these razors on our subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>great blade has 5</li>
            <li>Great price on these razors.  </li>
            <li>It was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Great razors for the money.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>The lubricating strip is great for those in between shaves.</li>
            <li>So saving money on a great product should make you as happy as as it made me.</li>
            <li>I especially enjoy Amazon&#x27;s auto-shipments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many Razors both electric and blade and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Good product, great price.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect razor for smooth shaving!  </li>
            <li>i love shick and this is they&#x27;re best.</li>
            <li>and on Christmas a family friend bought me a Gillette Fusion Pro-glide to goad me about our sometimes debate about who makes he best razor, thinking he could get me to switch to his favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I get 3 good weeks per razor which I think makes these a great value.</li>
            <li>The best price I was able to find  on the Internet.</li>
            <li>am very fair skinned and at my age I can damage my skin very easily.</li>
            <li>Hubby liked this shaver better than the 4-blade that seemed the best.  </li>
            <li>Good deal compared to B&amp;M stores.</li>
            <li>After Shave Intensive Treatment 4oz]] provides a good \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for hair bumps.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is not even a fair fight.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is not even a fair fight.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve given up on finding a good shave, give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Shick Hydro 5 blades are one of the best available on the market.</li>
            <li>and I want something that does a good job without a lot of fuss.  </li>
            <li>a star from the rating because the edging isn&#x27;t that good.  </li>
            <li>used the razor for two weeks to give me a fair chance to adjust to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave wise I still think the Gillette delivers a superior first/fresh shave experience.</li>
            <li>These provide a smooth shave with an excellent flow.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - the Schick refills are a good value.  </li>
            <li>I give the product 4 stars because the razor does give a good shave (not the closest you&#x27;ll ever get, but good).  </li>
            <li>Continue to give good shave.</li>
            <li>almost as good a shave as the Gillette.</li>
            <li>With the subscribe and save discount he feels he gets good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Superior product at a competitive price sums it up.  </li>
            <li>My husband got a hydro razor for a free trial and now thinks this is the best shave he&#x27;s ever had.  </li>
            <li>work good.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s sunscribe and save is a good way to get this at a discount.</li>
            <li>good shave</li>
            <li>Good razor to shave with.</li>
            <li>This is a good one.</li>
            <li>Good razor</li>
            <li>Lasts a good number of shaves.</li>
            <li>good on my skin, does the job, and the end flips up to get under the nose  </li>
            <li>Perfect for what I needed and arrived on time and package was readily accessible.</li>
            <li>I am sure that you will be happy with the performance just like I was!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you have to do more work to get a great shave</li>
            <li>Buying at Amazon with automatically receiving a fresh box makes it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>The razor is great and I prefer it over the Hydro 3, which doesn&#x27;t glide quite as well and causes more irritation for me.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Received this razor as a freebie 3 years ago and fell in love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was magical!  </li>
            <li>First one didn&#x27;t have the lubricating gel stuff, so resulted in a not too delightful experience.</li>
            <li>These razors are great and cheaper than the store and easy to setup on re-order.  </li>
            <li>Brilliant seller, exactly as advertised, thank you!</li>
            <li>A great blade for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Schick Hydro 5 is amazing.</li>
            <li>The price was also amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing what a difference this made when I switched from Gillette&#x27;s flagship product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grew up on the whole Gillette is the best mentality.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the Hydro 5 works SO well compared with anything else I have ever used that I am telling everyone</li>
            <li>Honestly, the Hydro 5 works SO well compared with anything else I have ever used that I am telling everyone</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s my our own fault</li>
            <li>It would be nice for the seller to take me on my word and send me another shipment basically</li>
            <li>The line of conditioning really makes a night-and-day difference, but the best part is that you can lift it away from the blades to get an even closer shave.  </li>
            <li>But this is a really nice Razor and Refill.....making it 7.99....</li>
            <li>and i use it on my legs, nice and close shave...</li>
            <li>think the lubricant should be lessened, or it would be nice if SHICK offered these w/o the lubricant.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades are nice.</li>
            <li>Yes, I know it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; razor, but honestly it&#x27;s a razor, and it works,</li>
            <li>I own two electric shavers and a safety razor.</li>
            <li>So much so I have purchased a bundle of refills for the both of us and he and I both think they are the best of all.</li>
            <li>Subscribe and save is handy.</li>
            <li>The flip trimmer on the Hydro 5 greatly exceeds the performance of the precision trimmer on the Gillette Fusion line, because it is not painful whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>So very easy to rinse unlike the Sensor excel.</li>
            <li>great, first time dealing with you !</li>
            <li>These give by far the best shave I have come across.  </li>
            <li>I love the shave and comfort of the Fusion Power and honestly in my opinion</li>
            <li>The Shick Hydro blades are really good -- smooth and no nicks.  </li>
            <li>this is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>Here is what I have found to be the best part of this razor so far...</li>
            <li>love the hydro 5; nice close shave, lubricates well without any harshness</li>
            <li>This is the best blade cartridge to use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good products, prices and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Problem Free and would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Amazing shave, I had been using another Schick razor and my skin was always sore and irritated afterwards, I went on line and check consume highest ranking men&#x27;s razor and this razor came up in the top 5.</li>
            <li>never had any issues so far , love them !!!! !!!</li>
            <li>I switched from Gillette Fusion to Schick Hydro, and I honestly believe that, even after the blade has seen a couple weeks of use, I get a smoother, better shave.  </li>
            <li>clean as smooth is my chin because of these beautiful blades without any nicks or scratches.  </li>
            <li>Just another ol&#x27; disposable cheapo razor, nothing real special.  </li>
            <li>I have never been happy with blade shaving and the many nicks that happen even with fresh blades.  </li>
            <li>but these blades are still great and work good on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>These are good and priced right if you own the handle when they&#x27;re on sale.  </li>
            <li>Great razors, exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>That is true but I found it to be a good thing reducing irritation.  </li>
            <li>The new lubricating dots work well and the fold-back mechanism on the Hydro 5 is very good at shaving hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>money is not a problem for you, stick with the Fusion, You may have to replace your blade every 10 days to keep it at its best, but if it really isn&#x27;t a problem as far as money, you&#x27;ll be more happy with it.</li>

            <li>Very smooth</li>
            <li>These blades help give you a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling very smooth without that burning sensation.....</li>
            <li>Good product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Super convenient and good savings.</li>
            <li>He had a Schick Quattro before which he liked fine but LOVES this one.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave and can be used many many times.</li>
            <li>Could probably go more</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I am so glad this razor and these blades were manufactored.</li>
            <li>also shave my head, and the Hydro 5 works much better than the Quattro on my dome as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better shave for cheaper??</li>
            <li>But it gets even better</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly the blades also rusted, so I tossed the blades and will get more.</li>
            <li>Way better blades than anything Gilette has -</li>
            <li>This is only for people who want the best shave a disposable razor can give.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Also, the fusion has a much better grip and is easier to shave with.</li>
            <li>The Fusion power dies off a lot faster and costs more to replace.</li>
            <li>The Fusion power dies off a lot faster and costs more to replace.</li>
            <li>is okay,</li>
            <li>I love these blades.</li>
            <li>I have been a Gillette user for most of my life.</li>
            <li>Got the Shick razor as the free one the hotel gives you when you can&#x27;t bring your own on the plane.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more ?</li>
            <li>Love these blades.  </li>
            <li>You can get better deals by looking on-line and specifically through the Amazon web site.</li>
            <li>Even better ?</li>
            <li>and I have found these to be the best simply because of the price</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I go over parts of my neck, it just will not get a close shave -</li>
            <li>so your beard will love it&lt;br</li>
            <li>top flips</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love this product</li>
            <li>To date I cannot find a razor that works better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know that the blade is touching my head or face.</li>
            <li>I like Schick  better than Gillette.</li>
            <li>I am personally glad I made the switch from Gillette.</li>
            <li>Okay maybe that&#x27;s not so peculiar, but the fact I can use these</li>
            <li>Really love the fact that it has moisturizer inbuilt and it works like a charm on the skin.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li>I used to use the Mach 3 but found this a lot more smoother of a shave.</li>
            <li>i got a better one</li>
            <li>four more words to.....</li>
            <li>but for the cost, they are definitely a better choice in my opinion.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades.  </li>
            <li>But at a better price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a Hydro 6 would shave better.</li>
            <li>Much greater quality than the rip off</li>
            <li>glad I switched.</li>
            <li>The shave of the Schick is slightly better than that of the Gillette.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these blades.</li>
            <li>Better than any razor/blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I get many shaves out of one blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why would I want to pay more for an inferior razor.</li>
            <li>I bet you will be pleased</li>
            <li>In my opinion, these are better than Gillette fusion manual.</li>
            <li>Tried for years to find the perfect razor, one that would last a bit but also give me a close shave that did not burn me up.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say I love the shave I get</li>
            <li>I was worried about how many blades does it take before it gets ridicules?</li>
            <li>This critter is the most efficient animal yet.</li>
            <li>These razors have my the most painless shave of any razor I have used.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>These are such a great deal on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although these are &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be a men&#x27;s razor, I tried these out earlier this year and have been very impressed.</li>
            <li>The 8-cartridge packs are usually a better deal --</li>
            <li>what more do you want????</li>
            <li>Very nice blades, worked really well and gave a close  shave.</li>
            <li>Very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>The blades work pretty well but not as good as my Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>He said that it was a pretty good shave, with no nics.</li>
            <li>However, I just used one of the new ones I bought from this deal, and it was great.</li>
            <li>easily the most irritation-free shave, too.</li>
            <li>the single best shaves</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed, works great, affordable price, recieved quickly.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of razors from so so many brands and most are good on the first shave</li>
            <li>I have used these before and they work fine mostly.</li>
            <li>I use the Fusion most of the time, it works fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering performance vs. cost.... and remembering my experiences with other disposables and replacement blade style razors, I have to say that this is one of the better ways (if not the best) to shave with a smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find them very good for both the regular razor and for the Fusion (vibration).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sure the Gillette ones might be a little better but for the price these work perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Schick is my favorite, so the 5 stars are really for the merchant who offered a very good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It gives the most comfortable head shave I have found.  </li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro 5 (and 3) is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned in 44 years, with a medium, coarse, full face beard</li>
            <li>Will smooth micro fiber work better?</li>
            <li>The shave is comfortable and close, cant ask for more.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and invest in this product, your partner male/female will thank you for making your skin smooth :)</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, I still ensure that I use a top quality shaving foam from Gillette or Neutrogena, but I very very rarely get cuts now</li>
            <li>Shaving is very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Schick now for about a year after bouncing between other brands and am very happy with the closeness and quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver for the money spent!</li>
            <li>They are easy to rinse out and go again.</li>
            <li>that this razor does my cut my face, even against the grain, and makes my skin feel healthy and hydrated after the clean cut shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to change blades.</li>
            <li>Easton use, easy to change.</li>
            <li>They were the perfect ones, came very quickly, and I&#x27;m sure they were about half the cost!</li>
            <li>No blade actually gives me a very smooth shave every time, but these seem to be better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and the quality seems good.</li>
            <li>original good quality fast shipping</li>
            <li>I own both the Schick Hydro 3 and 5 blade (just because I like them so much!)</li>
            <li>These are the best razors you&#x27;ll ever Hughes hands down for a man or a woman</li>
            <li>Smooth, clean shave that lasts more than 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Now for those of you who prefer Gillette, fine.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, fine.</li>
            <li>Now for those of you who prefer Gillette, fine.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, fine.</li>
            <li>That need to change the Gillette more often combined with its already higher price makes the Schick an astonishingly better value.</li>
            <li>blades work fine.  </li>
            <li>Blade is fine, I guess.</li>
            <li>I use Gillette Fusion on my face because it gives a good shave and is easy to clear of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The JBL speakers are nice, but a fast smooth shave every morning is even nicer.</li>
            <li>I use it even though it not the accurate one for me...</li>
            <li>Theses blades provide a smooth shave, no nicks</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great razor that is to be recommended.</li>
            <li>Then, about 1 1/2 years ago, I got a couple of free Hydro 5 razors with some JBL speakers I bought.  </li>
            <li>Baby smooth shave in 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when Schick discontinues that Hydro 5 \\&quot;introductory price,\\&quot; it may still be a more economical choice than the</li>
            <li>I know that it is more than worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>I know that it is more than worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample blade from bodybuilding.com and I noticed that the Schick 5 was smoother and closer shave than the Fusion...and cheaper.</li>
            <li>It was a really smooth, and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>should also note I received two free razors from an order I placed.</li>
            <li>It literally feels like I am shaving with a stick filled with water...</li>
            <li>I have been using Schick Hydro 5 for a few weeks now, and it is the best blade</li>
            <li>The Fusion Power is BETTER than the Hydro 5 in terms of comfort and shave (on a fresh blade).</li>
            <li>for reading, please mark this review as helpful if you liked it at all, as this really helps me.</li>

            <li>for reading, please mark this review as helpful if you liked it at all, as this really helps me.</li>
            <li>They leave my legs smooth and the shave is so close that I can skip a day or two, and sometimes three.</li>
            <li>These razors do a fantastic job at shaving the face.</li>
            <li>These fit my razor handle</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was stunned by how smooth the shaving</li>
            <li>CHEAP (compared to gillette)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>They put a bunch of these out for free in our campus mail room</li>
            <li>The hydrating strip actually works too which leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li>but mostly I cheap out and use the disposable ones.</li>
            <li>Since I have a mustache and a light beard, however, it didn&#x27;t matter cosmetically.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how smooth the shave is with these blades.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as can be.</li>
            <li>So painless, so smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Love to always have a fresh set on hand.</li>
            <li>I returned these since they don&#x27;t fit my razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great razor that keeps me coming back to it time and time again.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of comfortable shaves out of them.  </li>
            <li>, The shave was smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Well it was free, so we bought one and tried it.  </li>
            <li>We travel often and can&#x27;t always have a reusable, electrical model available.  </li>
            <li>I was given a free trial of this razor.</li>
            <li>The blades are so smooth</li>
            <li>After years of using cheap store brand disposable razors, I received one of these as a sample.  </li>
            <li>The concept seemed sound, the power blade vibrates thus helping to cut the stubble without tugging and irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cose and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>My primary issue is that anytime I accessed the page that tells you about price changes in your list, I  would get a notice that the price dropped on the blades when I was between orders, but when it was time for the order to ship...</li>
            <li>This is a great product and would definitely buy again on-line when I need this product again.  </li>
            <li>My son uses this and he found it to be to his liking a smooth shave which is why you buy a razor</li>
            <li>Smooth and thorough cut.  </li>
            <li>However, I believe Subscribe and Save comes with free ground shipping even if you&#x27;re not Prime.</li>
            <li>Another very positive attribute of this razor is that the cost of the replacement cartridges is not outrageous for the quality of the shave you get.  </li>
            <li>Love getting them right to my door</li>
            <li>I originally tried this razor when our then-local grocery store mailed us a free coupon to buy one.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can get a smooth, clean shave in about 30-45 seconds with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro 5 Is a great razor, very comfortable don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s just not as good as the Fusion.</li>

            <li>Bump Patrol Original Formula</li>
            <li>I love these razor blades, but more importantly, I love that they are cheaper than buying them at the local stores.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been married for over 40 years and has not been satisfied with anything I&#x27;ve purchased till I purchased the Schick Hydro shaver.  </li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve hesitated to buy these super-4-blade and 5-blade razors because they were much higher price than the others, or I didnâ€™t think theyâ€™d be any better.</li>
            <li>If you are contemplating buying this refill pack, then you must already be familiar with the product itself.</li>
            <li>The slime washes off cleanly when rinsing after your shave.  </li>
            <li>Hydro 5 is much more forgiving of the phrenological topology of my scalp than the Quattro, and is able to clear those \\&quot;nooks and</li>
            <li>It is very cost effective and worth having if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>and if all your blades for Shlick are from the same batch, will be nice to send me replacements in Fusion Proglide Power blades :-)..</li>
            <li>Easy to shave with, and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I always looked clean</li>
            <li>While I was generally satisfied for a while, even with the more frequent cuts and nicks, I started to notice a LOT of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>And then ... no matter how I clean it ... move it ...</li>
            <li>Shaves well; shaves clean.</li>
            <li>I cant even return them as I threw the packaging putting all my blades in a special container.</li>
            <li>and I have HIGHLY sensitive skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li>Hydro 5 is a very welcomed friend to every man on a budget who stills wants the best possible shave they can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>

            <li>For the razor itself I think Gillette&#x27;s power feature makes a real, noticable difference in blade performance, while Schick&#x27;s is more of a \\&quot;me too\\&quot; gimmick because I can&#x27;t tell any difference with it on or off.</li>
            <li>The blades and lubricant make for one very close and smooth shave!</li>
            <li>Also I use the full pre,during,post shave regiment of products</li>
            <li>They are good blades and they last a while.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, these are the best razors I&#x27;ve used and for how long they last me, the price is great.</li>
            <li>Speaking of love, from the first stroke on my leg the sheer velvety smooth results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have used these razors for about one year and they are the most gentle ones I have uses.</li>
            <li>these blades work good for the razor pictured above.</li>
            <li>these 5 bladed hydro last for about 5 months so these lasted me almost 2 years and were of good quality.</li>
            <li>Its just a bit of plastic, but it keeps the blades off surfaces, lets the razor dry out better, and the refills are kept handy snapped under it.</li>
            <li>The lubricating strip lasts longer and I noticed that I can easily shave against the grain after i have had a first shave in the direction of the grain.</li>
            <li>, I get a clean shave every time, lasts a while, price is pretty cheap for 4 blades...</li>
            <li>Not only does it compete with the best out there, it is simply unbeatable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been shaving on a daily basis for many, many years</li>
            <li>I received my shipment at the price quoted and received it rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many different brands, in an attempt to minimize the time, irritation and hassle.  </li>
            <li>It does not run out evenly (one side of the bar will run out faster) and runs out fairly quickly I think.</li>
            <li>rust appears quickly on them</li>
            <li>After decades of using Gillette products, accidental circumstances led me to using Schick disposables from which I quickly graduated to using this 5 blade model.  </li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon has me covered.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and money was saved.</li>
            <li>While not as slick as the Gillette shave fresh from the box its still a very good, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have used these blades for about two years, and I have discovered that their performance is much better with a high quality shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Schick Hydro 5 Power razor on special, and figured it was worth a shot...</li>
            <li>but this makes his head as smooth as a baby dolphin, haha!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m open-minded and willing to switch if the product is proven better...and the Schick won again.  </li>
            <li>Since Amazon opened up their new shaving department I have started to buy more shaving supplies there.  </li>
            <li>These blades are great, less irritation than anything I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li>Super close shave, lasts for weeks per blade and rarely nicks...</li>
            <li>this razor not only does a better job, but you don&#x27;t need to replace the blades every damn week!</li>
            <li>When these first hit the market, I was excited to get them and try them out; I use the blades to shave my cranium, and face.....</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades they cut great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Love my soft legs and so does my fella!  </li>
            <li>Fine trimming mechanism work very well.</li>
            <li>They are real razors and work just fine.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy, and they are a little bit cheaper too.</li>
            <li>(and I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll easily get 3 times by the time I finally move on to a new blade--maybe more).</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, this razor provided an incredibly comfortable and close shave.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I enjoy using these and really like the case they come in as they are convenient for storage or travel.</li>
            <li>Since each refill lasts me at least a month, with every day shaving, and leaves my face smooth without any cuts, it is a great value.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels smooth after each shave, not to mention a very close shave.</li>
            <li>These have to be my favorite razors so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this honest and as unbiased as I possibly can.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than the Hydro 5, simply as far as the shave and comfort levels.</li>
            <li>From Amazon they are almost worth the price.</li>
            <li>Hydro 5 offers a comparable shave at a greater value.  </li>
            <li>Ir you expect to complete most of your shave without rinsing, then of course they will.</li>
            <li>He says he gets about a month out of each blade and that they are economical for him to se.</li>
            <li>I have not had success with this product after my 1st shave.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall, the shave is nice with no 5&#x27; o clock shadow.</li>
            <li>I have only nicked myself once, and that was my own fault for being in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Gillette is more widely available; for example, Costco sells only Gillette products.  </li>
            <li>blade of a Fusion Power lasts me 10-15 days, with the first shave being excellent and the last being much less smooth than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Faster than the electric using super hot water.</li>
            <li>I probably didn&#x27;t explain that very well, but again it probably doesn&#x27;t matter much since most interested in these blades will be men and not shaving their bikini area.</li>
            <li>I know, right?</li>
            <li>Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in hard plastic case for clean storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and tend to get razor burn really easily.</li>
            <li>It shaves a bit better but the major improvement is that it lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>I have a bald head and until recently didn&#x27;t realize how easy, painless and smooth that my shave could be until a friend gave me a Schick blade to use.</li>
            <li>The problem is to get that good of a shave, i have to do some swipes across the grain instead of just with the grain because the blades will pass right over hair that is laying down instead of \\&quot;guiding it in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I can usually get a week to 10 days out of one blade which is great.</li>
            <li>Other than that, pretty good.</li>
            <li>Schick Hydro 5 is very good and cheap compare to expensive brand name</li>
            <li>WIth proper hydration (you do need to make sure you shave surface is wet), this razor aptly lubricates the area for a clean and consistent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you start to lose that smooth edge switch to a new blade.</li>
            <li>It is only after a few days of shaving that you get the best of the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>Although I won&#x27;t get a shipment for another 3 months as I set up when I started the save and subscribe, I think it&#x27;s a great way to get your product without going through the hassle of going to the store and getting a more expensive set of blades.</li>
            <li>I tended to feel that Fusion was more aggressive, and was more snatching what was to be cut after a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use fusion blades but these blades give me as good a shave and are half the price.</li>
            <li>These work really well, get the job done quickly</li>
            <li>Simply the best blade I have used in the over 50 years I&#x27;ve been shaving this heavy beard of mine.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s amazing is how much longer the blades give that same consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>and of course the final shave is very very smooth and what you would expect from a 5 bladed shave</li>
            <li>, it gives a very smooth, shave, complete, and with no risk of rush, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>These are way overpriced and not any more effective than anything DSC offers for half and even a quarter of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The Hydro 5-bladed razor from Schick is high-quality and comfortable compared to many other razors.  </li>
            <li>Great product but price is a little high.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than Gillette, also price is less than Gillette, lasts long than Gillette, so why pay more :) I</li>
            <li>I switched to the Hydro 3 when it came out, but the lack of a trimmer and overall lack of a clean shave prompted me to try the 5-blade (both 3- and 5-blade cartridges fit the handles).  </li>
            <li>I first received a $10.00 Dollar coupon in the mail for this new shaving accessory which is a great improvement over the previous multi blade products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>When I first picked up the Schick Hydro 5</li>
            <li>Schick products exactly 3 times in my life.</li>
            <li>early August the amazon Vine program gave me the opportunity to try the Hydro 5 razor for free.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it was almost exactly $5 CHEAPER than the equivilent Gillette Fusion 4-packs--and lets not even go INTO what Gillette is now charging for their newest ProGlide razors.</li>
            <li>This specific order though, none of the blades lasted me more than 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>Not a horrible set back, so i rounded up.</li>
            <li>At first I was pretty skeptical about going on the save and subscribe program but after receiving my first shipment of the Hydro blades, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>that I was overly eager to search given how much they all cost!  </li>
            <li>Worth it in the long run to purchase better blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different multi-blade razors including the Mach 3, Quattro, and Fusion.  </li>
            <li>- the Schick Quattro is my favorite overall razor for shave and value.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different razors over the years and have found these to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just wasn&#x27;t willing to take the time required to use one.</li>
            <li>Shaves pretty well.</li>
            <li>These days a double bladed safety razor seems to be the much better buy.</li>
            <li>and I should rate them much higher than Gilette Mach or knockoff razors.  </li>
            <li>(hey, sometimes you get lazy and call it a jeans-only week... :P)</li>
            <li>These are great razors, but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I like so much this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing (my first)</li>
            <li>When I first started shaving with it</li>
            <li>these damn blades are so expensive but this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever found</li>
            <li>This shaves smooth and leaves the skin feeling soooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>In the fourth and fifth week, I need to apply a bit more pressure to the razor.</li>
            <li>Schick Hydro 5 blades are so much better than Gillette blades.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother shaves and last longer than Gillette.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Warm water activates the gel and reduces drag when shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it advertises itself to do every shave, is consistent in blade quality with every pack I buy and has a durable and long-lasting feel and quality to the handle.</li>
            <li>I use can shaving cream, and rise razor out with hot water.  </li>
            <li>As you are currently aware, razors must be made of GOLD, because the price&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every blade out there, and this leaves such a smooth finish!  </li>
            <li>The price I paid was more than what it would have cot if I had gone to a local drug store.</li>
            <li>However, this does provide a good shave for my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>, I need a good razor for the few times I do shave.</li>
            <li>Previously, my go-to razor has been the Venus Embrace because I loved the absurdly large moisture ring.</li>
            <li>The first day I&#x27;m super smooth, but by the next day I&#x27;m prickly.</li>
            <li>I started using some cheap store brand razors, trying to save money, but quickly threw them away and switched back to these.</li>
            <li>since the blade was brand new, I needed a least 2 weeks to get a strong idea on the product.&lt;br /&gt;The result is great after two weeks (no thick beard btw), I could see the difference compared to the Gillette Fusion that would burn my face after a bit.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find a merchant on Amazon.com who did not cost a small fortune for this item!  </li>
            <li>Pro glide does rinse a little bit better but the flip down precision shave feature on the hydro is better than the proglides single blade strip although I personally love both to be honest.</li>
            <li>has been nice and sharp for months.</li>
            <li>The cut is extremely smooth and the hydrating gel does actually work (though it sometimes takes one full shave for it to really get activated).</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, very long lasting -- and therefore VERY economical!</li>
            <li>: I am STILL using my original blade clear into October, more than TWICE as long as I could get from anything I had used by Gillette</li>
            <li>The package rapped very well and shipping is very fast..</li>
            <li>Good grip to the handle too, easy to store, and the trimmer adaptation helps my stray hairs somewhat, but not perfectly in stubborn areas such as under the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the best use is a few days after I start a new blade.</li>
            <li>Hydro 5 also has the advantage of being much easier to clean and clear of beard/hair than the Quattro.</li>
            <li>liked it to shave my all hairs down and up</li>
            <li>I cannot say they last any longer that the older blades but the worked better.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can usually only shave once every 3 days (I am a 45yr old male) these blades are by far and away the best I have tried and this is someone who has used them all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole system is pretty much a gimmick, from the vibrating razor to the floating blade.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very particular about what type of razor he has me to buy.</li>
            <li>The shave quality was the same from both, but given the longevity of the hydro blades and their price, it was an easy choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pull back top guard works great on upper lip, gets hard to reach hair right under the nose.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different types and brands of razors, both for men and women.</li>
            <li>Like so many personal care items, this is subject to a certain degree and another blade may work better for you.  </li>
            <li>Good blades, smooth glide but not as sharp as Gilette Fusion blades but cost 40% less though.</li>
            <li>I normally have dry skin after shaving, and this razor keeps my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Nothing left but smooth</li>
            <li>Thanks Schick</li>
            <li>Really really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a much smarter idea to invest in blades rather than whole razors</li>
            <li>and the strip wears out fast rapidly degrading the shave experience.</li>
            <li>They deliver a close shave without much irritation.</li>
            <li>was short on blades with my Fusion, so I went ahead and tried this free Hydro 5 Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I am always open for suggestions that would help my problem so feel free to comment.</li>
            <li>The hydro-portion, the moisturizing bar, creates too much of a glide, feeling like you aren&#x27;t shaving close at all.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave</li>
            <li>I would like to know what the material is for the razor used, as I do not believe there is much quality put into these as oppossed to the &#x27;marketing hype&#x27; that is.....</li>
            <li>real hydro cause it ooze with lubricant</li>
            <li>Fast forward to vacation</li>
            <li>thats about all you need to say really.</li>
            <li>My husband has used disposable three blade razors for most of his adult life and constantly complained about how cut up his face was and how many areas were missed.  </li>
            <li>These blades are also much cheaper in prices than the Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really works well with the Hydro 5 Battery powered razor</li>
            <li>The moisture strip really lessens any shaving rash.</li>
            <li>Schick really delivers.  </li>
            <li>it left my skin smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades give you such a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>No fusions or cheap disposables are in my future.</li>
            <li>And considering I don&#x27;t like to shave very often</li>
            <li>and I really like the shave.</li>
            <li>This razor and blade is so much faster, cleaner, and closer than my $200 electric razor</li>
            <li>They work very well, and hold up.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, the real reason I wrote this review is to mention that the blades are made in the U.S.A, not China, like some reviews state.</li>
            <li>I really like these blades.</li>
            <li>I order these for my son as it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying at a drug/grocery store</li>
            <li>so I do not run through blades as fast as more men, but I have to say that moisture thing on the top is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice not having to buy new blades at the previous rate.</li>
            <li>Tried these Schick blades and agree with other reviewers they&#x27;re better than Gillette.</li>
            <li>Better than the &#x27;other&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li>I bought the Schick Hydro originally as a gimmick that I had seen on a television commercial.</li>
            <li>which you get the same clean cut.</li>
            <li>but every 3 days, my facial hair is not heavy, in fact, it is medium-light, so again the &#x27;romance&#x27; with these is starting to wain a bit, yet, I will most likely continue their use, unless I invest in a &#x27;top of the line&#x27; electric model.</li>
            <li>Gives a great shave, doesn&#x27;t seem to last past about a week.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave and a lot less bleeding :)</li>
            <li>this gives a much better and closer shave (without any irritation) and lasts twice as much and costs less than Mach3...</li>
            <li>I received a free Hydro 5 razor at school, and was not enthusiast since I was a long time</li>
            <li>and they were pretty sharp, smooth and longlasting.</li>
            <li>Considering these blades are so expensive at my local stores, I am now glad to have found it here for a good price.</li>
            <li>They are normally pretty expensive and this was a pretty good deal that I found.</li>
            <li>Very smooth soft, closed shaved.</li>
            <li>Arrived extremely fast and was brand new in sealed retail package with no damage.</li>
            <li>A brand new Gillette really does glide over my skin effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Use a toothbrush (new, only for this purpose) to clean it thoroughly every time.  </li>
            <li>Some sucked more, some sucked less, but they all sucked.  </li>
            <li>The ever soaring prices of the Gillette Fusion Power made me decide to give Schicks latest razors, at nearly half the cost of Gillette, another try with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>However, a razor that is able to cut the hair low but not so low that the hair kinks, curls, or otherwise cannot grow \\&quot;normally\\&quot;, solves the hair bump/razor bump problem.  </li>
            <li>and I have a steady supply of these gems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades last a while, but you&#x27;ll know when they&#x27;re done, because they start to rust fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>They should redo the flip back top strip and come up with something that can endure regular bathroom/shower/sink use.</li>
            <li>1* only because I&#x27;d prefer these in a 5-pack - the shave, itself, is remarkably better than the same product name on the disposables.</li>
            <li>I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\</li>
            <li>Much better value than the more expensive Gillette blades.</li>
            <li>The people selling the single razors in packages are ripping people off, you can get those from Schick for free, (The blades are where they make their money).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li>But when you have to pay for high price celebrities</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m deducting one star because the price of the replacement cartridges is stupidly high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you use a high quality shaving cream I would give the blades a 4 star.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing less of phenomenal, I find $15 a big expense for your face but worth the price in the end.</li>
            <li>I used these blades in conjunction with a Hydro 5 power select, so you can find that review for a little more info.  </li>
            <li>Just because a celebrity endorses a product doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better!  </li>
            <li>I get a nice shave every time and hardly ever nick myself.  </li>
            <li>I mainly feel this improvement when i cannot shave right after a shower, when i wait till the following morning.  </li>
            <li>I am not a thick beared person</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor,and I like the fact that the replacement blades are not overly expensive.</li>
            <li>Used to be about the Mach series razors until I tried Schick about a year ago, much gentler on my thicker stub and easier on my sensitive skin with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>It does leave your face \\&quot;slimey\\&quot;, especially when you pop in a fresh blade, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I were to have ANY kind of complaint</li>
            <li>They are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I shave my face and head daily and rarely experience any nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>better, Hydro 5 blades last a long time.  </li>
            <li>While I normally like to research the products I purchase before, I decided for the cost, why not give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try not to leave the razor in the shower because the lubrication strip will begin to disintegrate quicker than normal.  </li>
            <li>This is a very forgiving razor that glides smoothly over the skin, through the hairs, than previous razors that I have used.</li>
            <li>Holding it up to the shower head is enough to clear it out quickly and</li>
            <li>I tried to switch to a two, or even 3 black razor and they cut my face everywhere, I have sensitive, oily, acne prominent skin and I ding</li>
            <li>handle is much more solid than other brands, and the blades run much longer than others.. and no irritation or anything...</li>
            <li>I am not at all certain HOW this works, but for the economically challenged (ie: ME) here is how I break it down: better shave for less $$ that lasts 2-3 times longer &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Smooth, fast, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Razor bumps/hair bumps are usually caused because hair curls, kinks, or other wise is cut so low that once it is below the skin in cannot grow \\&quot;normally\\&quot; because it cannot get back to the top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>one converted &amp; newly convinced customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one converted &amp; newly convinced customer.    </li>
            <li>Sealed and packaged just like new in the store.</li>
            <li>I popped in a new blade and it felt like heaven all over again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was like a new shaving experience.</li>
            <li>but I think even women will experience a new shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I had been a Gillette man for years, but I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>Whenever they escalate the number of blades in the \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>They are worth the extra money as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strip that flips back on top, if it gets wet, like anything would in a shower.  </li>
            <li>I struggled to find a razor out there that I could use because I have very sensitive skin and curely hair</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>First that critter is becoming old technology and getting hard to find</li>
            <li>introductory price made it a better deal than my usual Schick Quattro disposable, so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I MUST admit that I had pretty low expectations--</li>
            <li>Wow, I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also willing to answer questions and such if you want to leave a comment.able.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also willing to answer questions and such if you want to leave a comment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>These also tend to last longer than most other brands.  </li>
            <li>This razor mysteriously appeared in my bathroom and belonged to no one (according to the roomies *eyeroll*), so I thought I would buy cartridges for it and see how it worked.</li>
            <li>The price is also a big plus with other razors more expensive.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Truly leaves the skin baby soft!</li>
            <li>Came earlier than promised, which was very welcomed!</li>
            <li>I can get 6 months out of one cartridge making sure to dry it immediately and vacuum, yes, vacuum it after shaves to really get all the water out.</li>
            <li>:&lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades, sharp and clean</li>
            <li>These blades are super smooth and shave extra close...don&#x27;t waste money on the Aloe/sensitive skin version blades- its just marketing!</li>
            <li>After using this for the first time, I noticed how smooth and painless it felt as my hard whiskers were being removed.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lot less comfortable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lot less comfortable.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and long lasting</li>
            <li>have normal thickness facial hair, but it grows fast</li>
            <li>The moisture strip is a lot smaller than on the Embrace, but seems to be equally as effective, if not more so, at preventing irritation.</li>
            <li>Overall, a better shave, blades last just as long</li>
            <li>They last a good while as long as they are thoroughly cleaned and dried after each time they are used.</li>
            <li>I was able to get about a half  of month worth of shaving out of one blade before I got a little bit of that \\&quot;tug and pull\\</li>
            <li>I used each one of the blades thinking that may be the next one will be better and ending up running out of all of them in less than 30 days.</li>
            <li>This blade cartridge is nice, i can shave fairly quickly with it (for me), it used to take forever when i was young because i was scared of cutting myself.  </li>
            <li>I prefer these to pretty much any other (womens) razor I have tried.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t try to use each too long than you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>Cut super close and stay sharp for a while.  </li>
            <li>As a guy with some coarse facial hair and sensitive skin it has always been hard to find good razors.  </li>
            <li>Now, I do tend to be sensitive to shaving and this really made that obvious.  </li>
            <li>No nicks, razor burns, etc., and a cinch to keep clear of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive face...best blade ever</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and always have issues with irritation - until now.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, give these a try.  </li>
            <li>Wife and daughters are not allowed to touch the old man&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li>Each time left me with intense razor burn and irritation to the point where I had sworn off attempting to purchase ANY Schick product ever again.</li>
            <li>basically translated into buying Gillette products for 95% of my adult shaving years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the beefier handle of the Power Select over the standard handle razor so even if the power feature doesn&#x27;t do much I will still stick with the Power Select model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>...let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They seem to work nicely on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Upon beginning to use the Schick Hydro 5, I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I really cannot see myself using anything else to shave in the future.</li>
            <li>This simply does the job and does it very well.</li>
            <li>a few years ago and a free pack of these got me to convert</li>
            <li>These are one of the few blades that are comfortable for me to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When I pull the blade across my face I still don&#x27;t feel any blades touch my skin, am still sometimes surprised that I&#x27;m getting a shave at all.</li>
            <li>i was surprised with the results...</li>
            <li>They last a week; he shaves daily.&lt;br /&gt;They are priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li>The extra lubrication of these Schick blades really make all the difference.</li>
            <li>I always get a close shave and can actually use these about 4-6 times before they&#x27;re absolutely unusable to me.</li>
            <li>A person with sane shaving habits could probably use one for nearly two weeks before needing to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse Italian hair, and I can still get a good shave even on a 3 week old</li>
            <li>The moisturizing part that flips back to leave just the blades is great for trimming sideburns and other hard to reach areas around the nose.</li>
            <li>If I were to have ANY kind of complaint it would be this: shaving immediately under my nose can be a bit tricky because the blade housing is slightly thicker than Gillette models making it a bit more difficult to navigate around--but it CAN be done...just not quite as easily as I have become accustomed to using my Fusion razors.</li>
            <li>These razors last a long time and the 5 blades get super close to the skin.</li>
            <li>And it seems to last a super long time before becoming dull and needing replacement blades.</li>
            <li>The price is right, it cuts through my thick facial, and head hair well, and works as good if not better than Gillettes</li>
            <li>This light weight razor with movable blades to avoid cutting is really just super.  </li>
            <li>The Schick 5 is in my opinion a better razor, gives a better shave and is priced at a less expensive price.</li>
            <li>These should technically last more than a month (and they have in past).</li>
            <li>If you are wanting this one, try it out first before buying extra blades because you may experience the same as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do particularly well on my coarse stubble.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Edging mode\\&quot; just clicks back the blue top portion, so you can&#x27;t edge in tight on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness</li>
            <li>If you did that, you would not really be spending more because the blades would get used less than 1 blade for doing both.</li>
            <li>However, I believe Subscribe and Save comes with free ground shipping even if you&#x27;re not Prime.lling you the current price and the price of the previous</li>
            <li>Shaves close, keeps my legs smooth all day (a past problem with stubble at the end of the day w/the mach)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor companies can keep setting their prices, but I might re-learn a straight razor before too long.  </li>
            <li>However, I plan to drop my Prime membership because small products like razor blades are increasingly listed as \\&quot;add-on items\\&quot; which are not eligible for free Prime shipping even if you pay for Prime.  </li>

            <li>I also used for my normal face grooming and the results were the same.</li>
            <li>it would be this: shaving immediately under my nose can be a bit tricky because the blade housing is slightly thicker than Gillette models making it a bit more difficult to navigate around--but it CAN be done...just not quite as easily as I have become accustomed to using my Fusion razors.</li>
            <li>My facial/neck area hairs turn inward however after using the same blade for several months(head and face), it has been a real pleasure.</li>
            <li>The hydro pad really helps (the blue pad on the gillette looks more stiff and less</li>
            <li>They arrived in a timely fashion and are perfect - too bad they don&#x27;t carry Schick products in Bulgaria!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kudos to Schick for a generations-leap ahead.e is how I break it down: better shave for less $$ that lasts 2-3 times longer &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Previously, used Gillette mach 3 and Fusion products and Schick works for me better for less money to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a female, these refills as well as the razor are serious yet has more advantages than disadvantages.</li>
            <li>After years of searching for a decent shave, I finally found (actually, received one as a promotion) the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it glides over my face avoiding all the tough spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>After years and years of being a loyal Gillette Fusion subject, I finally became fed up with the price gouging that had been going on.  </li>
            <li>and I can generally get</li>
            <li>but it always left something to be desired; specifically, the ability to clear the blade of hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades last a long time, much longer than the hydrating gel on the blade.  </li>
            <li>Much closer shave with absolutely no razor burn or cuts.</li>
            <li>However, my old sensor excel had no ventilation at the back of these blades for rinsing.</li>
            <li>These are the only cartridges that (for me at least) easily last more than a week.</li>
            <li>I easily get at least double the use over Gillette before I notice any change in razor performance.</li>
            <li>At first I might get a few minor nicks, then a few weeks of smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also much cheaper here than any other store out there.</li>
            <li>I could feet the other razor much like I could feel the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>razors work well and dont rough up my skin thanks to the aloe (i guess), though I never had a problem with the regular non-aloe blades.</li>
            <li>5 is that it has a pretty broad cartridge head, so there&#x27;s a little bit of an learning/experience curve to deal with so you don&#x27;t accidentally shave too deeply into your established beard/mustache/sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did take a little time to figure out how to change the first refill.</li>
            <li>From the very first shaves, I had very little irritation, and only occasional cuts.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found that the lubricating strip on these blades lasts much longer than on some of the other more expensive kinds.</li>
            <li>Several times, I have tried to switch back to a blade, and have suffered cuts, irritation, ingrown hairs, bumps, redness, and just general misery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hydro gell strip doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the blades.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the blades dull quickly (because they are smaller?)</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the Ultra Glide wears out quickly.</li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave than any Gillette razor offered and my face doesn&#x27;t look like a red mess.  </li>
            <li>The product is also economic as you can shave several times with one mess unit.</li>
            <li>I originally gave it to my son, to take to college with him, since I was long past destroying my face with another new gadget.</li>
            <li>Not a single complaint about a nicked face in the past several months, and they give a very smooth shave.  </li>

            <li> Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great price for a quality five blade razor.</li>
            <li> It provides a great shaving experience at lower price than it competitor.</li>
            <li> Great price and value.</li>
            <li> Great razors, get this on subscribe and save..</li>
            <li> Amazon has a great price too.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this price unless there is a great sale... which is never when I need a refill.</li>
            <li> I took a leap of faith and switched brands to the Schick Hydro 5 and am happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> But this was a great price.</li>
            <li> Great prices, and</li>
            <li> As with the mating razor, these do a great job.</li>
            <li> We bought this one and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head too and it did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li> , I have found a razor I can afford and does a great job.</li>
            <li> It does a great job day 1.</li>
            <li> The Shick Hydro 5 blades are great -- I prefer these because of the hydration strip.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Great razors for the price, have these razors on our subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> great blade has 5</li>
            <li> Great price on these razors.  </li>
            <li> It was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Great razors for the money.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> The lubricating strip is great for those in between shaves.</li>
            <li> So saving money on a great product should make you as happy as as it made me.</li>
            <li> I especially enjoy Amazon&#x27;s auto-shipments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Razors both electric and blade and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect razor for smooth shaving!  </li>
            <li> i love shick and this is they&#x27;re best.</li>
            <li> and on Christmas a family friend bought me a Gillette Fusion Pro-glide to goad me about our sometimes debate about who makes he best razor, thinking he could get me to switch to his favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I get 3 good weeks per razor which I think makes these a great value.</li>
            <li> The best price I was able to find  on the Internet.</li>
            <li> am very fair skinned and at my age I can damage my skin very easily.</li>
            <li> Hubby liked this shaver better than the 4-blade that seemed the best.  </li>
            <li> Good deal compared to B&amp;M stores.</li>
            <li> After Shave Intensive Treatment 4oz]] provides a good \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for hair bumps.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is not even a fair fight.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is not even a fair fight.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve given up on finding a good shave, give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Shick Hydro 5 blades are one of the best available on the market.</li>
            <li> and I want something that does a good job without a lot of fuss.  </li>
            <li> a star from the rating because the edging isn&#x27;t that good.  </li>
            <li> used the razor for two weeks to give me a fair chance to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave wise I still think the Gillette delivers a superior first/fresh shave experience.</li>
            <li> These provide a smooth shave with an excellent flow.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - the Schick refills are a good value.  </li>
            <li> I give the product 4 stars because the razor does give a good shave (not the closest you&#x27;ll ever get, but good).  </li>
            <li> Continue to give good shave.</li>
            <li> almost as good a shave as the Gillette.</li>
            <li> With the subscribe and save discount he feels he gets good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Superior product at a competitive price sums it up.  </li>
            <li> My husband got a hydro razor for a free trial and now thinks this is the best shave he&#x27;s ever had.  </li>
            <li> work good.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s sunscribe and save is a good way to get this at a discount.</li>
            <li> good shave</li>
            <li> Good razor to shave with.</li>
            <li> This is a good one.</li>
            <li> Good razor</li>
            <li> Lasts a good number of shaves.</li>
            <li> good on my skin, does the job, and the end flips up to get under the nose  </li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed and arrived on time and package was readily accessible.</li>
            <li> I am sure that you will be happy with the performance just like I was!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you have to do more work to get a great shave</li>
            <li> Buying at Amazon with automatically receiving a fresh box makes it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The razor is great and I prefer it over the Hydro 3, which doesn&#x27;t glide quite as well and causes more irritation for me.</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Received this razor as a freebie 3 years ago and fell in love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was magical!  </li>
            <li> First one didn&#x27;t have the lubricating gel stuff, so resulted in a not too delightful experience.</li>
            <li> These razors are great and cheaper than the store and easy to setup on re-order.  </li>
            <li> Brilliant seller, exactly as advertised, thank you!</li>
            <li> A great blade for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro 5 is amazing.</li>
            <li> The price was also amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what a difference this made when I switched from Gillette&#x27;s flagship product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grew up on the whole Gillette is the best mentality.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the Hydro 5 works SO well compared with anything else I have ever used that I am telling everyone</li>
            <li> Honestly, the Hydro 5 works SO well compared with anything else I have ever used that I am telling everyone</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s my our own fault</li>
            <li> It would be nice for the seller to take me on my word and send me another shipment basically</li>
            <li> The line of conditioning really makes a night-and-day difference, but the best part is that you can lift it away from the blades to get an even closer shave.  </li>
            <li> But this is a really nice Razor and Refill.....making it 7.99....</li>
            <li> and i use it on my legs, nice and close shave...</li>
            <li> think the lubricant should be lessened, or it would be nice if SHICK offered these w/o the lubricant.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades are nice.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; razor, but honestly it&#x27;s a razor, and it works,</li>
            <li> I own two electric shavers and a safety razor.</li>
            <li> So much so I have purchased a bundle of refills for the both of us and he and I both think they are the best of all.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and save is handy.</li>
            <li> The flip trimmer on the Hydro 5 greatly exceeds the performance of the precision trimmer on the Gillette Fusion line, because it is not painful whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> So very easy to rinse unlike the Sensor excel.</li>
            <li> great, first time dealing with you !</li>
            <li> These give by far the best shave I have come across.  </li>
            <li> I love the shave and comfort of the Fusion Power and honestly in my opinion</li>
            <li> The Shick Hydro blades are really good -- smooth and no nicks.  </li>
            <li> this is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> Here is what I have found to be the best part of this razor so far...</li>
            <li> love the hydro 5; nice close shave, lubricates well without any harshness</li>
            <li> This is the best blade cartridge to use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good products, prices and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Problem Free and would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Amazing shave, I had been using another Schick razor and my skin was always sore and irritated afterwards, I went on line and check consume highest ranking men&#x27;s razor and this razor came up in the top 5.</li>
            <li> never had any issues so far , love them !!!! !!!</li>
            <li> I switched from Gillette Fusion to Schick Hydro, and I honestly believe that, even after the blade has seen a couple weeks of use, I get a smoother, better shave.  </li>
            <li> clean as smooth is my chin because of these beautiful blades without any nicks or scratches.  </li>
            <li> Just another ol&#x27; disposable cheapo razor, nothing real special.  </li>
            <li> I have never been happy with blade shaving and the many nicks that happen even with fresh blades.  </li>
            <li> but these blades are still great and work good on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> These are good and priced right if you own the handle when they&#x27;re on sale.  </li>
            <li> Great razors, exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> That is true but I found it to be a good thing reducing irritation.  </li>
            <li> The new lubricating dots work well and the fold-back mechanism on the Hydro 5 is very good at shaving hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li> very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> money is not a problem for you, stick with the Fusion, You may have to replace your blade every 10 days to keep it at its best, but if it really isn&#x27;t a problem as far as money, you&#x27;ll be more happy with it.</li>

            <li> Very smooth</li>
            <li> These blades help give you a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling very smooth without that burning sensation.....</li>
            <li> Good product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Super convenient and good savings.</li>
            <li> He had a Schick Quattro before which he liked fine but LOVES this one.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave and can be used many many times.</li>
            <li> Could probably go more</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I am so glad this razor and these blades were manufactored.</li>
            <li> also shave my head, and the Hydro 5 works much better than the Quattro on my dome as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better shave for cheaper??</li>
            <li> But it gets even better</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly the blades also rusted, so I tossed the blades and will get more.</li>
            <li> Way better blades than anything Gilette has -</li>
            <li> This is only for people who want the best shave a disposable razor can give.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Also, the fusion has a much better grip and is easier to shave with.</li>
            <li> The Fusion power dies off a lot faster and costs more to replace.</li>

            <li> is okay,</li>
            <li> I love these blades.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette user for most of my life.</li>
            <li> Got the Shick razor as the free one the hotel gives you when you can&#x27;t bring your own on the plane.  </li>
            <li> Need I say more ?</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  </li>
            <li> You can get better deals by looking on-line and specifically through the Amazon web site.</li>
            <li> Even better ?</li>
            <li> and I have found these to be the best simply because of the price</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I go over parts of my neck, it just will not get a close shave -</li>
            <li> so your beard will love it&lt;br</li>
            <li> top flips</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love this product</li>
            <li> To date I cannot find a razor that works better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know that the blade is touching my head or face.</li>
            <li> I like Schick  better than Gillette.</li>
            <li> I am personally glad I made the switch from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Okay maybe that&#x27;s not so peculiar, but the fact I can use these</li>
            <li> Really love the fact that it has moisturizer inbuilt and it works like a charm on the skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Mach 3 but found this a lot more smoother of a shave.</li>
            <li> i got a better one</li>
            <li> four more words to.....</li>
            <li> but for the cost, they are definitely a better choice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades.  </li>
            <li> But at a better price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a Hydro 6 would shave better.</li>
            <li> Much greater quality than the rip off</li>
            <li> glad I switched.</li>
            <li> The shave of the Schick is slightly better than that of the Gillette.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these blades.</li>
            <li> Better than any razor/blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I get many shaves out of one blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why would I want to pay more for an inferior razor.</li>
            <li> I bet you will be pleased</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these are better than Gillette fusion manual.</li>
            <li> Tried for years to find the perfect razor, one that would last a bit but also give me a close shave that did not burn me up.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say I love the shave I get</li>
            <li> I was worried about how many blades does it take before it gets ridicules?</li>
            <li> This critter is the most efficient animal yet.</li>
            <li> These razors have my the most painless shave of any razor I have used.</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> These are such a great deal on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although these are &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be a men&#x27;s razor, I tried these out earlier this year and have been very impressed.</li>
            <li> The 8-cartridge packs are usually a better deal --</li>
            <li> what more do you want????</li>
            <li> Very nice blades, worked really well and gave a close  shave.</li>
            <li> Very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> The blades work pretty well but not as good as my Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> He said that it was a pretty good shave, with no nics.</li>
            <li> However, I just used one of the new ones I bought from this deal, and it was great.</li>
            <li> easily the most irritation-free shave, too.</li>
            <li> the single best shaves</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed, works great, affordable price, recieved quickly.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of razors from so so many brands and most are good on the first shave</li>
            <li> I have used these before and they work fine mostly.</li>
            <li> I use the Fusion most of the time, it works fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering performance vs. cost.... and remembering my experiences with other disposables and replacement blade style razors, I have to say that this is one of the better ways (if not the best) to shave with a smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find them very good for both the regular razor and for the Fusion (vibration).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sure the Gillette ones might be a little better but for the price these work perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Schick is my favorite, so the 5 stars are really for the merchant who offered a very good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It gives the most comfortable head shave I have found.  </li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 (and 3) is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned in 44 years, with a medium, coarse, full face beard</li>
            <li> Will smooth micro fiber work better?</li>
            <li> The shave is comfortable and close, cant ask for more.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and invest in this product, your partner male/female will thank you for making your skin smooth :)</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> , I still ensure that I use a top quality shaving foam from Gillette or Neutrogena, but I very very rarely get cuts now</li>
            <li> Shaving is very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick now for about a year after bouncing between other brands and am very happy with the closeness and quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver for the money spent!</li>
            <li> They are easy to rinse out and go again.</li>
            <li> that this razor does my cut my face, even against the grain, and makes my skin feel healthy and hydrated after the clean cut shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> Easton use, easy to change.</li>
            <li> They were the perfect ones, came very quickly, and I&#x27;m sure they were about half the cost!</li>
            <li> No blade actually gives me a very smooth shave every time, but these seem to be better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and the quality seems good.</li>
            <li> original good quality fast shipping</li>
            <li> I own both the Schick Hydro 3 and 5 blade (just because I like them so much!)</li>
            <li> These are the best razors you&#x27;ll ever Hughes hands down for a man or a woman</li>
            <li> Smooth, clean shave that lasts more than 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Now for those of you who prefer Gillette, fine.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, fine.</li>
            <li> Now for those of you who prefer Gillette, fine.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, fine.</li>
            <li> That need to change the Gillette more often combined with its already higher price makes the Schick an astonishingly better value.</li>
            <li> blades work fine.  </li>
            <li> Blade is fine, I guess.</li>
            <li> I use Gillette Fusion on my face because it gives a good shave and is easy to clear of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The JBL speakers are nice, but a fast smooth shave every morning is even nicer.</li>
            <li> I use it even though it not the accurate one for me...</li>
            <li> Theses blades provide a smooth shave, no nicks</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great razor that is to be recommended.</li>
            <li> Then, about 1 1/2 years ago, I got a couple of free Hydro 5 razors with some JBL speakers I bought.  </li>
            <li> Baby smooth shave in 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when Schick discontinues that Hydro 5 \\&quot;introductory price,\\&quot; it may still be a more economical choice than the</li>
            <li> I know that it is more than worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I know that it is more than worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample blade from bodybuilding.com and I noticed that the Schick 5 was smoother and closer shave than the Fusion...and cheaper.</li>
            <li> It was a really smooth, and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> should also note I received two free razors from an order I placed.</li>
            <li> It literally feels like I am shaving with a stick filled with water...</li>
            <li> I have been using Schick Hydro 5 for a few weeks now, and it is the best blade</li>
            <li> The Fusion Power is BETTER than the Hydro 5 in terms of comfort and shave (on a fresh blade).</li>
            <li> for reading, please mark this review as helpful if you liked it at all, as this really helps me.</li>

            <li> They leave my legs smooth and the shave is so close that I can skip a day or two, and sometimes three.</li>
            <li> These razors do a fantastic job at shaving the face.</li>
            <li> These fit my razor handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was stunned by how smooth the shaving</li>
            <li> CHEAP (compared to gillette)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> They put a bunch of these out for free in our campus mail room</li>
            <li> The hydrating strip actually works too which leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li> but mostly I cheap out and use the disposable ones.</li>
            <li> Since I have a mustache and a light beard, however, it didn&#x27;t matter cosmetically.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how smooth the shave is with these blades.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as can be.</li>
            <li> So painless, so smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Love to always have a fresh set on hand.</li>
            <li> I returned these since they don&#x27;t fit my razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great razor that keeps me coming back to it time and time again.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of comfortable shaves out of them.  </li>
            <li> , The shave was smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Well it was free, so we bought one and tried it.  </li>
            <li> We travel often and can&#x27;t always have a reusable, electrical model available.  </li>
            <li> I was given a free trial of this razor.</li>
            <li> The blades are so smooth</li>
            <li> After years of using cheap store brand disposable razors, I received one of these as a sample.  </li>
            <li> The concept seemed sound, the power blade vibrates thus helping to cut the stubble without tugging and irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cose and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> My primary issue is that anytime I accessed the page that tells you about price changes in your list, I  would get a notice that the price dropped on the blades when I was between orders, but when it was time for the order to ship...</li>
            <li> This is a great product and would definitely buy again on-line when I need this product again.  </li>
            <li> My son uses this and he found it to be to his liking a smooth shave which is why you buy a razor</li>
            <li> Smooth and thorough cut.  </li>
            <li> However, I believe Subscribe and Save comes with free ground shipping even if you&#x27;re not Prime.</li>
            <li> Another very positive attribute of this razor is that the cost of the replacement cartridges is not outrageous for the quality of the shave you get.  </li>
            <li> Love getting them right to my door</li>
            <li> I originally tried this razor when our then-local grocery store mailed us a free coupon to buy one.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can get a smooth, clean shave in about 30-45 seconds with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 Is a great razor, very comfortable don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s just not as good as the Fusion.</li>

            <li> Bump Patrol Original Formula</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades, but more importantly, I love that they are cheaper than buying them at the local stores.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been married for over 40 years and has not been satisfied with anything I&#x27;ve purchased till I purchased the Schick Hydro shaver.  </li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve hesitated to buy these super-4-blade and 5-blade razors because they were much higher price than the others, or I didnâ€™t think theyâ€™d be any better.</li>
            <li> If you are contemplating buying this refill pack, then you must already be familiar with the product itself.</li>
            <li> The slime washes off cleanly when rinsing after your shave.  </li>
            <li> Hydro 5 is much more forgiving of the phrenological topology of my scalp than the Quattro, and is able to clear those \\&quot;nooks and</li>
            <li> It is very cost effective and worth having if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very cost effective and worth having if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if all your blades for Shlick are from the same batch, will be nice to send me replacements in Fusion Proglide Power blades :-)..</li>
            <li> Easy to shave with, and worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I always looked clean</li>
            <li> While I was generally satisfied for a while, even with the more frequent cuts and nicks, I started to notice a LOT of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> And then ... no matter how I clean it ... move it ...</li>
            <li> Shaves well; shaves clean.</li>
            <li> I cant even return them as I threw the packaging putting all my blades in a special container.</li>
            <li> and I have HIGHLY sensitive skin is amazing.</li>
            <li> the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li> Hydro 5 is a very welcomed friend to every man on a budget who stills wants the best possible shave they can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Hydro 5 is a very welcomed friend to every man on a budget who stills wants the best possible shave they can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> For the razor itself I think Gillette&#x27;s power feature makes a real, noticable difference in blade performance, while Schick&#x27;s is more of a \\&quot;me too\\&quot; gimmick because I can&#x27;t tell any difference with it on or off.</li>
            <li> The blades and lubricant make for one very close and smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Also I use the full pre,during,post shave regiment of products</li>
            <li> They are good blades and they last a while.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, these are the best razors I&#x27;ve used and for how long they last me, the price is great.</li>
            <li> Speaking of love, from the first stroke on my leg the sheer velvety smooth results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used these razors for about one year and they are the most gentle ones I have uses.</li>
            <li> these blades work good for the razor pictured above.</li>
            <li> these 5 bladed hydro last for about 5 months so these lasted me almost 2 years and were of good quality.</li>
            <li> Its just a bit of plastic, but it keeps the blades off surfaces, lets the razor dry out better, and the refills are kept handy snapped under it.</li>
            <li> The lubricating strip lasts longer and I noticed that I can easily shave against the grain after i have had a first shave in the direction of the grain.</li>
            <li> , I get a clean shave every time, lasts a while, price is pretty cheap for 4 blades...</li>
            <li> Not only does it compete with the best out there, it is simply unbeatable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been shaving on a daily basis for many, many years</li>
            <li> I received my shipment at the price quoted and received it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many different brands, in an attempt to minimize the time, irritation and hassle.  </li>
            <li> It does not run out evenly (one side of the bar will run out faster) and runs out fairly quickly I think.</li>
            <li> rust appears quickly on them</li>
            <li> After decades of using Gillette products, accidental circumstances led me to using Schick disposables from which I quickly graduated to using this 5 blade model.  </li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon has me covered.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and money was saved.</li>
            <li> While not as slick as the Gillette shave fresh from the box its still a very good, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for about two years, and I have discovered that their performance is much better with a high quality shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Schick Hydro 5 Power razor on special, and figured it was worth a shot...</li>
            <li> but this makes his head as smooth as a baby dolphin, haha!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m open-minded and willing to switch if the product is proven better...and the Schick won again.  </li>
            <li> Since Amazon opened up their new shaving department I have started to buy more shaving supplies there.  </li>
            <li> These blades are great, less irritation than anything I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li> Super close shave, lasts for weeks per blade and rarely nicks...</li>
            <li> this razor not only does a better job, but you don&#x27;t need to replace the blades every damn week!</li>
            <li> When these first hit the market, I was excited to get them and try them out; I use the blades to shave my cranium, and face.....</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades they cut great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love my soft legs and so does my fella!  </li>
            <li> Fine trimming mechanism work very well.</li>
            <li> They are real razors and work just fine.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy, and they are a little bit cheaper too.</li>
            <li> (and I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll easily get 3 times by the time I finally move on to a new blade--maybe more).</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, this razor provided an incredibly comfortable and close shave.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I enjoy using these and really like the case they come in as they are convenient for storage or travel.</li>
            <li> Since each refill lasts me at least a month, with every day shaving, and leaves my face smooth without any cuts, it is a great value.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels smooth after each shave, not to mention a very close shave.</li>
            <li> These have to be my favorite razors so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this honest and as unbiased as I possibly can.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than the Hydro 5, simply as far as the shave and comfort levels.</li>
            <li> From Amazon they are almost worth the price.</li>
            <li> Hydro 5 offers a comparable shave at a greater value.  </li>
            <li> Ir you expect to complete most of your shave without rinsing, then of course they will.</li>
            <li> He says he gets about a month out of each blade and that they are economical for him to se.</li>
            <li> I have not had success with this product after my 1st shave.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shave is nice with no 5&#x27; o clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I have only nicked myself once, and that was my own fault for being in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Gillette is more widely available; for example, Costco sells only Gillette products.  </li>
            <li> blade of a Fusion Power lasts me 10-15 days, with the first shave being excellent and the last being much less smooth than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Faster than the electric using super hot water.</li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t explain that very well, but again it probably doesn&#x27;t matter much since most interested in these blades will be men and not shaving their bikini area.</li>
            <li> I know, right?</li>
            <li> Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in hard plastic case for clean storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tend to get razor burn really easily.</li>
            <li> It shaves a bit better but the major improvement is that it lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> I have a bald head and until recently didn&#x27;t realize how easy, painless and smooth that my shave could be until a friend gave me a Schick blade to use.</li>
            <li> The problem is to get that good of a shave, i have to do some swipes across the grain instead of just with the grain because the blades will pass right over hair that is laying down instead of \\&quot;guiding it in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I can usually get a week to 10 days out of one blade which is great.</li>
            <li> Other than that, pretty good.</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro 5 is very good and cheap compare to expensive brand name</li>
            <li> WIth proper hydration (you do need to make sure you shave surface is wet), this razor aptly lubricates the area for a clean and consistent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you start to lose that smooth edge switch to a new blade.</li>
            <li> It is only after a few days of shaving that you get the best of the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Although I won&#x27;t get a shipment for another 3 months as I set up when I started the save and subscribe, I think it&#x27;s a great way to get your product without going through the hassle of going to the store and getting a more expensive set of blades.</li>
            <li> I tended to feel that Fusion was more aggressive, and was more snatching what was to be cut after a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use fusion blades but these blades give me as good a shave and are half the price.</li>
            <li> These work really well, get the job done quickly</li>
            <li> Simply the best blade I have used in the over 50 years I&#x27;ve been shaving this heavy beard of mine.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s amazing is how much longer the blades give that same consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> and of course the final shave is very very smooth and what you would expect from a 5 bladed shave</li>
            <li> , it gives a very smooth, shave, complete, and with no risk of rush, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> These are way overpriced and not any more effective than anything DSC offers for half and even a quarter of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5-bladed razor from Schick is high-quality and comfortable compared to many other razors.  </li>
            <li> Great product but price is a little high.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than Gillette, also price is less than Gillette, lasts long than Gillette, so why pay more :) I</li>
            <li> I switched to the Hydro 3 when it came out, but the lack of a trimmer and overall lack of a clean shave prompted me to try the 5-blade (both 3- and 5-blade cartridges fit the handles).  </li>
            <li> I first received a $10.00 Dollar coupon in the mail for this new shaving accessory which is a great improvement over the previous multi blade products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> When I first picked up the Schick Hydro 5</li>
            <li> Schick products exactly 3 times in my life.</li>
            <li> early August the amazon Vine program gave me the opportunity to try the Hydro 5 razor for free.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it was almost exactly $5 CHEAPER than the equivilent Gillette Fusion 4-packs--and lets not even go INTO what Gillette is now charging for their newest ProGlide razors.</li>
            <li> This specific order though, none of the blades lasted me more than 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Not a horrible set back, so i rounded up.</li>
            <li> At first I was pretty skeptical about going on the save and subscribe program but after receiving my first shipment of the Hydro blades, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> that I was overly eager to search given how much they all cost!  </li>
            <li> Worth it in the long run to purchase better blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different multi-blade razors including the Mach 3, Quattro, and Fusion.  </li>
            <li> - the Schick Quattro is my favorite overall razor for shave and value.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different razors over the years and have found these to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just wasn&#x27;t willing to take the time required to use one.</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty well.</li>
            <li> These days a double bladed safety razor seems to be the much better buy.</li>
            <li> and I should rate them much higher than Gilette Mach or knockoff razors.  </li>
            <li> (hey, sometimes you get lazy and call it a jeans-only week... :P)</li>
            <li> These are great razors, but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I like so much this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing (my first)</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving with it</li>
            <li> these damn blades are so expensive but this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever found</li>
            <li> This shaves smooth and leaves the skin feeling soooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> In the fourth and fifth week, I need to apply a bit more pressure to the razor.</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro 5 blades are so much better than Gillette blades.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother shaves and last longer than Gillette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Warm water activates the gel and reduces drag when shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it advertises itself to do every shave, is consistent in blade quality with every pack I buy and has a durable and long-lasting feel and quality to the handle.</li>
            <li> I use can shaving cream, and rise razor out with hot water.  </li>
            <li> As you are currently aware, razors must be made of GOLD, because the price&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every blade out there, and this leaves such a smooth finish!  </li>
            <li> The price I paid was more than what it would have cot if I had gone to a local drug store.</li>
            <li> However, this does provide a good shave for my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> , I need a good razor for the few times I do shave.</li>
            <li> Previously, my go-to razor has been the Venus Embrace because I loved the absurdly large moisture ring.</li>
            <li> The first day I&#x27;m super smooth, but by the next day I&#x27;m prickly.</li>
            <li> I started using some cheap store brand razors, trying to save money, but quickly threw them away and switched back to these.</li>
            <li> since the blade was brand new, I needed a least 2 weeks to get a strong idea on the product.&lt;br /&gt;The result is great after two weeks (no thick beard btw), I could see the difference compared to the Gillette Fusion that would burn my face after a bit.</li>
            <li> and I was happy to find a merchant on Amazon.com who did not cost a small fortune for this item!  </li>
            <li> Pro glide does rinse a little bit better but the flip down precision shave feature on the hydro is better than the proglides single blade strip although I personally love both to be honest.</li>
            <li> has been nice and sharp for months.</li>
            <li> The cut is extremely smooth and the hydrating gel does actually work (though it sometimes takes one full shave for it to really get activated).</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, very long lasting -- and therefore VERY economical!</li>
            <li> : I am STILL using my original blade clear into October, more than TWICE as long as I could get from anything I had used by Gillette</li>
            <li> The package rapped very well and shipping is very fast..</li>
            <li> Good grip to the handle too, easy to store, and the trimmer adaptation helps my stray hairs somewhat, but not perfectly in stubborn areas such as under the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the best use is a few days after I start a new blade.</li>
            <li> Hydro 5 also has the advantage of being much easier to clean and clear of beard/hair than the Quattro.</li>
            <li> liked it to shave my all hairs down and up</li>
            <li> I cannot say they last any longer that the older blades but the worked better.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can usually only shave once every 3 days (I am a 45yr old male) these blades are by far and away the best I have tried and this is someone who has used them all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole system is pretty much a gimmick, from the vibrating razor to the floating blade.  </li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about what type of razor he has me to buy.</li>
            <li> The shave quality was the same from both, but given the longevity of the hydro blades and their price, it was an easy choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pull back top guard works great on upper lip, gets hard to reach hair right under the nose.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different types and brands of razors, both for men and women.</li>
            <li> Like so many personal care items, this is subject to a certain degree and another blade may work better for you.  </li>
            <li> Good blades, smooth glide but not as sharp as Gilette Fusion blades but cost 40% less though.</li>
            <li> I normally have dry skin after shaving, and this razor keeps my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Nothing left but smooth</li>
            <li> Thanks Schick</li>
            <li> Really really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a much smarter idea to invest in blades rather than whole razors</li>
            <li> and the strip wears out fast rapidly degrading the shave experience.</li>
            <li> They deliver a close shave without much irritation.</li>
            <li> was short on blades with my Fusion, so I went ahead and tried this free Hydro 5 Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I am always open for suggestions that would help my problem so feel free to comment.</li>
            <li> The hydro-portion, the moisturizing bar, creates too much of a glide, feeling like you aren&#x27;t shaving close at all.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave</li>
            <li> I would like to know what the material is for the razor used, as I do not believe there is much quality put into these as oppossed to the &#x27;marketing hype&#x27; that is.....</li>
            <li> real hydro cause it ooze with lubricant</li>
            <li> Fast forward to vacation</li>
            <li> thats about all you need to say really.</li>
            <li> My husband has used disposable three blade razors for most of his adult life and constantly complained about how cut up his face was and how many areas were missed.  </li>
            <li> These blades are also much cheaper in prices than the Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really works well with the Hydro 5 Battery powered razor</li>
            <li> The moisture strip really lessens any shaving rash.</li>
            <li> Schick really delivers.  </li>
            <li> it left my skin smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades give you such a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> No fusions or cheap disposables are in my future.</li>
            <li> And considering I don&#x27;t like to shave very often</li>
            <li> and I really like the shave.</li>
            <li> This razor and blade is so much faster, cleaner, and closer than my $200 electric razor</li>
            <li> They work very well, and hold up.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, the real reason I wrote this review is to mention that the blades are made in the U.S.A, not China, like some reviews state.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.</li>
            <li> I order these for my son as it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying at a drug/grocery store</li>
            <li> so I do not run through blades as fast as more men, but I have to say that moisture thing on the top is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice not having to buy new blades at the previous rate.</li>
            <li> Tried these Schick blades and agree with other reviewers they&#x27;re better than Gillette.</li>
            <li> Better than the &#x27;other&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li> I bought the Schick Hydro originally as a gimmick that I had seen on a television commercial.</li>
            <li> which you get the same clean cut.</li>
            <li> but every 3 days, my facial hair is not heavy, in fact, it is medium-light, so again the &#x27;romance&#x27; with these is starting to wain a bit, yet, I will most likely continue their use, unless I invest in a &#x27;top of the line&#x27; electric model.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave, doesn&#x27;t seem to last past about a week.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave and a lot less bleeding :)</li>
            <li> this gives a much better and closer shave (without any irritation) and lasts twice as much and costs less than Mach3...</li>
            <li> I received a free Hydro 5 razor at school, and was not enthusiast since I was a long time</li>
            <li> and they were pretty sharp, smooth and longlasting.</li>
            <li> Considering these blades are so expensive at my local stores, I am now glad to have found it here for a good price.</li>
            <li> They are normally pretty expensive and this was a pretty good deal that I found.</li>
            <li> Very smooth soft, closed shaved.</li>
            <li> Arrived extremely fast and was brand new in sealed retail package with no damage.</li>
            <li> A brand new Gillette really does glide over my skin effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Use a toothbrush (new, only for this purpose) to clean it thoroughly every time.  </li>
            <li> Some sucked more, some sucked less, but they all sucked.  </li>
            <li> The ever soaring prices of the Gillette Fusion Power made me decide to give Schicks latest razors, at nearly half the cost of Gillette, another try with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> However, a razor that is able to cut the hair low but not so low that the hair kinks, curls, or otherwise cannot grow \\&quot;normally\\&quot;, solves the hair bump/razor bump problem.  </li>
            <li> and I have a steady supply of these gems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades last a while, but you&#x27;ll know when they&#x27;re done, because they start to rust fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> They should redo the flip back top strip and come up with something that can endure regular bathroom/shower/sink use.</li>
            <li> 1* only because I&#x27;d prefer these in a 5-pack - the shave, itself, is remarkably better than the same product name on the disposables.</li>
            <li> I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\</li>
            <li> Much better value than the more expensive Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> The people selling the single razors in packages are ripping people off, you can get those from Schick for free, (The blades are where they make their money).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> But when you have to pay for high price celebrities</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deducting one star because the price of the replacement cartridges is stupidly high.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you use a high quality shaving cream I would give the blades a 4 star.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing less of phenomenal, I find $15 a big expense for your face but worth the price in the end.</li>
            <li> I used these blades in conjunction with a Hydro 5 power select, so you can find that review for a little more info.  </li>
            <li> Just because a celebrity endorses a product doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better!  </li>
            <li> I get a nice shave every time and hardly ever nick myself.  </li>
            <li> I mainly feel this improvement when i cannot shave right after a shower, when i wait till the following morning.  </li>
            <li> I am not a thick beared person</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor,and I like the fact that the replacement blades are not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> Used to be about the Mach series razors until I tried Schick about a year ago, much gentler on my thicker stub and easier on my sensitive skin with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> It does leave your face \\&quot;slimey\\&quot;, especially when you pop in a fresh blade, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I were to have ANY kind of complaint</li>
            <li> They are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head daily and rarely experience any nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> better, Hydro 5 blades last a long time.  </li>
            <li> While I normally like to research the products I purchase before, I decided for the cost, why not give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try not to leave the razor in the shower because the lubrication strip will begin to disintegrate quicker than normal.  </li>
            <li> This is a very forgiving razor that glides smoothly over the skin, through the hairs, than previous razors that I have used.</li>
            <li> Holding it up to the shower head is enough to clear it out quickly and</li>
            <li> I tried to switch to a two, or even 3 black razor and they cut my face everywhere, I have sensitive, oily, acne prominent skin and I ding</li>
            <li> handle is much more solid than other brands, and the blades run much longer than others.. and no irritation or anything...</li>
            <li> I am not at all certain HOW this works, but for the economically challenged (ie: ME) here is how I break it down: better shave for less $$ that lasts 2-3 times longer &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Smooth, fast, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Razor bumps/hair bumps are usually caused because hair curls, kinks, or other wise is cut so low that once it is below the skin in cannot grow \\&quot;normally\\&quot; because it cannot get back to the top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> one converted &amp; newly convinced customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one converted &amp; newly convinced customer.    </li>
            <li> Sealed and packaged just like new in the store.</li>
            <li> I popped in a new blade and it felt like heaven all over again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was like a new shaving experience.</li>
            <li> but I think even women will experience a new shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I had been a Gillette man for years, but I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> Whenever they escalate the number of blades in the \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> They are worth the extra money as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip that flips back on top, if it gets wet, like anything would in a shower.  </li>
            <li> I struggled to find a razor out there that I could use because I have very sensitive skin and curely hair</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> First that critter is becoming old technology and getting hard to find</li>
            <li> introductory price made it a better deal than my usual Schick Quattro disposable, so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I MUST admit that I had pretty low expectations--</li>
            <li> Wow, I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also willing to answer questions and such if you want to leave a comment.able.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also willing to answer questions and such if you want to leave a comment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> These also tend to last longer than most other brands.  </li>
            <li> This razor mysteriously appeared in my bathroom and belonged to no one (according to the roomies *eyeroll*), so I thought I would buy cartridges for it and see how it worked.</li>
            <li> The price is also a big plus with other razors more expensive.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Truly leaves the skin baby soft!</li>
            <li> Came earlier than promised, which was very welcomed!</li>
            <li> I can get 6 months out of one cartridge making sure to dry it immediately and vacuum, yes, vacuum it after shaves to really get all the water out.</li>
            <li> :&lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades, sharp and clean</li>
            <li> These blades are super smooth and shave extra close...don&#x27;t waste money on the Aloe/sensitive skin version blades- its just marketing!</li>
            <li> After using this for the first time, I noticed how smooth and painless it felt as my hard whiskers were being removed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot less comfortable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot less comfortable.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and long lasting</li>
            <li> have normal thickness facial hair, but it grows fast</li>
            <li> The moisture strip is a lot smaller than on the Embrace, but seems to be equally as effective, if not more so, at preventing irritation.</li>
            <li> Overall, a better shave, blades last just as long</li>
            <li> They last a good while as long as they are thoroughly cleaned and dried after each time they are used.</li>
            <li> I was able to get about a half  of month worth of shaving out of one blade before I got a little bit of that \\&quot;tug and pull\\</li>
            <li> I used each one of the blades thinking that may be the next one will be better and ending up running out of all of them in less than 30 days.</li>
            <li> This blade cartridge is nice, i can shave fairly quickly with it (for me), it used to take forever when i was young because i was scared of cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I prefer these to pretty much any other (womens) razor I have tried.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t try to use each too long than you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> Cut super close and stay sharp for a while.  </li>
            <li> As a guy with some coarse facial hair and sensitive skin it has always been hard to find good razors.  </li>
            <li> Now, I do tend to be sensitive to shaving and this really made that obvious.  </li>
            <li> No nicks, razor burns, etc., and a cinch to keep clear of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive face...best blade ever</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and always have issues with irritation - until now.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, give these a try.  </li>
            <li> Wife and daughters are not allowed to touch the old man&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> Each time left me with intense razor burn and irritation to the point where I had sworn off attempting to purchase ANY Schick product ever again.</li>
            <li> basically translated into buying Gillette products for 95% of my adult shaving years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the beefier handle of the Power Select over the standard handle razor so even if the power feature doesn&#x27;t do much I will still stick with the Power Select model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ...let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They seem to work nicely on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Upon beginning to use the Schick Hydro 5, I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I really cannot see myself using anything else to shave in the future.</li>
            <li> This simply does the job and does it very well.</li>
            <li> a few years ago and a free pack of these got me to convert</li>
            <li> These are one of the few blades that are comfortable for me to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> When I pull the blade across my face I still don&#x27;t feel any blades touch my skin, am still sometimes surprised that I&#x27;m getting a shave at all.</li>
            <li> i was surprised with the results...</li>
            <li> They last a week; he shaves daily.&lt;br /&gt;They are priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li> The extra lubrication of these Schick blades really make all the difference.</li>
            <li> I always get a close shave and can actually use these about 4-6 times before they&#x27;re absolutely unusable to me.</li>
            <li> A person with sane shaving habits could probably use one for nearly two weeks before needing to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse Italian hair, and I can still get a good shave even on a 3 week old</li>
            <li> The moisturizing part that flips back to leave just the blades is great for trimming sideburns and other hard to reach areas around the nose.</li>
            <li> If I were to have ANY kind of complaint it would be this: shaving immediately under my nose can be a bit tricky because the blade housing is slightly thicker than Gillette models making it a bit more difficult to navigate around--but it CAN be done...just not quite as easily as I have become accustomed to using my Fusion razors.</li>
            <li> These razors last a long time and the 5 blades get super close to the skin.</li>
            <li> And it seems to last a super long time before becoming dull and needing replacement blades.</li>
            <li> The price is right, it cuts through my thick facial, and head hair well, and works as good if not better than Gillettes</li>
            <li> This light weight razor with movable blades to avoid cutting is really just super.  </li>
            <li> The Schick 5 is in my opinion a better razor, gives a better shave and is priced at a less expensive price.</li>
            <li> These should technically last more than a month (and they have in past).</li>
            <li> If you are wanting this one, try it out first before buying extra blades because you may experience the same as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do particularly well on my coarse stubble.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Edging mode\\&quot; just clicks back the blue top portion, so you can&#x27;t edge in tight on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness</li>
            <li> If you did that, you would not really be spending more because the blades would get used less than 1 blade for doing both.</li>
            <li> However, I believe Subscribe and Save comes with free ground shipping even if you&#x27;re not Prime.lling you the current price and the price of the previous</li>
            <li> Shaves close, keeps my legs smooth all day (a past problem with stubble at the end of the day w/the mach)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor companies can keep setting their prices, but I might re-learn a straight razor before too long.  </li>
            <li> However, I plan to drop my Prime membership because small products like razor blades are increasingly listed as \\&quot;add-on items\\&quot; which are not eligible for free Prime shipping even if you pay for Prime.  </li>
            <li> However, I plan to drop my Prime membership because small products like razor blades are increasingly listed as \\&quot;add-on items\\&quot; which are not eligible for free Prime shipping even if you pay for Prime.  </li>
            <li> I also used for my normal face grooming and the results were the same.</li>
            <li> it would be this: shaving immediately under my nose can be a bit tricky because the blade housing is slightly thicker than Gillette models making it a bit more difficult to navigate around--but it CAN be done...just not quite as easily as I have become accustomed to using my Fusion razors.</li>
            <li> My facial/neck area hairs turn inward however after using the same blade for several months(head and face), it has been a real pleasure.</li>
            <li> The hydro pad really helps (the blue pad on the gillette looks more stiff and less</li>
            <li> They arrived in a timely fashion and are perfect - too bad they don&#x27;t carry Schick products in Bulgaria!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kudos to Schick for a generations-leap ahead.e is how I break it down: better shave for less $$ that lasts 2-3 times longer &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Previously, used Gillette mach 3 and Fusion products and Schick works for me better for less money to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a female, these refills as well as the razor are serious yet has more advantages than disadvantages.</li>
            <li> After years of searching for a decent shave, I finally found (actually, received one as a promotion) the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it glides over my face avoiding all the tough spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> After years and years of being a loyal Gillette Fusion subject, I finally became fed up with the price gouging that had been going on.  </li>
            <li> and I can generally get</li>
            <li> but it always left something to be desired; specifically, the ability to clear the blade of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades last a long time, much longer than the hydrating gel on the blade.  </li>
            <li> Much closer shave with absolutely no razor burn or cuts.</li>
            <li> However, my old sensor excel had no ventilation at the back of these blades for rinsing.</li>
            <li> These are the only cartridges that (for me at least) easily last more than a week.</li>
            <li> I easily get at least double the use over Gillette before I notice any change in razor performance.</li>
            <li> At first I might get a few minor nicks, then a few weeks of smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also much cheaper here than any other store out there.</li>
            <li> I could feet the other razor much like I could feel the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> razors work well and dont rough up my skin thanks to the aloe (i guess), though I never had a problem with the regular non-aloe blades.</li>
            <li> 5 is that it has a pretty broad cartridge head, so there&#x27;s a little bit of an learning/experience curve to deal with so you don&#x27;t accidentally shave too deeply into your established beard/mustache/sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did take a little time to figure out how to change the first refill.</li>
            <li> From the very first shaves, I had very little irritation, and only occasional cuts.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that the lubricating strip on these blades lasts much longer than on some of the other more expensive kinds.</li>
            <li> Several times, I have tried to switch back to a blade, and have suffered cuts, irritation, ingrown hairs, bumps, redness, and just general misery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hydro gell strip doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the blades.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the blades dull quickly (because they are smaller?)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the Ultra Glide wears out quickly.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave than any Gillette razor offered and my face doesn&#x27;t look like a red mess.  </li>
            <li> The product is also economic as you can shave several times with one mess unit.</li>
            <li> I originally gave it to my son, to take to college with him, since I was long past destroying my face with another new gadget.</li>
            <li> Not a single complaint about a nicked face in the past several months, and they give a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I finally got tired of the complaining and ordered these razor blades as they were significantly cheaper than their closest competitor.  </li>
            <li> I only have one small complaint, but it doesn&#x27;t warrant knocking off a star, as I am most likely a minority purchaser since I am female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives an extremely close shave, but it&#x27;s also sensitive with the hydro idea  built in.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for any one who has a thick beard but sensitive skin or face.  </li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re forced to buy the new one because the old model will cut up your face and give you fewer shaves per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less irritation and virtually no razor burn (I have ridiculously sensitive facial skin--and</li>
            <li> So the Amazon Subscribe-and-Save program was a nice convenience; the blades were less expensive and I no longer needed to remember to buy them at the grocery or drugstore.  </li>
            <li> The price fluctuates frequently, and Amazon sends you an e-mail before every shipment telling you the current price and the price of the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I shake the water out of it before daily storage, a single cartridge can last me 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t have a single blade on the back to trim with --</li>
            <li> , snd blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 simply beats it in price and how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed these blades seem to last longer (like twice as long).</li>
            <li> Close shave, no nicks or cuts, long lasting.</li>
            <li> No pulling and they last long.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that I now live in a world where I am too lazy to buy something as simple as razor blades in stores when I can do all of my shopping from the comfort of my bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this cartridge was part of it, because the first few swipes were comfortable enough that i wasn&#x27;t so afraid anymore, even after 10 years of exclusively using electric shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are sometimes difficult to find in the store, so you made it easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> The issue I had was the gel strip ends up getting really gross if it gets left wet.</li>
            <li> I get roughly the same quality of shave and same amount of reuses per cartridge with the Schick Hydro 5 as I do with the Gillette Mach 5.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of single, double and triple blades.  </li>
            <li> This purchase was for the blades only as I already possessed the razor itself, but they are used as a single product.  </li>
            <li> When I mean sensitive, this is a complete understatement.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now and will not go back to any other razor.  </li>
            <li> The flip up trimmer works very well, both on sideburns and hard to reach areas (under the nose, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I initially suspected that five blades would be an overkill, since I have only an average beard.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put my razors away wet, but my fiancee used this for her legs one time and left it on the side of the shower.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a long, long time ago (remember 30 cent</li>
            <li> the shave takes about as long as it does with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> you can shave you faster and it&#x27; a long life product I think.</li>
            <li> I was a long time</li>
            <li> Amazon had my business last time, but I&#x27;m not sure about next time because the local grocery stores charge about the same amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never going to change as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I watched a You Tube vid of a guy cleaning his razor by simply running it on his jeans a few times (one direction, obviously) and this method definitely works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach3 for so long and never thought of trying this Hydro 5....</li>
            <li> When I have tried Schick in the past I found their razors to be harsh, with lots of tug and pull even on a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last as long as expected.  </li>
            <li> I finally cracked down and bought her the female version.</li>
            <li> Better shave, lasts longer and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin seems less irritated by the older blades than they did with my previous ones.</li>
            <li> The blades last longer than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the lubrication strip on the Razor lasts longer than any other.</li>
            <li> last the longest out of any of the other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> No need to pay the extra money at this point to try the other brand.</li>
            <li> In recent years I&#x27;ve used Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s and Schick Extreme 3&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Extreme 3&#x27;s would last maybe 20.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads on amazon because they were cheaper here than other websites and our local store does not carry them.</li>
            <li> I have not back to any other brand since.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints and I have used multiple other razors and blades over the years.  </li>
            <li> The benefits are ; hydrating gel can be used alone or with soap lather ( works for me either way), rust resistant ( I do shake opposite of towel once, then air dry in bedroom), sharp blades ( no nicks, remainder hairs, cuts or scrapes),  and life time</li>
            <li> I like the lubricating reservoir; I have dry skin</li>
            <li> ; just dry after each use</li>
            <li> Consequently I had tried--and loved--every single Gillette product I had ever used.</li>
            <li> I shave every single day.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t shave for a while, they seem to do a better job of cutting through multiple days of growth--less drag and less pain.  </li>
            <li> But Edge is much too expensive at Amazon (significantly more expensive than at a brick and mortar store), so buy it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In using them, I also find that I am much less likely to get \\&quot;</li>
            <li> If i don&#x27;t shave for about a day and a half, i can tell there&#x27;s stubble from afar in a mirror, which is actually what i&#x27;m shooting for because of ingrown hairs if i shave too close.  </li>
            <li> stay sharp enough that I don&#x27;t have to change them every other day.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried the Gillette Proglide fusion in a &amp;#34;shave-off&amp;#34;, which entails lathering up then using each razor on half the face then the next day switching to avoid the lag effect, and then on another day hiding the handle to do a &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; test.</li>
            <li> I also found the hydro blades to last longer and to be almost half the price of the fusion blades.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 was a slight improvement over the last generation, which still worked well, despite having fewer blades per cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Super expensive</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, and thus have been an electric razor user for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Stay sharp a long time</li>
            <li> Seems to stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> my only small complaint - the wider blue \\&quot;frame\\&quot; around the blade head makes it a little difficult to get really precise in the bikini area, despite the tilt back upper part of the frame.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and my face can always tell when the blades are getting to be the slightest of dull.</li>
            <li> A least 35%/40% more expensive than the Hydro 5 Blade refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is the handle as the blue paint flecks off over time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves how these razors work for him with minimal nicks.</li>
            <li> it was put away wet, but something that is always used with water shouldn&#x27;t rust</li>
            <li> Not much to review here.</li>
            <li> so there was minimal choice in product to use as refills.</li>
            <li> cause too much friction and give me razor burn worse than the cheapest disposables I have ever</li>
            <li> Max a month only on a few shaves</li>
            <li> For shaving the moustache are, these 5 blades are not very convenient.</li>
            <li> I used to be just an electric shaver guy, but I was curious one day and ordered a Hydro 5</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re just running an empty razor over your face.  </li>
            <li> These are really expensive, but I think worth it to some point.</li>
            <li> only thing I hate more than shaving is going to the store to buy blades.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get rid of your single razor, although this razor makes an attempt in these areas, you&#x27;ll still need a single razor for all the tight places where this razor can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> After the third week the lubrication is a little unpredictable.</li>
            <li> Not as expensive as Gillette (any product) and is very gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> I am so spoiled I won&#x27;t use any other now.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and just like you purchase at any store.</li>
            <li> I wish I had all the money we have spent trying to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; razor for my husband!</li>
            <li> Close in the extreme, sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dependable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I say this because sometimes it just comes out a lot at once, and other times nothing comes out</li>
            <li> I say this because sometimes it just comes out a lot at once, and other times nothing comes out</li>
            <li> The blades also stay sharp for longer than the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am averaging about 4-5 weeks per blade, this is with use every other day.</li>
            <li> I threw the other 3 cartridges away without using them.</li>
            <li> I figured since my skin is so prone to battle wounds that I might as well find a razor that is a bit cheaper with the same if not better results.</li>
            <li> Usually a fusion blade would last 7-12 days.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I go to walmart, or CVS or all that other BS.  </li>
            <li> But longer than some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> It is softer and gentler than other disposable razors we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference between this and all the other ones out there.</li>
            <li> Well evidently it is not 5.</li>
            <li> so I cannot give the product 5 stars due to the cost.</li>
            <li> i no have to shave every other day,  not every day as when i was using a womens razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette blades do not last long, do not cut well and are ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> I actively went out to purchase a replacement 4-pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much of a saving, but a saving none the less.</li>
            <li> Previous razors would always nick his noggin and still leave some rough spots.....</li>
            <li> and I can give up &amp; throw it away immediately if it begins to give me a similar experience to what I have had in the past with ALL previous Schick products.</li>
            <li> I never seem to knick myself with this blade either, and it seems to last longer without getting dull - unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> For me, even the Schick extreme disposables caused less irritation than the Mach&#x27;s did.  </li>
            <li> , the razor and refill costs much less than other power competitors.</li>
            <li> me, the Hyrdo 5 refills last about a week, and I shave my face every morning.&lt;br /&gt;After 6-7 days, the blades get dull and the hydrating gel starts to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they go dull in that short period of time.</li>
            <li> Mach 3&#x27;s would be dull within ten shaves.  </li>
            <li> I receieved one of these bad boys as a free trial in the mail, and have been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the 8 pack isnt on prime while the 4 pack is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My first subcribe and save order was $8.30 per 4ct refill, now they just increased the price to a few cents shy of $12.00.  </li>
            <li> The blades are thin, they seem to last quite long.</li>
            <li> It last me at least 1-2 weeks just for one razor...</li>
            <li> I really like them and unless I find something that blows my mind (seems unlikely), I&#x27;ll stick with them.</li>
            <li> If you have ultra sensitive skin, I found Gillette to be worse than even the Schick disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Nothing works as well for shaving my thick beard, mustache, and my entire head as the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the blades do get dull quickly which makes it expensive.</li>
            <li> improved\\&quot; version, the quality of the previous model (when it&#x27;s still available) slips badly.</li>
            <li> The comfort level goes down.</li>
            <li> These blades get hair down close to the skin, and don&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> Being Greek, I can grow a mean beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Schick Hydro 3 razor for the past few months, and I recently experimented with the Hydro 5 for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have no irritation and I can shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> I have way less irritation after shaving now.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the Gillette Fusion Power for 2 years, and disposable razors for a year and a half before then, and electric shavers before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had got unlucky with my previous razor cartridge because the lubrication was stuck and wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> I must add on like I did in my previous reviews</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d take a half a star if i could though.  </li>
            <li> less irritation and pulling than Gillette Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> And they do just glide over the skin making shaving less time consuming.</li>
            <li> I am unable to decide if they last longer than Gillette or are the same -</li>
            <li> get less and less shaving ability.</li>
            <li> And again: Costs less.  </li>
            <li> I have fewer nicks and less skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I would have to give the Fusion a slight edge,</li>
            <li> these are decent, just criminally expensive.</li>
            <li> After that the strip turned into a gooey mess that stuck to me like glue.</li>
            <li> After shaving, lotioning up just want to caress my legs throughout the day, which is not cool.  </li>
            <li> do not have a heavy beard, yet due to using them on my cranium, perhaps my expectations on length of use is not accurate.</li>
            <li> Due to it&#x27;s size, it often leaves two or three areas on the face difficult to shave, and those are on the undersides of the cheek near where the face curves.</li>
            <li> It can seem a bit ungainly sometimes when trying to shave in tight places.</li>
            <li> Attempting to save a little cash, I decided to give this a try given the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Shaves well but a little tricky getting around the nostrils.</li>
            <li> i have little stubble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so uncomfortable that I wouldn&#x27;t shave with it, because I have gone just over 3 weeks on my previous blade, and I feel I could use it for another 2 weeks before I would say it&#x27;s completely worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If shaving is a hassle and beard is tough and coarse, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t dull for several uses even when used on moderately thick hair</li>
            <li> The Quattro would regularly get clogged so bad I would be forced to use a toothbrush to gently remove the logjam.</li>
            <li> You will notice the shave starting to get SLIGHTLY worse after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave everyday (although I should),</li>
            <li> so I got a few of them thinking I could give them a shot if after my Gillette fusion cartridges ran out.</li>
            <li> I am not the heavy beard type.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price, I have to shave everyday</li>
            <li> With Schick, you save a few bucks...</li>
            <li> Once you realize this, a few adjustments can be made to the shave technique to fix this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched from an electric razor about 2 years ago and tried a few razors until I used this one.  </li>
            <li> I used one head 2-3 times per week for several months so the cost and environmental impact is not great.  </li>
            <li> Schick never has fail me so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of spendy cartridge</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe other people have faces more compatible than I do, but these are the worst razor blades I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I need to shave at least every other day.</li>
            <li> which I only do every 3rd day to avoid bad skin irritation)</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the Hydro 5 because I was tired of my Fusion Power losing its lubrication strip so fast, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my experience simply could NOT have been much worse.</li>
            <li> This represents the biggest bargain in shaving and the least amount of material waste (I hated throwing away those cheap Bic type razors).</li>
            <li> It begins to get rather ugly and really has no use.  </li>
            <li> I usually get 4-5 shaves before I change the blade.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is they are SO expensive.</li>
            <li> It spreads out excessively.</li>
            <li> After years of not enjoying shaving with the disposables I decided to try another replaceable blade style shaver.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the razor in the mail from Kroger for some reason, maybe based on past purchases for grooming products; I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I will unfortunately be going back to Gillette after I am done with this cartridge.</li>
            <li> No better than a disposable, but I&#x27;ve gotten no razor burns</li>
            <li> Sorry, going on a tangent here, I am a female.</li>
            <li> Double-edged blades were no better.  </li>
            <li> Just gotta keep your eyes open for sales because they are always too expensive.</li>
            <li> No more porcupine, prickly hugs and kisses.</li>
            <li> After my skin had a few days to get used to the razor, it was glorious!  </li>
            <li> There are usually coupons in the weekly newspapers, or you can use subscribe and save like we do.</li>
            <li> I am usually using this product.&lt;br</li>

            <li> With past razors (Fusion and even the Quattro) I was getting 3 or 4 shaves and they would get dull.</li>
            <li> , the Hydro 5 lubrication is annoying on the first 2-4 uses.</li>
            <li> The Schick&#x27;s blade, which I never liked in the past, is dramatically improved in the Hydro.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because there a five blades and they dull slower or something.</li>
            <li> hard to cut self.  </li>
            <li> the past, I have been plagued with cuts and razor burn on my face and neck from poor quality razors and/or poor technique (I want to give the benefit of the doubt to the other companies).</li>
            <li> Then Amazon goes and fixes that problem for me, cutting the price by 50% compared to any local store.</li>
            <li> at least  twenty shaves in before I have to change blades.  </li>
            <li> and they last like crazy.</li>
            <li> I hate how much razors cost and that&#x27;s why I kept a star.</li>
            <li> have a thick beard and get about 5 shaves from each cartridge.  </li>
            <li> And a five-blade razor requires thick gel to avoid cuts and abrasion.  </li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> The razors are worthless if you have any decent amount of hair on your face.</li>
            <li> I have had at least one bad experience where I got a refill pack that was dull, but I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one without any issues.  </li>
            <li> I get terrible razor burn and my facial hair grows in different directions.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than purchasing in a store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve done blades, electric (several models) even a \\&quot;bald\\&quot; hair trimmer, (which wasn&#x27;t too bad), but until I happened upon the Schick, I was still in shaving hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if any at all...which is probably why the Hydro 5 literally shocked me by not only giving me one of</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a blade for tough spot (have to remove the hydro pad, not a problem since you get used to it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydro 5 Power ?</li>
            <li> As if that was bad enough, the refills are too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any tugging of the beard, irritation, or cuts.  </li>
            <li> These are the worse premium razors I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Worse shave, lots of cuts, takes forever.</li>
            <li> but when I tired Hydro5</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use Amazon&#x27;s streaming video service, so these add-on items make Prime a poor value for me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette razor user forever. Tried these Schick blades and agree with other reviewers they&#x27;re better than Gillette. Better shave, lasts longer and less expensive.</li>
            <li> As a guy with some coarse facial hair and sensitive skin it has always been hard to find good razors.  I have a drawer full of razors from so so many brands and most are good on the first shave but that&#x27;s it.  If I wanted only one shave I would buy disposables.  These give by far the best shave I have come across.  I usually get 4-5 shaves before I change the blade.  Could probably go more but they start to pull the hair anything after 5 or 6.  Sure the Gillette ones might be a little better but for the price these work perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Dollar Shave Club blows doors of these (no, I don&#x27;t work for DSC).  These are way overpriced and not any more effective than anything DSC offers for half and even a quarter of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are wasting your money if you&#x27;re still buying razors that aren&#x27;t DSC.  That goes for both men and women.</li>
            <li> Good deal compared to B&amp;M stores. A great blade for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These have to be my favorite razors so far. They work well and make it so I don&#x27;t have to shave as often.</li>
            <li> Theses blades provide a smooth shave, no nicks, snd blades last a long time. A bit pricey at around $10 for four.</li>
            <li> My husband loves how these razors work for him with minimal nicks.</li>
            <li> great, first time dealing with you !</li>
            <li> not the best quality razors</li>
            <li> These are the best razors you&#x27;ll ever Hughes hands down for a man or a woman</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Schick Hydro 3 razor for the past few months, and I recently experimented with the Hydro 5 for a few days.  (Both cartridges are interchangeable with the Hydro line handles.)  I initially suspected that five blades would be an overkill, since I have only an average beard.  Also, my previous attempts at using a five bladed razor were not successful as it proved to be too painful.  Much to my surprise, this razor provided an incredibly comfortable and close shave.  Just like the Hydro 3, the lubrication this razor provides is terrific.  I have not experienced any tugging of the beard, irritation, or cuts.  No parts of my face or throat were missed in the initial strokes.  This cartridge has a flip trimmer, and it is very good at shaving the mustache area and sideburns.  This is a feature which definitely gives the Hydro 5 an edge over the Hydro 3.  The flip trimmer on the Hydro 5 greatly exceeds the performance of the precision trimmer on the Gillette Fusion line, because it is not painful whatsoever.  Another very positive attribute of this razor is that the cost of the replacement cartridges is not outrageous for the quality of the shave you get.  Also, just like the Hydro 3, the replacement cartridges last longer than those of their competitors.  Overall, this is a great razor that is to be recommended.</li>
            <li> I came from using Mach 3 razors.  I switched to the Hydro 3 when it came out, but the lack of a trimmer and overall lack of a clean shave prompted me to try the 5-blade (both 3- and 5-blade cartridges fit the handles).  The flip up trimmer works very well, both on sideburns and hard to reach areas (under the nose, etc.).  I like the lubricating reservoir; I have dry skin and it helps prevent razor burn.  It does leave your face \\&quot;slimey\\&quot;, especially when you pop in a fresh blade, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The slime washes off cleanly when rinsing after your shave.  The 5-blade shaves quite well, not needing multiple passes to have a close shave, but it is BIG.  It can seem a bit ungainly sometimes when trying to shave in tight places.</li>
            <li> Super close shave, lasts for weeks per blade and rarely nicks...I have sensitive face...best blade ever</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I am so spoiled I won&#x27;t use any other now. It beats ALL</li>
            <li> Arrived extremely fast and was brand new in sealed retail package with no damage. These are sharp and just like you purchase at any store. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> i gave this razor a shot due to being entirely disgusted with the price/amount of time my gilette fusion blades lasted. this razor not only does a better job, but you don&#x27;t need to replace the blades every damn week!</li>
            <li> I am so glad this razor and these blades were manufactored. I wish I had all the money we have spent trying to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; razor for my husband! well, this is it...no more searching!!!</li>
            <li> I hate to shave. I have sensitive skin and always have issues with irritation - until now. I&#x27;ve tried many Razors both electric and blade and this one is the best. I have no irritation and I can shave in half the time. The blades last longer than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the lubrication strip on the Razor lasts longer than any other. Highly recommend this. It is expensive but it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I grew up on the whole Gillette is the best mentality.  If you have ultra sensitive skin, I found Gillette to be worse than even the Schick disposable razors.  After getting tired of running the gamete of Gillette razors I started off with the Schick disposables, then the Quattro, and now the Hydro 5, that I received a free coupon for.  I have never looked back since.  For me, even the Schick extreme disposables caused less irritation than the Mach&#x27;s did.  I get a much closer shave than any Gillette razor offered and my face doesn&#x27;t look like a red mess.  If you have sensitive skin, give these a try.  I doubt you will buy anything else again.</li>
            <li> Even with a medium beard, I&#x27;ve dreaded shaving for over 30 years.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of single, double and triple blades.  Some sucked more, some sucked less, but they all sucked.  Then, about 1 1/2 years ago, I got a couple of free Hydro 5 razors with some JBL speakers I bought.  Now, I can get a smooth, clean shave in about 30-45 seconds with no irritation.  If I shake the water out of it before daily storage, a single cartridge can last me 2-3 months.  Wife and daughters are not allowed to touch the old man&#x27;s razor.  The JBL speakers are nice, but a fast smooth shave every morning is even nicer.</li>
            <li> I will buy this over and over again. Never have had any cuts with it. Very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> When I first picked up the Schick Hydro 5 I thought it was a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introductory price made it a better deal than my usual Schick Quattro disposable, so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro 5 is amazing. It&#x27;s almost unreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best description I can come up with is \\&quot;beard eraser.\\&quot; One pass along the beard grain, one pass against the beard grain and the stubble is erased...Nothing left but smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning time savings is a plus. With the Quattro I would spend 3-4 minutes shaving, feeling for residual stubble, and shaving again to get those missed spots. With the Hydro 5, I&#x27;ve learned not to even bother checking after two passes...Baby smooth shave in 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also shave my head, and the Hydro 5 works much better than the Quattro on my dome as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 is much more forgiving of the phrenological topology of my scalp than the Quattro, and is able to clear those \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot; in 2-3 passes instead of 4-5 with the Quattro...The latter giving me razor burn, cuts and scabs in the more difficult places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 also has the advantage of being much easier to clean and clear of beard/hair than the Quattro. The Quattro would regularly get clogged so bad I would be forced to use a toothbrush to gently remove the logjam. Not so with the Hydro 5...Holding it up to the shower head is enough to clear it out quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, as another reviewer has mentioned, the Hydro 5 cartridges curiously last 2x-4x longer than the Quattro. Even when Schick discontinues that Hydro 5 \\&quot;introductory price,\\&quot; it may still be a more economical choice than the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only functional disadvantage of the Schick Hydro 5 is that it has a pretty broad cartridge head, so there&#x27;s a little bit of an learning/experience curve to deal with so you don&#x27;t accidentally shave too deeply into your established beard/mustache/sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: The Hydro 5 is now my razor of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Schick: Please keep the introductory prices for the Hydro 5 indefinitely and just dump the sucky Quattro product line entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Please stop the \\&quot;Blade Wars.\\&quot; The Hydro 5 is chunky enough.ep the introductory prices for the Hydro 5 indefinitely and just dump the sucky Quattro product line entirely.    PS. Please stop the \\&quot;Blade Wars.\\&quot; The Hydro 5 is chunky enough.</li>
            <li> Good product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> For some razor/hair bumps are their bain.  Razor bumps/hair bumps are usually caused because hair curls, kinks, or other wise is cut so low that once it is below the skin in cannot grow \\&quot;normally\\&quot; because it cannot get back to the top layer of skin.  However, a razor that is able to cut the hair low but not so low that the hair kinks, curls, or otherwise cannot grow \\&quot;normally\\&quot;, solves the hair bump/razor bump problem.  This Schick Hydro is great at preventing hair bumps.  Because the strips on the blades prevent the hair being cut too low, I no longer have razor bump problems.  The blades are well lubricated and provide and very comfortable shave.  One reviewer notes that there is a lot of \\&quot;glide.\\&quot;  That is true but I found it to be a good thing reducing irritation.  The Schick Quattro also stops the bumps as well.  Using either of the Schick blades with [[ASIN:B000NPJHQU Bump Patrol Original Formula After Shave Intensive Treatment 4oz]] provides a good \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for hair bumps.</li>
            <li> I have used--prior to receiving a Hydro 5 razor through the amazon Vine program--Schick products exactly 3 times in my life. Each time left me with intense razor burn and irritation to the point where I had sworn off attempting to purchase ANY Schick product ever again. Seriously, my experience simply could NOT have been much worse. Consequently I had tried--and loved--every single Gillette product I had ever used. Less irritation and virtually no razor burn (I have ridiculously sensitive facial skin--and I HATE that, but what can I do?) basically translated into buying Gillette products for 95% of my adult shaving years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early August the amazon Vine program gave me the opportunity to try the Hydro 5 razor for free. I figured, why not? If I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m not out any $$ and I can give up &amp; throw it away immediately if it begins to give me a similar experience to what I have had in the past with ALL previous Schick products. I MUST admit that I had pretty low expectations--if any at all...which is probably why the Hydro 5 literally shocked me by not only giving me one of the single best shaves I had ever had, but easily the most irritation-free shave, too. I was downright dumbfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I had finished with my next shave (which I only do every 3rd day to avoid bad skin irritation) I actively went out to purchase a replacement 4-pack. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it was almost exactly $5 CHEAPER than the equivilent Gillette Fusion 4-packs--and lets not even go INTO what Gillette is now charging for their newest ProGlide razors. Wow, I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck! Better shave for cheaper?? But it gets even better: I am STILL using my original blade clear into October, more than TWICE as long as I could get from anything I had used by Gillette (and I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll easily get 3 times by the time I finally move on to a new blade--maybe more). I am not at all certain HOW this works, but for the economically challenged (ie: ME) here is how I break it down: better shave for less $$ that lasts 2-3 times longer &#x3D; one converted &amp; newly convinced customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to have ANY kind of complaint it would be this: shaving immediately under my nose can be a bit tricky because the blade housing is slightly thicker than Gillette models making it a bit more difficult to navigate around--but it CAN be done...just not quite as easily as I have become accustomed to using my Fusion razors. Otherwise, this is not even a fair fight. Honestly, the Hydro 5 works SO well compared with anything else I have ever used that I am telling everyone I know that it is more than worth giving a try. Now for those of you who prefer Gillette, fine. If you don&#x27;t, fine. All I can say is this razor made a VERY skeptical believer out of me...and I simply did not think that would ever happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Schick for a generations-leap ahead.e is how I break it down: better shave for less $$ that lasts 2-3 times longer &#x3D; one converted &amp; newly convinced customer.

            <li> Better than the &#x27;other&#x27; brands. Very smooth soft, closed shaved.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to Schick 5. I used to shave with Fusion razors but they are mad expensive. I got a free sample blade from bodybuilding.com and I noticed that the Schick 5 was smoother and closer shave than the Fusion...and cheaper. Great blades! Def recommend</li>
            <li> It was a really smooth, and comfortable shave. The issue I had was the gel strip ends up getting really gross if it gets left wet. I don&#x27;t put my razors away wet, but my fiancee used this for her legs one time and left it on the side of the shower. After that the strip turned into a gooey mess that stuck to me like glue. I ripped it off. Unfortunatly the blades also rusted, so I tossed the blades and will get more. I know it&#x27;s my our own fault it was put away wet, but something that is always used with water shouldn&#x27;t rust so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note I received two free razors from an order I placed. The people selling the single razors in packages are ripping people off, you can get those from Schick for free, (The blades are where they make their money).</li>
            <li> Way better blades than anything Gilette has - I have super sensitive skin. My life changed when I found these blades. I have way less irritation after shaving now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time.  Thanks Schick...Knew you had it in you....leave everyone else in the dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp.  Close in the extreme, sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dependable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  Really really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Class</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades, but more importantly, I love that they are cheaper than buying them at the local stores. It&#x27;s not much of a saving, but a saving none the less.</li>
            <li> This is only for people who want the best shave a disposable razor can give. It literally feels like I am shaving with a stick filled with water... My only problem is they are SO expensive. Then Amazon goes and fixes that problem for me, cutting the price by 50% compared to any local store. These get 5 stars when purchased through amazon!</li>
            <li> After years of searching for a decent shave, I finally found (actually, received one as a promotion) the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done blades, electric (several models) even a \\&quot;bald\\&quot; hair trimmer, (which wasn&#x27;t too bad), but until I happened upon the Schick, I was still in shaving hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Schick as a promo, along with something else I purchased. I originally gave it to my son, to take to college with him, since I was long past destroying my face with another new gadget. 5 blade system, now I have 4 additional blades to screw with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He forgot to take it with him, and one day, after my wife had chided me for my appearance, (a Panasonic electric), I noticed the Schick still on his desk and decided to give blades another shot. I&#x27;m glad I did. Probably the cleanest, smoothest shave since I was 20 - and that&#x27;s a long, long time ago (remember 30 cent gas?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the Amazon subscribe and save plan, I don&#x27;t even need to leave the house and I have a steady supply of these gems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve given up on finding a good shave, give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;berry</li>
            <li> I have been using Schick Hydro 5 for a few weeks now, and it is the best blade I must admit.&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything from Gillete Mach3/Fusion/Fusion Pro glide/ etc.. nothing is as close as Schick Hydro 5..&lt;br /&gt;The handle is much more solid than other brands, and the blades run much longer than others.. and no irritation or anything...</li>
            <li> very good quality, I get a clean shave every time, lasts a while, price is pretty cheap for 4 blades...a much smarter idea to invest in blades rather than whole razors</li>
            <li> For me, the Schick Hydro 5 razor and blades has given me the best long-lasting shaves ever.  In using them, I also find that I am much less likely to get \\&quot; shaving nicks.\\&quot;  Recommended.</li>
            <li> The Shick Hydro 5 blades are one of the best available on the market. Not only does it compete with the best out there, it is simply unbeatable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, one blade lasts me 3-4 weeks. I shave every single day. I have been using the Hydro 5 for about 2 months now, and I can say i&#x27;m impressed. I had previously been using the Gillette Fusion Power for 2 years, and disposable razors for a year and a half before then, and electric shavers before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this honest and as unbiased as I possibly can. This is the third time I am reviewing the Hydro 5 (once for the razor, once for the power version of the razor, and now this one). I decided to buy the Hydro 5 because I was tired of my Fusion Power losing its lubrication strip so fast, rendering it useless. As if that was bad enough, the refills are too expensive. The Hydro 5 simply beats it in price and how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One blade of a Fusion Power lasts me 10-15 days, with the first shave being excellent and the last being much less smooth than I&#x27;d like. I love the shave and comfort of the Fusion Power and honestly in my opinion it&#x27;s better than the Hydro 5, simply as far as the shave and comfort levels. Also, the fusion has a much better grip and is easier to shave with. I found with the Hydro 5 there was no grip, then I bought the power version and it did have a grip, but the Fusion&#x27;s is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had got unlucky with my previous razor cartridge because the lubrication was stuck and wouldn&#x27;t come out. However, I just used one of the new ones I bought from this deal, and it was great. I must add on like I did in my previous reviews, the Hydro 5 lubrication is annoying on the first 2-4 uses. It spreads out excessively. It is only after a few days of shaving that you get the best of the Hydro 5. You will notice the shave starting to get SLIGHTLY worse after about 2 weeks. The comfort level goes down. After the third week the lubrication is a little unpredictable. I say this because sometimes it just comes out a lot at once, and other times nothing comes out and it&#x27;s a lot less comfortable. It&#x27;s not so uncomfortable that I wouldn&#x27;t shave with it, because I have gone just over 3 weeks on my previous blade, and I feel I could use it for another 2 weeks before I would say it&#x27;s completely worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So IN MY OPINION-- The Fusion Power is BETTER than the Hydro 5 in terms of comfort and shave (on a fresh blade). The Fusion power dies off a lot faster and costs more to replace. The Hydro 5 Is a great razor, very comfortable don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s just not as good as the Fusion. It is very cost effective and worth having if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If money is not a problem for you, stick with the Fusion, You may have to replace your blade every 10 days to keep it at its best, but if it really isn&#x27;t a problem as far as money, you&#x27;ll be more happy with it. Hydro 5 is a very welcomed friend to every man on a budget who stills wants the best possible shave they can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, please mark this review as helpful if you liked it at all, as this really helps me.

            <li> I know they are just blades, but --hey-- I use them every day and I want something that does a good job without a lot of fuss.  The Shick Hydro blades are really good -- smooth and no nicks.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price.</li>
            <li> Attempting to save a little cash, I decided to give this a try given the reviews.  Now, I do tend to be sensitive to shaving and this really made that obvious.  My neck literally broke out from this product.  It was horrible.  I haven&#x27;t even used the remaining blades.  They belong in the garbage.  Back to Mach Fusion!</li>
            <li> I have used these before and they work fine mostly. This specific order though, none of the blades lasted me more than 2-3 days. These should technically last more than a month (and they have in past). I cant even return them as I threw the packaging putting all my blades in a special container. I used each one of the blades thinking that may be the next one will be better and ending up running out of all of them in less than 30 days. It would be nice for the seller to take me on my word and send me another shipment basically but I am not too hopeful. and if all your blades for Shlick are from the same batch, will be nice to send me replacements in Fusion Proglide Power blades :-).. Just asking</li>
            <li> I have been shaving on a daily basis for many, many years and these are the best blades I&#x27;ve come across. They leave my legs smooth and the shave is so close that I can skip a day or two, and sometimes three. Also, I&#x27;ve found that the lubricating strip on these blades lasts much longer than on some of the other more expensive kinds. The blades also stay sharp for longer than the others I&#x27;ve used. I can usually get a week to 10 days out of one blade which is great.</li>
            <li> I used these blades in conjunction with a Hydro 5 power select, so you can find that review for a little more info.  This blade cartridge is nice, i can shave fairly quickly with it (for me), it used to take forever when i was young because i was scared of cutting myself.  No cuts, and probably about 5 minutes to shave.  I&#x27;d say this cartridge was part of it, because the first few swipes were comfortable enough that i wasn&#x27;t so afraid anymore, even after 10 years of exclusively using electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white squares that hold the built-in lubrication diminish as you use the blade and are supposed to be indicators of when to change cartridges.  Worked well for me, i noticed tugging when about a third of the squares were gone.  Only 2 weeks, which seems a bit on the short side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a star from the rating because the edging isn&#x27;t that good.  If you look on the picture on front of the box, you&#x27;ll see two metal columns.  \\&quot;Edging mode\\&quot; just clicks back the blue top portion, so you can&#x27;t edge in tight on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness is okay, i&#x27;d take a half a star if i could though.  If i don&#x27;t shave for about a day and a half, i can tell there&#x27;s stubble from afar in a mirror, which is actually what i&#x27;m shooting for because of ingrown hairs if i shave too close.  The problem is to get that good of a shave, i have to do some swipes across the grain instead of just with the grain because the blades will pass right over hair that is laying down instead of \\&quot;guiding it in\\&quot;.  Not a horrible set back, so i rounded up.</li>
            <li> At first I was pretty skeptical about going on the save and subscribe program but after receiving my first shipment of the Hydro blades, I was very impressed. I received my shipment at the price quoted and received it rather quickly. Although I won&#x27;t get a shipment for another 3 months as I set up when I started the save and subscribe, I think it&#x27;s a great way to get your product without going through the hassle of going to the store and getting a more expensive set of blades.</li>
            <li> I HATE SHAVING!!!  but, it&#x27;s a necessary evil. this is by far the best razor I have ever used. I have tried many many different brands, in an attempt to minimize the time, irritation and hassle.  This has been the best so far. I don&#x27;t shave everyday (although I should), but when I do, i&#x27;m happy to do so with this razor.  My wife loves it too. I finally cracked down and bought her the female version. she&#x27;s also happy.</li>
            <li> Discovered this razor recently and thought I would give it a try for shaving my head.  I have been using the Head Blade system for years but it always left something to be desired; specifically, the ability to clear the blade of hair.  I use Gillette Fusion on my face because it gives a good shave and is easy to clear of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 has been awesome.  It gives the most comfortable head shave I have found.  No nicks, razor burns, etc., and a cinch to keep clear of hair.  I can&#x27;t recommended this blade enough for shaving your head.  Just try it for yourself, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Probably the best razor blades Iâ€™ve used. From Amazon they are almost worth the price. These blades convinced me to stop using Dollar Shave Club.</li>
            <li> Razor performs well and gives me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal thickness facial hair, but it grows fast and I need to shave at least every other day. Here is what I have found to be the best part of this razor so far... I have noticed these blades seem to last longer (like twice as long). Perhaps it is because there a five blades and they dull slower or something. With past razors (Fusion and even the Quattro) I was getting 3 or 4 shaves and they would get dull. I an getting 8-9 shave out of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice not having to buy new blades at the previous rate.</li>
            <li> I love these blades. Best.Shave.Ever!  Close shave, no nicks or cuts, long lasting. Definitely would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect razor for smooth shaving!  The line of conditioning really makes a night-and-day difference, but the best part is that you can lift it away from the blades to get an even closer shave.  I&#x27;m never going back to disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I will never pay 3 plus dollars per again.... I changed to DE shaving and pay only .27 cents per blade and have no neck issues ...</li>
            <li> Great product but price is a little high.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette user for most of my life. When I have tried Schick in the past I found their razors to be harsh, with lots of tug and pull even on a fresh blade. The ever soaring prices of the Gillette Fusion Power made me decide to give Schicks latest razors, at nearly half the cost of Gillette, another try with the [[ASIN:B006DR2BO2 Schick Hydro 5 Power Select Razor]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor for two weeks to give me a fair chance to adjust to it. For the razor itself I think Gillette&#x27;s power feature makes a real, noticable difference in blade performance, while Schick&#x27;s is more of a \\&quot;me too\\&quot; gimmick because I can&#x27;t tell any difference with it on or off. That said, I do like the beefier handle of the Power Select over the standard handle razor so even if the power feature doesn&#x27;t do much I will still stick with the Power Select model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave wise I still think the Gillette delivers a superior first/fresh shave experience. A brand new Gillette really does glide over my skin effortlessly. The problem is that the blades dull quickly (because they are smaller?) and the strip wears out fast rapidly degrading the shave experience. The Schick&#x27;s blade, which I never liked in the past, is dramatically improved in the Hydro. While not as slick as the Gillette shave fresh from the box its still a very good, clean shave. What&#x27;s amazing is how much longer the blades give that same consistent shave.  I easily get at least double the use over Gillette before I notice any change in razor performance. That need to change the Gillette more often combined with its already higher price makes the Schick an astonishingly better value. Schick has finally converted me with their Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to see Schick provide is a stand to put the razor in like Gillete has with its razors. Its just a bit of plastic, but it keeps the blades off surfaces, lets the razor dry out better, and the refills are kept handy snapped under it.</li>
            <li> These razors do a fantastic job at shaving the face. They deliver a close shave without much irritation. My only complaint is that the Ultra Glide wears out quickly. After 2-4 uses, the layer is virtually gone. Nevertheless, I enjoy using these and really like the case they come in as they are convenient for storage or travel.</li>
            <li> These blades help to achieve the closest shave I&#x27;ve had yet. I&#x27;ve tried the three blade, and used to swear by the four blade razors until I tried the Hydro. These are the best blades out!</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro 5 is very good and cheap compare to expensive brand name which you get the same clean cut. Why should I buy the costly brand name for? Not me, you know. As a matter of fact I just bought another 5 refill of 4-count. Please go for it.</li>
            <li> Great blades.  Wish the lubricant strip would last longer.  less irritation and pulling than Gillette Mach 3.  I mainly feel this improvement when i cannot shave right after a shower, when i wait till the following morning.  solid/heavy feel.  pull back top guard works great on upper lip, gets hard to reach hair right under the nose.  hard to cut self.  Fewer repeat strokes needed than Gillette Mach 3.  I am averaging about 4-5 weeks per blade, this is with use every other day.</li>
            <li> Sealed and packaged just like new in the store. Would definitely buy again. Would recommend others to buy as well.</li>
            <li> These are good and priced right if you own the handle when they&#x27;re on sale.  As always! Best pricing on Amazon S &amp;S</li>
            <li> Easy to shave with, and worth the price.  If shaving is a hassle and beard is tough and coarse, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got the Shick razor as the free one the hotel gives you when you can&#x27;t bring your own on the plane.  Couldn&#x27;t find the replacement blades for it in any store . . .not that I was overly eager to search given how much they all cost!  Randomly thought to check Amazon.  Really happy I did!!  They were the perfect ones, came very quickly, and I&#x27;m sure they were about half the cost!</li>
            <li> Not much to review here. These fit my razor handle so there was minimal choice in product to use as refills. The price on Amazon was the best I could find.</li>
            <li> Found 3 buck coupon in paper today.....Stop and shop has for 10.99 on sale.......Need I say more ? But this is a really nice Razor and Refill.....making it 7.99....SWEET&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t shave with anything else. Very smooth</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  Stay sharp a long time and I get a close shave every time.  Might get at least  twenty shaves in before I have to change blades.  Worth it in the long run to purchase better blades.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Price &amp; Service. You can get better deals by looking on-line and specifically through the Amazon web site.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can usually only shave once every 3 days (I am a 45yr old male) these blades are by far and away the best I have tried and this is someone who has used them all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette proglide, fusion, sensor, mach III, Schtick Quattro etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can shave the day after with these Hydro blades, I still ensure that I use a top quality shaving foam from Gillette or Neutrogena, but I very very rarely get cuts now and of course the final shave is very very smooth and what you would expect from a 5 bladed shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different multi-blade razors including the Mach 3, Quattro, and Fusion.  These are the worse premium razors I have ever used.  I bought a package on a coupon deal with the introduction of the Hydro 5 razor blades.  The skin guards that stick out in front of the razor (supposedly to properly angle the blades or something else) cause too much friction and give me razor burn worse than the cheapest disposables I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe other people have faces more compatible than I do, but these are the worst razor blades I have ever used.  I threw the other 3 cartridges away without using them.</li>
            <li> I received a free Hydro 5 razor at school, and was not enthusiast since I was a long time Gilette User. I had the Gillette Mach 3, then the Fusion with the fancy (overrated ?) battery.&lt;br /&gt;I was short on blades with my Fusion, so I went ahead and tried this free Hydro 5 Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned by how smooth the shaving was.&lt;br /&gt;But since the blade was brand new, I needed a least 2 weeks to get a strong idea on the product.&lt;br /&gt;The result is great after two weeks (no thick beard btw), I could see the difference compared to the Gillette Fusion that would burn my face after a bit. I tended to feel that Fusion was more aggressive, and was more snatching what was to be cut after a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But huh, I don&#x27;t like to change my habits, so I went to see the price of some Gillette Blade Refill. A least 35%/40% more expensive than the Hydro 5 Blade refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades, sharp and clean shave&lt;br /&gt;- No burn feeling after several shaves&lt;br /&gt;- The hydro pad really helps (the blue pad on the gillette looks more stiff and less efficient).&lt;br /&gt;- CHEAP (compared to gillette)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t have a blade for tough spot (have to remove the hydro pad, not a problem since you get used to it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydro 5 Power ? What would be the Hydro 5 with the battery/vibrations that has the Gillette Fusion Power ? Even better ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick now for about a year after bouncing between other brands and am very happy with the closeness and quality of the shave.  The replacement blades come in a plastic holder and replacing the blade in the razor is a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> i love shick and this is they&#x27;re best. I&#x27;ll continue to need these until the zombie apocalyspe. I don&#x27;t have to run out before i know I need them. i get it at a great price</li>
            <li> They put a bunch of these out for free in our campus mail room so I got a few of them thinking I could give them a shot if after my Gillette fusion cartridges ran out. I didn&#x27;t expect to be converted entirely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get a lot of ingrown hairs with the fusion. No more! This razor works so well, I don&#x27;t even need to use cream. The hydrating strip actually works too which leaves my face feeling great. Not to mention the price... A pack of Gillette provides now costs over $30. At $9 for 4, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would choose the Gillette.</li>
            <li> Hello Folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving my head and face for quite sometime and I have found these to be the best simply because of the price...let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. When I mean sensitive, this is a complete understatement. I bleed everytime, no matter what razor I use. I have previous used the Gillette Fusion Proglide and this work decent enough but I still would bleed from this. I figured since my skin is so prone to battle wounds that I might as well find a razor that is a bit cheaper with the same if not better results. This is why I switched to the Schick. The price is right, it cuts through my thick facial, and head hair well, and works as good if not better than Gillettes version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am always open for suggestions that would help my problem so feel free to comment.</li>
            <li> I tried the Hydro 5 and was disappointed.  I thought the 5-blade would make it a close shave, but this razor just does not work for me.  The hydro-portion, the moisturizing bar, creates too much of a glide, feeling like you aren&#x27;t shaving close at all.  That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it worked well, but it doesn&#x27;t.  No matter how many times I go over parts of my neck, it just will not get a close shave - and some parts simply won&#x27;t shave at all.  Unfortunately, this razor just will not work for me.  If you are wanting this one, try it out first before buying extra blades because you may experience the same as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way - the Schick Quattro is my favorite overall razor for shave and value.  I use the Fusion most of the time, it works fine but the blades do get dull quickly which makes it expensive.</li>
            <li> Best &#x27;refillable&#x27; razor I&#x27;ve found so far! Very close shave and a lot less bleeding :) Great for head shaving as well!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver for the money spent! I have used replaceable blade shavers before but mostly I cheap out and use the disposable ones. After years of not enjoying shaving with the disposables I decided to try another replaceable blade style shaver. I looked at everything Wally-Mart had on their shelves and decided to give this one a try. All I have to say is WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave about every two days... I am not the heavy beard type. The blades and lubricant make for one very close and smooth shave! I was able to get about a half  of month worth of shaving out of one blade before I got a little bit of that \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot; feel to the shaver. I popped in a new blade and it felt like heaven all over again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering performance vs. cost.... and remembering my experiences with other disposables and replacement blade style razors, I have to say that this is one of the better ways (if not the best) to shave with a smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $6-$7 buy the starter kit... and give it a test drive! I am sure that you will be happy with the performance just like I was!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> Very close shave and I kid you not each blade cartridge lasts me about 3 months of daily use.  This represents the biggest bargain in shaving and the least amount of material waste (I hated throwing away those cheap Bic type razors).</li>
            <li> I have tried many different razors over the years and have found these to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;They last the longest out of any of the other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good quality refills!!</li>
            <li> my hubby loves the shave he gets from this blade...and i use it on my legs, nice and close shave...</li>
            <li> Best blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li> When these first hit the market, I was excited to get them and try them out; I use the blades to shave my cranium, and face.....I felt they were the best razor blade on the market, since that time(2 years?), I sense that the &#x27;quality&#x27; of the metal blade is changed, and  is to enamored with the &#x27;lubricant&#x27; - the &#x27;lifetime of a set&#x27; is not what I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;I think the lubricant should be lessened, or it would be nice if SHICK offered these w/o the lubricant. I would like to know what the material is for the razor used, as I do not believe there is much quality put into these as oppossed to the &#x27;marketing hype&#x27; that is.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a heavy beard, yet due to using them on my cranium, perhaps my expectations on length of use is not accurate. I do not shave my cranium but every 3 days, my facial hair is not heavy, in fact, it is medium-light, so again the &#x27;romance&#x27; with these is starting to wain a bit, yet, I will most likely continue their use, unless I invest in a &#x27;top of the line&#x27; electric model.</li>
            <li> I have switched from the Fusion/Power Fusion to these blades.  If I don&#x27;t shave for a while, they seem to do a better job of cutting through multiple days of growth--less drag and less pain.  They also seem to last forever and ever before I notice a reduction in shave smoothness.  Usually a fusion blade would last 7-12 days.  These seem to last several weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been an electric shaver user for years.  Recently, I was given a Schick Hydro 5 razor, which came with two blade cartridges.  I have never been happy with blade shaving and the many nicks that happen even with fresh blades.  I also like the speed of shaving with an electric shaver.  However, the electric shaver admittedly never gave me that close a shave.  Since I have a mustache and a light beard, however, it didn&#x27;t matter cosmetically.  I always looked clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the razor with the Hydro 5 blades and was amazed at the smoothness of the shave.  In fact, I initially thought there was no blade in the razor.  That&#x27;s how smooth the shave is with these blades.  I am a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this multi-pack and signed up for Amazon&#x27;s automatic mailing, which saves a great deal of money over the blades purchased in the supermarket or drug store. No more annoying nicks, and the shave takes about as long as it does with an electric shaver.  I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> those blades real hydro cause it ooze with lubricant so your beard will love it&lt;br /&gt;the top flips so you can trim moustache&lt;br /&gt;i love this product</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my story:  I had a passing interest in trying out razors again after using a Braun Syncro Electric for the longest time. I read up on double edge safety razors and their virtues and proceeded to purchase a used one with various blades on ebay. Also got a badger brush and shaving soap. The result? Worse shave, lots of cuts, takes forever. Perhaps I just wasn&#x27;t willing to take the time required to use one. Fast forward to vacation and I forgot my electric razor. My father happen to have an unopened Schick hydro 5 unit in my bathroom that has been sitting there for a couple of years. I reluctantly gave it a try... amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave than my electric, nary a cut to be found. Faster than the electric using super hot water. Smooth as can be. I&#x27;m a convert. I still use the badger brush and shaving soap, and probably always will, but will not be using electric, or safety razors, ever again.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Coming from a mach 3 turbo razor, I&#x27;d say this is definitely an improvement.  It shaves a bit better but the major improvement is that it lasts a lot longer.  With the mach 3 I changed cartridges every 2 months, with this I can stretch it to 5.  Too bad they increased the price though.</li>
            <li> thats about all you need to say really. Pro glide does rinse a little bit better but the flip down precision shave feature on the hydro is better than the proglides single blade strip although I personally love both to be honest.But this one has the edge.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades are nice. And it has aloe strip on the refill which help to&lt;br /&gt;product the skin from razor burn but its no replacement for actual&lt;br /&gt;shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Esta maquina de afeitar es  excelente y econ&amp;oacute;mica las 5 hojas logran un corte de barba muy suave sin  irritar la piel. La recomiendo</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty well. Great price for a quality five blade razor. I am not a thick beared person so I do not run through blades as fast as more men, but I have to say that moisture thing on the top is kind of annoying. It does not run out evenly (one side of the bar will run out faster) and runs out fairly quickly I think. Also I use the full pre,during,post shave regiment of products so the moisture strip to me is fairly useless. Other than that, pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love! I prefer these to pretty much any other (womens) razor I have tried. The heads don&#x27;t pop off the handle while you are using it (even if you drop it), and the blades seem to be rust resistant, even if left in the shower for weeks at a time. Yes, I know it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; razor, but honestly it&#x27;s a razor, and it works, so I use it.</li>
            <li> It gives me a smoother shave than the Gillette Power fusion system that I used to have.  I also like the fact that the blades are cheaper than the Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> The razors are worthless if you have any decent amount of hair on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of spendy cartridge razors-- these are decent, just criminally expensive. These days a double bladed safety razor seems to be the much better buy.</li>
            <li> To date I cannot find a razor that works better. I&#x27;m a woman but I received one as a sample once. I used it when I ran out of my regular razor blades and have been buying them ever since. They are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I have a bald head and until recently didn&#x27;t realize how easy, painless and smooth that my shave could be until a friend gave me a Schick blade to use. It was like a new shaving experience. I also used for my normal face grooming and the results were the same. My facial/neck area hairs turn inward however after using the same blade for several months(head and face), it has been a real pleasure. I don&#x27;t even know that the blade is touching my head or face. I don&#x27;t know but I think even women will experience a new shaving experience. So painless, so smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> My husband has used disposable three blade razors for most of his adult life and constantly complained about how cut up his face was and how many areas were missed.  I finally got tired of the complaining and ordered these razor blades as they were significantly cheaper than their closest competitor.  He loves them.  Not a single complaint about a nicked face in the past several months, and they give a very smooth shave.  No need to pay the extra money at this point to try the other brand.</li>
            <li> We have been using the Hydro 5 blades since they came out and I should rate them much higher than Gilette Mach or knockoff razors.  I shave my face and head daily and rarely experience any nicks or cuts.  These provide a smooth shave with an excellent flow.  They do particularly well on my coarse stubble.  These also tend to last longer than most other brands.  I get about seven shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> I like Schick  better than Gillette. Very smooth shave and can be used many many times.</li>
            <li> excellent, everything perfect</li>
            <li> Been using Hydro 5&#x27;s for a couple years now.  They are good blades and they last a while.  Good stuff</li>
            <li> I had been a Gillette man for years, but I wanted to try something new.  These blades are great, less irritation than anything I&#x27;ve had before.  These blades are also much cheaper in prices than the Gillette.  But when you have to pay for high price celebrities it&#x27;s the consumer who pays the price.  Just because a celebrity endorses a product doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better!  I would recommend Schick to anyone!</li>
            <li> I switched over to the Hydro after using the Mach 3 and haven&#x27;t purchased anything else since. Considering these blades are so expensive at my local stores, I am now glad to have found it here for a good price.</li>
            <li> It provides a great shaving experience at lower price than it competitor. Fine trimming mechanism work very well. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I started using some cheap store brand razors, trying to save money, but quickly threw them away and switched back to these. I am a big fan of them.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the razor in the mail from Kroger for some reason, maybe based on past purchases for grooming products; I am not sure. It&#x27;s a great razor,and I like the fact that the replacement blades are not overly expensive. They seem to work nicely on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I used to use fusion blades but these blades give me as good a shave and are half the price.</li>
            <li> I made the switch from the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo to the Schick Hydro 5 some time ago.&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 offers a comparable shave at a greater value.  In my case, I think I get a closer shave with Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Hyrdo 5 refills last about a week, and I shave my face every morning.&lt;br /&gt;After 6-7 days, the blades get dull and the hydrating gel starts to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is...I have had at least one bad experience where I got a refill pack that was dull, but I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one without any issues.  This has happened to me with the Gillette razors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - the Schick refills are a good value.  I sometimes find coupons for $2.00 off, and that helps lower the cost.  I am personally glad I made the switch from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was using gillette for years until i switched to Schick to do a comparison. While I was generally satisfied for a while, even with the more frequent cuts and nicks, I started to notice a LOT of ingrown hairs (currently i have 3-4 under my chin. Its quite unsightly. I never used to get them with the Gillette razor. I will unfortunately be going back to Gillette after I am done with this cartridge.</li>
            <li> Gasp! I&#x27;m a woman who uses men&#x27;s razors! I know, right? Okay maybe that&#x27;s not so peculiar, but the fact I can use these and I have HIGHLY sensitive skin is amazing. These work really well, get the job done quickly, don&#x27;t dull for several uses even when used on moderately thick hair (hey, sometimes you get lazy and call it a jeans-only week... :P) Ultimately, these are the best razors I&#x27;ve used and for how long they last me, the price is great.</li>
            <li> The whole system is pretty much a gimmick, from the vibrating razor to the floating blade.  You can&#x27;t get a close shave at all.</li>
            <li> What can I say. This is a third time I&#x27;ve got these blades. I have \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; options for them and I&#x27;m not going to switch to anything else for a while. Previously, used Gillette mach 3 and Fusion products and Schick works for me better for less money to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars!</li>
            <li> Great price and value. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price, I have to shave everyday and I always look for best value.  These things are so expensive, so I bought them on on amazon!</li>
            <li> Great razors, get this on subscribe and save.. you&#x27;ll never run out! Love to always have a fresh set on hand.</li>
            <li> These are great razors, but don&#x27;t last long. The first day I&#x27;m super smooth, but by the next day I&#x27;m prickly. No better than a disposable, but I&#x27;ve gotten no razor burns and I can shave with just water. No cuts. And they do just glide over the skin making shaving less time consuming.</li>
            <li> this is my second blades refill! I like so much this product!, I don&#x27;t finish with my face irritated after shaved me with this blades! you can shave you faster and it&#x27; a long life product I think.</li>
            <li> Good blades, smooth glide but not as sharp as Gilette Fusion blades but cost 40% less though. I still like it.</li>
            <li> Quality stuff. Really love the fact that it has moisturizer inbuilt and it works like a charm on the skin. Amazon has a great price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Mach III for years now even though I&#x27;m a woman (I&#x27;m sorry but men&#x27;s razors just work better). This razor mysteriously appeared in my bathroom and belonged to no one (according to the roomies *eyeroll*), so I thought I would buy cartridges for it and see how it worked. Holy crap, I can&#x27;t believe how crappy my Mach III is compared to this. Shaves close, keeps my legs smooth all day (a past problem with stubble at the end of the day w/the mach) all and all a good razor!</li>
            <li> I like this product, and fullfilled my expectations, it gives a very smooth, shave, complete, and with no risk of rush, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> These blades last a while, but you&#x27;ll know when they&#x27;re done, because they start to rust fairly quickly. I think it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> love the hydro 5; nice close shave, lubricates well without any harshness</li>
            <li> Love getting them right to my door</li>
            <li> This light weight razor with movable blades to avoid cutting is really just super.  I love the way it glides over my face avoiding all the tough spots.&lt;br /&gt;  The price is also a big plus with other razors more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;  And it seems to last a super long time before becoming dull and needing replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for any one who has a thick beard but sensitive skin or face.  It really works well with the Hydro 5 Battery powered razor</li>
            <li> Received this razor as a freebie 3 years ago and fell in love! Speaking of love, from the first stroke on my leg the sheer velvety smooth results are amazing. After shaving, lotioning up just want to caress my legs throughout the day, which is not cool.  I can go on and on about this that just want to use it all over but can&#x27;t do that. Sorry, going on a tangent here, I am a female. Being a female, these refills as well as the razor are serious yet has more advantages than disadvantages. The benefits are ; hydrating gel can be used alone or with soap lather ( works for me either way), rust resistant ( I do shake opposite of towel once, then air dry in bedroom), sharp blades ( no nicks, remainder hairs, cuts or scrapes),  and life time guarantee on blades. No I say this because still on one blade for a year even though the gel is noticeable in 4 slots. The only thing I am up in the air about is the life span of blades. They say &amp;#34;performance guarantee&amp;#34; gather that means till no longer usable.</li>
            <li> I have used these razors for about one year and they are the most gentle ones I have uses. They don&#x27;t get the closest shave that I ave ever had but I never get razor burn. The price was also amazing. I cannot find this price unless there is a great sale... which is never when I need a refill.</li>
            <li> Since Amazon opened up their new shaving department I have started to buy more shaving supplies there.  These razors are great and cheaper than the store and easy to setup on re-order.  My only complaint is the 8 pack isnt on prime while the 4 pack is.</li>
            <li> I was a long time Gilette Fusion user and recently tried the Hydro. I will now permanently switch. Much closer shave with absolutely no razor burn or cuts.</li>
            <li> Very good blade, works well. I only tried one on, but i assume al the others should be the same. The package rapped very well and shipping is very fast..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> They last an extremely short amount of time.I shave maybe two to three times every two or three weeks and they go dull in that short period of time. Max a month only on a few shaves</li>
            <li> Smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li> best razors out there</li>
            <li> This is my fav razor. I used to use the Mach 3 but found this a lot more smoother of a shave. Also, I&#x27;ve found buying it here is a lot cheaper than the grocery store.</li>
            <li> After years and years of being a loyal Gillette Fusion subject, I finally became fed up with the price gouging that had been going on.  I took a leap of faith and switched brands to the Schick Hydro 5 and am happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> Stopped using the razor cause i got a better one but these blades are still great and work good on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I give the product 4 stars because the razor does give a good shave (not the closest you&#x27;ll ever get, but good).  I get roughly the same quality of shave and same amount of reuses per cartridge with the Schick Hydro 5 as I do with the Gillette Mach 5.  With Schick, you save a few bucks...for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first subcribe and save order was $8.30 per 4ct refill, now they just increased the price to a few cents shy of $12.00.  Since I buy in bulk as much as possible, I price shop every 3 - 6 months for the razors.  Amazon had my business last time, but I&#x27;m not sure about next time because the local grocery stores charge about the same amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor companies can keep setting their prices, but I might re-learn a straight razor before too long.  Supply and demand.</li>
            <li> Continue to give good shave.</li>
            <li> I returned these since they don&#x27;t fit my razors. But this was a great price. I would purchase from this source again.</li>
            <li> I own two electric shavers and a safety razor. In recent years I&#x27;ve used Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s and Schick Extreme 3&#x27;s.  Nothing works as well for shaving my thick beard, mustache, and my entire head as the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, Hydro 5 blades last a long time.  Mach 3&#x27;s would be dull within ten shaves.  Extreme 3&#x27;s would last maybe 20.  Double-edged blades were no better.  The Hydro 5 blade I&#x27;m replacing (my first) has been nice and sharp for months.</li>
            <li> liked it to shave my all hairs down and up</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than Gillette, also price is less than Gillette, lasts long than Gillette, so why pay more :) I</li>
            <li> This is the best blade cartridge to use if you have sensitive skin. The moisture strip really lessens any shaving rash.</li>
            <li> clean as smooth is my chin because of these beautiful blades without any nicks or scratches.  four more words to.....</li>
            <li> Everytime I go to walmart, or CVS or all that other BS.  They&#x27;re always OUT OF STOCK, ALWAYS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up on them and started buying online. Great prices, and if I order ahead of time, I am never out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried giving my money to big box stores but they don&#x27;t want it I guess. And they wonder why Amazon is slaying them and taking customers away.</li>
            <li> razors work well and dont rough up my skin thanks to the aloe (i guess), though I never had a problem with the regular non-aloe blades.</li>
            <li> Compared to Gillette, I found the Schick Hydro to be easier on my face. I am unable to decide if they last longer than Gillette or are the same - but for the cost, they are definitely a better choice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> blades work fine.  My only complaint about this product is the handle as the blue paint flecks off over time.</li>
            <li> These are about the best razors out there. I&#x27;ve recently done the touch test with the Dorco 6 blade and these still won out. Just gotta keep your eyes open for sales because they are always too expensive.</li>
            <li> Good products, prices and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Problem Free and would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I gave a 5 star rating because of all the above mentioned.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades they cut great and last a long time. The hydro gell strip doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the blades. I hate how much razors cost and that&#x27;s why I kept a star.</li>
            <li> I bought the Schick Hydro originally as a gimmick that I had seen on a television commercial. While I normally like to research the products I purchase before, I decided for the cost, why not give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have been plagued with cuts and razor burn on my face and neck from poor quality razors and/or poor technique (I want to give the benefit of the doubt to the other companies). Upon beginning to use the Schick Hydro 5, I have been pleasantly surprised. This is a very forgiving razor that glides smoothly over the skin, through the hairs, than previous razors that I have used. WIth proper hydration (you do need to make sure you shave surface is wet), this razor aptly lubricates the area for a clean and consistent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the razor is fantastic, the head itself can be frustrating at times. Due to it&#x27;s size, it often leaves two or three areas on the face difficult to shave, and those are on the undersides of the cheek near where the face curves. Once you realize this, a few adjustments can be made to the shave technique to fix this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great razor that keeps me coming back to it time and time again.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades.  I get a lot of comfortable shaves out of them.  Like so many personal care items, this is subject to a certain degree and another blade may work better for you.  But I would suggest giving them a try.  They are worth the extra money as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used the Pro Glide. So I cannot compare it. However, I did research both and I felt that this seemed to offer as good/better/almost as good a shave as the Gillette. But at a better price. The blades are thin, they seem to last quite long. Prior to this, I used the Sensor Excel. For shaving the moustache are, these 5 blades are not very convenient. So perhaps you can get the excel and use both if you must. If you did that, you would not really be spending more because the blades would get used less than 1 blade for doing both. The blades do not get clogged. Ir you expect to complete most of your shave without rinsing, then of course they will. However, my old sensor excel had no ventilation at the back of these blades for rinsing. These are like window blinds. Ventilated that way. So very easy to rinse unlike the Sensor excel. You can always spend 10 bucks or so and try it out. You might actually like it. I do.</li>
            <li> Mens&#x27; razors are always the best, but this one tops them all. Smooth, clean shave that lasts more than 1 hour. I never seem to knick myself with this blade either, and it seems to last longer without getting dull - unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> Hubby liked this shaver better than the 4-blade that seemed the best.  Schick really delivers.  A close shave - no bleeding.</li>
            <li> Very nice blades, worked really well and gave a close  shave. Yes I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use these blades. He says he gets about a month out of each blade and that they are economical for him to se. With the subscribe and save discount he feels he gets good value for the money.</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about what type of razor he has me to buy. We&#x27;ve been married for over 40 years and has not been satisfied with anything I&#x27;ve purchased till I purchased the Schick Hydro shaver.  So much so I have purchased a bundle of refills for the both of us and he and I both think they are the best of all.</li>
            <li> As with the mating razor, these do a great job.They last a good while as long as they are thoroughly cleaned and dried after each time they are used.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended to my husband a 5 razor blade for shaving his head.  We bought this one and it works great.  Previous razors would always nick his noggin and still leave some rough spots.....but this makes his head as smooth as a baby dolphin, haha!  Get it is you want a shiny sleek head.</li>
            <li> Amazing shave, I had been using another Schick razor and my skin was always sore and irritated afterwards, I went on line and check consume highest ranking men&#x27;s razor and this razor came up in the top 5. When I first started shaving with it I thought I had not removed the protective head, The shave was smooth and comfortable. it left my skin smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned and at my age I can damage my skin very easily. How wonderful it was to have a great shave without the irritation. I shave my head too and it did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I have found a razor I can afford and does a great job.</li>
            <li> 5 blades on a razor might be overkill.  However, this does provide a good shave for my heavy beard.  Don&#x27;t get rid of your single razor, although this razor makes an attempt in these areas, you&#x27;ll still need a single razor for all the tight places where this razor can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Used to be about the Mach series razors until I tried Schick about a year ago, much gentler on my thicker stub and easier on my sensitive skin with no razor burn.  Only downside is that I now live in a world where I am too lazy to buy something as simple as razor blades in stores when I can do all of my shopping from the comfort of my bed. This is the future that I dreamed of as a kid.</li>
            <li> Superior product at a competitive price sums it up.  Comfortable to use and long lasting; just dry after each use and I find I can go for a month, shaving six days per week.</li>
            <li> Best product for men whose looking for great blades to shave the head..... I get about 20 shaves per blad&amp;eacute;....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deducting one star because the price of the replacement cartridges is stupidly high.  However, I saved about a dollar over Walgreen&#x27;s price by buying them from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick beard and get about 5 shaves from each cartridge.  Try not to leave the razor in the shower because the lubrication strip will begin to disintegrate quicker than normal.  Personally, I don&#x27;t need the lubrication strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave can&#x27;t be beat.  Smoothest I ever had.  I don&#x27;t think a Hydro 6 would shave better.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip that flips back on top, if it gets wet, like anything would in a shower.  It begins to get rather ugly and really has no use.  They should redo the flip back top strip and come up with something that can endure regular bathroom/shower/sink use.</li>
            <li> I used to be just an electric shaver guy, but I was curious one day and ordered a Hydro 5 and I really cannot see myself using anything else to shave in the future. The cut is extremely smooth and the hydrating gel does actually work (though it sometimes takes one full shave for it to really get activated). Much greater quality than the rip off that is Gilette!</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave, doesn&#x27;t seem to last past about a week.  But longer than some of the other brands.  So I&#x27;m happy, and they are a little bit cheaper too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as promised.  I first received a $10.00 Dollar coupon in the mail for this new shaving accessory which is a great improvement over the previous multi blade products on the market.  After using this for the first time, I noticed how smooth and painless it felt as my hard whiskers were being removed.  The local merchants charge an arm and leg for the blade refills and I was happy to find a merchant on Amazon.com who did not cost a small fortune for this item!  Thank you! Regards, Steve Horvath</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now and will not go back to any other razor.  This simply does the job and does it very well. I normally have dry skin after shaving, and this razor keeps my skin very smooth.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> these damn blades are so expensive but this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever found</li>
            <li> No more porcupine, prickly hugs and kisses. This shaves smooth and leaves the skin feeling soooooooo soft. Been using and will continue to use. Truly leaves the skin baby soft!</li>
            <li> I struggled to find a razor out there that I could use because I have very sensitive skin and curely hair (horrible combo if you&#x27;re wondering). I receieved one of these bad boys as a free trial in the mail, and have been hooked ever since. Best razors out there, wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> My husband got a hydro razor for a free trial and now thinks this is the best shave he&#x27;s ever had.  He had a Schick Quattro before which he liked fine but LOVES this one.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what a difference this made when I switched from Gillette&#x27;s flagship product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette blades do not last long, do not cut well and are ridiculously overpriced. I tried this as an experiment when it came out. Several packets of blades and hundreds of shaves later, I still stand by Schick. Will never buy Gillette again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothest shave of any manual product.</li>
            <li> The blades work pretty well but not as good as my Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> I switched from an electric razor about 2 years ago and tried a few razors until I used this one.  I get a nice shave every time and hardly ever nick myself.  As long as you don&#x27;t try to use each too long than you should be fine.  When you start to lose that smooth edge switch to a new blade.</li>
            <li> Smoothest and closest shave I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> Simply the best blade I have used in the over 50 years I&#x27;ve been shaving this heavy beard of mine. I know that my wife&#x27;s name will appear here, but obviously the blades are for me.</li>
            <li> I have not had success with this product after my 1st shave.  It does a great job day 1. And then ... no matter how I clean it ... move it ... whatever ...&lt;br /&gt;I get less and less shaving ability.</li>
            <li> work good.  rust appears quickly on them</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 gives the fastest and best shave out of any razor I&#x27;ve used.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this razor when our then-local grocery store mailed us a free coupon to buy one.  Well it was free, so we bought one and tried it.  We travel often and can&#x27;t always have a reusable, electrical model available.  This razor works well for both male and female face shaving.  It is softer and gentler than other disposable razors we&#x27;ve tried.  I used one head 2-3 times per week for several months so the cost and environmental impact is not great.  I purchased these replacement heads on amazon because they were cheaper here than other websites and our local store does not carry them.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve hesitated to buy these super-4-blade and 5-blade razors because they were much higher price than the others, or I didnâ€™t think theyâ€™d be any better. But this is the third time Iâ€™ve ordered these Hydro 5 Blades. Since each refill lasts me at least a month, with every day shaving, and leaves my face smooth without any cuts, it is a great value. I find them very good for both the regular razor and for the Fusion (vibration).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Fusion power razor and the vibration seems to help my shaving speed and cleanness. Good grip to the handle too, easy to store, and the trimmer adaptation helps my stray hairs somewhat, but not perfectly in stubborn areas such as under the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the best use is a few days after I start a new blade. At first I might get a few minor nicks, then a few weeks of smooth shaving. In the fourth and fifth week, I need to apply a bit more pressure to the razor.</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro 5 blades are so much better than Gillette blades.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother shaves and last longer than Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I switched.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in hard plastic case for clean storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus 1* only because I&#x27;d prefer these in a 5-pack - the shave, itself, is remarkably better than the same product name on the disposables.</li>
            <li> The hydro produces the closest shave on the second shave.  Warm water activates the gel and reduces drag when shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tend to get razor burn really easily. This is the best razor I&#x27;ve found. It gives an extremely close shave, but it&#x27;s also sensitive with the hydro idea  built in.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro is a big leap forward compared to the Quattro. Prior to this, I tried the more expensive Gillette fusion. The shave of the Schick is slightly better than that of the Gillette. The razor is lighter which is what I wanted. Overall, the shave is nice with no 5&#x27; o clock shadow. Amazon&#x27;s sunscribe and save is a good way to get this at a discount. The price cant be beat. Only problem is that it leaves hais just below my nose..... Big blade I guess.</li>
            <li> I had switched to electric razors for my head (I shave my head bald) a few years ago and a free pack of these got me to convert back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package came as promised and was cheaper than Target.</li>
            <li> These Schick blades definitely last longer than Gillette blades. They&#x27;re also much cheaper here than any other store out there.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed and arrived on time and package was readily accessible. Would definitely purchase again if need be.</li>
            <li> The Shick Hydro 5 blades are great -- I prefer these because of the hydration strip. I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple years now and I prefer them to disposable razors. I order them every couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but when I tired Hydro5 I had the best shave of my life. Smooth, fast, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Shaves well but a little tricky getting around the nostrils.</li>
            <li> After decades of using Gillette products, accidental circumstances led me to using Schick disposables from which I quickly graduated to using this 5 blade model.  Very comfortable, very long lasting -- and therefore VERY economical!</li>
            <li> good shave but you have to do more work to get a great shave</li>
            <li> I shave my head with these, and they only cut me once. Very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I hate saving I mean really hate shaving. These are one of the few blades that are comfortable for me to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I hate more than shaving is going to the store to buy blades. Luckily Amazon has me covered.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these blades. I only have one small complaint, but it doesn&#x27;t warrant knocking off a star, as I am most likely a minority purchaser since I am female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades give you such a close, smooth shave. Better than any razor/blade I have ever used. I thought the Quattro was the best..til the Hydro 5 came out. I have no irritation at all, no knicks or cuts, no razorburn. The moisturizing is long-lasting, especially considering I use it for shaving my legs, underarms, and bikini area. I get many shaves out of one blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my only small complaint - the wider blue \\&quot;frame\\&quot; around the blade head makes it a little difficult to get really precise in the bikini area, despite the tilt back upper part of the frame. If it is tilted back, you still have the frame on the bottom part and so if you&#x27;re shaving from inner to outter, that bottom frame piece is blocking some of the shaving area - so as you come outwards to the crease of your leg, you have to pull the razor further since the blue part isn&#x27;t shaving, of course. I probably didn&#x27;t explain that very well, but again it probably doesn&#x27;t matter much since most interested in these blades will be men and not shaving their bikini area.</li>
            <li> original good quality fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was given a free trial of this razor. I have not back to any other brand since. No fusions or cheap disposables are in my future.</li>
            <li> Being Greek, I can grow a mean beard. And considering I don&#x27;t like to shave very often, I need a good razor for the few times I do shave. These razors last a long time and the 5 blades get super close to the skin. I also don&#x27;t have any irritation while using these razors. The moisturizing part that flips back to leave just the blades is great for trimming sideburns and other hard to reach areas around the nose.</li>
            <li> I own both the Schick Hydro 3 and 5 blade (just because I like them so much!) and on Christmas a family friend bought me a Gillette Fusion Pro-glide to goad me about our sometimes debate about who makes he best razor, thinking he could get me to switch to his favorite razor. I&#x27;m open-minded and willing to switch if the product is proven better...and the Schick won again.  The Schick 5 is in my opinion a better razor, gives a better shave and is priced at a less expensive price. period.  It does exactly what it advertises itself to do every shave, is consistent in blade quality with every pack I buy and has a durable and long-lasting feel and quality to the handle. When I pull the blade across my face I still don&#x27;t feel any blades touch my skin, am still sometimes surprised that I&#x27;m getting a shave at all. No pull, cuts, nicks or irritation at all...never happens. I could feet the other razor much like I could feel the Mach 3. I still had to do touch up which I never have to do with the Schick 5.  And again: Costs less.  Why would I want to pay more for an inferior razor. The Schick Hydro 5 (and 3) is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned in 44 years, with a medium, coarse, full face beard and I&#x27;m never going to change as long as they keep making it. The only razor that comes close is the Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product...It last me at least 1-2 weeks just for one razor...I bet you will be pleased</li>
            <li> I can get 6 months out of one cartridge making sure to dry it immediately and vacuum, yes, vacuum it after shaves to really get all the water out. I watched a You Tube vid of a guy cleaning his razor by simply running it on his jeans a few times (one direction, obviously) and this method definitely works for me. Will smooth micro fiber work better? Hmmm, will check out...</li>
            <li> These blades help give you a very smooth shave.  Produces no cuts, nicks, or burns - even when lacking proper shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you are buying the refills you must have the shaver.  My hubby loves it cause it vibrates.  I just like that he shaves.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who swears by 5-blade razors.  He said that it was a pretty good shave, with no nics.</li>
            <li> Gives a perfect shave..... It leaves your face feeling very smooth without that burning sensation.....I recommend this blades to anyone</li>
            <li> Came earlier than promised, which was very welcomed! As far as the blades, they are razor blades - not much to review.</li>
            <li> Brilliant seller, exactly as advertised, thank you!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last as long as expected.  The blades expire before the next delivery from the shaver program</li>
            <li> Best blades ever.  Cut super close and stay sharp for a while.  I use these to shave my face and my head and the blades stay sharp enough that I don&#x27;t have to change them every other day.  I also have these sent to me automatically every month with amazons subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t have to go out to the store and get them</li>
            <li> These are the only cartridges that (for me at least) easily last more than a week. I use can shaving cream, and rise razor out with hot water.  Use a toothbrush (new, only for this purpose) to clean it thoroughly every time.  Seems to stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great razors, exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> These blades are super smooth and shave extra close...don&#x27;t waste money on the Aloe/sensitive skin version blades- its just marketing!</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach3 for so long and never thought of trying this Hydro 5....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife got this for me and boy....i was surprised with the results...this gives a much better and closer shave (without any irritation) and lasts twice as much and costs less than Mach3...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i am very happy with Hydro 5 and would continue to use it going forward (already ordered couple refills)</li>
            <li> Just another ol&#x27; disposable cheapo razor, nothing real special.  Did not see any difference between this and all the other ones out there.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving product</li>
            <li> Been using Gillette for several years till I found these on sale (after rebate). In my opinion, these are better than Gillette fusion manual. The lubricating strip lasts longer and I noticed that I can easily shave against the grain after i have had a first shave in the direction of the grain. The razor feels tacky but I can&#x27;t complain. Overall, a better shave, blades last just as long and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> No one no where can give you a closer shave then this company! Schick never has fail me so far so I plan on sticking with them.</li>
            <li> Cheaper then Gillette and for me works just as well.  Using both Gillette and Schick and could not tell any noticeable difference, so I went with this blade since it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great razors for the price, have these razors on our subscribe and save. After every shave add almond oil to the blade and they will last for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> No blade actually gives me a very smooth shave every time, but these seem to be better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and the quality seems good.</li>
            <li> great blade has 5 so you cant miss a hair</li>
            <li> I desperately needed these in Bulgaria and sent them to my friend in the States to bring to me. They arrived in a timely fashion and are perfect - too bad they don&#x27;t carry Schick products in Bulgaria!</li>
            <li> I have only nicked myself once, and that was my own fault for being in a hurry. The blades are so smooth and I really like the shave. Good job, Schick!</li>
            <li> Tried for years to find the perfect razor, one that would last a bit but also give me a close shave that did not burn me up. These are the ones! Been using them now about 6 months and I gotta say I love the shave I get and they last like crazy. I get 3 good weeks per razor which I think makes these a great value. The shave is comfortable and close, cant ask for more.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for about two years, and I have discovered that their performance is much better with a high quality shaving cream.  If you use a high quality shaving cream I would give the blades a 4 star.</li>
            <li> Shaving is very smooth and clean. The product is also economic as you can shave several times with one mess unit. Buying at Amazon with automatically receiving a fresh box makes it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have used several different kinds of razors.  This, in my opinion, is the best.  Closet shave I have ever had</li>
            <li> After years of using cheap store brand disposable razors, I received one of these as a sample.  I&#x27;m never going back.  It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re just running an empty razor over your face.  No irritation (and I have very sensitive skin).  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Useless - Can&#x27;t get to hair under my nose.  never had problem with Quattro.  Might as well throw it out since I need a different razor to get the spot under my nose.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, and thus have been an electric razor user for at least 20 years.  Several times, I have tried to switch back to a blade, and have suffered cuts, irritation, ingrown hairs, bumps, redness, and just general misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Schick Hydro 5 Power razor on special, and figured it was worth a shot... The concept seemed sound, the power blade vibrates thus helping to cut the stubble without tugging and irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was magical!  From the very first shaves, I had very little irritation, and only occasional cuts.  After my skin had a few days to get used to the razor, it was glorious!  This razor and blade is so much faster, cleaner, and closer than my $200 electric razor could ever hope to be!  I have been using the Schick Hydro 5 Power for about 4 months now, and I will never go back to electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades last a long time, much longer than the hydrating gel on the blade.  I have thick, coarse Italian hair, and I can still get a good shave even on a 3 week old blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This refill also fits the non-power version of my razor, but in my experience, the power makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a bonus, the razor and refill costs much less than other power competitors.</li>
            <li> I moved from a mach 3 turbo razor for two reasons. First that critter is becoming old technology and getting hard to find so it was time to change. Then I received a coupon for the Schick Hydro 5. So I said why not. I was worried about how many blades does it take before it gets ridicules? Well evidently it is not 5. This critter is the most efficient animal yet. And yep, it is time for the refill. I cannot say they last any longer that the older blades but the worked better. They are easy to rinse out and go again. It did take a little time to figure out how to change the first refill.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing less of phenomenal, I find $15 a big expense for your face but worth the price in the end. I tried to switch to a two, or even 3 black razor and they cut my face everywhere, I have sensitive, oily, acne prominent skin and I ding that this razor does my cut my face, even against the grain, and makes my skin feel healthy and hydrated after the clean cut shave. Do yourself a favor and invest in this product, your partner male/female will thank you for making your skin smooth :)</li>
            <li> Great price on these razors.  As you are currently aware, razors must be made of GOLD, because the price&lt;br /&gt;of these things at the local store is getting outrageous.</li>
            <li> These razors have my the most painless shave of any razor I have used. I get terrible razor burn and my facial hair grows in different directions. These shave well and don&#x27;t hurt. No pulling and they last long. Love them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. These blades are sometimes difficult to find in the store, so you made it easy and convenient. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My son uses these.  They work very well, and hold up.  Easy to change blades. They last a week; he shaves daily.&lt;br /&gt;They are priced reasonably.  There are usually coupons in the weekly newspapers, or you can use subscribe and save like we do.</li>
            <li> Good razor to shave with. Not as expensive as Gillette (any product) and is very gentle on the face. Shaves well; shaves clean. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t have a single blade on the back to trim with -- I guess Gillette patented that, but every razor should have that trimming blade.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and my face can always tell when the blades are getting to be the slightest of dull. The extra lubrication of these Schick blades really make all the difference. My skin always feels smooth after each shave, not to mention a very close shave. It was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> They are real razors and work just fine. I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of buying fake razors from time to time. These are A+</li>
            <li> these blades work good for the razor pictured above. never had any issues so far , love them !!!! !!!</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5-bladed razor from Schick is high-quality and comfortable compared to many other razors.  This purchase was for the blades only as I already possessed the razor itself, but they are used as a single product.  The shaving experience depends on the care used when shaving, the shaving cream or gel used, and the person&#x27;s hair.  I have no complaints and I have used multiple other razors and blades over the years.  This is a good one.</li>
            <li> The best price I was able to find  on the Internet. Easton use, easy to change. Cose and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> For years I was a Gillette fan.  Lately I have been disappointed with the quality of their blades for some reason.  I decided to give Schick another try and have been very happy with the quality of shave I get from the Hydro 5.  I have fewer nicks and less skin irritation.  Of course, the blades will also seem overpriced to me so I cannot give the product 5 stars due to the cost.</li>
            <li> Great shave for both my face and my bald head!</li>
            <li> Good razor but I switched to Dorco and will never look back. Look up the name and you will not be disappointed. Great razors for the money.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter..she says she loves them..no nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people still use Gillette. These are way smoother. Been using for a year now after got a sample in the mail. God bless the sample. Try it.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are very good. Subscribe and save is handy. My primary issue is that anytime I accessed the page that tells you about price changes in your list, I  would get a notice that the price dropped on the blades when I was between orders, but when it was time for the order to ship...OOPS... the price went back up--every time and I have been subscribing for over a year.</li>
            <li> They are great! They are normally pretty expensive and this was a pretty good deal that I found. These razors work very good</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself just to try them out. Since using them I don&#x27;t see why I would buy anything else these are the best razors!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and would definitely buy again on-line when I need this product again.  Less expensive than purchasing in a store.</li>
            <li> I have to shave my legs every day or else i have little stubble. I find that using a guys razor is a closer shave and smoother shave. i no have to shave every other day,  not every day as when i was using a womens razor.  Worth the money. Great value. now at stores this will cost $18...i will purchase again if it is $11.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every blade out there, and this leaves such a smooth finish!  Love my soft legs and so does my fella!  These are such a great deal on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed, works great, affordable price, recieved quickly. Very happy with the product and a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Purchased it in error but didnt return it, my fault, any how...they have great blades...!! I use it even though it not the accurate one for me...</li>
            <li> I tried these for a while and they were pretty sharp, smooth and longlasting. Then I tried the Gillette Proglide fusion in a &amp;#34;shave-off&amp;#34;, which entails lathering up then using each razor on half the face then the next day switching to avoid the lag effect, and then on another day hiding the handle to do a &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; test. I would have to give the Fusion a slight edge, albeit it is a tad more expensive.</li>
            <li> These are cheaper than Gillette. The lubricating strip is great for those in between shaves. I&#x27;ve been using a cartridge for over six months and still get a close shave. I just keep my razor blade submerged in baby oil when not in use.</li>
            <li> These are really expensive, but I think worth it to some point. These blades get hair down close to the skin, and don&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> Super expensive but that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Razors likes and dislikes are highly personal. Schick is my favorite, so the 5 stars are really for the merchant who offered a very good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My son uses this and he found it to be to his liking a smooth shave which is why you buy a razor</li>
            <li> If you are contemplating buying this refill pack, then you must already be familiar with the product itself. So saving money on a great product should make you as happy as as it made me. It was delivered quickly and money was saved. Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> I am usually using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good cost performance. I have no concerns for it.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy same one next time.</li>
            <li> The razor is great and I prefer it over the Hydro 3, which doesn&#x27;t glide quite as well and causes more irritation for me. I also found the hydro blades to last longer and to be almost half the price of the fusion blades. The shave quality was the same from both, but given the longevity of the hydro blades and their price, it was an easy choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the real reason I wrote this review is to mention that the blades are made in the U.S.A, not China, like some reviews state. On the back of the box, it states that &amp;#34;Hydro cartridges are made in the U.S.A for Energizer Personal Care LLC, Shelton CT 06484&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon, but rather locally, so perhaps there are slightly different versions for sale.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different types and brands of razors, both for men and women. Previously, my go-to razor has been the Venus Embrace because I loved the absurdly large moisture ring. Unfortunately, I go through about two of those razors a week because I&#x27;m obsessed with my legs being totally hairless and shave almost every day, and I also hate shaving with even a slightly dull razor. At about $17/box, the cost was ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although these are &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be a men&#x27;s razor, I tried these out earlier this year and have been very impressed. The moisture strip is a lot smaller than on the Embrace, but seems to be equally as effective, if not more so, at preventing irritation. I always get a close shave and can actually use these about 4-6 times before they&#x27;re absolutely unusable to me. A person with sane shaving habits could probably use one for nearly two weeks before needing to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both on and off Amazon, these are also about $5 cheaper than the Embrace. I really like them and unless I find something that blows my mind (seems unlikely), I&#x27;ll stick with them.</li>
            <li> Schick and Gillette... Hydro vs. Fusion.  I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\&quot; is very different between the 2 brands.  Prices are comparable.  I&#x27;m a big fan of both and the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades. Smooth and thorough cut.  Lasts a good number of shaves. The lubricant part pulls back allowing for a close shave of hair under nose. Much better value than the more expensive Gillette blades. I especially enjoy Amazon&#x27;s auto-shipments. I get them at an even lower price than I would at Wal-Mart, they arrive as I need them. I recommend buying all consumables this way. Super convenient and good savings.</li>
            <li> these 5 bladed hydro last for about 5 months so these lasted me almost 2 years and were of good quality.</li>
            <li> I order these for my son as it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying at a drug/grocery store and he loves them.</li>
            <li> I have always preferred Schick razors to Gillette.  Gillette is more widely available; for example, Costco sells only Gillette products.  Schick razors give me a closer shave and I can generally get 4 shaves out of a Schick razor as opposed to only 3 from a similar Gillette. The Hydro 5 was a slight improvement over the last generation, which still worked well, despite having fewer blades per cartridge.  The new lubricating dots work well and the fold-back mechanism on the Hydro 5 is very good at shaving hard-to-reach areas.  I hope we&#x27;ve reached the end of the Razor Blade Arms Race, because 5 blades is certainly enough for a close shave.  Whenever they escalate the number of blades in the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version, the quality of the previous model (when it&#x27;s still available) slips badly. So you&#x27;re forced to buy the new one because the old model will cut up your face and give you fewer shaves per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus review: Edge Gel is thicker than the products made by either Schick or Gillette.  When you shave in the shower this makes a difference because the Schick/Gillette stuff rinses off your face before you&#x27;re done shaving.  And a five-blade razor requires thick gel to avoid cuts and abrasion.  But Edge is much too expensive at Amazon (significantly more expensive than at a brick and mortar store), so buy it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying razor blades is a costly nuisance.  About 7 years ago, both Schick and Gillette cut back on the number of blade cartridges per package from 5 to 4, without reducing the price.  So the Amazon Subscribe-and-Save program was a nice convenience; the blades were less expensive and I no longer needed to remember to buy them at the grocery or drugstore.  The 8-cartridge packs are usually a better deal -- the 4-packs cost about $10.50 while the 8-packs cost about $17.  Subscribe and Save discounts the price of both by a small percentage.  The price fluctuates frequently, and Amazon sends you an e-mail before every shipment telling you the current price and the price of the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Prime member, so I can usually avoid paying for shipping.  However, I plan to drop my Prime membership because small products like razor blades are increasingly listed as \\&quot;add-on items\\&quot; which are not eligible for free Prime shipping even if you pay for Prime.  I don&#x27;t use Amazon&#x27;s streaming video service, so these add-on items make Prime a poor value for me.  However, I believe Subscribe and Save comes with free ground shipping even if you&#x27;re not Prime.lling you the current price and the price of the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Prime member, so I can usually avoid paying for shipping.

            <li> this is the finest blade system I have EVERY USED (50 years of shaving)  good on my skin, does the job, and the end flips up to get under the nose  what more do you want????</li>
            <li> Got these and tried them out. First one didn&#x27;t have the lubricating gel stuff, so resulted in a not too delightful experience. Second one did have the gel. Blade is fine, I guess. The price I paid was more than what it would have cot if I had gone to a local drug store. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I switched from Gillette Fusion to Schick Hydro, and I honestly believe that, even after the blade has seen a couple weeks of use, I get a smoother, better shave.  Also, my skin seems less irritated by the older blades than they did with my previous ones.</li>
