            <li>Love Love</li>
            <li>Another great product from NOW Foods, a company more people should really know more about.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Very effective while staying gentle.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use a lot to adequately clean my face and get a nice lather.</li>
            <li>and I am familiar with NOW products!</li>
            <li>truly is a clear gel, that smells great</li>
            <li>Since I have been very pleased with their line of cleansers and body oils, my sense was that this product would also be very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it goes really mild and won&#x27;t harm your skin.  </li>
            <li>This Cleanser is just fantastic on the skin.</li>
            <li>Works well and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Brightens the skin and leaves your family so clean.  </li>
            <li>does get face clean</li>
            <li>Clean feel.</li>
            <li>I read so many positive reviews about this on another site which carries this product.</li>
            <li>in the winter or when I use skin products that are full of chemicals this type of discoloration flares up.</li>
            <li>This cleanser smells great, produces a moderate lather, and is really gentle.  </li>
            <li>It always feels better, for me, to use products that do not add more garbage to my system - living in the big city and surrounded by poisons, anyway (pollution, etc).</li>
            <li>I am noticing a reduction in the size of some stubborn cystic acne and my skin is healing rather quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin felt pretty clean afterwards, no residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a great little scent.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li>(like fresh squeezed oranges).</li>
            <li>You apply and massage this to freshly moistened (with water) skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks totally fresh every morning after using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it makes my skin seriously soft.</li>
            <li>I was right in assuming this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin felt tight but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>luckily I found a generic oil free cleanser made by a supermarket chain that agrees with my skin.</li>
            <li>I have pretty decent skin to begin with, and a sensitivity to Vitamin C, however this cleanser is the right balance of the Vitamin C I need, and a cleanser that will do the day-to-day job.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I noticed redness and discoloration but was using a face sponge so decided that might be too harsh and used it on its own.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but breaks my face out in little tiny bumps.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it didn&#x27;t improve my problem skin much at all.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Cons: It does not lather as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very watery smells like they just put orange smell in it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t quite give me a deep clean feel</li>
            <li>It was gentle enough to not cause any more breakouts than I&#x27;m used to, but it definitely didn&#x27;t decrease the number.  </li>
            <li>I have worked in many different facets of the skin industry (from a day-spa to a medical clinic) and this cleanser was suggested to me by one of the aestheticians.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and so far its gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Cleans dead skin, smells good, can be a little drying, does brighten skin, helps with irritations.</li>
            <li>Has even helped to clear up rosacea which I did not expect.  </li>
            <li>Actually I found it very soothing on my irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I only been using for a month off and on because it really doesn&#x27;t brighten my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve used much worse cleansers, there are definitely better ones out there ( such as those containing vitamin A and glycolic acid).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily to mildly oily in the sweltering and hot seasons, but dry when the very short cold season shows up.</li>

            <li> I read so many positive reviews about this on another site which carries this product. people said it is especially great for sensitive skin and clearing your skin tone but I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first time I used it I noticed redness and discoloration but was using a face sponge so decided that might be too harsh and used it on its own. same result. I have oily combination skin, my problem area being the T zone. this cleanser zoomed in on the area and made my nose red as well as area around my mouth. my skin felt tight but not in a good way. it also looked shiny. basically all the things it is meant to reverse. in the winter or when I use skin products that are full of chemicals this type of discoloration flares up. luckily I found a generic oil free cleanser made by a supermarket chain that agrees with my skin. this was a waste of cash.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it goes really mild and won&#x27;t harm your skin.  I will highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a great little scent. It has made my pores tighter as well!</li>
            <li> Product is too thick and, while gentle, not good enough at gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but breaks my face out in little tiny bumps.  They almost look like hives.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and I&#x27;m especially pleased that the ingredients are good for me, non toxic, parabin and chemical free.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells great, produces a moderate lather, and is really gentle.  I love that the ingredients are natural.

            <li> Cleanser does not leave a film on your skin.  Has even helped to clear up rosacea which I did not expect.  This cleanser has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> As of late, I have been having some complexion issues. Due to blemishes, shifts in weather (a really dry month in Seattle), and hormones, I have frequent breakouts and scars from these episodes. Seeking less toxic solutions has been my way to work through this (in addition to wearing lots and lots of liquid foundation that melts away in heat!). Great things have been published about the benefits of manuka honey (in skin and in the body), so, I decided to give NOW Foods Gel Cleanser with Vitamin C and Manuka Honey a try. Since I have been very pleased with their line of cleansers and body oils, my sense was that this product would also be very pleasing. I was right in assuming this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a clear gel, that smells great (like fresh squeezed oranges). You apply and massage this to freshly moistened (with water) skin. You rub it in from 1-2 minutes, and then thoroughly rinse it off with water. My pores instantly felt cleansed and soothed. This is also supposed to minimize scarring - I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in this yet, but, I have only been applying it for about a week now. We shall see how things progress, in about a month&#x27;s time. It always feels better, for me, to use products that do not add more garbage to my system - living in the big city and surrounded by poisons, anyway (pollution, etc). Another great product from NOW Foods, a company more people should really know more about.</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser. Works well and good for sensitive skin. Removes make-up without being harsh. Actually I found it very soothing on my irritated skin. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Pros: I love the orange scent! It is gentle on the skin. Cons: It does not lather as much as I would like. I feel like I have to use a lot to adequately clean my face and get a nice lather.</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion, which gets weird when you live in the Deep South. It&#x27;s very oily to mildly oily in the sweltering and hot seasons, but dry when the very short cold season shows up. This cleanser is amazing. It works for me all the time. It removes excess oils and never overdries. My skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> I switched from Clinique to the NOW Vitamin C and Manuka Honey Cleanser and Acai Toner. They cleanse my skin without drying it out. I had some skin irritation from traveling to Asia for an extended business trip. These were the only products that helped. Very effective while staying gentle. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My skin looks totally fresh every morning after using it.  It&#x27;s not drying, but you must follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Looooooove this!! Doesn&#x27;t quite give me a deep clean feel but it&#x27;s amazing for clearing up my blemishes and acne scars. I&#x27;m a picker&lt;br /&gt;My HG cleanser</li>
            <li> I love the smell and cleanse good. I only been using for a month off and on because it really doesn&#x27;t brighten my skin. But it does subside my acne keep them for getting worst.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I think that the vitamin C broke my face out besides that the face wash is good and I am familiar with NOW products!</li>
            <li> I started using the cleanser a week ago and I love it. I love the smell and how it makes my skin seriously soft. I have acne prone skin and eczema and so far its gentle on my skin. I am noticing a reduction in the size of some stubborn cystic acne and my skin is healing rather quickly. I use it along with the manuka honey skin cream. I would recommend this product. I have tried tons of other products but my skin would get irritated and dry.</li>
            <li> It took a long time for order to ship I was a little disappointed in product very watery smells like they just put orange smell in it does get face clean but u have to use a lot I will not purchase this item again so it only gets three star rating from me</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell. Clean feel. Do they make a scrub? If so, I would buy it.</li>
            <li> I have worked in many different facets of the skin industry (from a day-spa to a medical clinic) and this cleanser was suggested to me by one of the aestheticians. I have pretty decent skin to begin with, and a sensitivity to Vitamin C, however this cleanser is the right balance of the Vitamin C I need, and a cleanser that will do the day-to-day job. It is the perfect general cleanser for myself and my tween daughter. We both use it along with a moisturizer for maximum effect. We both have varying degrees of combo skin, she is getting the pre-teen break outs, that we are keeping at bay with this cleanser and the NOW foods red clay mask. I like not paying extra for fancy packaging or clinical sounding names. These are quality products with quality ingredients. Read the labels. Compare.</li>
