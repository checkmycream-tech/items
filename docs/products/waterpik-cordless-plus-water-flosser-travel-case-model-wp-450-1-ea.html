After reading some of the reviews stating that the case was too small, I was a little concern. Looks like I am going to be real happy with it.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and I must floss my teeth twice a day. This case is great for carrying my Waterpik Flosser.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of the WaterPik and this time the travel kit was available!</li>
            <li> Very tight fit when trying to get the travel model of Waterpik in here!  I wish it had slots to put the Waterpik tips in!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling and holds my Water Flosser &amp; implements perfectly</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have enough pressure.  I was disappointed as I own the water pick which is too big for travel.  I am thinking of returning it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, works fine, have all the extras &amp; there have been no problems.  I highly reccomend it &amp; will take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Nice looking, but not large enough to carry the charger along with the flosser.</li>
            <li> case is sbubstantial and attractive and would recommend to friends and family, also is a must for traveling to keep from losing tips</li>
            <li> Nice to have for traveling</li>
            <li> This case is not made for the unit I have bought. ItÂ´s narrow and then did not be used to keep all the additional pieces</li>
            <li> This works great for my Potable water flosser. This is a must have for those who travel a lot around!</li>
            <li> Great &amp; so easy to use. I had a water pik years ago that took up half of my bathroom counter top. This one is so small that I actually carried it in my carry on and used it in the airport bathroom. It is fantastic at getting any food out from under my permanent bridge. So thankful and now buying one for my sister who was also so impressed when she saw me using it while I visited her. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This travel case does what it is supposed to do, but it&#x27;s just a plastic sleeve. It is WAY overpriced. Save your money.</li>
            <li> this case is prettying flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work any better than a ziplock bag.  I don&#x27;t recommend it, especially not at that price</li>
            <li> Could be a tad larger.</li>
