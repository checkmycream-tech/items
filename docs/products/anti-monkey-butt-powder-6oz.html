            <li>Reduces any kind of discomfort, and is much better without the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; of gold bond.</li>
            <li>gold bond is much more effective.  </li>
            <li>I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>If you have used baby powder, or gold bond, I find this to be the better alternative.</li>
            <li>Bacteria love moisture and as you sit there you will get stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>

            <li>I like it so much that I need to buy more.  </li>
            <li>but after ordering that one, the true anti friction powder came.</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and smelling nice!</li>
            <li>As funny as the name is, this is a super product.  </li>
            <li>It really helped combat the irritation I&#x27;ve been fighting, particularly in the skin creases in the most intimate areas, areas that perspire even when I am not sweaty.</li>
            <li>(friction between legs on hot day).</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Not only do I like the product, but I love the name.</li>
            <li>It works, it really works!  </li>
            <li>Given that the product states that it can be used in areas other than your butt, you would expect it to smell nice.</li>
            <li>I really really works.  </li>
            <li>Since he is a firefighter and thus a real man, I decided to try his product for myself.</li>
            <li>Gold Bond has menthol, which causes a temporary cooling sensation but really doesn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
            <li>We really don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
            <li>He really likes this product...for his Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li>Really does the job when you are doing water games for recreation.</li>
            <li>I am so clean and dry</li>
            <li>This powder last all day and really helps with all kinds of chafing (Meaning you don&#x27;t have to just use it on your butt</li>
            <li>I am a new believer, and now I use this powder daily!  </li>
            <li>I intended to use the product as a body powder to soak up excess perspiration but due to the funny odor, it&#x27;s not well suited for that.  </li>
            <li>Other than the fact that powder is a pain to use, this powder absolutely reduces moisture and itching in those &amp;#34;unmentionable&amp;#34; areas.</li>

            <li> Great stuff and doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as other brands on the market..</li>
            <li> I use a combo of gold bond and this as I am sitting all shift long and the temps sometimes get up over a 100 degrees.  </li>
            <li> However, we ordered the anti monkey butt powder and we received the anti monkey baby butt powder..which does not work as well for the purpose we were needing.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as embarrassing as goldbond powder..</li>
            <li> The company sent us a product not in the picture, it was Monkey Butt for Babies, not Anti friction.</li>
            <li> anti monkey butt for diaper rash; not for grown ups, which is what I hoped would ship, as shown in the photo</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;know I was prepared to say that this product did not live up to the hype...</li>
            <li> Monkey Butt Powder (AMBP) works by controlling the moisture that builds up in your junk, preventing bacteria and molds from throwing a party, and wet abrasion from scooting in your seat and your undies.</li>
            <li> Anti mokey butt powder works for me - and the only reason I am reviewing this now is that I just bought some for my Father-in-Law who is riding to Sturgis in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is like putting corn starch down your underpants.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a crotch desert down there.</li>
            <li> I noticed that while Gold Bond usually kept me dry, it did not help heal irritation or relieve itch.</li>
            <li> It works where other powders and such have failed.</li>
            <li> I used to be a die hard Gold Bond Medicated Powder (the green bottle) man, but now I&#x27;m all about this stuff.</li>
            <li> No more chafing, no rashes, no \\&quot;rough\\&quot; spots....</li>
            <li> With such a subtle smell this makes me want to wear this product out in public where I would hate wearing goldbond powder due to its unmistakable smell!</li>
            <li> just wish it didn&#x27;t have such a disgusting name &amp; cartoony label.  </li>
            <li> so my husband was disappointed in that.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a first timer on this product and took a chance, and man I glad I did.  I buy alot of products on Amazon and I\\&quot;m a number# 1 fan.  When I got this I really really works.  I use all over my body.  I like it so much that I need to buy more.  I used it inside my tennis shoe and it keep your feet from sweat and fungus.  Thank YOU ANTI-MONKEY YOU KICK BUTT.  What will a man do without this stuff.  I brought this to the gym and everybody want to use this and told I bought this on Amazon.  I had to tell them to go and get their own.  AWESOME CAN I SAY MORE?</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. If you have used baby powder, or gold bond, I find this to be the better alternative. Reduces any kind of discomfort, and is much better without the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; of gold bond.</li>
            <li> I got this for a 1200 mile trip on my motorcycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem that folks run into when in the saddle for hours at the time is having some moisture buildup in your crotch as you build up the miles. Bacteria love moisture and as you sit there you will get stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti Monkey Butt Powder (AMBP) works by controlling the moisture that builds up in your junk, preventing bacteria and molds from throwing a party, and wet abrasion from scooting in your seat and your undies. It works as advertised and smell good to boot. If you need it NOW, Goldbond is a good alternative but IMO doesn&#x27;t smell as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you pair this stuff with some good undies and socks for maximum comfort:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-PowerSox Men&#x27;s Coolmax Crew 3 Pack,Black,10-13 (Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;-Adidas Men&#x27;s Sport Performance Climalite 2-Pack Boxer Brief, Black/Black (Amazon)</li>
            <li> It really helped combat the irritation I&#x27;ve been fighting, particularly in the skin creases in the most intimate areas, areas that perspire even when I am not sweaty.</li>
            <li> The product itself works as advertised and I like the feel and smell of the powder but it was delivered a day after the package&#x27;s expiration date of 2/1/2015.</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;know I was prepared to say that this product did not live up to the hype...but, I can&#x27;t.  I am a new believer, and now I use this powder daily!  I use a combo of gold bond and this as I am sitting all shift long and the temps sometimes get up over a 100 degrees.  No more chafing, no rashes, no \\&quot;rough\\&quot; spots....Anti mokey butt powder works for me - and the only reason I am reviewing this now is that I just bought some for my Father-in-Law who is riding to Sturgis in a few weeks.  Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> However, we ordered the anti monkey butt powder and we received the anti monkey baby butt powder..which does not work as well for the purpose we were needing. (friction between legs on hot day).</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s friend&#x27;s husband is a fireman and recommended this stuff. Since he is a firefighter and thus a real man, I decided to try his product for myself. I used to be a die hard Gold Bond Medicated Powder (the green bottle) man, but now I&#x27;m all about this stuff. I noticed that while Gold Bond usually kept me dry, it did not help heal irritation or relieve itch. This stuff seems to do all of the above, probably because it actually has medication in it - calamine. Gold Bond has menthol, which causes a temporary cooling sensation but really doesn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of my White Elephant gift for my corporate holiday party.  I paired this up with how to poo at work and depends - HUGE hit!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband, he asked for the product w/o calamine and that is what I ordered. I received a bottle w/ calamine so my husband was disappointed in that. He has only tried it twice, but thinks it may be helping. We really don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
            <li> It smells good and helped get rid if the rash from my son&#x27;s soccer shinpads. Order came on time as well</li>
            <li> Great stuff and doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as other brands on the market.. Basically this stuff just smells like regular baby powder. With such a subtle smell this makes me want to wear this product out in public where I would hate wearing goldbond powder due to its unmistakable smell! This powder last all day and really helps with all kinds of chafing (Meaning you don&#x27;t have to just use it on your butt ;-) lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pick it up here on Amazon or DSE website itself PLUS I have seen it in my local Wal*Mart (Foot Health Section), my local CVS, and even hardware stores.. It&#x27;s also a great conversation starter when guest see it in the bathroom! Not nearly as embarrassing as goldbond powder..</li>
            <li> Last minute gag gift sent to 15 individuals.  All orders arrived by the promised date, packed perfectly, with enclosed greeting card.  A++++++</li>
            <li> The company sent us a product not in the picture, it was Monkey Butt for Babies, not Anti friction.We returned it and got our money back.  So I just searched for it again, and clicked on another product sold by the same seller, but after ordering that one, the true anti friction powder came. My husband used this a couple years ago and raves about it, he works at a hospital and has to wear scrubs all the time and this has helped him a lot</li>
            <li> What can I say... I know the product works</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your but will like it. No smell or order. Just try one can you will like it.</li>
            <li> I have found AMB powder very effective for my problem.  I think the calamine in the powder is the key ingredient.</li>
            <li> Best powder I&#x27;ve used, much better than baby powder. I have bought 2 more. Definitely a good buy. Need to sell more of there products</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have a nice scent like the one for babies.  It does not.  I intended to use the product as a body powder to soak up excess perspiration but due to the funny odor, it&#x27;s not well suited for that.  The odor seems to smell like dirt, earthy and damp.  Given that the product states that it can be used in areas other than your butt, you would expect it to smell nice.</li>
            <li> Sticker on bottle: part of a set,do not sell separate. Rip off.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for me. I rode my M/C 1000 miles in 3 days, b/n 7 and 10 hours each day.</li>
            <li> gold bond is much more effective.  this stuff is like putting corn starch down your underpants.</li>
            <li> just wish it didn&#x27;t have such a disgusting name &amp; cartoony label.  I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to see this in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> My son in law works in construction work...He really likes this product...for his Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> As funny as the name is, this is a super product.  It works where other powders and such have failed.</li>
            <li> The product that came is for babies....anti monkey butt for diaper rash; not for grown ups, which is what I hoped would ship, as shown in the photo</li>
            <li> I am so clean and dry it&#x27;s like a crotch desert down there. Swamp pants be gone! Thank&#x27;s Anti-Monkey Butt!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, he thought I was ot of my mind...So when it came and he used it he loved it..</li>
            <li> A couple years ago, I received this product as a gift. I really liked it. After I used it all, I couldn&#x27;t find a store that carried it. So I was very happy when I found it on Amazon. Not only do I like the product, but I love the name.</li>
            <li> good stuff and the price is right an amazing discovery.  will buy it again  keeps the skin healthy no rashes</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great and has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It works, it really works!  Other than the fact that powder is a pain to use, this powder absolutely reduces moisture and itching in those &amp;#34;unmentionable&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> Really does the job when you are doing water games for recreation.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful powder! Keeps you dry and smelling nice! Works well with heat rash and jock itch alike! Awesome stuff!</li>
