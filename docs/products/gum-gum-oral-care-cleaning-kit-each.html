    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This kit Works just perfect.</li>
            <li>Best mirror I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>It is very good for illuminating my mouth</li>
            <li>This Gum Gum Oral Care Cleaning Kit is a very good kit.</li>
            <li>But, even with that, these work great for me.</li>
            <li>What a great kit.</li>
            <li>The mirror, which didn&#x27;t steam up, was successful in locating it for removal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good substitute though.  </li>
            <li>This means the manufacture&#x27;s profit margin has been improved by making the product cheaper and not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li>Both thought it was a good item.  </li>
            <li>Good addition to a reagular hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a good tool.</li>
            <li>this is a great item, helps me see things better.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the effectiveness of the scaler.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing set.  </li>
            <li>The light works great on the mirror.</li>
            <li>The lighted mirror came with a battery already in it, which was nice.</li>
            <li>The light is very effective.</li>
            <li>Handy and effective tools for keeping teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Though I use a rubber tipped tool (not included in this kit) for cleaning the site, the mirror allows me to view the site easily and effectively.</li>
            <li>I have had many scalers over the years and this is the poorest quality I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I should have know better.</li>
            <li>I can see my teeth better with the Dentek.  </li>
            <li>Also, Dentek scaler does a better job at scraping the tooth.  </li>
            <li>but if you can&#x27;t find, this is MUCH better than the Rite-Aid brand I tried.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work as promised and the LED light is really handy.  </li>
            <li>Glad I ordered it and think it will be helpful..</li>
            <li>The dentist said he wished more people would buy and use these.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the mirror and explorer tool, would be better if had 3 scaler picks instead.</li>
            <li>Love that it takes an AAA battery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok set.</li>
            <li>I do floss every night, and use a fluoride rinse most days, and a prescription anti-bacterial rinse about twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I love it and can see everything in my mouth now.</li>
            <li>Others have been able to remove hardened tartar, I have yet been able too.</li>
            <li>The scaler is excellent for cleaning off the outside surface of teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing to have at home, specially for clean up parts of you</li>
            <li>Better deal - - - easy and inexpensive to replace.</li>
            <li>This is something that really helps me feel good about my teeth between dentist visits.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to scrape off the plaque myself and feel squeaky clean after each use.</li>
            <li>The lighted mirror allows for easy viewing (vs. trying a flashlight) for dental cleaning purposes.  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to use the tools</li>
            <li>Grips make it easy to hold and use the instruments.</li>
            <li>This item was just as I needed and came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>With the tool, I got all the hardened tartar off my teeth fairly easily.</li>
            <li>the pick and mirror works fine.</li>
            <li>Maybe about 2/3 as much light.</li>
            <li>The set is functional, but cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>the mirror with light is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was looking for a mirror with a light</li>
            <li>the build in light makes cleaning a snap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seems a bit cheap, but I&#x27;ve had no problems from using it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, my dental hygentist will not have a fit that I am doing this at home.  </li>
            <li>I got this kit for the mirror with the combination LED light built into it.</li>
            <li>The performance of the light is just pitiful.</li>
            <li>The mirror provides useful lighting where you need it, although getting used to working backward is interesting.</li>
            <li>The lighted mirror wand is great, does aid immensely in seeing inside your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Gum health is important to me and, with a hereditary tendency to gingivitis, I need special care.</li>
            <li>The handles are covered in soft material of some kind - easy to hold and non-slip.</li>
            <li>good quality overall.</li>
            <li>Purchased for the lighted mirror, which is adequate.  </li>
            <li>Holding the light in my mouth, I can barely see more than</li>
            <li>The scaler pick worked, I was so surprised I was able to get all tartar from bottom teeth inside of mouth.</li>
            <li>The battery artived oxidized, and had to be changed right away.</li>
            <li>The light source could not be adjusted and was out of alignment with the mirror, so it barely cast any light on the teeth mirrored.</li>
            <li>The light on the mirror is a clever touch ......</li>
            <li>I had a similar kit from DenTek which worked fine until the light went out on the mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this mirror, I&#x27;ve never truly been able to see all the way in the back of my mouth, just took my dentist&#x27;s word on what they saw but with this light (and seriously why aren&#x27;t there more with lights out there?)</li>
            <li>new one by Gum uses regular AAA batteries, and the handle is a much better fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>Mirror is ok, but all the mirrors in these kits are about the same.  </li>
            <li>Your mirror has a clear headpiece and the light is bluish.  </li>
            <li>I mainly bought the kit for the mirror, and that works adequately for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>This one takes a  AAA battery which is good, but not nearly as much light output.</li>
            <li>The tarter scraper has a flat edge and worked better for me on the inside edges of my teeth where I couldn&#x27;t get the scaler.</li>
            <li>Pros&lt;br /&gt;light is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;Grip</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with a dental mirror with an on/off button for the light, and two different dental cleaner/scrapers.</li>
            <li>They are very reliable and are sturdy.</li>
            <li>I added this set to a 6\\&quot;, double-ended, stainless scraper.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t flimsy really, there is an intentional give in the neck of the tool - added release for safety (is my guess).</li>
            <li>I do have all my natural teeth (knock on wood!), but a lot of crowns and large fillings, which tend to get cracks and chips through the years.  </li>
            <li>I already have an older model that takes the LR936 batteries.</li>
            <li>I just showed the older one to my dental hygienist and dentist.  </li>
            <li>so I could get a better view in tight places.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The scraper and pick are also high quality steel and plastic.</li>
            <li>I was able to scrape a little plaque off to get me through until my 6 month cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I think I like this one a little more because of the size and the grip.  </li>
            <li>This was ordered for my daughter who struggles with poor enamel so being ale to keep on top of it even more was essential.</li>
            <li>Another new and improved product.</li>
            <li>The new one uses a AAA battery.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like my back teeth are so much cleaner</li>
            <li>It does the cleaning job in a very professional way.</li>
            <li>First I had to spend a fortune for those tiny little flat batteries, and while the light came back on, it flickered like a strobe light - useless!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Wonder how long the light will last, don&#x27;t think the description gave any info.</li>
            <li>I use the little lighted mirror in front of a magnifying stand mirror that I keep on my bathroom counter - works fine for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars if the handles were just a little more solid.</li>
            <li>The lighted mirror makes it easy to see the back teeth and those other hard-to-see spots.</li>
            <li>The old one used hearing aid batteries.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as an add-on item because I had misplaced a free mirror a dentist had given me years ago.  </li>
            <li>As warned, these tools are very sharp and special care is needed to prevent injury or damage to your gums.</li>
            <li>The pick may be useful, but it isn&#x27;t terribly sharp either.</li>
            <li>I am not ever likely to use the scraper, since my teeth are extremely sensitive, and I&#x27;d rather let a professional do the cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Metal part of scaler is too thick and metal is so cheap it bends like it is going to break while using it.  </li>
            <li>This item replaces a previous purchase where it required some odd looking batteries for the light  use.  </li>

            <li> This item replaces a previous purchase where it required some odd looking batteries for the light  use.  </li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an older one I&#x27;ve used for several years but now does not light up reliably.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other tools due to the fact my teeth are very sensitive and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing probably make things wrost</li>
            <li> When I got these in and used them for the first time, immediately, the finish started flaking off, They are bendy, poorly shaped, and practically trash.</li>
            <li> The tiny pick can get everywhere, even with my extremely tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I will keep using my little flashlight instead, as that actually WORKS.</li>
            <li> does what I expected to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> i bought one several years ago and misplaced it, this one is updated.</li>
            <li> It appears to simply be cut from a 1/8&amp;#34; thick sheet of metal with no further attention given to it.  </li>
            <li> have not used other brands, so no comparison there</li>
            <li> he prefers the power and control of placing sharp instruments in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be very careful, though.</li>
            <li> So I really love this set and it does take care of that annoying plaque.</li>
            <li> My previous one came to a point</li>
            <li> If my little flashlight output around 300 lumens, then this lighted mirror outputs around 12 lumens, if that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star</li>
            <li> They feel a little flexible and that presents a bit of a challenge when applying pressure.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> The probe would only be used when I do feel as though I have broken off another piece of something (groan).  </li>
            <li> Sorry, GUM but Dentek has you beat with their similar product.  </li>
            <li> works for me removing some hardened plaque, but my dentist is not pleased that i use these implements of destruction.  </li>
            <li> I get very heavy plaque build up on my front teeth.  </li>
            <li> Or the large filling stays intact, but part of the tooth around it breaks off :( .  </li>
            <li> Those tools were dull and rusted!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though, I am one of those crazy people who actually like to get their teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I had no interest in the rest of the tools that came with this package, just the lighted mirror, and that was a MASSIVE disappointment.</li>
            <li> It is to thick to be of any use whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at that as it is the Christmas season and might have been slow.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my little hand-held flashlight I have been using, this thing is pathetic, and I threw it away.  </li>
            <li> The tools reach around and behind and get into the crevices my toothbrush seems to miss.</li>
            <li> The tartar scraper is essentially useless as it is too thick and has not been sharpened at all.  </li>
            <li> The mirror+light combo was ... disappointing, to say the least.</li>
            <li> It is useless for scraping the inside part of my teeth do to the angle of the scrapper or my teeth.</li>
            <li> It drives me CRAZY.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the tooth scraper.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with the mirror, and the dental tools are an added bonus.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing to have at home, specially for clean up parts of you teeth where brush can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I have had many scalers over the years and this is the poorest quality I have ever had.  Metal part of scaler is too thick and metal is so cheap it bends like it is going to break while using it.  Mirror is ok, but all the mirrors in these kits are about the same.  Needless to say I am now looking for a better scaler to buy.  I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> This item replaces a previous purchase where it required some odd looking batteries for the light  use.  The provider was prompt on service.  The packaging was 5 star. Yes, I&#x27;d recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The lighted mirror, the reason I bought the Cleaning Kit, did not work well at all.  The light source could not be adjusted and was out of alignment with the mirror, so it barely cast any light on the teeth mirrored. I should have know better.</li>
            <li> Sorry, GUM but Dentek has you beat with their similar product.  Your mirror has a clear headpiece and the light is bluish.  I can see my teeth better with the Dentek.  Also, Dentek scaler does a better job at scraping the tooth.  Tools are flimsy, as it seemed like it was bending as I was trying to scale my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good substitute though.  i recommed Dentek but if you can&#x27;t find, this is MUCH better than the Rite-Aid brand I tried.  Those tools were dull and rusted!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentek, #1, Gum is a close #2.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;light is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;Grip is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;mirror magnification is not good.&lt;br /&gt;the diameter can be made bigger</li>
            <li> Another new and improved product. This means the manufacture&#x27;s profit margin has been improved by making the product cheaper and not as good as they used to be. I already have an older model that takes the LR936 batteries. Had to order batteries from Amazon so also ordered this product in the process. This one takes a  AAA battery which is good, but not nearly as much light output. Maybe about 2/3 as much light. Will look for another brand dental mirror in future.</li>
            <li> The set is functional, but cheaply made.  The battery artived oxidized, and had to be changed right away.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as promised and the LED light is really handy.  Glad I ordered it and think it will be helpful..</li>
            <li> I really feel like my back teeth are so much cleaner since I got this kit. The tools reach around and behind and get into the crevices my toothbrush seems to miss. I&#x27;m able to scrape off the plaque myself and feel squeaky clean after each use. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> good quality overall. the mirror with light is great.&lt;br /&gt;It does what I expected to.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used other brands, so no comparison there</li>
            <li> Bought this cause of the lighted mirror and it works very well. I don&#x27;t use the other tools due to the fact my teeth are very sensitive and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing probably make things wrost</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an older one I&#x27;ve used for several years but now does not light up reliably.  It is very good for illuminating my mouth so I can keep it cleaner.  I just showed the older one to my dental hygienist and dentist.  Both thought it was a good item.  The dentist said he wished more people would buy and use these.  The old one used hearing aid batteries.  The new one uses a AAA battery.  Better deal - - - easy and inexpensive to replace.</li>
            <li> Handy and effective tools for keeping teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The scaler pick worked, I was so surprised I was able to get all tartar from bottom teeth inside of mouth. I did not use the mirror and explorer tool, would be better if had 3 scaler picks instead.</li>
            <li> works for me removing some hardened plaque, but my dentist is not pleased that i use these implements of destruction.  he prefers the power and control of placing sharp instruments in my mouth.</li>
            <li> After recent dental surgery, I needed to keep close watch on the site, and keep the area well cleaned.  The lighted mirror allows for easy viewing (vs. trying a flashlight) for dental cleaning purposes.  Though I use a rubber tipped tool (not included in this kit) for cleaning the site, the mirror allows me to view the site easily and effectively.</li>
            <li> The kit comes with a dental mirror with an on/off button for the light, and two different dental cleaner/scrapers. The handles are covered in soft material of some kind - easy to hold and non-slip. I find it easy to use the tools and I like the mirror a lot.</li>
            <li> Love that it takes an AAA battery. Was looking for a mirror with a light so I could get a better view in tight places. I&#x27;m using it as a tool, not an oral care product.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my daughter who struggles with poor enamel so being ale to keep on top of it even more was essential. The light on the mirror is a clever touch ......</li>
            <li> This is a kit that everyone should have at home&lt;br /&gt;the mirror does not fog, when enters your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;with the build in light makes cleaning a snap.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Gum Gum Oral Care Cleaning Kit is a very good kit. I use them several times daily. They are very reliable and are sturdy. I would recommend them and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> It does the cleaning job in a very professional way. This kit Works just perfect. As if I had visited the dentist without the charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok set. Seems a bit cheap, but I&#x27;ve had no problems from using it. Good addition to a reagular hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> Well made. The mirror is not cheap plastic. Grips make it easy to hold and use the instruments. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with a piece of aluminum foil that was lodged in a molar.  Almost every day I was getting a taste of aluminum.  The mirror, which didn&#x27;t steam up, was successful in locating it for removal.</li>
            <li> Purchased for the lighted mirror, which is adequate.  The tartar scraper is essentially useless as it is too thick and has not been sharpened at all.  It appears to simply be cut from a 1/8&amp;#34; thick sheet of metal with no further attention given to it.  It is to thick to be of any use whatsoever.  The pick may be useful, but it isn&#x27;t terribly sharp either.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an add-on item because I had misplaced a free mirror a dentist had given me years ago.  I mainly bought the kit for the mirror, and that works adequately for my purposes.  I do have all my natural teeth (knock on wood!), but a lot of crowns and large fillings, which tend to get cracks and chips through the years.  Or the large filling stays intact, but part of the tooth around it breaks off :( .  I use the little lighted mirror in front of a magnifying stand mirror that I keep on my bathroom counter - works fine for my purposes.  I am not ever likely to use the scraper, since my teeth are extremely sensitive, and I&#x27;d rather let a professional do the cleaning.  The probe would only be used when I do feel as though I have broken off another piece of something (groan).  I do floss every night, and use a fluoride rinse most days, and a prescription anti-bacterial rinse about twice a week.  I have never had gum problems.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Does the job. Wonder how long the light will last, don&#x27;t think the description gave any info. On that.</li>
            <li> This item was just as I needed and came very quickly.  I&#x27;m amazed at that as it is the Christmas season and might have been slow.  I love it and can see everything in my mouth now.</li>
            <li> The scaler and explorer work as intended. I haven&#x27;t used the mirror yet but I assume its just as advertised. I&#x27;m still hesitant when using the instruments in my mouth but I&#x27;ll get the hang of them after a while. Others have been able to remove hardened tartar, I have yet been able too. Five stars.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing set.  I get very heavy plaque build up on my front teeth.  I can actually feel the plaque with my tongue.  It drives me CRAZY.  I was able to scrape a little plaque off to get me through until my 6 month cleaning.  Hopefully, my dental hygentist will not have a fit that I am doing this at home.  I like the lighted mirror and the grips.  I also bought the Dentek Daily Pick.  I think I like this one a little more because of the size and the grip.  FYI though, I am one of those crazy people who actually like to get their teeth cleaned.  So I really love this set and it does take care of that annoying plaque.</li>
            <li> I got this kit for the mirror with the combination LED light built into it. The mirror+light combo was ... disappointing, to say the least. The performance of the light is just pitiful. Holding the light in my mouth, I can barely see more than if I just tilt my head so the bathroom lights shine in. Compared to my little hand-held flashlight I have been using, this thing is pathetic, and I threw it away.  I had no interest in the rest of the tools that came with this package, just the lighted mirror, and that was a MASSIVE disappointment. I will keep using my little flashlight instead, as that actually WORKS. If my little flashlight output around 300 lumens, then this lighted mirror outputs around 12 lumens, if that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star</li>
            <li> I had a similar kit from DenTek which worked fine until the light went out on the mirror. First I had to spend a fortune for those tiny little flat batteries, and while the light came back on, it flickered like a strobe light - useless!&lt;br /&gt;The new one by Gum uses regular AAA batteries, and the handle is a much better fit in my hand. The scraper and pick are also high quality steel and plastic.</li>
            <li> this is a great item, helps me see things better.  i bought one several years ago and misplaced it, this one is updated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars if the handles were just a little more solid. They feel a little flexible and that presents a bit of a challenge when applying pressure. But, even with that, these work great for me. Gum health is important to me and, with a hereditary tendency to gingivitis, I need special care. The tiny pick can get everywhere, even with my extremely tight teeth. The mirror provides useful lighting where you need it, although getting used to working backward is interesting. I was very pleased with the effectiveness of the scaler. I added this set to a 6\\&quot;, double-ended, stainless scraper. The scaler is excellent for cleaning off the outside surface of teeth. The tarter scraper has a flat edge and worked better for me on the inside edges of my teeth where I couldn&#x27;t get the scaler. With all these tools, I feel like I can keep my teeth to an acceptable level between visits to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be very careful, though. As warned, these tools are very sharp and special care is needed to prevent injury or damage to your gums.</li>
            <li> The lighted mirror wand is great, does aid immensely in seeing inside your mouth.  The two dental picks that come with this kit, however, are flimsy, and I frankly threw them out.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the tooth scraper. My previous one came to a point and I could scrape betwen the teeth but this one has a rounded end. It is useless for scraping the inside part of my teeth do to the angle of the scrapper or my teeth. the pick and mirror works fine.</li>
            <li> This is something that really helps me feel good about my teeth between dentist visits.  The light is very effective.</li>
            <li> The lighted mirror came with a battery already in it, which was nice. With the tool, I got all the hardened tartar off my teeth fairly easily.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for dental care.  The lighted mirror makes it easy to see the back teeth and those other hard-to-see spots.</li>
            <li> When I got these in and used them for the first time, immediately, the finish started flaking off, They are bendy, poorly shaped, and practically trash. in fact, the trash is where I put them.</li>
            <li> What a great kit. The light works great on the mirror. Best mirror I&#x27;ve ever had.  Yep. This is a good tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this mirror, I&#x27;ve never truly been able to see all the way in the back of my mouth, just took my dentist&#x27;s word on what they saw but with this light (and seriously why aren&#x27;t there more with lights out there?) you can see it all.  You will not be disappointed with the mirror, and the dental tools are an added bonus.  I see why another customer called them flimsy...they aren&#x27;t flimsy really, there is an intentional give in the neck of the tool - added release for safety (is my guess).</li>
