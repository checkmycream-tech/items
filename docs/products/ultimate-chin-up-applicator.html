            <li>My feels and looks like a teenager&#x27;s again and my confidence is way up, its amazing.</li>

            <li>My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, my package arrived within 2 days and I&#x27;m so thrilled about that.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest</li>
            <li>so I can kind of creat a from wrap with it.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of a wrap and how a body wrap works</li>
            <li>has a nice firming effect</li>
            <li>Honestly I would give ZERO stars if I could....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for those who did have significant improvement</li>
            <li>The Chin ups are very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The applicator was very easy to remove without any pain.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use just apply it to the chin and leave on for 45-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of goofy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited that I got the opportunity to test this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li>So, to my surprise it has worked for me; and I feel significantly better about the way I look now.</li>
            <li>This product worked okay, but the name it was advertised under made it seem like it was a diff product.</li>
            <li>But still is a great product and much cheaper than surgery.</li>
            <li>Probably better off looking into the chin exercises you can find online.</li>
            <li>Drinking lots of water and healthy habits helps a lot more.</li>
            <li>maybe to make sure the product count was inside</li>
            <li>Yep, I&#x27;ve studied this face for many years and have done a lot of observing of others too.  :-)</li>
            <li>and hopefully my skin even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat pleased with this product but wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to spend anymore on it than I</li>

            <li>Really enjoyed the feeling</li>
            <li>For the price of almost 30 dollars I thought I would get more out of the product.</li>
            <li>and I am assuming the more</li>
            <li>the better the results.</li>
            <li>Best solution for double chin .&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love it!üòç</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but this is perfect for lots of occasions such as before taking pictures.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will know more when I apply one more time.</li>
            <li>Very unique product.</li>
            <li>Good ,but unfortunately not permanent results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller, fast shipping and awesome product.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t good for me.i like another product that works for me but thanks for asking</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, easy to apply, and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my results and with more than one application</li>
            <li>I use it when I need to look my best, lasts for few days for sure.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>First off all this product smells amazing &amp; does wonders for my chin.</li>
            <li>Once I first applied the chin up wrap the cooling feeling was so nice.</li>
            <li>I have had no bad side effects from using this which is great because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>more hype than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not these actually work lol.  </li>
            <li>Gave it a shot for fun :)</li>
            <li>this is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I used it only 2 times and am happy with the result ..</li>
            <li>Its super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Just got these haven&#x27;t use it yet but excited to see what they do</li>
            <li>I did not see a significant change in the chin line</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product, I wrote a really good review about it because it actually worked.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t so special</li>
            <li>If it was cheaper I would say great, because it&#x27;s really not uncomfortable to have it on for an hour,but I personally cannot afford to go through two patches a week!!!!</li>
            <li>She immediately felt a cool and tingling sensation as the applicator tightened up.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Just good and simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>works but the results fade quickly</li>
            <li>Recommended for quick fix.</li>
            <li>a more lengthy chin/jaw tends to develop fat beneath in that area even when the rest of the face appears normal.</li>
            <li>The very first application, I saw a softening of creepiness under my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to sit and hold it in place each time for the whole duration (which was an hour) per use !!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice - not strong or sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item very much works after just the first application also its amazing by far.</li>
            <li>This is a great application for my fatty chin.</li>
            <li>Product was received complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>a first time I find something help full</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try out these types of wraps without having to pay a higher price or sign up for a &#x27;loyal member&amp;#34; to get a discounted price</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m wearing it right now and it wings up around my lower face and jawline.</li>
            <li>but I could feel and see the difference right away.</li>
            <li>It stayed cool for the whole hour</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the look is much better as the skin looks thicker and no so wrinkly and generally looks healthier and my friends have commented that they can see the change in my skin areas</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SUPER FAST ..</li>
            <li>its much larger than i expected...smells good and has natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Honestly, often the results don&#x27;t look as good as i would expect and plus, most of the time with chin lipo pictures, there&#x27;s been a small chin implant inserted so it makes the skin tighter - this they usually don&#x27;t mention in the pictures!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product says you can notice a immediate difference first time use I find this to be untrue.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference after the first use, and it lasted about 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>Love it will definitely recommend &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not sticking as well as it did with the first one.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m back, wore it for 55 mins and it does work.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works more so for saggy skin then double chin?</li>
            <li>I noticed the key is to make sure you have it on correctly the first time</li>
            <li>I would probably not order more of these unless I see additional improvement with the last 3 wraps.</li>
            <li>noticable difference after first application.  </li>
            <li>After my first use i could see a difference immediately.</li>
            <li>under the chin looks more tighten and younger.</li>
            <li>Helped me out so much!</li>
            <li>tightening from first wrap .</li>
            <li>I think I may have had mine a bit close to my throat on my first use.</li>
            <li>All doubts I had about this product were gone after my first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive &amp; I feel like I&#x27;m in the spa for much affordable price .</li>
            <li>There are easy to follow instructions that are located on the box and on each individual package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and feels like a facial almost for your neck.</li>
            <li>Overall it does work, easy to apply/remove, &amp; I can notice a difference after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for inspection purposes.</li>
            <li>The wrap was way too large and it did nothing.</li>
            <li>So far I have definitely felt and noticed my skin was tighter,felt more toned, &amp; lifted in my chin area after the first application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much of a chin</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but there was some tightening noted.</li>
            <li>but when I stood straight up it went away.</li>
            <li>Very overweight people tend to get a much thicker neck and the chin fills out</li>
            <li>I guess it really depends on your skin and etc</li>
            <li>the very fist application, i saw a softening of crepiness under my chin.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you use the real thing.</li>
            <li>The product really makes a difference in terms of texture and appearance.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in terms of texture and appearance.</li>
            <li>Used the whole box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than other products on the market .</li>
            <li>I have a stubborn double chin &amp; right after first use</li>
            <li>In fact it might feel better if I just laid down for another 20 mins, relax and allow this thing to do what it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li>Older Review</li>
            <li>Maybe if you are older and you want to tighten your skin, this would work if you used it twice a week forever.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product to anyone who is wanting to vamp up their face.</li>
            <li>This is probably my 3rd purchase from this seller, which pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>This is probably my 3rd purchase on this product, which pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>This would definitely work for someone with more loose skin hanging.</li>
            <li>choose the rating because it is huge, won&#x27;t stay in place, and I did not see any results do not recommend would rather use other product for the price</li>
            <li>I kept the Chin up patch on for 3 hours (no so comfortable ), But  it works ,My pesky double chin looks smaller and lifted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any tightening or firming of skin; however, my skin was very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I still have my double chin ;-)</li>
            <li>when I took it off it was pretty red for an hr or so</li>
            <li>I have only worn them twice, but they seem to stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li>Plus it was pretty clear my box had been open..</li>
            <li>Recent Update after finishing full box: Overall I did notice a difference after applying the product but as someone stated it was after wearing it overnight.</li>
            <li>As per the directions I, tried to &#x27;pull back sides of my skin, only, my skin is fairly taut so its hard to do.</li>
            <li>I have only used one so far... but it did not do anything really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten her a second package for mothers day, as she loves them so much</li>
            <li>Feels like a really soft bandaid.  </li>
            <li>You could really see a difference in her double chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I am liking it.</li>
            <li>It has always made me self conscious</li>
            <li>&#x27;s not disappear completely .but</li>
            <li>so far I feel my skin is staying taut than before.</li>
            <li>It definitely feels as if it&#x27;s firming and tightening very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used my second CHIN UP and this time, had more trouble removing the form from its adhesive.</li>
            <li>I have done 3 wraps thus far and cannot see any change... sounded too good to be true :(</li>
            <li>In the mean time I&#x27;ve taken an ACE bandage and wrapped over the wrap and tied up top my head just for added support.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful to wear, some might find it a little bothersome.</li>
            <li>My chin is much less saggy and my self esteem is much higher because of this product!</li>
            <li>More than likely I would probably not reorder it because of the price and how slow it takes to build up noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>Although, I don&#x27;t have any major neck concerns, but I wanted to try it as a prevention product.</li>
            <li>you have only a small double chin, I have no reason to think it wouldn&#x27;t work a bit better for you.</li>
            <li>I was very careful to do exactly as it said.  </li>
            <li>but i dont think after 5 &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; it made much of a difference other than make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had it on for just over 15 mins and am starting to feel a tingling and tightening sensation.</li>
            <li>The length definitely helps keep that area of your chin lifted and toned which surprised me.</li>
            <li>But other than that, this stuff really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>so I was interested in trying this out for toning up &amp; keeping things tight in that area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a double chin starting in my early teens.</li>
            <li>The chin applicator is a simple strip which was much longer than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>wraps .It was a little hard to keep it on my under chin :)</li>

            <li> I will know more when I apply one more time.</li>
            <li> Very unique product.</li>
            <li> Good ,but unfortunately not permanent results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller, fast shipping and awesome product.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t good for me.i like another product that works for me but thanks for asking</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, easy to apply, and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my results and with more than one application</li>
            <li> I use it when I need to look my best, lasts for few days for sure.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> First off all this product smells amazing &amp; does wonders for my chin.</li>
            <li> Once I first applied the chin up wrap the cooling feeling was so nice.</li>
            <li> I have had no bad side effects from using this which is great because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> more hype than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not these actually work lol.  </li>
            <li> Gave it a shot for fun :)</li>
            <li> this is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I used it only 2 times and am happy with the result ..</li>
            <li> Its super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Just got these haven&#x27;t use it yet but excited to see what they do</li>
            <li> I did not see a significant change in the chin line</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product, I wrote a really good review about it because it actually worked.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so special</li>
            <li> If it was cheaper I would say great, because it&#x27;s really not uncomfortable to have it on for an hour,but I personally cannot afford to go through two patches a week!!!!</li>
            <li> She immediately felt a cool and tingling sensation as the applicator tightened up.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> Just good and simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> works but the results fade quickly</li>
            <li> Recommended for quick fix.</li>
            <li> a more lengthy chin/jaw tends to develop fat beneath in that area even when the rest of the face appears normal.</li>
            <li> The very first application, I saw a softening of creepiness under my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to sit and hold it in place each time for the whole duration (which was an hour) per use !!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nice - not strong or sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item very much works after just the first application also its amazing by far.</li>
            <li> This is a great application for my fatty chin.</li>
            <li> Product was received complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> a first time I find something help full</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try out these types of wraps without having to pay a higher price or sign up for a &#x27;loyal member&amp;#34; to get a discounted price</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m wearing it right now and it wings up around my lower face and jawline.</li>
            <li> but I could feel and see the difference right away.</li>
            <li> It stayed cool for the whole hour</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the look is much better as the skin looks thicker and no so wrinkly and generally looks healthier and my friends have commented that they can see the change in my skin areas</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s SUPER FAST ..</li>
            <li> its much larger than i expected...smells good and has natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Honestly, often the results don&#x27;t look as good as i would expect and plus, most of the time with chin lipo pictures, there&#x27;s been a small chin implant inserted so it makes the skin tighter - this they usually don&#x27;t mention in the pictures!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product says you can notice a immediate difference first time use I find this to be untrue.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after the first use, and it lasted about 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> Love it will definitely recommend &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not sticking as well as it did with the first one.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m back, wore it for 55 mins and it does work.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works more so for saggy skin then double chin?</li>
            <li> I noticed the key is to make sure you have it on correctly the first time</li>
            <li> I would probably not order more of these unless I see additional improvement with the last 3 wraps.</li>
            <li> noticable difference after first application.  </li>
            <li> After my first use i could see a difference immediately.</li>
            <li> under the chin looks more tighten and younger.</li>
            <li> Helped me out so much!</li>
            <li> tightening from first wrap .</li>
            <li> I think I may have had mine a bit close to my throat on my first use.</li>
            <li> All doubts I had about this product were gone after my first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive &amp; I feel like I&#x27;m in the spa for much affordable price .</li>
            <li> There are easy to follow instructions that are located on the box and on each individual package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and feels like a facial almost for your neck.</li>
            <li> Overall it does work, easy to apply/remove, &amp; I can notice a difference after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for inspection purposes.</li>
            <li> The wrap was way too large and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> So far I have definitely felt and noticed my skin was tighter,felt more toned, &amp; lifted in my chin area after the first application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much of a chin</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but there was some tightening noted.</li>
            <li> but when I stood straight up it went away.</li>
            <li> Very overweight people tend to get a much thicker neck and the chin fills out</li>
            <li> I guess it really depends on your skin and etc</li>
            <li> the very fist application, i saw a softening of crepiness under my chin.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you use the real thing.</li>
            <li> The product really makes a difference in terms of texture and appearance.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in terms of texture and appearance.</li>
            <li> Used the whole box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than other products on the market .</li>
            <li> I have a stubborn double chin &amp; right after first use</li>
            <li> In fact it might feel better if I just laid down for another 20 mins, relax and allow this thing to do what it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li> Older Review</li>
            <li> Maybe if you are older and you want to tighten your skin, this would work if you used it twice a week forever.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product to anyone who is wanting to vamp up their face.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 3rd purchase from this seller, which pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 3rd purchase on this product, which pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> This would definitely work for someone with more loose skin hanging.</li>
            <li> choose the rating because it is huge, won&#x27;t stay in place, and I did not see any results do not recommend would rather use other product for the price</li>
            <li> I kept the Chin up patch on for 3 hours (no so comfortable ), But  it works ,My pesky double chin looks smaller and lifted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any tightening or firming of skin; however, my skin was very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I still have my double chin ;-)</li>
            <li> when I took it off it was pretty red for an hr or so</li>
            <li> I have only worn them twice, but they seem to stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Plus it was pretty clear my box had been open..</li>
            <li> Recent Update after finishing full box: Overall I did notice a difference after applying the product but as someone stated it was after wearing it overnight.</li>
            <li> As per the directions I, tried to &#x27;pull back sides of my skin, only, my skin is fairly taut so its hard to do.</li>
            <li> I have only used one so far... but it did not do anything really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten her a second package for mothers day, as she loves them so much</li>
            <li> Feels like a really soft bandaid.  </li>
            <li> You could really see a difference in her double chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I am liking it.</li>
            <li> It has always made me self conscious</li>
            <li> &#x27;s not disappear completely .but</li>
            <li> so far I feel my skin is staying taut than before.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels as if it&#x27;s firming and tightening very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used my second CHIN UP and this time, had more trouble removing the form from its adhesive.</li>
            <li> I have done 3 wraps thus far and cannot see any change... sounded too good to be true :(</li>
            <li> In the mean time I&#x27;ve taken an ACE bandage and wrapped over the wrap and tied up top my head just for added support.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful to wear, some might find it a little bothersome.</li>
            <li> My chin is much less saggy and my self esteem is much higher because of this product!</li>
            <li> More than likely I would probably not reorder it because of the price and how slow it takes to build up noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Although, I don&#x27;t have any major neck concerns, but I wanted to try it as a prevention product.</li>
            <li> you have only a small double chin, I have no reason to think it wouldn&#x27;t work a bit better for you.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to do exactly as it said.  </li>
            <li> but i dont think after 5 &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; it made much of a difference other than make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it on for just over 15 mins and am starting to feel a tingling and tightening sensation.</li>
            <li> The length definitely helps keep that area of your chin lifted and toned which surprised me.</li>
            <li> But other than that, this stuff really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> so I was interested in trying this out for toning up &amp; keeping things tight in that area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a double chin starting in my early teens.</li>
            <li> The chin applicator is a simple strip which was much longer than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> wraps .It was a little hard to keep it on my under chin :)</li>
            <li> So I was slightly confused but quickly realized there is a white opaque sticky tape that runs on one side of the form</li>
            <li> She said the results last for a few days and when her neck starts hanging again she puts one on to firm it right back up.</li>
            <li> Cant now how long the result will stay,but will definitely use this product.</li>
            <li> My fat pad has stretched the skin below my jawline and my double chin droops like a bubble from the front of my chin to where my neck begins.</li>
            <li> The patch is a bit larger than expected.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to work with and get it under the chin and to stay, but any troubles getting it on are worth it.  </li>
            <li> I washed my face, patted dry, and applied the patch.</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t work for fatty or double chin problems, but definitely tightened my hanging skin.</li>
            <li> I probably will repurchase to wear just for special events and etc since its kinda expensive for something not permanent.   </li>
            <li> ; long &amp; about 3&amp;#34; wide give or take.</li>
            <li> but I notice a small temporary change that lasted a few days after use of a WHOLE box.</li>
            <li> I only have a small amount of extra fat that needs to go away under my chin and have used these twice</li>
            <li> It does cover your entire chin and goes up to the bottom half of your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Once I removed it I noticed my chin was a little smaller than before.</li>
            <li> i recently had weight loss and started to notice that my neck looked a little wrinkly as i lost weight.  </li>
            <li> product is crap did nothing it works body wrap is amazing</li>
            <li> did not work at all like i would of expected it smh</li>
            <li> The product arrived quicker than expected but the product itself does not work.</li>
            <li> And after using all of them there is absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable to apply, but I can tolerate that as long as it does show the results.</li>
            <li> It works slowly, but you need to use the whole box for noticing a small difference.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they help other people.....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not exactly foil.</li>
            <li> I followed other&#x27;s reviews and wore patch overnight.</li>
            <li> It is recommended to only use the patches no more than two times a week.</li>
            <li> Was no fun at all.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the feeling around my jawline because it feels like its being pulled down.</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t stick to me, the sides kept on rolling down.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt make that big of a difference at least on me but my double chin is very small.</li>
            <li> You get 7 treatments for $20, which is such a small price for the confidence you get after just one hout!</li>
            <li> My skin was firmer and much less saggy.</li>
            <li> I never really worried about my chin, but as the years add up, my skin is just not a firm as it used to be, and I am starting to see the signs of aging, like a saggy chin :(  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately as time went on, that area was the first to show age and more weight which accumulated a substantial and awful looking fat pad beneath.</li>
            <li> : I see a little bit of improvement but nothing that noticeable</li>
            <li> I wasted time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Do I use this everyday?</li>
            <li> and I tried it a few times.</li>
            <li> The ending result: A waste of money I wish I would have just saved</li>
            <li> Wasted $30.</li>
            <li> I waste my money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> Also, my neck is short so putting it only around the neck area was impossible, if it was going to cover the fat pad/toadish chin bubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s weird is even though the skin at my jawline is tight enough, the waddle beneath it is not.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but hope it works.</li>
            <li> If you notice, some people with too small of a chin and/or</li>
            <li> I was not sure how well this would work because one I never tried a product like this and two</li>
            <li> I was not sure how well ti would work with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have unfortunately aged a lot this past year and my chin is one of my worse problems.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those who can afford an expensive surgery to fix the problem, so I look for products that will at least temporarily fix the problem, and have a lasting effect with continued use.  </li>
            <li> There was no huge difference in the before and after of my chin, but a very subtle and slight one.</li>
            <li> Did everything the directions said but it wasn&#x27;t too much or hard.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with the applicator even sticking to my skin ( I followed the directions closely).</li>
            <li> is looking less creepy and looks fuller and doesn&#x27;t look as transparent and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I noticed when I was younger is that skin beneath my jaw puffed out if my posture was bad</li>
            <li> It was a little cold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously considered lipo in that area but am too chicken about doctors (a story for another time) yet am always looking at that procedure online and viewing pics of it.</li>
            <li> wraps however are unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a go as I had creepy skin on my neck</li>
            <li> totally useless, no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try but was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> I would def buy these again despite how silly they seem!</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed..</li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed in the companies</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do nothing for me , very disappointed..</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
            <li> This not work for me :(!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite impressed after just my first application. It was easy to use, easy to apply, and easy to remove. Once I first applied the chin up wrap the cooling feeling was so nice. It stayed cool for the whole hour I had it on. Once I removed it I noticed my chin was a little smaller than before. I was a bit worried about having my skin break out or start to itch but it didn&#x27;t at all. I have had no bad side effects from using this which is great because I have sensitive skin. This would definitely work for someone with more loose skin hanging. This definitely tightens the chin up! Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my results and with more than one application you will definitely see a difference. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Product says you can notice a immediate difference first time use I find this to be untrue. I don&#x27;t really have much of a chin but I notice a small temporary change that lasted a few days after use of a WHOLE box. I like the sensation it feels like its working but product didn&#x27;t stick as well as kit should have and peeled off a lot. Last time use I had to wrap a scarf around my neck to keep it in place. May give it another try and keep something around my neck to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make that big of a difference at least on me but my double chin is very small. It just makes it FEEL tighter.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the product. It is easy to use and it has a nice minty smell. Although, I don&#x27;t have any major neck concerns, but I wanted to try it as a prevention product. After three wraps it did give some lift and firmness to the skin; it seemed to tighten just a bit. So, to my surprise it has worked for me; and I feel significantly better about the way I look now. I will buy this product again. Product was received complimentary for review purposes. My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This product worked okay, but the name it was advertised under made it seem like it was a diff product.</li>
            <li> I used this product as instructed. I wasted time and money on this product. Do not be taken in - this product does not work!</li>
            <li> Just got these haven&#x27;t use it yet but excited to see what they do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dramatically improvement but I noticed my sagging chin lifted,and visibly looks shaper.Cant now how long the result will stay,but will definitely use this product.Recommended</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product, I wrote a really good review about it because it actually worked. Then I realized that unless you use it every couple of days your double chin is back.  If it was cheaper I would say great, because it&#x27;s really not uncomfortable to have it on for an hour,but I personally cannot afford to go through two patches a week!!!!</li>
            <li> tried the entire pack and one bit of change at all. I now use the It Works Wraps and they truly do work after just 45 mins</li>
            <li> I did not see a significant change in the chin line and I do not have a lot of fat so I was very disappointed in the companies claim about its product.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a go as I had creepy skin on my neck I have been using this for  4 weeks now &amp; I am noticing the skin is looking less creepy and looks fuller and doesn&#x27;t look as transparent and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the look is much better as the skin looks thicker and no so wrinkly and generally looks healthier and my friends have commented that they can see the change in my skin areas so I am very happy with this and will keep buying it as nothing else has worked no matter what brand I had tried&lt;br /&gt;Cons ;  does not stick .</li>
            <li> Works good I would recommend this item very much works after just the first application also its amazing by far.</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money in my opinion. I only have a small amount of extra fat that needs to go away under my chin and have used these twice and they have done nothing yet. I have three left and am going to use them but I won&#x27;t buy them again. Maybe they help other people.....</li>
            <li> totally useless, no results whatsoever. used it as directed, even left it on for 6 hours once, no evidence of any change noted.</li>
            <li> I still have my double chin ;-) more hype than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I never really worried about my chin, but as the years add up, my skin is just not a firm as it used to be, and I am starting to see the signs of aging, like a saggy chin :(  I am not one of those who can afford an expensive surgery to fix the problem, so I look for products that will at least temporarily fix the problem, and have a lasting effect with continued use.  I have to say that this is one of those products!  It is a little hard to work with and get it under the chin and to stay, but any troubles getting it on are worth it.  I could tell a difference after the first use, and it lasted about 3-4 days.  So you will have to reapply every couple of days.  But still is a great product and much cheaper than surgery. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

            <li> My mom has a neck like a turkey so I thought she would be a great candidate to try these out. She is thrilled at the results! She said that after one application her neck firmed up enough that she no longer had the urge to say &amp;#34;GOBBLE GOBBLE&amp;#34; at herself in the mirror every time she passes one. She said the results last for a few days and when her neck starts hanging again she puts one on to firm it right back up. I&#x27;ve gotten her a second package for mothers day, as she loves them so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not these actually work lol.  I thought I would give it a try but was skeptical.  I used one wrap and left it on for an hour and took it off.  Its super easy to apply.  When I took it off there was a definate difference in my saggy chin!  These is not permanent as about two days later the sag was back again.  But it would be perfect for something like a night out, or a party or even if getting picutures done.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you pull it off. Feels like a really soft bandaid.  I would def buy these again despite how silly they seem!</li>
            <li> Very unique product. Really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but there was some tightening noted. It&#x27;s worth a try everyone is different.</li>
            <li> First off all this product smells amazing &amp; does wonders for my chin. I have a stubborn double chin &amp; right after first use I saw a difference . It&#x27;s not expensive &amp; I feel like I&#x27;m in the spa for much affordable price . Love it will definitely recommend &amp; the shipping it&#x27;s SUPER FAST ..</li>
            <li> The product is working well on sagging skin. It probably won&#x27;t work for fatty or double chin problems, but definitely tightened my hanging skin. Not very comfortable to apply, but I can tolerate that as long as it does show the results. I use it when I need to look my best, lasts for few days for sure.</li>
            <li> did not do anything under my face is still fat</li>
            <li> Do I use this everyday?</li>
            <li> My mother has a double chin and is always looking for ways to tighten it. When I stumbled upon the ultimate chin up applicator by body chin up I simply needed her to try it. The chin ups came in a box that contained five individual applicators. There are easy to follow instructions that are located on the box and on each individual package. The Chin ups are very easy to apply.  My mother left it on for about an hour. She immediately felt a cool and tingling sensation as the applicator tightened up. She felt a tightness under her chin. The tightness was not unbearable, it made her feel like the applicator was working. The applicator was very easy to remove without any pain. She did not experience an skin irritation or stickiness to her chin. The cooling sensation and tightness lasted for about another 30 minutes after removing the applicator. Her skin felt smoother and tighter. You could really see a difference in her double chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Have posted a before and after picture</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for squat. Probably better off looking into the chin exercises you can find online. You have to put in the work but after 2 weeks you start seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> choose the rating because it is huge, won&#x27;t stay in place, and I did not see any results do not recommend would rather use other product for the price</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me and I followed the instructions to a tee.  It may work for others but not me.  Sorry.  Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> its much larger than i expected...smells good and has natural ingredients but i dont think after 5 &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; it made much of a difference other than make my skin soft.But i think everyone needs to keep in mind that every skin/body type is different. Drinking lots of water and healthy habits helps a lot more.And genetics are a big factor for me.Plus it was pretty clear my box had been open..maybe to make sure the product count was inside but still..you expect an intact box.Gave it a shot for fun :)</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve just used my second CHIN UP and this time, had more trouble removing the form from its adhesive. It&#x27;s also not sticking as well as it did with the first one. Not sure why but hope it works. I&#x27;ve had a double chin starting in my early teens. What I noticed when I was younger is that skin beneath my jaw puffed out if my posture was bad but when I stood straight up it went away. Unfortunately as time went on, that area was the first to show age and more weight which accumulated a substantial and awful looking fat pad beneath. I&#x27;ve seriously considered lipo in that area but am too chicken about doctors (a story for another time) yet am always looking at that procedure online and viewing pics of it. Honestly, often the results don&#x27;t look as good as i would expect and plus, most of the time with chin lipo pictures, there&#x27;s been a small chin implant inserted so it makes the skin tighter - this they usually don&#x27;t mention in the pictures!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried chin exercises but it can hurt your neck so those aren&#x27;t for me either.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...So, my package arrived within 2 days and I&#x27;m so thrilled about that. There are 5 to a package. The fragrance is very nice - not strong or sickeningly sweet. You remove from outer package and the directions say to &amp;#34;remove the foil&amp;#34;...but it&#x27;s not exactly foil. So I was slightly confused but quickly realized there is a white opaque sticky tape that runs on one side of the form and that&#x27;s what you peel back. As per the directions I, tried to &#x27;pull back sides of my skin, only, my skin is fairly taut so its hard to do. What&#x27;s weird is even though the skin at my jawline is tight enough, the waddle beneath it is not. My fat pad has stretched the skin below my jawline and my double chin droops like a bubble from the front of my chin to where my neck begins. You can see it from both side and front and there&#x27;s no hiding it. Also, my neck is short so putting it only around the neck area was impossible, if it was going to cover the fat pad/toadish chin bubble.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wearing it right now and it wings up around my lower face and jawline. Basically it covers the double chin and then the lower face toward ears. Everyones face shape and chin situation is different so I expect my results will be too. So far I&#x27;ve had it on for just over 15 mins and am starting to feel a tingling and tightening sensation. It&#x27;s not bad but I don&#x27;t like the feeling around my jawline because it feels like its being pulled down. I intend to wear it an hour...but might only last 45 minutes. In the mean time I&#x27;ve taken an ACE bandage and wrapped over the wrap and tied up top my head just for added support. In fact it might feel better if I just laid down for another 20 mins, relax and allow this thing to do what it&#x27;s going to do. Will report back...Ok so I&#x27;m back, wore it for 55 mins and it does work. Basically it&#x27;s reduced by about 1/4 and I&#x27;ll take what I can get. It looks better from the front but from the side, unfortunately the droop is still prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have only a small double chin, I have no reason to think it wouldn&#x27;t work a bit better for you. BTW, I&#x27;ve noticed that it isn&#x27;t always overweight people who have fat pads under their chins. Often, the shape of the face and how the jawline connects with the neck, creates conditions for a fat pad to develop so heredity, the way jawbone and facial structure is shaped, the length of the neck and life style all make a difference. If you notice, some people with too small of a chin and/or a more lengthy chin/jaw tends to develop fat beneath in that area even when the rest of the face appears normal. Very overweight people tend to get a much thicker neck and the chin fills out but when they lose weight, they tend to lose their double chin too. Or they gain weight all over, even in their face... but never below the jaw so they have no double chin at all! That&#x27;s never been the case with me. If or when I lose any amount of weight the chin only slightlyreduces but never goes away. Yep, I&#x27;ve studied this face for many years and have done a lot of observing of others too.  :-) I think I will use another wrap in about 5 days to see if that shrinks the pad and hopefully my skin even more. I&#x27;m somewhat pleased with this product but wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to spend anymore on it than I did.ay.

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give this product any stars. It didn&#x27;t work at all and I tried it a few times. The ending result: A waste of money I wish I would have just saved</li>
            <li> Recent Update after finishing full box: Overall I did notice a difference after applying the product but as someone stated it was after wearing it overnight. I probably will repurchase to wear just for special events and etc since its kinda expensive for something not permanent.   Older Review: I see a little bit of improvement but nothing that noticeable but i&#x27;ll update again after I finish the last two. It&#x27;s easy to put on and feels like a facial almost for your neck. Really enjoyed the feeling but it did get itchy after awhile and when I took it off it was pretty red for an hr or so but then it went away.  More than likely I would probably not reorder it because of the price and how slow it takes to build up noticeable improvement. For the price of almost 30 dollars I thought I would get more out of the product. I guess it really depends on your skin and etc like stated on the box. I&#x27;m happy for those who did have significant improvement just wish I did for me. Maybe it works more so for saggy skin then double chin?</li>
            <li> The wrap is a lot bigger than pictured. It basically goes from ear to ear and covers the entire area under the jaw. I have only worn them twice, but they seem to stay on pretty well. I noticed the key is to make sure you have it on correctly the first time so you do not need to adjust it. It&#x27;s not painful to wear, some might find it a little bothersome. There was no huge difference in the before and after of my chin, but a very subtle and slight one. I would probably not order more of these unless I see additional improvement with the last 3 wraps.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest I was not sure how well this would work because one I never tried a product like this and two I was not sure how well ti would work with my skin.I do not have a double chin but I am in my thirties so I was interested in trying this out for toning up &amp; keeping things tight in that area.So far I have definitely felt and noticed my skin was tighter,felt more toned, &amp; lifted in my chin area after the first application.The chin applicator is a simple strip which was much longer than I expected it to be.I would say it measured about 9&amp;#34; long &amp; about 3&amp;#34; wide give or take.The length definitely helps keep that area of your chin lifted and toned which surprised me.The strip actually goes up to my jaw area so I can kind of creat a from wrap with it.It has a jelly like feel to the sticky part which adheres well to your face.It kind of reminds me of a wrap and how a body wrap works but this is for your chin area.So I can definitely see how this would help.It definitely does work and I am assuming the more I do it the better the results.So far I am liking it.It is very easy to use just apply it to the chin and leave on for 45-60 minutes.I left mine on for 45minutes and felt a difference in that area.They also recommend only doing this 2 times per week.You get 5 packs so you have enough for almost a month if you are doing it 2 times per week.Overall it does work, easy to apply/remove, &amp; I can notice a difference after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for inspection purposes.</li>
            <li> I suspect with regular use you can see a bit of result</li>
            <li> the very fist application, i saw a softening of crepiness under my chin.  i recently had weight loss and started to notice that my neck looked a little wrinkly as i lost weight.  noticable difference after first application.  would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change in the double chin at all</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. When I took it off I didn&#x27;t see any results and it left my chin all sticky. Was no fun at all. I&#x27;m going to try the It Works! wraps at the end of this week and I have faith in it. I suggest you use the real thing. You can find the It Works! product at myitworks.com. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Wasted $30. Did everything the directions said but it wasn&#x27;t too much or hard. Took pictures and no change after using two. Mise well do the others and cross my fingers. I don&#x27;t know what else I can do to help it work. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get thee to stick. Would nOt buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchase several slimming product from this seller . This &amp;#34;chin up&amp;#34; more complicated for use then&lt;br /&gt;other wraps .It was a little hard to keep it on my under chin :) But It makes my &amp;#34;turkey&amp;#34; wrinkles  disappear ,It is a temporary fix, but until surgery...this is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. I have had a double chin for years despite never being drastically overweight. It has always made me self conscious so i tried this product and i couldnt believe the results. After my first use i could see a difference immediately. My skin was firmer and much less saggy. My feels and looks like a teenager&#x27;s again and my confidence is way up, its amazing.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know my opinion yet</li>
            <li> I have only used one so far... but it did not do anything really. I am going to finish the box and see if it improves. I was not expecting miracles (hoping for them, of course), but I did hope it would tighten it up some, and it just hasn&#x27;t. At this time, I do not see buying it again.</li>
            <li> Best solution for double chin .&lt;br /&gt;This a first time I find something help full .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not disappear completely .but looks smaller and tighten . Recommended will buy again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see no different it wasn&#x27;t good for me.i like another product that works for me but thanks for asking</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do nothing for me , very disappointed..</li>
            <li> After two applications I still haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you are older and you want to tighten your skin, this would work if you used it twice a week forever. But other than that, this stuff really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is probably my 3rd purchase from this seller, which pretty much says it all. The product really makes a difference in terms of texture and appearance. It is also lightweight, which is not always the case with products for the neck area. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so special but it works!!</li>
            <li> Did not make a difference. ..did not work at all like i would of expected it smh very disappointed. Dont recommended</li>
            <li> It works slowly, but you need to use the whole box for noticing a small difference.  It does not stick as well as the ultimate body wrap applicators.</li>
            <li> Great and it will do what it said also I used it only 2 times and am happy with the result ..</li>
            <li> This is probably my 3rd purchase on this product, which pretty much says it all. It really makes a difference in terms of texture and appearance. It is also lightweight, which is not always the case with products for the neck &amp; decollete area. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped</li>
            <li> Just good and simple. It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Skin under the chin looks more tighten and younger. Recommended.</li>
            <li> works but the results fade quickly</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Helped me out so much! Love it!üòç</li>
            <li> The product arrived quicker than expected but the product itself does not work. I had a hard time with the applicator even sticking to my skin ( I followed the directions closely). I had to sit and hold it in place each time for the whole duration (which was an hour) per use !!  I have used three out of the four applicators without notice of change... Highly disappointed..</li>
            <li> I followed other&#x27;s reviews and wore patch overnight. I didn&#x27;t notice any tightening or firming of skin; however, my skin was very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I kept the Chin up patch on for 3 hours (no so comfortable ), But  it works ,My pesky double chin looks smaller and lifted.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this seller, fast shipping and awesome product.</li>
            <li> Everything seems to work alright. has a nice firming effect so far I feel my skin is staying taut than before. It&#x27;s better than other products on the market .</li>
            <li> I just got this product today and I absolutely love it. You get 7 treatments for $20, which is such a small price for the confidence you get after just one hout! It&#x27;s kind of goofy to use (it looks like a maxi pad stuck on your face) but the results are amazing. I highly reccomend this product to anyone who is wanting to vamp up their face.</li>
            <li> I bought these even!  They wouldn&#x27;t stick to me, the sides kept on rolling down.  The wrap was way too large and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> Best solution ,for chin . tightening from first wrap . Will buy again , recommended .</li>
            <li> Honestly I would give ZERO stars if I could....&lt;br /&gt;didnt do anything for me..&lt;br /&gt;itworks wraps however are unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> product is crap did nothing it works body wrap is amazing this is junk&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
            <li> This is a great application for my fatty chin. The patch is a bit larger than expected. It does cover your entire chin and goes up to the bottom half of your cheeks. Its very simple to use. I washed my face, patted dry, and applied the patch. I left my patch on for 60 minutes. It was a little cold and I felt like I as being strangled at times. I think I may have had mine a bit close to my throat on my first use. I saw immediate results and my chin felt tighter. Of course this is a temporary solution but this is perfect for lots of occasions such as before taking pictures. I was having a family gathering and decided to use a chin patch the day before just in case the family wanted to take pictures. I have unfortunately aged a lot this past year and my chin is one of my worse problems. I have been looking for a product to help me with my sagging chin. I&#x27;m very excited that I got the opportunity to test this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.The package comes with 5 patches. It is recommended to only use the patches no more than two times a week. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easy to use. It has a spearmint or peppermint smell. The wraps are awesome also. My midsection is looking firmer and my stretch marks are tightening up too. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try out these types of wraps without having to pay a higher price or sign up for a &#x27;loyal member&amp;#34; to get a discounted price</li>
            <li> It definitely feels as if it&#x27;s firming and tightening very well. This is not a miracle product, but I feel it helps minimize the double chin area.</li>
            <li> All doubts I had about this product were gone after my first use. Nothing else that I have tried has worked for me but I could feel and see the difference right away. My chin is much less saggy and my self esteem is much higher because of this product!</li>
            <li> The very first application, I saw a softening of creepiness under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;It tones, firms, and you have to use it to understand how wonderful it is. Recomended</li>
            <li> I use the chin up with v line belt from the same seller. Good ,but unfortunately not permanent results. Recommended for quick fix.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions outlines on the box to a T. I was very careful to do exactly as it said.  And after using all of them there is absolutely no difference. Very disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
            <li> I have a double chin and Ive used only 4 wraps and I can see the difference already. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> This not work for me :(!!!! I waste my money I used all the package and I don&#x27;t see a diference</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money... I have done 3 wraps thus far and cannot see any change... sounded too good to be true :(</li>
            <li> It does improve your neckline. However it is a product that would need continuous use. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars as I have only used one. Definitely gave my chin a tighter look.  I will know more when I apply one more time.</li>
            <li> Not results I was looking for</li>
            <li> Used the whole box. Nothing.</li>
    </ol>
