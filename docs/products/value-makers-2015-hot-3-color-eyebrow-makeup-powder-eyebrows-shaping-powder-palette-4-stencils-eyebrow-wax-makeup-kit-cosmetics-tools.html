            <li>But the compact is awesome!!</li>
            <li>Real Good Deal !!</li>
            <li>Otherwise I am very happy</li>
            <li>Luv great very happy with product</li>
            <li>Otherwise very pleased!</li>
            <li>But all in all great product.</li>
            <li>I am happy.</li>
            <li>Great, but wished the stencils were plastic instead of wax paper</li>
            <li>No idea how to use the archers but the brow kit was great</li>
            <li>You get a lot for the price,very happy.</li>
            <li>Ok I like the wax pencil best.</li>
            <li>This gave me the shape as a good base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  </li>
            <li>nice product....</li>
            <li>Worked out nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice buy</li>
            <li>So much better and easier to do my eyebrows now that I have them! :)</li>
            <li>The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions.</li>
            <li>If you are doing a thinner brow, I suggest covering your own brows, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>while yes the palette is great andjust what I wanted, I oordered this specific order because it was supposed to come with the eyebrow stencils....</li>
            <li>I just started playing around with my brows and this kit makes it easy and fun.</li>
            <li>It came on time and is exactly what is pictured here!</li>
            <li>the brush has an eraser on the opposite end, which I found suuuuuper handy.</li>
            <li>This kit has 4 shapes, which were fun to play with.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>The wax, the brush and colors work well and definitely look better than an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>The downfall was the stencils, none of them fit my face or natural brow line, which was a bummer.</li>
            <li>make-up is nice, I used the ivory to cover then the dark brown to create the brows.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>I really wanted my eyebrows even and shaped.</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and stays all day.</li>
            <li>Stencils are way too big for a normal face.</li>
            <li>It was tricky to place it just right, but once you get that down, you are golden!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did have to go over it with a dark pencil, but that was just because I needed it to really pop on stage.</li>

            <li> plastic is a little larger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> Looks extremely fake very difficult...do not recommend</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the color would be so dark.</li>
            <li> a little goes along way.</li>

            <li> Product is as described. The stincels are kinda hard to use but then again I&#x27;ve never used them before.....nice product....the brush has an eraser on the opposite end, which I found suuuuuper handy. But all in all great product. I am happy.</li>
            <li> Great, but wished the stencils were plastic instead of wax paper so they could stay in place easier</li>
            <li> THIS IS A TERRIBLE BUY. The stencils are so hard to work with. And plusssss the shapes of the stencils are so ugly!</li>
            <li> I really like this set. I picked it up for a play I was doing. I really wanted my eyebrows even and shaped. This kit has 4 shapes, which were fun to play with. If you are doing a thinner brow, I suggest covering your own brows, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make-up is nice, I used the ivory to cover then the dark brown to create the brows. Worked out nicely. I did have to go over it with a dark pencil, but that was just because I needed it to really pop on stage. This gave me the shape as a good base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use the brush to apply the makeup, the plastic does not go well with a pencil. It is especially tricky with the thinner brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is a little larger than it needs to be. It was tricky to place it just right, but once you get that down, you are golden!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the product up close and personal. I also added a show photo to see the end results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description. The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions. I hope this look at the products has helped you make the decision to buy or not to buy. Thanks for taking the time to read my review! ***</li>
