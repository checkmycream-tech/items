            <li>I love this wash because I feel like it is very gentle on my skin while still doing an excellent job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Bright beautiful skin at 50+ years old!!</li>
            <li>It has the most effective, yet gentlest exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First thing you notice is that it can come out sort of runny and thin...seems to be important to give it a good shake to mix things up.</li>
            <li>The consistency is gel-like, and the grains are very, very fine.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so good and clean after using this.</li>
            <li>Loved this wash made my face feel clean</li>
            <li>Costs a bit more then others but</li>
            <li>I actually use it with my Clarisonic cleaning brush and it works great!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>The more I use it, the better my skin looks.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Normally I love this cleanser, but will not be buying again from this seller.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin feel more radiant and healthier after just one use.  </li>
            <li>Even though I just started using this twice a day, I feel more confident</li>
            <li>skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>and I like it even better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Well I do love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this peel/cleanser.  </li>
            <li>and I love the combo.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy and moisturized, and I have minimized wrinkles and not one pimple.  </li>
            <li>this one is at the top of&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>and I had to unscrew the top to get the product out.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth after using it and also helps prevent acne!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find myself seeing any great results after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I would say that It&#x27;s an okay product when it comes to exfoliating.</li>
            <li>When I use in conjunction with my face steamer and brushes, I definitely get the best results.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had better results with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SCRUB.  </li>
            <li>I have switched from a Clinique roduct to this one and definitely a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Great product, the whole Philosophy Line works wonders on my face,hands and body</li>
            <li>I love this skin care product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for the world!!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this exfoliater to anyone who wants a smooth beautiful face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is a really good exfoliater and leaves my skin feeling very very</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent and dye-free which is great because I have very sensitive skin and the beads are not too abrasive.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for those rough spots on your body.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth my feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order the full one as soon as I can!</li>
            <li>Product does appear to clean the skin better then</li>
            <li>It washes off easily; I rinse with just water.</li>
            <li>This products works and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Barely has any scent (if any) which is great because I have fragrance</li>
            <li>I kind of like those ;)</li>
            <li>The product has a pretty good size, but im not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li>is a fine non course scrub cleanser</li>
            <li>My mother also uses it and it helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>i first bought this a macys and loved it my face feels clean and fresh after using this the scrub</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s  a mix of cheap detergent and medication.  </li>
            <li>It brightens my face and makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the gentle exfoliating!</li>
            <li>When you wash it away, it just leaves your skin feeling clean without leaving redness.  </li>
            <li>are definitely helpful in making my moisturizer more effective.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your face feel so clean, and I get a glow if</li>
            <li>and I know it has helped to clean up my skin...</li>
            <li>It also rinses off cleanly without residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gives a gentle exfoliation which keeps you complexion fresh and bright in a natural healthy way.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product made my face feel clean but did not make my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>I will never go without, this is my absolute favorite product by philosophy.</li>
            <li>I loved how this and the hope in a jar moisturizer would make my face feel and look but the moisturizer was just too gross.</li>
            <li>i love this face wash SOOO much</li>
            <li>NO BAD  </li>
            <li>Not only does this work better as it is a wash, you also get way more for the money.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a week, I have noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>I feel better about myself more today than I did last week.</li>
            <li>Also mild burning sensation.</li>
            <li>For the most part, whenever I would change my face wash, I would break out even more than what was already present.  </li>
            <li>and I actually have pretty nice skin underneath those bumps!  </li>
            <li>wish I had ordered the super size</li>
            <li>Finally to top it all - I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, can&#x27;t really describe it</li>
            <li>Now my face is smooth and radiant and I saw my first blemish today since using this.</li>
            <li>I was using Lancome CrÃ¨me radiance before, which is amazing (going  back to it).  </li>
            <li>I liked it while it last.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty resilient to irritants, luckily, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li>It very effectively removes dead skin and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product in a kit with other Philosophy items and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I will use purity, but this seems to be better for my skin due to the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice texture with teeny tiny granules to scrub and has a nice smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very gentle exfoliant</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first philosophy product</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it daily.</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST product that has yet to either of those things.</li>
            <li>I have also dealt with a lot of mixed emotions regarding my appearance and there is no doubt that I have had more than one or two comments about the bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I was a bit hesitant at first.  </li>
            <li>Had tried Purity before, this is the first I&#x27;ve used Philosophy</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Philosophy !</li>
            <li>a twice a week scrab will give you  way better results that the daily \\&quot;exfoliation\\&quot; you  get from  this product.</li>
            <li>WITHOUT PAYING THE BRANDS HIGHER PRICES AT RETAIL STORES.</li>
            <li>this was the first time I used this product</li>
            <li>Overall, it does a great job at keeping dry flakes away</li>
            <li>It makes your face really clean and is very gentle on the sensitive skin on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet inspirational blurb on the front like a lot of other philosophy products.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I took to much</li>
            <li>Even wearing good make-up does not cover the fact that your skin is not healthy.</li>
            <li>- they&#x27;re small, more like grains of fine sand than anything.</li>
            <li>The grit is very fine, so you can scrub really hard or really lightly, depending on what&#x27;s going on with your skin.</li>
            <li>and it has been fine all excluding last week.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>This is light enough that I don&#x27;t feel like my face is being scratched (IE.</li>
            <li>I have to hide it from my husband because he wants to use all the time as well.</li>
            <li>and I really could not be happier.  </li>
            <li>she absolutely swears by it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>but it really does work</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>Then, I gently massage it more after getting it wet, then I rinse.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>First off, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After reading the rave reviews about this product not only on Amazon but also on Sephora, I was excited about buying this exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li>Product works okay, have been happier with other exfoliating products I have used.</li>
            <li>Just a dime&#x27;s worth on your hands and your skin looks lovely afterward, and your makeup is much nicer on since all of the dead skin cells are gone!  </li>
            <li>The microdelivery exfoliating wash has super fine exfoliating particles that scrub away all the dead skin without being too abrasive.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced acne since I was in fourth grade and have spent probably thousands of dollars on different over the counter and prescription treatments.  </li>
            <li>I only have the sample size of this currently, but I love it so much</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that it seems about average for the better products.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be ok if I put it upside down, but that would just make all the exfoliator accumulate at the cap.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will feel brand new every morning and your mirror will thank you for it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely couldn&#x27;t live without Purity</li>
            <li>From the beginning the exfoliating substance was not distributed in the main cleanser</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the best (faintly medicinal), but not enough to warrant an under 5 star review.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The price was kinda high for face wash.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I love the little exfoliaters in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different exfoliating washes and have noticed they either use large, rough shells or grains that irritate your skin</li>
            <li>Not much of a smell to it and it lightly lathers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, yet gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>After using the Philosophy wash I still get more dead skin with the Avani product.</li>
            <li>I have normal to combination skin</li>
            <li>I normally use Dermalogica&#x27;s micro-exofilaint.</li>
            <li>My sister uses this often and has not had a similar reaction, my skin is more sensitive than hers definitely.</li>
            <li>Because the results were not Immediate, I can not say for sure, but it seems like the next day after using this product my face became dry and peely to the touch.</li>
            <li>Love this product for middle aged skin, helps skin to rejuvenate!</li>
            <li>use this pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never been better, exfoliating but still gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too rough and they make the skin feel extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Worth a try, especially if you like Philosophy products generally.</li>
            <li>since you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I am assuming the batch was old or stored incorrectly in the warehouse.  </li>
            <li>I switched back to this cleaner and it is much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>she also tells me her skin fills so soft...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and also aging skin.</li>
            <li>I use this wash almost daily in the shower and it really wakes up and softens my face.</li>
            <li>I am surprised as it has chemicals and fillers that should cause issues with my face, but do not.</li>
            <li>I have dull, combination fair skin with little acne.</li>
            <li>With the Dermalogica powder, it was difficult to get the right ammount out, and for how huge the bottle is, you don&#x27;t get nearly any product.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle and I have dry skin that flakes a lot.</li>
            <li>for  the whole minute it feels like I&#x27;m running a dry brush over my face.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old female who has frequent problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure to shake before you use it and be careful not to get it in your eyes - this stuff has diatomaceous earth in it and its not comfortable on your eyeballs.</li>
            <li>I like to use this in the morning (gentle enough to use daily) and follow up with Purity at night.</li>
            <li>I do not know how do describe it, but I have a major problem with the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough on your skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Even the sensitive skin products turn my face red if I use them every day.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff daily and my skin has been so soft since I&#x27;ve started.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this product loud enough.</li>
            <li>Following the instructions will definitely help, 30-60 sec messaging on the face and it will leaving you feeling exfoliated and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I believe it helps loosen blackheads which really amps up the effectivness of other products I use to extract them.</li>
            <li>: A little of this product goes a long way; start by getting a small amount and then add more a needed.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of pricey to throw away  </li>
            <li> Nice exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> I love this wash because I feel like it is very gentle on my skin while still doing an excellent job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Bright beautiful skin at 50+ years old!!</li>
            <li> It has the most effective, yet gentlest exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing you notice is that it can come out sort of runny and thin...seems to be important to give it a good shake to mix things up.</li>
            <li> The consistency is gel-like, and the grains are very, very fine.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so good and clean after using this.</li>
            <li> Loved this wash made my face feel clean</li>
            <li> Costs a bit more then others but</li>
            <li> I actually use it with my Clarisonic cleaning brush and it works great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> The more I use it, the better my skin looks.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Normally I love this cleanser, but will not be buying again from this seller.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin feel more radiant and healthier after just one use.  </li>
            <li> Even though I just started using this twice a day, I feel more confident</li>
            <li> skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> and I like it even better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Well I do love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this peel/cleanser.  </li>
            <li> and I love the combo.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy and moisturized, and I have minimized wrinkles and not one pimple.  </li>
            <li> this one is at the top of&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> and I had to unscrew the top to get the product out.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth after using it and also helps prevent acne!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find myself seeing any great results after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I would say that It&#x27;s an okay product when it comes to exfoliating.</li>
            <li> When I use in conjunction with my face steamer and brushes, I definitely get the best results.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had better results with this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SCRUB.  </li>
            <li> I have switched from a Clinique roduct to this one and definitely a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Great product, the whole Philosophy Line works wonders on my face,hands and body</li>
            <li> I love this skin care product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for the world!!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this exfoliater to anyone who wants a smooth beautiful face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is a really good exfoliater and leaves my skin feeling very very</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent and dye-free which is great because I have very sensitive skin and the beads are not too abrasive.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for those rough spots on your body.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth my feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order the full one as soon as I can!</li>
            <li> Product does appear to clean the skin better then</li>
            <li> It washes off easily; I rinse with just water.</li>
            <li> This products works and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Barely has any scent (if any) which is great because I have fragrance</li>
            <li> I kind of like those ;)</li>
            <li> The product has a pretty good size, but im not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> is a fine non course scrub cleanser</li>
            <li> My mother also uses it and it helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> i first bought this a macys and loved it my face feels clean and fresh after using this the scrub</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s  a mix of cheap detergent and medication.  </li>
            <li> It brightens my face and makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the gentle exfoliating!</li>
            <li> When you wash it away, it just leaves your skin feeling clean without leaving redness.  </li>
            <li> are definitely helpful in making my moisturizer more effective.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your face feel so clean, and I get a glow if</li>
            <li> and I know it has helped to clean up my skin...</li>
            <li> It also rinses off cleanly without residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gives a gentle exfoliation which keeps you complexion fresh and bright in a natural healthy way.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product made my face feel clean but did not make my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> I will never go without, this is my absolute favorite product by philosophy.</li>
            <li> I loved how this and the hope in a jar moisturizer would make my face feel and look but the moisturizer was just too gross.</li>
            <li> i love this face wash SOOO much</li>
            <li> NO BAD  </li>
            <li> Not only does this work better as it is a wash, you also get way more for the money.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week, I have noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> I feel better about myself more today than I did last week.</li>
            <li> Also mild burning sensation.</li>
            <li> For the most part, whenever I would change my face wash, I would break out even more than what was already present.  </li>
            <li> and I actually have pretty nice skin underneath those bumps!  </li>
            <li> wish I had ordered the super size</li>
            <li> Finally to top it all - I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, can&#x27;t really describe it</li>
            <li> Now my face is smooth and radiant and I saw my first blemish today since using this.</li>
            <li> I was using Lancome CrÃ¨me radiance before, which is amazing (going  back to it).  </li>
            <li> I liked it while it last.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty resilient to irritants, luckily, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> It very effectively removes dead skin and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this product in a kit with other Philosophy items and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I will use purity, but this seems to be better for my skin due to the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice texture with teeny tiny granules to scrub and has a nice smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very gentle exfoliant</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first philosophy product</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST product that has yet to either of those things.</li>
            <li> I have also dealt with a lot of mixed emotions regarding my appearance and there is no doubt that I have had more than one or two comments about the bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I was a bit hesitant at first.  </li>
            <li> Had tried Purity before, this is the first I&#x27;ve used Philosophy</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Philosophy !</li>
            <li> a twice a week scrab will give you  way better results that the daily \\&quot;exfoliation\\&quot; you  get from  this product.</li>
            <li> WITHOUT PAYING THE BRANDS HIGHER PRICES AT RETAIL STORES.</li>
            <li> this was the first time I used this product</li>
            <li> Overall, it does a great job at keeping dry flakes away</li>
            <li> It makes your face really clean and is very gentle on the sensitive skin on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet inspirational blurb on the front like a lot of other philosophy products.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I took to much</li>
            <li> Even wearing good make-up does not cover the fact that your skin is not healthy.</li>
            <li> - they&#x27;re small, more like grains of fine sand than anything.</li>
            <li> The grit is very fine, so you can scrub really hard or really lightly, depending on what&#x27;s going on with your skin.</li>
            <li> and it has been fine all excluding last week.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> This is light enough that I don&#x27;t feel like my face is being scratched (IE.</li>
            <li> I have to hide it from my husband because he wants to use all the time as well.</li>
            <li> and I really could not be happier.  </li>
            <li> she absolutely swears by it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> but it really does work</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> Then, I gently massage it more after getting it wet, then I rinse.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> First off, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After reading the rave reviews about this product not only on Amazon but also on Sephora, I was excited about buying this exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> Product works okay, have been happier with other exfoliating products I have used.</li>
            <li> Just a dime&#x27;s worth on your hands and your skin looks lovely afterward, and your makeup is much nicer on since all of the dead skin cells are gone!  </li>
            <li> The microdelivery exfoliating wash has super fine exfoliating particles that scrub away all the dead skin without being too abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced acne since I was in fourth grade and have spent probably thousands of dollars on different over the counter and prescription treatments.  </li>
            <li> I only have the sample size of this currently, but I love it so much</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that it seems about average for the better products.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be ok if I put it upside down, but that would just make all the exfoliator accumulate at the cap.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will feel brand new every morning and your mirror will thank you for it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely couldn&#x27;t live without Purity</li>
            <li> From the beginning the exfoliating substance was not distributed in the main cleanser</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the best (faintly medicinal), but not enough to warrant an under 5 star review.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The price was kinda high for face wash.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I love the little exfoliaters in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different exfoliating washes and have noticed they either use large, rough shells or grains that irritate your skin</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell to it and it lightly lathers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, yet gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> After using the Philosophy wash I still get more dead skin with the Avani product.</li>
            <li> I have normal to combination skin</li>
            <li> I normally use Dermalogica&#x27;s micro-exofilaint.</li>
            <li> My sister uses this often and has not had a similar reaction, my skin is more sensitive than hers definitely.</li>
            <li> Because the results were not Immediate, I can not say for sure, but it seems like the next day after using this product my face became dry and peely to the touch.</li>
            <li> Love this product for middle aged skin, helps skin to rejuvenate!</li>
            <li> use this pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never been better, exfoliating but still gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too rough and they make the skin feel extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Worth a try, especially if you like Philosophy products generally.</li>
            <li> since you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am assuming the batch was old or stored incorrectly in the warehouse.  </li>
            <li> I switched back to this cleaner and it is much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> she also tells me her skin fills so soft...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and also aging skin.</li>
            <li> I use this wash almost daily in the shower and it really wakes up and softens my face.</li>
            <li> I am surprised as it has chemicals and fillers that should cause issues with my face, but do not.</li>
            <li> I have dull, combination fair skin with little acne.</li>
            <li> With the Dermalogica powder, it was difficult to get the right ammount out, and for how huge the bottle is, you don&#x27;t get nearly any product.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle and I have dry skin that flakes a lot.</li>
            <li> for  the whole minute it feels like I&#x27;m running a dry brush over my face.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old female who has frequent problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure to shake before you use it and be careful not to get it in your eyes - this stuff has diatomaceous earth in it and its not comfortable on your eyeballs.</li>
            <li> I like to use this in the morning (gentle enough to use daily) and follow up with Purity at night.</li>
            <li> I do not know how do describe it, but I have a major problem with the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough on your skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Even the sensitive skin products turn my face red if I use them every day.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff daily and my skin has been so soft since I&#x27;ve started.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this product loud enough.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions will definitely help, 30-60 sec messaging on the face and it will leaving you feeling exfoliated and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I believe it helps loosen blackheads which really amps up the effectivness of other products I use to extract them.</li>
            <li> : A little of this product goes a long way; start by getting a small amount and then add more a needed.</li>
            <li> I frequently recieve compliments from complete strangers on my complexion and when guessing my age people usually guess 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> It did not appear red but felt dry and corse).</li>
            <li> I used this for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I have half the bottle left and all I have left is the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands, but always go back to philosophy.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands and always go back to philosophy.</li>
            <li> My main complaint about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can really think of is the smell, but it&#x27;s certainly bearable and by no means</li>
            <li> As far  as its exfoliating properties - nothing to write home about either, the beads are tiny and you won&#x27;t get a serious exfoliation like with  using products specifically designed for this;  </li>
            <li> Probably will go back to previous product.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Cosmetics Renewal facial peel.</li>
            <li> Thought I would be red from the chemicals being too harsh.</li>
            <li> It was as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 5/15 - after a couple of months of having this product and only a few uses, all of the beads dissolved and it can no longer be used for exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Before Microdelivery my facial skin dull and dry.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> and I ended up rinsing a 3/4 of a handful down the drain.</li>
            <li> My sister suffers from moderate to severe acne, has very sensitive skin(she</li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t a miracle product doesn&#x27;t vanish black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and my mostly normal skin has started having random breakouts.</li>
            <li> It was a mess, &amp; I lost about 1/4 of the product.</li>
            <li> and I would have to shake it vigorously to get even a little defoliator to come out.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the $24 price tag, I was a little put off.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh but gets the job of exfoliation done.</li>
            <li> or they have a heavy, oily feel.  </li>
            <li> So far I like this product as a face wash, but when I received it the cover had broken off and the product was spilled all over inside the package!</li>
            <li> I use this once a day, its not too harsh on my 40+ skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years</li>
            <li> I had blemishes and  an uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to work well...after a few days, your skin seems fresher and smoother, although in my case, also somewhat drier - switching to an every-other-day schedule solves that.</li>
            <li> One of the few face washes that I can use.  </li>
            <li> I definitely suggest this product to anyone who has had some difficult times due to using products that never, ever worked.</li>
            <li> Oh, and did I mention it made me break out pretty bad?</li>
            <li> A little expensive -- but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Sephora, but thought I&#x27;d save the trip and order on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was probably because I had a sun burn on my face, but after rubbing it like usual, it started to sting a lot.</li>
            <li> But if you use a small amount and don&#x27;t overdo it, the product works.</li>
            <li> The product itself from a manufacturer standpoint was fine but this stuff smells awful</li>
            <li> I have thick, oily skin and using this product after washing with neem soap has transformed my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is up?!?  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something that works as well but is less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this as a less expensive option.</li>
            <li> This is why I was so disappointed when the exfoliating beads disappeared only within a few months!</li>
            <li> i always had HORRIBLE acne and this cleared it up so quickly ..</li>
            <li> use it daily, and I am no spring chicken !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine was a dud, but be wary that you might end up with disappearing beads within a few months!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this every day because I am afraid it would be too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be a face wash AND exfoliator and it fails in both categories.  </li>
            <li> It is very expensive to me as it costs about $50 for a 30 ml bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It smells horrible, at least to me.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to squeeze.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I ended up breaking out really bad and felt like I could never fully get the soap off my face.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I am, in all reality, shocked.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that this happened after paying for the product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m truly disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have been using  Avani  Dead Sea Cosmetics Renewal facial peel. It very effectively removes dead skin and is very gentle.  It does not have abrasives in it.  It is very expensive to me as it costs about $50 for a 30 ml bottle. I have been trying to find something that works as well but is less expensive.  After using the Philosophy wash I still get more dead skin with the Avani product.</li>
            <li> Product does appear to clean the skin better then others I have tried. Costs a bit more then others but it works! I received my product on time and packaging was good to protect the contents.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Not too harsh but gets the job of exfoliation done. I actually use it with my Clarisonic cleaning brush and it works great!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliating wash I have ever used!  The microdelivery exfoliating wash has super fine exfoliating particles that scrub away all the dead skin without being too abrasive.  After one wash you will reveal smoother, brighter skin.  You can even mix with purity made simple for a 2-in-1, especially for those who can&#x27;t use traditional exfoliating washes.  I will never go without, this is my absolute favorite product by philosophy.</li>
            <li> I liked it while it last. It dries out my skin, tho.</li>
            <li> I only have the sample size of this currently, but I love it so much I&#x27;m going to order the full one as soon as I can! I use it with my  [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]] and afterwards my skin feels amazing. I think scrubbing it in with your hands feels a bit too gritty for my taste but with the pro-x it&#x27;s perfect. I can&#x27;t comment on how similar it is to a proper microdermabrasion since I&#x27;ve never had one, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need one using this! The only bad thing I can really think of is the smell, but it&#x27;s certainly bearable and by no means a deal-breaker. note: I have normal to combination skin</li>
            <li> This microdelivery exfoliating wash has become part of my morning routine.  I absolutely love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  It&#x27;s not rough on your skin at all.  I&#x27;ve tried many different exfoliating washes and have noticed they either use large, rough shells or grains that irritate your skin or they have a heavy, oily feel.  This one is different.  The consistency is gel-like, and the grains are very, very fine.  When you massage it into your skin for 30-40 seconds, it feels like getting a facial.  When you wash it away, it just leaves your skin feeling clean without leaving redness.  The more I use it, the better my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a less expensive option. I normally use Dermalogica&#x27;s micro-exofilaint. Not only does this work better as it is a wash, you also get way more for the money. With the Dermalogica powder, it was difficult to get the right ammount out, and for how huge the bottle is, you don&#x27;t get nearly any product. This is light enough that I don&#x27;t feel like my face is being scratched (IE. St. Ives Apricot Scrub) but I can definitely feel it working. Will buy this again!</li>
            <li> In the summer, I use this every morning. It does just what it should do without making my skin irritated. My skin is pretty resilient to irritants, luckily, so your mileage may vary. The grit is very fine, so you can scrub really hard or really lightly, depending on what&#x27;s going on with your skin. It washes off easily; I rinse with just water. I used to use all Philosophy products. I&#x27;ve since moved on, but this is one of the two that I think will never be replaced.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from sephora, and had to buy it. It is wonderful. My face feels so good and clean after using this. It&#x27;s my first philosophy product and I love it. A little bit goes a long way. I have to hide it from my husband because he wants to use all the time as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite exfoliating wash!</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old female who has frequent problems with my skin. Sometimes it&#x27;s acne, sometimes it&#x27;s just skin that is not clear-cleaning looking skin. Even wearing good make-up does not cover the fact that your skin is not healthy. After using this product for a week, I have noticed a tremendous difference. My skin is glowing and people have noticed (actually asking if I&#x27;m using a different type of make-up). It&#x27;s not the make-up, it&#x27;s my skin. This products works and it is easy to use. I feel better about myself more today than I did last week. I&#x27;m ready for the world!!!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for those rough spots on your body. I use it weekly. I enjoy all of the Philosophy products and Amazon seems to have the best prices.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in a kit with other Philosophy items and loved it.  It makes your face really clean and is very gentle on the sensitive skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Love this product for middle aged skin, helps skin to rejuvenate!</li>
            <li> I love this wash because I feel like it is very gentle on my skin while still doing an excellent job at exfoliating. It&#x27;s scent and dye-free which is great because I have very sensitive skin and the beads are not too abrasive. Overall, it does a great job at keeping dry flakes away and I believe it helps loosen blackheads which really amps up the effectivness of other products I use to extract them.</li>
            <li> This product is one of those that make you wonder how you ever managed without it!  I use philosophy Purity before bed each night, and use the Microdelivery Wash every morning.  It has the most effective, yet gentlest exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever used.  There&#x27;s nothing quite like it.  Your skin will feel brand new every morning and your mirror will thank you for it!  Get it!!</li>
            <li> Loved this wash made my face feel clean but this isn&#x27;t a miracle product doesn&#x27;t vanish black heads. Made my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> The product has a pretty good size, but im not crazy about the smell. it just doesnt do it for me. I dont relly notice any mayor difference in the improvement of my skin. I dont know if its a good cleanser cause I dont wear makeup. My main complaint about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Sephora, but thought I&#x27;d save the trip and order on Amazon.  From the beginning the exfoliating substance was not distributed in the main cleanser and I would have to shake it vigorously to get even a little defoliator to come out.  I thought it would be ok if I put it upside down, but that would just make all the exfoliator accumulate at the cap.  nothing I did would make it distribute, so I gave up and threw it away.  I am assuming the batch was old or stored incorrectly in the warehouse.  Normally I love this cleanser, but will not be buying again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I just started using this last night and it made my skin feel more radiant and healthier after just one use.  I feel like exfoliators are definitely helpful in making my moisturizer more effective.  This product is gentle and I have dry skin that flakes a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and my mostly normal skin has started having random breakouts. I&#x27;m not sure what is up?!?  I switched back to this cleaner and it is much better.&lt;br /&gt;I use this pretty much daily. Occasionally I will use purity, but this seems to be better for my skin due to the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice texture with teeny tiny granules to scrub and has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the sweet inspirational blurb on the front like a lot of other philosophy products. I kind of like those ;)</li>
            <li> this is a great product. philosophy makes a terrific line for women.</li>
            <li> First off, I have very sensitive skin. I can never use a product without it drying out my skin or making my face turn red for days. Even the sensitive skin products turn my face red if I use them every day. This is the FIRST product that has yet to either of those things. It has cleared up my complextion, made my skin softer and since you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, lasts a long time. When I saw the $24 price tag, I was a little put off. It is worth it. I recommend this product to everyone and will continue to use it every day.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product as a face wash, but when I received it the cover had broken off and the product was spilled all over inside the package! It was a mess, &amp; I lost about 1/4 of the product.</li>
            <li> The best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Because the results were not Immediate, I can not say for sure, but it seems like the next day after using this product my face became dry and peely to the touch. Also mild burning sensation. Like a post sunburn almost ( and I have not been in the sun). It did not appear red but felt dry and corse). I am wondering if using this product again would be a big mistake.  My sister uses this often and has not had a similar reaction, my skin is more sensitive than hers definitely.</li>
            <li> I have experienced acne since I was in fourth grade and have spent probably thousands of dollars on different over the counter and prescription treatments.  I have also dealt with a lot of mixed emotions regarding my appearance and there is no doubt that I have had more than one or two comments about the bumps on my face.  My sister suggested this product after trying it for herself and I was a bit hesitant at first.  For the most part, whenever I would change my face wash, I would break out even more than what was already present.  However, I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I am, in all reality, shocked.  My face is clearing up and I actually have pretty nice skin underneath those bumps!  Even though I just started using this twice a day, I feel more confident and I really could not be happier.  I definitely suggest this product to anyone who has had some difficult times due to using products that never, ever worked.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for everyday use and perfect with Miami weather.  My skin has never looked so good.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing.  It makes my skin super smooth.  I have tried tons of different face washes and this is the only one I will use now.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I liked this product made my face feel clean but did not make my face feel soft. For the price I would not buy it again. The price was kinda high for face wash. Also I like a face wash that has alot of vitimans in it this product did not.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loves this facial wash... she swears if she doesn&#x27;t use this her face will break out. she also tells me her skin fills so soft... she absolutely swears by it.</li>
            <li> Cleansers the skin daily and leaves a radiant glow. I use it each morning followed by philosphy &amp;#34;Hope in a  Jar moisturizer&amp;#34;. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Immediate results.....skin so smooth! Use it every morning....great to start the day....wish I had ordered the super size ..great texture</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my skin since using this wash. I use it at night, followed by Hope in a Jar Night and I love the way my skin feels. I do sometimes need to wash twice to feel like I&#x27;ve done a really good job, though. Not much of a smell to it and it lightly lathers.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a really good exfoliater and leaves my skin feeling very very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It smells horrible, at least to me. I do not know how do describe it, but I have a major problem with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;-I use it once a week and it has been fine all excluding last week. I was probably because I had a sun burn on my face, but after rubbing it like usual, it started to sting a lot. However, that was just once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: A little of this product goes a long way; start by getting a small amount and then add more a needed. The first time I used it I took to much and I ended up rinsing a 3/4 of a handful down the drain.</li>
            <li> Had tried Purity before, this is the first I&#x27;ve used Philosophy and I like it even better.</li>
            <li> Works great for exfoliating my face without over drying it.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered this product.  I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;MLP</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Love how smooth my feels afterwards. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best (faintly medicinal), but not enough to warrant an under 5 star review.</li>
            <li> I really like the product but this bottle has got to go.  It is very difficult to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Well I do love this product. I gives a gentle exfoliation which keeps you complexion fresh and bright in a natural healthy way.  I use this once a day, its not too harsh on my 40+ skin. Thanks Philosophy !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this peel/cleanser.  Its great for skin that is prone to breakouts and has wrinkles.  I use it with Philosophy&#x27;s Take a Deep Breath and I love the combo.  My skin looks healthy and moisturized, and I have minimized wrinkles and not one pimple.  Its that good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes your face feel so good. It was delivered as promised. The packaging was overdone, this one 8oz. bottle was in a box 7&amp;#34;x 10&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34;high.</li>
            <li> I adore Philosophy products,&lt;br /&gt;and this one is at the top of&lt;br /&gt;my adoration list currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face feel so clean, and I get a glow if&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, and I am no spring chicken ! I will&lt;br /&gt;turn 62 in June of this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to any age ! â™¥</li>
            <li> I loved this! I love the little exfoliaters in it. They aren&#x27;t too rough and they make the skin feel extraordinary. I loved how this and the hope in a jar moisturizer would make my face feel and look but the moisturizer was just too gross. If I had a moisturizer to follow this up with I would definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine product. I have sensitive skin and also aging skin. Thought I would be red from the chemicals being too harsh. But if you use a small amount and don&#x27;t overdo it, the product works.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff daily and my skin has been so soft since I&#x27;ve started. Love it! Make sure to shake before you use it and be careful not to get it in your eyes - this stuff has diatomaceous earth in it and its not comfortable on your eyeballs.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love the gentle exfoliating!</li>
            <li> It was as expected. Good product.</li>
            <li> This was such a rip off product. After a couple of months of use, the exfoliating beads disappeared and it was just liquid. Now it&#x27;s useless. The entire time I was using this, the pop up lid kept getting clogged and I had to unscrew the top to get the product out. Will not buy this again. Save your money and avoid frustration by finding another product.</li>
            <li> After reading the rave reviews about this product not only on Amazon but also on Sephora, I was excited about buying this exfoliating wash. The product worked really well for a few months...This is why I was so disappointed when the exfoliating beads disappeared only within a few months! I have half the bottle left and all I have left is the cleanser. I am so disappointed that this happened after paying for the product. I don&#x27;t know if mine was a dud, but be wary that you might end up with disappearing beads within a few months!</li>
            <li> Finally I found something that does wonders for my skin! Occasionally I will get acne bumps on my forehead and this wash takes it away over night. Following the instructions will definitely help, 30-60 sec messaging on the face and it will leaving you feeling exfoliated and fresh. My face feels smooth after using it and also helps prevent acne!</li>
            <li> I used this for a long time now. I have problem skin, and must use this every morning. I&#x27;ve used other brands, but always go back to philosophy.</li>
            <li> Product works okay, have been happier with other exfoliating products I have used. Probably will go back to previous product.</li>
            <li> I use this at night with my clarisonic.  I absolutely couldn&#x27;t live without Purity is why I initially decided to try this.  When used in the 32 ounce size with the pump it comes out watery.  I recommend losing the pump or just buying in the 8 ounce size.</li>
            <li> The product itself from a manufacturer standpoint was fine but this stuff smells awful and I didn&#x27;t find myself seeing any great results after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> After trying a sample, I had to have this.  I don&#x27;t use this every day because I am afraid it would be too harsh.  It makes my skin feel smoother even after just one use.</li>
            <li> I use this wash almost daily in the shower and it really wakes up and softens my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great face wash.  I have combination skin and have tried everything from Pro-Activ to Clinique.  But I started using this and my skin has never been better, exfoliating but still gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> It really exfoliate dead skin cell.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the microdelivery exfoliating wash based on all the great reviews it&#x27;s got but I&#x27;m truly disappointed with the product. It is supposed to be a face wash AND exfoliator and it fails in both categories.  I use  it with my Clarisonic brush  and it does not leather up at all,  for  the whole minute it feels like I&#x27;m running a dry brush over my face. I was using Lancome CrÃ¨me radiance before, which is amazing (going  back to it).  As far  as its exfoliating properties - nothing to write home about either, the beads are tiny and you won&#x27;t get a serious exfoliation like with  using products specifically designed for this;  a twice a week scrab will give you  way better results that the daily \\&quot;exfoliation\\&quot; you  get from  this product. Finally to top it all - I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, can&#x27;t really describe it but it&#x27;s  a mix of cheap detergent and medication.  I  will keep using it because I don&#x27;t  have time to deal with returning it and it&#x27;s kind of pricey to throw away  but will definitely not purchase again.</li>
            <li> i love this face wash SOOO much i always had HORRIBLE acne and this cleared it up so quickly .. it dries your face out if you use it every day but it really does work</li>
            <li> I like the philosophy product line, which is what made me buy this product from philosophy. I would say that It&#x27;s an okay product when it comes to exfoliating. Neither I can say it&#x27;s great nor I hate. It&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to purchase this MAGNIFICENT product.  It works beautifully on all types of skin. Just a dime&#x27;s worth on your hands and your skin looks lovely afterward, and your makeup is much nicer on since all of the dead skin cells are gone!  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliator.  Barely has any scent (if any) which is great because I have fragrance allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/15 - after a couple of months of having this product and only a few uses, all of the beads dissolved and it can no longer be used for exfoliation.  I still use it as a face wash but that&#x27;s what I bought the Philosophy Purity Made Simple for so I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother.  Very gentle exfoliant so I can use every day if I want.  When I use in conjunction with my face steamer and brushes, I definitely get the best results.  A little expensive -- but a little goes a long way.  I got the 8oz and have had for a month and am not even halfway through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I wish I had better results with this product.  Nonetheless, I know it is a good product and I know it has helped to clean up my skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and I love it.  It&#x27;s effective, yet gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a rating of ten points I would! This is an amazing product. I use it every morning as part of my daily routine and have done so for over a year now. Before Microdelivery my facial skin dull and dry. I had blemishes and  an uneven skin tone. Now my face is smooth and radiant and I saw my first blemish today since using this. I frequently recieve compliments from complete strangers on my complexion and when guessing my age people usually guess 10 years younger.  I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this product loud enough. Try it please, it will not disappoint you!</li>
            <li> i first bought this a macys and loved it my face feels clean and fresh after using this the scrub is a fine non course scrub cleanser the price including the shipping was cheaper than the store not to mention the travel time to the store since not all macys sells this product&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend the product and seller packaging was perfect and arrival was on time 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the best exfoliating cleanser, so I figured I&#x27;d try the Philosophy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing you notice is that it can come out sort of runny and thin...seems to be important to give it a good shake to mix things up. The fragrance is mild and barely noticeable. I like the beads - they&#x27;re small, more like grains of fine sand than anything. It also rinses off cleanly without residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well...after a few days, your skin seems fresher and smoother, although in my case, also somewhat drier - switching to an every-other-day schedule solves that. Bottom line is that it seems about average for the better products. Worth a try, especially if you like Philosophy products generally.</li>
            <li> AS IN ALL PHILOSOPHY PRODUCTS IT DELIVERS WHAT IT CLAIMS.  I LOVE THIS SCRUB.  NO BAD  REACTIO TO ITS USE AND IT WORKS WELL.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  LOOK AROUND ON THE NET AND YOU CAN FIND ANY PHILOSOPHY PRODUCTS YOU LIKE WITHOUT PAYING THE BRANDS HIGHER PRICES AT RETAIL STORES.</li>
            <li> I have thick, oily skin and using this product after washing with neem soap has transformed my skin. I was impressed with the softness of the granules and the fact that it didn&#x27;t have perfume to make me sneeze. I have switched from a Clinique roduct to this one and definitely a satisfied customer. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, the whole Philosophy Line works wonders on my face,hands and body</li>
            <li> One of the few face washes that I can use.  I am surprised as it has chemicals and fillers that should cause issues with my face, but do not. I leave it on as a mask for 5-10 minutes after massaging it in.  Then, I gently massage it more after getting it wet, then I rinse.Good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just amazing. Everyone I know uses it no matter what their skin type. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I have dull, combination fair skin with little acne. It brightens my face and makes my skin so smooth. My mother also uses it and it helps with fine lines and wrinkles. My sister suffers from moderate to severe acne, has very sensitive skin(she literally can&#x27;t wear make up)and she also loves it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Best stuff ever will not use anything else ever. Have tried other brands and always go back to philosophy.</li>
            <li> this is the only exfoliator i use. i alternate this with purity made simple. i love philosophy! think i gotta try a moisturizer by them soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years.  I think it&#x27;s good to exfoliate your skin and this product is a good one.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I have ever used in all my 35 years of life (and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything, including ProActiv). My skin looks and feels amazing. I like to use this in the morning (gentle enough to use daily) and follow up with Purity at night.</li>
            <li> I love this skin care product.Philosophy produces excellent quality products.I would recommend this exfoliater to anyone who wants a smooth beautiful face.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t made a visible difference for me. Maybe I need a stronger exfoliant.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! Bright beautiful skin at 50+ years old!!</li>
            <li> Great for acne. Gentle.</li>
            <li> Love it! Have purchased multiple times.</li>
            <li> this was the first time I used this product and I&#x27;m glad I did because it works so well at exfoliating my face!  I can instantly see a difference in the texture and smoothness of my complexion.  My make up glides on after using this product.  This one bottle has lasted me since March and still have plenty left.  You only need a small amount to get the job done.  I will continue to buy this product because it&#x27;s a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I ended up breaking out really bad and felt like I could never fully get the soap off my face. Left me feeling grimy. Oh, and did I mention it made me break out pretty bad?</li>
