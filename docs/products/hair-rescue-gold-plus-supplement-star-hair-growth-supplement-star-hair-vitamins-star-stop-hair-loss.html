            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>As well as eating the right foods and treating your hair with some good hair growth products, there are some wonderful supplements like the Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Supplement that will ensure your hair is growing at its top speed.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It’s also nice that it’s Made in the USA in an FDA approved GMP facility.</li>
            <li>As someone who was resigned to my hair getting thinner and thinner as years go by (it runs in my family) and clogging the drain and brush consistently I am THRILLED with the results.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to know that they also offer a supplement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving it.</li>

            <li>When I saw the wonderful reviews for Hair Rescue Gold, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li>The hair rescue gold plus supplements are truely my savior!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used shampoos and other treatments for my thinning hair, with fair results, at best.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve remembered if it sounds to good to be true</li>

            <li>It works magic  </li>

            <li>For even better results, the tablets can be used in conjunction with Hair Rescue Gold shampoo.</li>
            <li>My fault, I should be more diligent when ordering.  </li>
            <li>If it takes more than 1, should probably mention that</li>
            <li>I use the Hair Rescue GOLD shampoo, which I love, as well.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i would also recommend  using it in conjunction with hair rescue Gold  shampoo for even  more healthier and thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hair growth product, and none of them worked.</li>
            <li>My hair is now softer, thicker, shinier and even has more volume.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it works wonders</li>
            <li>Its sensation on my scalp was refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years to address my thinning, shedding hair.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is safe and is FDA approved.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products like this one and none of them have worked as well as this.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the hair rescue line, so I had to try to these vitamins</li>
            <li>and I love them as well.</li>
            <li>I truley love the vitamins.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Most products do not work.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with using Hair Rescue to treat what&#x27;s causing my hair thinning problem.</li>
            <li>I suspect many reviews are false/by the manufacturer</li>
            <li>I love them both</li>
            <li>The fact that these are approved by the FDA makes me feel even that much better about using them.</li>
            <li>It has more volume and bounce, my hair feels like it did when I was in my 20s.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>anticipate purchasing many bottles of this going forward given the inital results.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>and you will be able to see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended many products, and this one happened to be on her list.</li>
            <li>Plus, the hair I had has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I love the results I have experience with Hair Rescue  </li>
            <li>It worked for me and many others....</li>
            <li>Having purchased this before, I am glad it it available on amazon!</li>
            <li>and i will be buying more of it as soon as I need to</li>
            <li>That means more of the good stuff in the supplements actually gets absorbed into the body so it can work to make your hair beautiful.</li>
            <li>Many people don’t realize that diet plays a huge role in the health of hair.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist, my friends, my mom and most importantly me...</li>
            <li>Aside from being a good vitamin supplement, this product really performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product is a good value and it really works.</li>
            <li>Buy this and introduce an amazing thing into your life right now.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients listed were recognizable and known to be healthy for you!</li>
            <li>that breaks easily?</li>
            <li>Great results 1st time trying and just starting to see healthy hair results.</li>
            <li>I can feel that strong thickness where it&#x27;s growing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go without saying that we are what we eat, and for strong hair, nutritionists swear by the powers of protein.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this to anyone struggling with hair loss or thinning.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are easy to understand, have been side effect free and the results are noted.</li>
            <li>Excited to continue use and get the full benefit!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of contents, the supplements contain a variety of important vitamins and minerals, including biotin, zinc and selenium.</li>
            <li>This product does precisely as it promises - it halts hair loss and promotes hair growth.  </li>
            <li>This was really important to me.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The formula is drug free and is made in the U.S. at a GMP facility, so it’s safe to use and contains exactly what it says it</li>
            <li>and it is significantly thicker and has grown.</li>
            <li>but know I&#x27;ve noticed significant growth in my hair.</li>
            <li>This supplement does exactly what it says it will do: promote healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li>Within 2-weeks, i started noticing my hair becoming fuller, thicker, and overall more healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use special serums or conditioners that just cover up the problem anymore.</li>
            <li>I am super excited to see a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>What really makes Hair Rescue Gold Plus Supplements work better than the competition is that they contain betaine hydrochloride in the formula, which improves vitamin and mineral absorption.</li>
            <li>Took full month supply.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, after doing some careful research, I landed on this product and I&#x27;m soooo glad i did, I will order this again!!</li>
            <li>I have seen a tremendous difference since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Hair Growth Supplement Hair Vitamins is a treatment to rebirth the hair you have by awakening the roots from the 20 different vitamins and nutrients that are implemented into the product to make your hair healthy and to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is definitely thicker allowing me to feel more confident that you can&#x27;t see my scalp any longer.</li>
            <li>Also I have noticed the new growth coming in having a softer feel and more dense than before.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the stomach, and easy to swallow.  </li>
            <li>I see a real difference in the fullness and strength of my hair since adding this supplement!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting to note that these are only available on Amazon USA and not on Amazon UK.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my the roots of my hair feel stronger, and my hair has such a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>I decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and this one far exceeds the rest.</li>
            <li>My wife can&#x27;t stop running her fingers through it and telling me how soft and healthy it feels.</li>
            <li>So it is definately worth trying for yourself...</li>
            <li>My hair has never been thicker and I&#x27;m excited to see how much it&#x27;ll grow in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>so I wanted to find something that would target hair loss right away before it started.</li>
            <li>After about a week of taking it, she noticed new, strong hair growing.</li>
            <li>After about a week of taking it, I saw new, strong hair growing in that, for once, wasn&#x27;t falling out in clumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to continue this product and see my new hair!</li>
            <li>Since I have that shampoo, it was kind of hard to tell which one has a greater effect.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product from a friend who is quickly losing what hair he has and decided to order a bottle as it was not very expensive.</li>
            <li>but I can say that it does give me a stomach ache if I don&#x27;t eat something first.</li>
            <li>This is my first use...</li>
            <li>My wife has had thinning since we have been married.  </li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>It says exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Mostly, they don&#x27;t work, so I decided to try a different method: a hair growth supplement that treats my hair from the inside out.  </li>
            <li>Finally I have come to the conclusion better quality hair is going to need to come from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair overall feels thicker, it has a bit more body</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a month, and even though I continually forget to take all three doses each day, I have really noticed a change!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something really for the thinness and this product helped with everything!</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s not only what we do to our hair and use on our hair, but also what&#x27;s inside our bodies that effects how healthy our hair skin and nails are.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently and have noticed that my hair has gotten thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use  Thanks!</li>
            <li>Hair Rescue did exactly that to my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes time to see the results at first, but you wake up one day knowing your hair is thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li>However, the question I&#x27;ve been always asking is: can oral supplements really help you get healthy, full long hair?</li>
            <li>I have so far been taking this supplement for several weeks with noticeable increase in hair thickness and density (as well as nail growth!), and will need to give it more time to evaluate its full effect.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this my hair was color damaged and thinning, I&#x27;ve gone through so many products and this one has really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I do love the idea of being able to take 20 supplements and stay stress free which its been helping a lot, can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few months have in store!</li>
            <li>I did and I have nothing but positive reviews.</li>
            <li>the hair shaft  from inside and out and promotes long, lustrous healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li>I have added this to my daily supplements and I&#x27;m enjoying my new look!</li>
            <li>My new healthy hair is starting to show after years of color dye damage.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product because it really works!</li>
            <li>However, popping a pill can make a huge difference, but only if you remember to take it correctly, and always with a meal.</li>
            <li>Hair has been looking and feeling fuller which is a huge plus for those with hair growth issues such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was my last ditch effort and it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The discontinued supplements seemed to be really working , along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner I have been using from amazon as well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to accelerate the growth I&#x27;ve had by using hair rescue shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much thicker and fuller</li>
            <li>I have had no negative side effects, these tablets do exactly what they say they do.</li>
            <li>I really recommend them to anyone who wants fuller and stronger hair.</li>
            <li>This supplement works really well.</li>
            <li>My hair had started thinning and it was really bothering me, so I did some research online</li>
            <li>Once I started taking this supplement my hair began to grow and it felt much thicker as well.</li>
            <li>Consider this worth a try if you are experiencing hair loss and want a natural alternative to combat the problem.</li>
            <li>Never the less my wife was more than willing to try them out</li>
            <li>I’ve taken other supplements with fair results, but I have to say after taking this product about 3 weeks I’m actually starting to see results.  </li>
            <li>While so many other products can&#x27;t deliver results this one delivers.</li>
            <li>This works so much better other products that I have tried</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that Hair Rescue contains many vitamins and nutrients which have helped to significantly boost my hair growth, moisturize my dry scalp, and leave my hair looking shiny and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I first started off with the Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo, and in addition I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this herbal supplement.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product combined with the hair growth shampoo by the same brand is doing wonders for my natural fine and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely a new customer for life!</li>
            <li>Plus there is new hair growth!</li>
            <li>Definitely a new customer for life!</li>
            <li>Nutrients such as selenium zinc are essential add biotin and more, researched and balanced</li>
            <li>id buy again, and i highly recommend to others...</li>
            <li>Ever since high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but if your mane is damaged, this will certainly put a block on your natural growth cycle.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the investment and benefits not only my hair but my fingernails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scalp treatments in the past that have worked OK but the Hair Rescue Gold is really a turbo charger for hair growth.</li>
            <li>If you are like me, you are on a never ending quest for full long hair, and then you might be intrigued to hear that Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Supplement might just have the answer to your follicle dreams.</li>
            <li>The other brand I was getting from amazon is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like there is new volume and lift to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have peach fuzz along my hair line, NEW HAIR GROWTH after 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li>and once I started taking this, I started noticing new sprouts and thicker looking hair as well.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; new hair growth</li>
            <li>After years of processing my hair with color, straightening treatments, heating tools and again back to curling my hair has suffered needless to say incredible loss and volume.</li>
            <li>I have super corse, dry hair and cannot seem to get it to grow for the life of me.  </li>
            <li>When I brush my hair, I no longer have a brush full of hair every single time!</li>
            <li>and I’m surprised to already see what I’d call “baby hairs” appearing at the front of my hairline!</li>
            <li>So Now onto the second bottle and first review.</li>
            <li>It saves me a trip to the only Brick and Mortar store that consistently has it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so maybe her feed back will eventually prove positive.  </li>
            <li>I would lose large clumps of hair in the shower, and my hair was constantly shedding and noticeably thinner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>and I’ve also stopped using anything with alcohol in it as far as styling goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Am ready to order my next bottle!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much my hair has grown in the last 3 months from using this product.</li>
            <li>I initially wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about taking vitamins to help hair growth because I&#x27;ve only used to products such as shampoo and such but take my word for it,</li>
            <li>the affects that it had on my hair far outweigh anything else.</li>
            <li>It actually works and it works fast.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten thicker and a natural shine now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>So the 30-day return policy is actually 30 days minus the several days it takes to ship it to you, which could be a week or more.</li>
            <li>Will update in a complete month.</li>
            <li>These supplements are formulated to give the body everything it needs to grow thick, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my toe nails are becoming stronger since they tend to break all the time and after taking this supplement, my nails are actually breaking less.</li>
            <li>Anyways I&#x27;ve noticed quite a bit of new open pores on my head and new hairs sprouting out.</li>
            <li>Instead of consuming the recommended dosage of three capsules at one time, I have only take one pill with breakfast and lunch (a total of two pills daily), and I still reap the full benefits.</li>
            <li>The pill is fairly large and isn&#x27;t necessarily a nuisance to swallow if you are used to taking larger pills.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard not to love something that actually works.</li>
            <li>After only two weeks of use I saw clear improvements in my hair&#x27;s quality and hair growth was clear where I have been balding.</li>
            <li>I saw results in such a short time and this product has really restored my confidence in my hair.</li>
            <li>Now, not only is my hair growing faster, but it looks and feels really healthy and thick too.</li>
            <li>I had a major issue with hair loss because of health issues and it seemed like nothing was working.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks of taking this supplement, my hair feels so much stronger, barely no strands in my shower drain, and my hair doesn&#x27;t have that flat feeling at the roots.</li>
            <li>I have been taking this product for around 2 weeks now with the recommended dosage and am surprised to say that not only does my hair look fuller and thicker but also just alot healthier</li>
            <li>After many years of abusing my hair with dying, styling, and blow drying, my hair was brittle and broken.  </li>
            <li>It sucks it took me so long to find something that really works!!!!</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and product works extremely well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other things and have had mixed results, but the vitamins in this product really seem to do something for my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this product Hair Rescue again because I&#x27;m surprised at the results a long with another product I have been using, which I will leave out of this review unless requested.</li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower, and its overall condition is like it was when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower, and its overall condition is like it was when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fuller and thicker now, and I don&#x27;t have little strands of hair falling out so much like before.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products like this one and none of them have worked as well as this.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the hair rescue line, so I had to try to these vitamins</li>
            <li> and I love them as well.</li>
            <li> I truley love the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> Most products do not work.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with using Hair Rescue to treat what&#x27;s causing my hair thinning problem.</li>
            <li> I suspect many reviews are false/by the manufacturer</li>

            <li> The fact that these are approved by the FDA makes me feel even that much better about using them.</li>
            <li> It has more volume and bounce, my hair feels like it did when I was in my 20s.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>

            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> and you will be able to see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended many products, and this one happened to be on her list.</li>
            <li> Plus, the hair I had has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I love the results I have experience with Hair Rescue  </li>
            <li> It worked for me and many others....</li>
            <li> Having purchased this before, I am glad it it available on amazon!</li>
            <li> and i will be buying more of it as soon as I need to</li>
            <li> That means more of the good stuff in the supplements actually gets absorbed into the body so it can work to make your hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> Many people don’t realize that diet plays a huge role in the health of hair.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist, my friends, my mom and most importantly me...</li>
            <li> Aside from being a good vitamin supplement, this product really performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is a good value and it really works.</li>
            <li> Buy this and introduce an amazing thing into your life right now.</li>
            <li> All the ingredients listed were recognizable and known to be healthy for you!</li>
            <li> that breaks easily?</li>
            <li> Great results 1st time trying and just starting to see healthy hair results.</li>
            <li> I can feel that strong thickness where it&#x27;s growing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go without saying that we are what we eat, and for strong hair, nutritionists swear by the powers of protein.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this to anyone struggling with hair loss or thinning.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are easy to understand, have been side effect free and the results are noted.</li>
            <li> Excited to continue use and get the full benefit!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of contents, the supplements contain a variety of important vitamins and minerals, including biotin, zinc and selenium.</li>
            <li> This product does precisely as it promises - it halts hair loss and promotes hair growth.  </li>
            <li> This was really important to me.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The formula is drug free and is made in the U.S. at a GMP facility, so it’s safe to use and contains exactly what it says it</li>
            <li> and it is significantly thicker and has grown.</li>
            <li> but know I&#x27;ve noticed significant growth in my hair.</li>
            <li> This supplement does exactly what it says it will do: promote healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li> Within 2-weeks, i started noticing my hair becoming fuller, thicker, and overall more healthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use special serums or conditioners that just cover up the problem anymore.</li>
            <li> I am super excited to see a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> What really makes Hair Rescue Gold Plus Supplements work better than the competition is that they contain betaine hydrochloride in the formula, which improves vitamin and mineral absorption.</li>
            <li> Took full month supply.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, after doing some careful research, I landed on this product and I&#x27;m soooo glad i did, I will order this again!!</li>
            <li> I have seen a tremendous difference since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Hair Growth Supplement Hair Vitamins is a treatment to rebirth the hair you have by awakening the roots from the 20 different vitamins and nutrients that are implemented into the product to make your hair healthy and to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is definitely thicker allowing me to feel more confident that you can&#x27;t see my scalp any longer.</li>
            <li> Also I have noticed the new growth coming in having a softer feel and more dense than before.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the stomach, and easy to swallow.  </li>
            <li> I see a real difference in the fullness and strength of my hair since adding this supplement!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to note that these are only available on Amazon USA and not on Amazon UK.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my the roots of my hair feel stronger, and my hair has such a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> I decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and this one far exceeds the rest.</li>
            <li> My wife can&#x27;t stop running her fingers through it and telling me how soft and healthy it feels.</li>
            <li> So it is definately worth trying for yourself...</li>
            <li> My hair has never been thicker and I&#x27;m excited to see how much it&#x27;ll grow in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> so I wanted to find something that would target hair loss right away before it started.</li>
            <li> After about a week of taking it, she noticed new, strong hair growing.</li>
            <li> After about a week of taking it, I saw new, strong hair growing in that, for once, wasn&#x27;t falling out in clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to continue this product and see my new hair!</li>
            <li> Since I have that shampoo, it was kind of hard to tell which one has a greater effect.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend who is quickly losing what hair he has and decided to order a bottle as it was not very expensive.</li>
            <li> but I can say that it does give me a stomach ache if I don&#x27;t eat something first.</li>
            <li> This is my first use...</li>
            <li> My wife has had thinning since we have been married.  </li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> It says exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Mostly, they don&#x27;t work, so I decided to try a different method: a hair growth supplement that treats my hair from the inside out.  </li>
            <li> Finally I have come to the conclusion better quality hair is going to need to come from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair overall feels thicker, it has a bit more body</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a month, and even though I continually forget to take all three doses each day, I have really noticed a change!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something really for the thinness and this product helped with everything!</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s not only what we do to our hair and use on our hair, but also what&#x27;s inside our bodies that effects how healthy our hair skin and nails are.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it consistently and have noticed that my hair has gotten thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Hair Rescue did exactly that to my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes time to see the results at first, but you wake up one day knowing your hair is thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li> However, the question I&#x27;ve been always asking is: can oral supplements really help you get healthy, full long hair?</li>
            <li> I have so far been taking this supplement for several weeks with noticeable increase in hair thickness and density (as well as nail growth!), and will need to give it more time to evaluate its full effect.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this my hair was color damaged and thinning, I&#x27;ve gone through so many products and this one has really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I do love the idea of being able to take 20 supplements and stay stress free which its been helping a lot, can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few months have in store!</li>
            <li> I did and I have nothing but positive reviews.</li>
            <li> the hair shaft  from inside and out and promotes long, lustrous healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have added this to my daily supplements and I&#x27;m enjoying my new look!</li>
            <li> My new healthy hair is starting to show after years of color dye damage.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product because it really works!</li>
            <li> However, popping a pill can make a huge difference, but only if you remember to take it correctly, and always with a meal.</li>
            <li> Hair has been looking and feeling fuller which is a huge plus for those with hair growth issues such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was my last ditch effort and it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The discontinued supplements seemed to be really working , along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner I have been using from amazon as well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to accelerate the growth I&#x27;ve had by using hair rescue shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> I have had no negative side effects, these tablets do exactly what they say they do.</li>
            <li> I really recommend them to anyone who wants fuller and stronger hair.</li>
            <li> This supplement works really well.</li>
            <li> My hair had started thinning and it was really bothering me, so I did some research online</li>
            <li> Once I started taking this supplement my hair began to grow and it felt much thicker as well.</li>
            <li> Consider this worth a try if you are experiencing hair loss and want a natural alternative to combat the problem.</li>
            <li> Never the less my wife was more than willing to try them out</li>
            <li> I’ve taken other supplements with fair results, but I have to say after taking this product about 3 weeks I’m actually starting to see results.  </li>
            <li> While so many other products can&#x27;t deliver results this one delivers.</li>
            <li> This works so much better other products that I have tried</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that Hair Rescue contains many vitamins and nutrients which have helped to significantly boost my hair growth, moisturize my dry scalp, and leave my hair looking shiny and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I first started off with the Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo, and in addition I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this herbal supplement.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product combined with the hair growth shampoo by the same brand is doing wonders for my natural fine and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new customer for life!</li>
            <li> Plus there is new hair growth!</li>
            <li> Definitely a new customer for life!</li>
            <li> Nutrients such as selenium zinc are essential add biotin and more, researched and balanced</li>
            <li> id buy again, and i highly recommend to others...</li>
            <li> Ever since high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but if your mane is damaged, this will certainly put a block on your natural growth cycle.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the investment and benefits not only my hair but my fingernails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scalp treatments in the past that have worked OK but the Hair Rescue Gold is really a turbo charger for hair growth.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you are on a never ending quest for full long hair, and then you might be intrigued to hear that Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Supplement might just have the answer to your follicle dreams.</li>
            <li> The other brand I was getting from amazon is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like there is new volume and lift to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have peach fuzz along my hair line, NEW HAIR GROWTH after 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li> and once I started taking this, I started noticing new sprouts and thicker looking hair as well.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; new hair growth</li>
            <li> After years of processing my hair with color, straightening treatments, heating tools and again back to curling my hair has suffered needless to say incredible loss and volume.</li>
            <li> I have super corse, dry hair and cannot seem to get it to grow for the life of me.  </li>
            <li> When I brush my hair, I no longer have a brush full of hair every single time!</li>
            <li> and I’m surprised to already see what I’d call “baby hairs” appearing at the front of my hairline!</li>
            <li> So Now onto the second bottle and first review.</li>
            <li> It saves me a trip to the only Brick and Mortar store that consistently has it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so maybe her feed back will eventually prove positive.  </li>
            <li> I would lose large clumps of hair in the shower, and my hair was constantly shedding and noticeably thinner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> and I’ve also stopped using anything with alcohol in it as far as styling goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Am ready to order my next bottle!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much my hair has grown in the last 3 months from using this product.</li>
            <li> I initially wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about taking vitamins to help hair growth because I&#x27;ve only used to products such as shampoo and such but take my word for it,</li>
            <li> the affects that it had on my hair far outweigh anything else.</li>
            <li> It actually works and it works fast.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten thicker and a natural shine now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> So the 30-day return policy is actually 30 days minus the several days it takes to ship it to you, which could be a week or more.</li>
            <li> Will update in a complete month.</li>
            <li> These supplements are formulated to give the body everything it needs to grow thick, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my toe nails are becoming stronger since they tend to break all the time and after taking this supplement, my nails are actually breaking less.</li>
            <li> Anyways I&#x27;ve noticed quite a bit of new open pores on my head and new hairs sprouting out.</li>
            <li> Instead of consuming the recommended dosage of three capsules at one time, I have only take one pill with breakfast and lunch (a total of two pills daily), and I still reap the full benefits.</li>
            <li> The pill is fairly large and isn&#x27;t necessarily a nuisance to swallow if you are used to taking larger pills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard not to love something that actually works.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of use I saw clear improvements in my hair&#x27;s quality and hair growth was clear where I have been balding.</li>
            <li> I saw results in such a short time and this product has really restored my confidence in my hair.</li>
            <li> Now, not only is my hair growing faster, but it looks and feels really healthy and thick too.</li>
            <li> I had a major issue with hair loss because of health issues and it seemed like nothing was working.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of taking this supplement, my hair feels so much stronger, barely no strands in my shower drain, and my hair doesn&#x27;t have that flat feeling at the roots.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for around 2 weeks now with the recommended dosage and am surprised to say that not only does my hair look fuller and thicker but also just alot healthier</li>
            <li> After many years of abusing my hair with dying, styling, and blow drying, my hair was brittle and broken.  </li>
            <li> It sucks it took me so long to find something that really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable and product works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things and have had mixed results, but the vitamins in this product really seem to do something for my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product Hair Rescue again because I&#x27;m surprised at the results a long with another product I have been using, which I will leave out of this review unless requested.</li>
            <li> My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower, and its overall condition is like it was when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li> My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower, and its overall condition is like it was when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fuller and thicker now, and I don&#x27;t have little strands of hair falling out so much like before.</li>
            <li> After my last pregnancy, my hair began to thin out significantly.</li>
            <li> I see new hair growing and my receding hairline is much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to make a recommendation</li>
            <li> I have breakage from ​years of double processing (I&#x27;ve had pink hair since high-school) and had to cut it short to minimize further damage.</li>
            <li> Dying my hair left it lifeless stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> A complete &amp; utter waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shampoos and other topical treatments for my thinning hair, with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> Smells strange</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked for me long term, until I found this product.  </li>
            <li> that’s fine and thin, results can start to be seen in as little as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple months now and it doesn&#x27;t take long to start seeing results!  </li>
            <li> Do you have brittle dry hair  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin also wasn&#x27;t so dry.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of personal use, my hair has seen the same results!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve noticed very little difference in my head of hair.</li>
            <li> and this is a product i will continue to use and pass down the line to the future generations..</li>
            <li> My hair was looking very dry and damaged,I used  Hair Rescue Gold Plus Supplement.</li>
            <li> Before using this supplement, I was getting frustrated with  many of my loose hair strands falling everywhere, even when I just run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> These supplements do however have a bitter taste to them, so i take them with juice, or flavored water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO side effects.</li>
            <li> I had started to see the signs of a receding hairline at my forehead, but after a few weeks with this product, I was seeing the fulness come back to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have seen much less shedding, and my dry scalp is even improving.  </li>
            <li> After only a few weeks I could let my hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair just will not grow past my shoulders and I&#x27;m hopeful for the future.</li>
            <li> At first, I was so skeptical about ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first to try this product, but after seeing it work for a friend of mine</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My hair has always been thin and so flat but with these tablets it has become just the opposite fuller and even healthier.</li>
            <li> The average head of hair grows 1 inch every month</li>
            <li> My hair started thinning in my late teens, so I&#x27;ve tried tons of different treatments - shampoos, creams, pills, you name it - but nothing helped.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use of the supplements I notice stronger hair with noticeably less breakage.</li>
            <li> The supplement has an odd after taste which leaves soon after you swallow.</li>
            <li> About half way through the bottle</li>
            <li> I have been taking these tablets for a week now and have noticed less hair coming out of my head and in the sink drain.</li>
            <li> I have used them for about a month and a half and see a noticeable change in my hair.</li>
            <li> You notice less and less of it in the drain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt my hair so thick and long before</li>
            <li> I used shampoos and other hair treatments for my hair which is really thin, with mixed results.</li>
            <li> Usually when you’re trying to speed your hair growth and make your hair healthier and slow hair loss you have to use three different products.</li>
            <li> Also my nails feel a little stronger and don&#x27;t break as often as before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months</li>
            <li> saw results within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier already after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I’ve always been a firm believer in what you put on the inside</li>
            <li> Give it a few weeks as directed and regain your confidence.</li>
            <li> Cant speak to its efficacy but it really really smells bad.  </li>
            <li> After much deep conditioning, failed hair masks &amp; growth treatments - I went out on a limb and decided to try hair rescue...</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the Hair Rescue GOLD Shampoo for the past three weeks</li>
            <li> BUT Hair Rescue + Gold is just what I been missing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after taking this supplement for a few months !</li>
            <li> Unlike other products, this also doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell, so it&#x27;s not embarrassing to apply and leave the house shortly after.</li>
            <li> These supplements do seem to be making my hair fuller to the touch &amp; not so thin feeling &amp; so much less hair in my brush &amp; drain.</li>
            <li> and no male hair breakage during this cold snowy winter.</li>
            <li> my hair has been shedding leaving it very thin, weak, and it has been very dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, the vitamins stink like all get-out when the bottle is opened, but you don&#x27;t get bad breath from them, and as long as they are taken with food, no stomach upset, either.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair loss, weak or lifeless hair, give Hair Rescue the chance to rescue your hair.</li>
            <li> it usually is!!</li>
            <li> Are you tired of products that never does what it says?</li>
            <li> In fact, a lot of the name brand products just made the problem worse.</li>
            <li> I am on an oral chemotherapy medicine and although I have always suffered from thin hair, my boyfriend began commenting on all my hair he had been finding around the house.</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic difference in the amount of shedding I experience.</li>
            <li> i mean I was really desperate to find a solution.</li>
            <li> The supplement isn&#x27;t too expensive and you get a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li> My hair still falling like crazy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bad balding area on the crown of my head for some time</li>
            <li> The product was not that bad.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The other brand I was getting from amazon is no longer available.  Reading both labels they seem to have the same in both bottles. The discontinued supplements seemed to be really working , along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner I have been using from amazon as well. These supplements do however have a bitter taste to them, so i take them with juice, or flavored water. These supplements do seem to be making my hair fuller to the touch &amp; not so thin feeling &amp; so much less hair in my brush &amp; drain. I will continue to take them.&lt;br /&gt;💊THANKS FOR READING, BYE💊</li>
            <li> My hair was looking very dry and damaged,I used  Hair Rescue Gold Plus Supplement. It works magic  The amount of time and I notice the difference.  I totally would buy this product again again.  You must try it .</li>
            <li> My hair is growing faster i can tell by my roots since I dye my hair. It is also thicker and fuller. This supplement works</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to make a recommendation but I can say that it does give me a stomach ache if I don&#x27;t eat something first.</li>
            <li> I have so far been taking this supplement for several weeks with noticeable increase in hair thickness and density (as well as nail growth!), and will need to give it more time to evaluate its full effect. Its great for the price but wish I can find it locally so I would not have to wait on shipping each time.</li>
            <li> My new healthy hair is starting to show after years of color dye damage. Before using this supplement, I was getting frustrated with  many of my loose hair strands falling everywhere, even when I just run my fingers through my hair. After 4 weeks of taking this supplement, my hair feels so much stronger, barely no strands in my shower drain, and my hair doesn&#x27;t have that flat feeling at the roots. It&#x27;s like there is new volume and lift to my hair. I can feel that strong thickness where it&#x27;s growing. The hay-like texture that I once felt all over has softened, which makes me so relieved. I&#x27;m really excited to continue this product and see my new hair!</li>
            <li> This product is ideal for anyone looking to thicken up their hair. My friend Jeremy has been using it for several months and I have personally seen the results with him. After a few weeks of personal use, my hair has seen the same results! I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
            <li> 1st time trying this product ,10days in. and just starting to see results. Even being outdoors with a hat on at work, I see healthy hair. and no male hair breakage during this cold snowy winter. Just to let anyone know, there are a lot of great vitamins in this product. I think women can use this as well. I will buy this again, once I finish this bottle.  I am adding the following I am being harassed by some Punk named: Dean Whittington. He asked a ?? and I gave him my answer in my opinion. Which I will add.. I&#x27;m 48 have male pattern baldness, and work out doors. He think supplements are a scam as they are not FDA approved. It seems that he has no idea and has never walked into a GNC or Vitamnin shop in the US. No supplements are FDA approved. Maybe he is bald and he&#x27;s out of luck. But I want to keep my hair and youth. and will try anything once.  AMAZON, if he continues to harass me, I will take it court.</li>
            <li> Works. Improved my hair thickness and strength. Also my nails feel a little stronger and don&#x27;t break as often as before.</li>
            <li> Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Supplements address hair loss from the inside, out. Many people don’t realize that diet plays a huge role in the health of hair. These supplements are formulated to give the body everything it needs to grow thick, healthy hair. They work for men or women and for people like me with hair that’s fine and thin, results can start to be seen in as little as 2 weeks. For even better results, the tablets can be used in conjunction with Hair Rescue Gold shampoo. Each bottle contains 90 tablets, which is enough to last for 30 days (you take 3 a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablets work to strengthen your existing hair so that it doesn’t break or pull out and it also addresses the root cause of hair loss (no pun intended). The formula is drug free and is made in the U.S. at a GMP facility, so it’s safe to use and contains exactly what it says it contains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of contents, the supplements contain a variety of important vitamins and minerals, including biotin, zinc and selenium. Zinc is known to boost hair growth and strengthen hair follicles. You’ll find zinc in a lot of hair growth shampoos and supplements. What really makes Hair Rescue Gold Plus Supplements work better than the competition is that they contain betaine hydrochloride in the formula, which improves vitamin and mineral absorption. That means more of the good stuff in the supplements actually gets absorbed into the body so it can work to make your hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> I like this product. So far, so good. This is my first use...but I have no complaintsl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed! My wife has had thinning since we have been married.  She has tried tons of different treatments - shampoos, creams, pills, nothing helped. When I saw the wonderful reviews for Hair Rescue Gold, I decided to give it to my wife to try. It really does work! After about a week of taking it, she noticed new, strong hair growing. Definitely a new customer for life!</li>
            <li> I only realised that these were caplets when they arrived.  My fault, I should be more diligent when ordering.  Never the less my wife was more than willing to try them out so maybe her feed back will eventually prove positive.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that these are only available on Amazon USA and not on Amazon UK.</li>
            <li> One bottle no results. If it takes more than 1, should probably mention that</li>
            <li> This is like the best product ever. It says exactly what it says it does. I have seen a tremendous difference since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shampoos and other topical treatments for my thinning hair, with mixed results.  Mostly, they don&#x27;t work, so I decided to try a different method: a hair growth supplement that treats my hair from the inside out.  It took about 2 to 3 weeks to start seeing results, but the change in my hair, over time, has been remarkable.  My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower, and its overall condition is like it was when I was in my twenties. It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone. I don&#x27;t use special serums or conditioners that just cover up the problem anymore. I use Hair Rescue to treat what&#x27;s causing the problem - and I swear by it.</li>
            <li> After years of processing my hair with color, straightening treatments, heating tools and again back to curling my hair has suffered needless to say incredible loss and volume. After much deep conditioning, failed hair masks &amp; growth treatments - I went out on a limb and decided to try hair rescue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference!!! I have seen a dramatic difference in the amount of shedding I experience. I have peach fuzz along my hair line, NEW HAIR GROWTH after 3 weeks of use I am super excited to see a full head of hair. Ordering my next batch!</li>
            <li> Totally awesome. Grew the hair as it says.... my only regret is not buying this sooner. My thinness is no.more and this is a product i will continue to use and pass down the line to the future generations.. It sucks it took me so long to find something that really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Finally I have come to the conclusion better quality hair is going to need to come from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is my hair growing faster? Yes! And thicker too. I’ve been using the Hair Rescue GOLD Shampoo for the past three weeks and I’m surprised to already see what I’d call “baby hairs” appearing at the front of my hairline! My hair just will not grow past my shoulders and I&#x27;m hopeful for the future. My hair overall feels thicker, it has a bit more body and I’ve also stopped using anything with alcohol in it as far as styling goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased to say I’m impressed with my results! Totally worth the investment and benefits not only my hair but my fingernails are growing faster and stronger!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for around 2 weeks now with the recommended dosage and am surprised to say that not only does my hair look fuller and thicker but also just alot healthier then it did before. I would definitely refer anyone who was having low confidence or thinning hair to this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a month, and even though I continually forget to take all three doses each day, I have really noticed a change!  I use the Hair Rescue GOLD shampoo, which I love, as well.  Yes, the vitamins stink like all get-out when the bottle is opened, but you don&#x27;t get bad breath from them, and as long as they are taken with food, no stomach upset, either.  Am ready to order my next bottle!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Supplements are really good for growing hair and strengthening it. If you have hair loss, weak or lifeless hair, give Hair Rescue the chance to rescue your hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! This helped my hair grow thicker and longer! I am so happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the hair rescue gold shampoo to go along with my supply of hair rescue gold supplements. Using the two products together strengthens the overall effect of thicker stronger hair. After 3 weeks of use of the supplements I notice stronger hair with noticeably less breakage. Excited to continue use and get the full benefit!</li>
            <li> this products work wonders. you will truly notice that your hair  is fuller, thicker, and healthier. i would also recommend  using it in conjunction with hair rescue Gold  shampoo for even  more healthier and thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Aside from being a good vitamin supplement, this product really performs as advertised. I&#x27;ve used scalp treatments in the past that have worked OK but the Hair Rescue Gold is really a turbo charger for hair growth. I started taking the supplements some time ago and am glad to have found it now on Amazon at a lower price than I&#x27;ve bought these before, so now I get this great product at a lower price and I&#x27;m a happy camper. I&#x27;ve had a bad balding area on the crown of my head for some time and once I started taking this, I started noticing new sprouts and thicker looking hair as well. It&#x27;s now my go-to product of choice to start regrowing the chrome dome!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend, who introduced me to the Hair Rescue Gold line of products. I first started off with the Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo, and in addition I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this herbal supplement. Instead of consuming the recommended dosage of three capsules at one time, I have only take one pill with breakfast and lunch (a total of two pills daily), and I still reap the full benefits. I have noticed drastic improvement in the condition and fullness of my hair. This is a great supplement to take for growth and for improvement in hair condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shampoos and other treatments for my thinning hair, with fair results, at best. I decided to try a different method: a hair growth supplement that treats my hair from the inside out. It took about 3 weeks to start seeing results, but the change in my hair, over time, has been remarkable. My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower, and its overall condition is like it was when I was in my twenties. It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone.  I use Hair Rescue to treat what&#x27;s causing the problem, and it works. I give it 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair growth product, and none of them worked. A friend told me about Hair Rescue Gold so I decided to try it. I am happy I did. Even my friends and family noticed the difference is in my hair growth. I cannot believe how much my hair has grown in the last 3 months from using this product.</li>
            <li> Good vitamins id buy again, and i highly recommend to others...</li>
            <li> The hair rescue gold plus supplements are truely my savior!! Ever since high school my hair has been shedding leaving it very thin, weak, and it has been very dry. I was looking for something really for the thinness and this product helped with everything! And I have tried EVERYTHING! My hair is now softer, thicker, shinier and even has more volume. I am so happy with this product it is absolutely wonderful and I am going to be purchasing this regularly! I saw results in such a short time and this product has really restored my confidence in my hair. I am so pleased I have been telling all my friends and family about it!</li>
            <li> Do you have brittle dry hair  that breaks easily? Are you tired of products that never does what it says? Well Hair Rescue Gold Plus is here to rescue your hair. It&#x27;s a vitamin supplement that strengthens  the hair shaft  from inside and out and promotes long, lustrous healthy hair growth. The supplement is for both men and women and it&#x27;s FDA approved so you know it&#x27;s  got a good seal of approval. So what are you waiting on rescue your hair with Hair Rescue Gold Plus.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  saw results within a few weeks. I strongly suggest trying this product to see the amazing results.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it works wonders</li>
            <li> Lots of benefits in one product. Usually when you’re trying to speed your hair growth and make your hair healthier and slow hair loss you have to use three different products. As with any treatment or supplement you can’t expect overnight results. It contains lots of good ingredients from vitamins to hair treatment supplements like biotin. It’s also nice that it’s Made in the USA in an FDA approved GMP facility.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist, my friends, my mom and most importantly me... we all see it. It&#x27;s only been about a month and it is significantly thicker and has grown. It&#x27;s not wishful thinking. Absolutely NO side effects. I&#x27;m pairing it with the shampoo (and I also have been massaging my scalp.) As someone who was resigned to my hair getting thinner and thinner as years go by (it runs in my family) and clogging the drain and brush consistently I am THRILLED with the results. I would recommend it to everyone who has had problems with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a God send!  I have super corse, dry hair and cannot seem to get it to grow for the life of me.  I use the shampoo by the same company and it has done wonders.  I then decided to get this product to add a boost to the process.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.  Highly recommend for those of us that were not blessed with great hair growth!</li>
            <li> The product was not that bad. Its sensation on my scalp was refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t work ...</li>
            <li> Smells strange I can&#x27;t say if it works yet just started using it I&#x27;ll keep you posted......</li>
            <li> Not working, didn&#x27;t see any result.... My hair still falling like crazy... Wasting money.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to accelerate the growth I&#x27;ve had by using hair rescue shampoo. These tablets are easy to swallow and works ridiculously good! Dying my hair left it lifeless stripped and dry. Now, not only is my hair growing faster, but it looks and feels really healthy and thick too.</li>
            <li> Great results 1st time trying and just starting to see healthy hair results. Great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a hair growth system that works and this product has truly been a god send. It&#x27;s so easy to use and effective. I&#x27;ve never felt my hair so thick and long before and I&#x27;m truly grateful to the Hair Rescue Gold Plus vitamins for it. I initially wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about taking vitamins to help hair growth because I&#x27;ve only used to products such as shampoo and such but take my word for it, the affects that it had on my hair far outweigh anything else. My hair has never been thicker and I&#x27;m excited to see how much it&#x27;ll grow in the coming weeks. Buy this and introduce an amazing thing into your life right now.</li>
            <li> I use this plus the hair rescue shampoo. So I definitely have noticed my hair to be a bit thicker from my thinning hair. Since I have that shampoo, it was kind of hard to tell which one has a greater effect. I have noticed my toe nails are becoming stronger since they tend to break all the time and after taking this supplement, my nails are actually breaking less. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Thicker longer stronger hair. People don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s not only what we do to our hair and use on our hair, but also what&#x27;s inside our bodies that effects how healthy our hair skin and nails are. My hair feels healthier already after just a few weeks of use. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years to address my thinning, shedding hair.  Nothing has worked for me long term, until I found this product.  I use this product in conjunction with the Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo, and I am very happy with the results.  After many years of abusing my hair with dying, styling, and blow drying, my hair was brittle and broken.  I would lose large clumps of hair in the shower, and my hair was constantly shedding and noticeably thinner.  After using this product, my the roots of my hair feel stronger, and my hair has such a nice shine.  I have seen much less shedding, and my dry scalp is even improving.  I love that this product is safe and is FDA approved.  It is gentle on the stomach, and easy to swallow.  This product is a good value and it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products like this one and none of them have worked as well as this. After only two weeks of use I saw clear improvements in my hair&#x27;s quality and hair growth was clear where I have been balding. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this product. It actually works and it works fast. I see new hair growing and my receding hairline is much less noticeable. My hair is thicker, lusher, and healthier. It has a nice shine to it and my hair has never felt better. The supplement isn&#x27;t too expensive and you get a lot of it. I definitely recommend it to people who want a fuller head of hair and I will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves my hair with  moisture,shine, and body. Will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> At first, I was so skeptical about ordering this product. After some time, I decided to give it a go and after about 3 weeks, I noticed a huge change in my hair!! Beforehand, my hair had split ends, was damaged, lifeless, i mean I was really desperate to find a solution. Thankfully, after doing some careful research, I landed on this product and I&#x27;m soooo glad i did, I will order this again!!</li>
            <li> I love the hair rescue line, so I had to try to these vitamins and I love them as well. My hair has gotten thicker and a natural shine now. I use to have a problem with shedding when I ran my fingers through my hair or brushed my hair, but not anymore! I truley love the vitamins. Great product!</li>
            <li> After taking this vitamin for awhile, my hair began to get healthier, and shinier. When I brush my hair, I no longer have a brush full of hair every single time! I also noticed that my skin also wasn&#x27;t so dry. I love this product..</li>
            <li> I used shampoos and other hair treatments for my hair which is really thin, with mixed results. Most products do not work. BUT Hair Rescue + Gold is just what I been missing! It took about 2 to 3 weeks to start seeing results, but the change in my hair, over time, has been remarkable. My hair is much healthier and less prone to breaking or falling out in the shower. It&#x27;s shinier, thicker and easier to style and the thinning areas are almost completely gone. I am really pleased with using Hair Rescue to treat what&#x27;s causing my hair thinning problem.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me at all. Took full month supply.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrid but we will see how it works out.</li>
            <li> I gave it the college try and noticed with my one reorder they raised the price and it didn&#x27;t do squat. Stick with propecia</li>
            <li> Did not improve hair quality</li>
            <li> Cant speak to its efficacy but it really really smells bad.  Edit: I suspect many reviews are false/by the manufacturer</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first to try this product, but after seeing it work for a friend of mine I decided it was worth a shot. I have to say after a month, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the results. My edges are making some sort of a come back and overall my hair looks fuller and feels stronger. I&#x27;ve tried other things and have had mixed results, but the vitamins in this product really seem to do something for my hair. Definitely recommend this product, and I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> The ingredients or vitamins in this supplement are ones each person should be consuming anyway. Nutrients such as selenium zinc are essential add biotin and more, researched and balanced right and you have Hair Rescue Gold Supplement.  This is the perfect addition to the shampoo.  I love them both they make my hair fuller and shinny too.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars if that were an option. Went through 2 bottles over 2 months using with the Hair Rescue shampoo and my hair is thinner than before using it. This actually increased fallout. Let&#x27;s face it, if there were pills &amp; shampoo that could actually regrows hair we would be seeing ads for it. It would be hailed as the remedy for male pattern hair loss. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t exist.  And keep in mind that the 30-day return policy begins the day of shipment. It does NOT begin the day you receive the product, even though this is a 30-day supply of pills. So the 30-day return policy is actually 30 days minus the several days it takes to ship it to you, which could be a week or more. This is just as deceptive as the product&#x27;s claims!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed by this supplement. I&#x27;ve been using these tablets for just a couple of weeks and I see great results. My hair is so much thicker and fuller it is so beautiful. My hair has always been thin and so flat but with these tablets it has become just the opposite fuller and even healthier. The fact that these are approved by the FDA makes me feel even that much better about using them. I have had no negative side effects, these tablets do exactly what they say they do. I really recommend them to anyone who wants fuller and stronger hair.</li>
            <li> So Now onto the second bottle and first review. I decided to order this product Hair Rescue again because I&#x27;m surprised at the results a long with another product I have been using, which I will leave out of this review unless requested. Anyways I&#x27;ve noticed quite a bit of new open pores on my head and new hairs sprouting out. I do love the idea of being able to take 20 supplements and stay stress free which its been helping a lot, can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few months have in store! If you&#x27;re looking into a hair supplement it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this out! You wont be disappointed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you are on a never ending quest for full long hair, and then you might be intrigued to hear that Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Supplement might just have the answer to your follicle dreams. However, the question I&#x27;ve been always asking is: can oral supplements really help you get healthy, full long hair? Yes, this product combined with the hair growth shampoo by the same brand is doing wonders for my natural fine and curly hair. The average head of hair grows 1 inch every month but if your mane is damaged, this will certainly put a block on your natural growth cycle. Well, all is not lost. As well as eating the right foods and treating your hair with some good hair growth products, there are some wonderful supplements like the Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Supplement that will ensure your hair is growing at its top speed. It doesn&#x27;t go without saying that we are what we eat, and for strong hair, nutritionists swear by the powers of protein. After all, if our hair is made of protein, let&#x27;s keep feeding those building blocks. However, popping a pill can make a huge difference, but only if you remember to take it correctly, and always with a meal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple months now and it doesn&#x27;t take long to start seeing results!  Within 2-weeks, i started noticing my hair becoming fuller, thicker, and overall more healthy. I especially like the fact that Hair Rescue contains many vitamins and nutrients which have helped to significantly boost my hair growth, moisturize my dry scalp, and leave my hair looking shiny and feeling soft. It also helps for nail growth and strength as well. The changes I have seen in my hair after using both the Hair Rescue Gold Supplement and the Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo are truly impressive! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> So I went ahead and made the purchase and am on my second day of taking 3 capsules.  The pill is fairly large and isn&#x27;t necessarily a nuisance to swallow if you are used to taking larger pills. The supplement has an odd after taste which leaves soon after you swallow. The supplement is NOT FDA approved like it says in the Amazon description.  Update 4/5/15: So far, I&#x27;ve noticed very little difference in my head of hair. Will update in a complete month.</li>
            <li> I’ve always been a firm believer in what you put on the inside will benefit the outside.  I’ve taken other supplements with fair results, but I have to say after taking this product about 3 weeks I’m actually starting to see results.  My hair looks shinier and it just feels healthier. It has more volume and bounce, my hair feels like it did when I was in my 20s.  Another big plus, I don’t see any hair in my shower drain !!  I’ve used Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo and I love it and I was thrilled to know that they also offer a supplement. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after taking this supplement for a few months ! Thank you Hair Rescue Gold !!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and this one far exceeds the rest. I absolutely love it! I am at the beginning stages of my hair thinning so I wanted to find something that would target hair loss right away before it started. Not only has it targeted my hair thinning, but it&#x27;s also grown back thicker than ever! I would highly recommend this product because it really works!</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far. About half way through the bottle and the results have been impressive. Hair has been looking and feeling fuller which is a huge plus for those with hair growth issues such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipate purchasing many bottles of this going forward given the inital results. Can&#x27;t put a price on how good you look and feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I got great results for my hair...I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I have 6 pills left which is the equivalent of a 2 day supply. A complete &amp; utter waste of money. I have not noticed &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; new hair growth what so ever. I should&#x27;ve remembered if it sounds to good to be true it usually is!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have purchased two bottles of Hair Rescue and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It took about three weeks to start noticing a difference but know I&#x27;ve noticed significant growth in my hair. Will continue buying from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> This supplement works really well. I have been using it consistently and have noticed that my hair has gotten thicker and healthier. Prior to using this my hair was color damaged and thinning, I&#x27;ve gone through so many products and this one has really worked for me. I&#x27;m so happy I started using this - the difference is noticeable!</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair for years. After using Hair Rescue Gold Plus there is new hair growth! I can no longer see the bald spots. Also my hair looks and feels healthier. While so many other products can&#x27;t deliver results this one delivers.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, works great and is the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far. Price is reasonable and product works extremely well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Like anything you have to stick with it and you will be able to see and feel the difference. I had a major issue with hair loss because of health issues and it seemed like nothing was working. This was my last ditch effort and it made a huge difference. I defintiely recommend this product. It is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard not to love something that actually works. I was facing the perilous journey of hair loss and had no idea what to do and who to turn to. My stylist recommended many products, and this one happened to be on her list. After trudging through treatment after treatment, I finally purchased Hair Rescue GOLD. Thankfully, I search could stop here. This product does precisely as it promises - it halts hair loss and promotes hair growth.  I had started to see the signs of a receding hairline at my forehead, but after a few weeks with this product, I was seeing the fulness come back to my hair. Unlike other products, this also doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell, so it&#x27;s not embarrassing to apply and leave the house shortly after. No one would even know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed! My hair started thinning in my late teens, so I&#x27;ve tried tons of different treatments - shampoos, creams, pills, you name it - but nothing helped. In fact, a lot of the name brand products just made the problem worse. When I saw the wonderful reviews for Hair Rescue Gold, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m surprised. It really does work! After about a week of taking it, I saw new, strong hair growing in that, for once, wasn&#x27;t falling out in clumps. Plus, the hair I had has never felt better. My wife can&#x27;t stop running her fingers through it and telling me how soft and healthy it feels. Definitely a new customer for life!</li>
            <li> My hair had started thinning and it was really bothering me, so I did some research online and I found this product. I&#x27;m really loving it. This supplement does exactly what it says it will do: promote healthy hair growth. My hair feels fuller and thicker now, and I don&#x27;t have little strands of hair falling out so much like before. I would strongly recommend this to anyone struggling with hair loss or thinning.</li>
            <li> Hair Rescue GOLD Plus Hair Growth Supplement Hair Vitamins is a treatment to rebirth the hair you have by awakening the roots from the 20 different vitamins and nutrients that are implemented into the product to make your hair healthy and to keep it healthy. This product helps to remove stress from your roots so they can relax to bring growth, fullness and vitality.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend who is quickly losing what hair he has and decided to order a bottle as it was not very expensive. I have breakage from ​years of double processing (I&#x27;ve had pink hair since high-school) and had to cut it short to minimize further damage. I have been taking these tablets for a week now and have noticed less hair coming out of my head and in the sink drain. Also I have noticed the new growth coming in having a softer feel and more dense than before. I will continue to use  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Hair Rescue did exactly that to my hair it rescue/reconstruct it from all the damage of chemicals and heat it at withheld throughout my years. Once I started taking this supplement my hair began to grow and it felt much thicker as well. I love the results I have experience with Hair Rescue  + Gold it has given my hair life again is longer, thicker and healthier. Will definitely recommend this supplement to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I started off using the &amp;#34;Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo&amp;#34;  which I was completely happy with!  After reading up on the  &amp;#34;Hair Rescue Gold Supplements&amp;#34;, I decided to add them to my routine.  All the ingredients listed were recognizable and known to be healthy for you! This was really important to me. I see a real difference in the fullness and strength of my hair since adding this supplement!!  I definitely would  recommend this product to newcomers and also those that might be looking for a change!</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that many people fail to believe that this supplement works, I can truly say that they DO...I have used them for about a month and a half and see a noticeable change in my hair. After my last pregnancy, my hair began to thin out significantly. Now my hair is definitely thicker allowing me to feel more confident that you can&#x27;t see my scalp any longer. It worked for me and many others.... So it is definately worth trying for yourself...I did and I have nothing but positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am on an oral chemotherapy medicine and although I have always suffered from thin hair, my boyfriend began commenting on all my hair he had been finding around the house. I didn&#x27;t tell him about the clumps I was finding after my shower so I bought this and started taking it without telling him. Not only did I notice that it was working, but he commented as well. He actually thought I was just cleaning my shedding up before he would see it. This made my hair feel thicker and stronger! I have added this to my daily supplements and I&#x27;m enjoying my new look!</li>
            <li> Awsom product, works well. You won&#x27;t be disapointed...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough. I have used this product faithfully with the Hair Rescue Gold Shampoo and as a stand alone supplement when I have traveled. The ingredients are easy to understand, have been side effect free and the results are noted.Consider this worth a try if you are experiencing hair loss and want a natural alternative to combat the problem. Give it a few weeks as directed and regain your confidence.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My hair was also thinning, brittle, and loosing its life. After only a few weeks I could let my hair down.</li>
            <li> Having purchased this before, I am glad it it available on amazon! It saves me a trip to the only Brick and Mortar store that consistently has it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes time to see the results at first, but you wake up one day knowing your hair is thicker and stronger.  You notice less and less of it in the drain.It is a great feeling. This works so much better other products that I have tried and i will be buying more of it as soon as I need to</li>
