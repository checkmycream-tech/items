            <li>Make sure you get the correct size because it takes a lot of pressure to squeeze to a smaller size.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin, DO NOT GET THESE</li>

            <li> they came really small. not that noticeable when you put them on... looking from the front</li>
            <li> This item took forever to deliver and on top of that the gold paint rusted off while I was wearing it within the two days giving my nose piercing an infection and I had my nose pierced for 5 years&lt;br /&gt;Never again</li>

            <li> I love it but it&#x27;s really small, it&#x27;s discret. So if you want it to look like a full hoop it&#x27;s not good for you. I just have a negative comment on the time it took to arrive! Add a month to the estimation.</li>
