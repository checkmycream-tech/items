    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product for thinner hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff creates great texture and body without rubbing off onto your hands all day.</li>
            <li>ok!</li>
            <li>stuff is so strong that if you needed to spike a kid&#x27;s hair for Halloween it would work great.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves the hair, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>to each his own -- but it would probably work</li>
            <li>You do have to get used to the strong fragrance though!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that product tends to &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; off of (especially in hot weather).</li>
            <li>I believe Unilever has discontinued this item as I have not been able to find it at retail.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this  non-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t try to get it perfect, just reasonably well styled, and finish getting ready.  </li>
            <li>LOVE AXE for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have always had fine hair and no body; my hairdresser would say, \\&quot;Yeah</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, but you got a llll ooooo tttt of it.\\</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it does its job of holding hair up, but I wouldn&#x27;t call this for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>This product is great for short hair, girls or boys.</li>
            <li>If you need to spike your hair daily because you think that looks good, well. . .</li>
            <li>this stuff works very well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This product does well for my straight, course, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>and with this stuff, so long as I don&#x27;t use more than a pea size amount, I can&#x27;t even tell its there once my hair dries!</li>
            <li>Formerly used American Crew Fiber almost exclusively, for great hold and matte finish.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well - as my hair has been thinning out in the back, this product definitely works better than Fiber in providing better coverage for my balding spot.</li>
            <li>While the quality overall isn&#x27;t as good, it definitely does give your hair a fuller look, so I recommend it for guys who are thinning out a bit.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>hahaha..  </li>
            <li>If it gets too messed up, I just run wet fingers through, style, let dry, and adjust, and good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and am a woman who ventured into men&#x27;s products and was glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great for guys with thin hair!</li>
            <li>Periodically test out new products.</li>
            <li>I am an adult male with slightly thinning, short hair, but I get windblown in my convertible with the top down :-)  .  </li>
            <li>When I get out of the car, a quick swoosh of the hand through my hair is enough to put it back in place.  </li>
            <li>NOW, after using AXE for fine hair, my hair is so thick and blond and easy to work with; I swear I have more hair, and NO it is not sticky, you must be using it wrong.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>Then, once hair is dry, go back real quick to the mirror, run hand over it to break up any matted spots, mess it up a bit in others, and that&#x27;s it!  </li>
            <li>You can put it on wet hair for a more slick, gel-type look, or what I like to do is put it in my hair while dry, and then come back 10 minutes later or so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> greasy, long lasting, voluming product and</li>
            <li> Ordered this 3 pack because it&#x27;s been taken off the market &amp; I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> have really not found anything with a similar consistency.</li>
            <li> Dries stiff bit a comb through leaves your hair looking natural and in place all day long.</li>
            <li> They have changed this product, so I&#x27;m not sure about the new version.</li>
            <li> it gives it a bit of a shine even when dry.</li>
            <li> Pretty tough problem to have to suffer, eh?  </li>
            <li> It takes so little of this product to give sufficient body that I suspect my supply will outlive me and need to be willed to my future grandchildren!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this makes my hair clump up too much.  </li>
            <li> after a few hours my hair looks greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> and mess up my hair with a towel for a dry look that holds well.</li>
            <li> Even half way through the day, if I try to run my fingers through my hair, it&#x27;s like running it through cement.  </li>
            <li> use less than pea-sized portion of this product in the morning and find it gives my hair body.  </li>
            <li> I look a mess after arriving at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an everyday product that works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years now</li>
            <li> and I find that a lot of the products on the market are way too heavy with oils...</li>
            <li> Even though this product seems not to be in stores anymore, I bought a few to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Gives body and holds well without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> The name says hold and touch, but it leaves hair stiff and crunchy after an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Axe is sticky and messy..!  </li>
            <li> have thin hair, so most other products I tried just caused it to glob up, and look horrible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too thick for me.  </li>
            <li> It adds some body and helps with filling in some of the thin spots.</li>

            <li> I have always had fine hair and no body; my hairdresser would say, \\&quot;Yeah it&#x27;s fine, but you got a llll ooooo tttt of it.\\&quot; So I see this product, which I guess is now discontinued, of course, story of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE AXE for fine hair. NOW, after using AXE for fine hair, my hair is so thick and blond and easy to work with; I swear I have more hair, and NO it is not sticky, you must be using it wrong. Why are they discontinuing this, that&#x27;s sucky.</li>
            <li> This product is great for short hair, girls or boys. I love the way it leaves the hair, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I got this because my barber recommended it to me.  I have thin hair and this makes my hair clump up too much.  It&#x27;s a bit too thick for me.  Even half way through the day, if I try to run my fingers through my hair, it&#x27;s like running it through cement.  I gave it 3 stars because it does its job of holding hair up, but I wouldn&#x27;t call this for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I believe Unilever has discontinued this item as I have not been able to find it at retail. I am extremely pleased with this  non- greasy, long lasting, voluming product and have really not found anything with a similar consistency.</li>
            <li> Great product for thinner hair.  Gives body and holds well without being stiff or sticky.  They have changed this product, so I&#x27;m not sure about the new version.</li>
            <li> this stuff works very well and is easy to apply. just apply it to damp hair and no problems. ok!</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this price for a 3 pack of product.  I like the fact that I can style my hair and it gives it a bit of a shine even when dry.</li>
            <li> Great for guys with thin hair!</li>
            <li> I am an adult male with slightly thinning, short hair, but I get windblown in my convertible with the top down :-)  .  Pretty tough problem to have to suffer, eh?  Without any product in my hair I look a mess after arriving at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use less than pea-sized portion of this product in the morning and find it gives my hair body.  When I get out of the car, a quick swoosh of the hand through my hair is enough to put it back in place.  It takes so little of this product to give sufficient body that I suspect my supply will outlive me and need to be willed to my future grandchildren!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so strong that if you needed to spike a kid&#x27;s hair for Halloween it would work great. If you need to spike your hair daily because you think that looks good, well. . . to each his own -- but it would probably work</li>
            <li> This is an everyday product that works well. Dries stiff bit a comb through leaves your hair looking natural and in place all day long.</li>
            <li> The name says hold and touch, but it leaves hair stiff and crunchy after an hour or so.  I&#x27;d spend the money on American Crew fiber or grooming cream.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that product tends to &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; off of (especially in hot weather). This stuff creates great texture and body without rubbing off onto your hands all day. You do have to get used to the strong fragrance though! Almost candy like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years now and I really like it. I have fine hair and I find that a lot of the products on the market are way too heavy with oils... after a few hours my hair looks greasy and gross. This never makes my hair feel greasy. You can put it on wet hair for a more slick, gel-type look, or what I like to do is put it in my hair while dry, and then come back 10 minutes later or so and mess up my hair with a towel for a dry look that holds well. Also the Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I prefer Garnier. Axe is sticky and messy..!  I wish I had stuck with my Garnier, Now I have enough Axe to last for a year. Maybe I will give it to a friend.  But then .. would he be my friend after his hands were made all sticky by my cream...  hahaha..  yuck</li>
            <li> Formerly used American Crew Fiber almost exclusively, for great hold and matte finish. Periodically test out new products. Even though this product seems not to be in stores anymore, I bought a few to have on hand. It works pretty well - as my hair has been thinning out in the back, this product definitely works better than Fiber in providing better coverage for my balding spot.

            <li> Why does Amazon require a 20 word review on a discontinued item?  This product does well for my straight, course, fine hair.  It adds some body and helps with filling in some of the thin spots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using products, but this stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair, so most other products I tried just caused it to glob up, and look horrible.  Or, they did nothing at all, and made my hair look greasy and matted.  But with this stuff, I use just a tiny amount, rub into hands, then spread from back to front, then spike the front a bit, then wipe whats left on hands over the sides.  I don&#x27;t try to get it perfect, just reasonably well styled, and finish getting ready.  Then, once hair is dry, go back real quick to the mirror, run hand over it to break up any matted spots, mess it up a bit in others, and that&#x27;s it!  Looks natural, and stays all day.  If it gets too messed up, I just run wet fingers through, style, let dry, and adjust, and good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand having stuff in my hair, getting on my hands, etc...and with this stuff, so long as I don&#x27;t use more than a pea size amount, I can&#x27;t even tell its there once my hair dries!</li>
            <li> Thought this might work, but way too sticky and gooey for me.</li>
