    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Firewall is the best flatiron spray I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Works well, great product !</li>
            <li>Even if I am not straightening my hair this is great for frizz and the unruly fly aways!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product, just not for my hair type!</li>
            <li>I think this product would work great for women that have thicker, courser hair.  </li>
            <li>Great shipping and product..</li>
            <li>Smells great, helps straighten my hair while protecting.</li>
            <li>Great product, and would give 5stars</li>
            <li>It smells good and adds shine.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>Love this spray!</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such an excellent product for an excellent price :) .</li>
            <li>But I guess I&#x27;m spoiled from BedHead and how everything they have smells amazing.</li>
            <li>An excellent product for using before straight ironing your hair.</li>
            <li>This puts a nice protective layer on my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy transaction!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Have ordered it more than once.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product and can&#x27;t do my hair without it.</li>
            <li>I love all of the AG products I have tried.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Goodbye frizzes forever :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this spray but even the slightest amount causes severe static in my air...instantly.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron spray is the best!  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the high reviews it had received, but I didn&#x27;t find that it worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, let me know when you produce them in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>I use it once after shampoo and my hair stays smooth until I shampoo again.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best flat iron spray I have ever used and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Does not leave hair  sticky feeling like the CHI or the Kenra Platinum Hot Spray brand I&#x27;ve used and works better than these products to give a smoother and softer look.</li>
            <li>Keeps the frizzes at bay and your hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, a good firewall is necessary for anyone applying heat to their hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is worth the money</li>
            <li>Not the right product for me.</li>
            <li>spray comes out a soft mist and can build to heavy application, so the more fine your hair is, be mindful of how much you&#x27;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how well this product keeps my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Using it make my hair more touche-ably soft, manageable, smoother and all around improves the look of flat ironing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I would like to say due to a medical problem I have not been able to get a hair cut or color in five months</li>
            <li>It just produces very shiny soft straightened hair.</li>
            <li>have finally stopped looking for the right heat protection because I have discovered&lt;br /&gt;AG Firewall.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after using it, my hair seemed to have less fullness or body.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that loves to frizz in humidity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a whole different type of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leaves your hair so soft and never greasy.</li>
            <li>The spray provides a protective barrier, allowing the high heat of a flat iron (450 degrees) to be applied--without burning my hair.  </li>
            <li>so well that I barely have to use my iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its more expensive than some other products but worth it.</li>
            <li>The end result is that I can use the flat iron frequently without causing damage.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses this on me (fine, thin hair) and if I didn&#x27;t see the results for myself, I wouldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this because my hairdresser uses it when she flat irons my hair.</li>
            <li> Most either smell bad or dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I straighten my thick wirey hair and this sets my hair and it feels soft.</li>
            <li> Hair looks glossy, too, and not at all weighed down, nor greasy.  </li>

            <li> It does seem to protect from heat but makes my hair a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less expensive online than in the store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product about three times a week, I get at least three months&#x27; use from one can.  </li>
            <li> I have literally tried dozens of expensive brand and drug store heat protection products.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is dry, frizzy and breaking badly :(</li>
            <li> I would even say it smells bad.</li>

            <li> I purchased this because my hairdresser uses it when she flat irons my hair. I could never quite get the same effect at home. Finally I asked her what she was using, and this was the product. It looks like it would add oil or oiliness to the texture of your hair when you spray it on, however it doesn&#x27;t. It just produces very shiny soft straightened hair. My hair is very coarse and wavy. Also color treated.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizzes at bay and your hair nice and soft.  Also protects your hair from damage done by a straightening iron</li>
            <li> Love this spray! Even if I am not straightening my hair this is great for frizz and the unruly fly aways! Not greasy or oily!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, let me know when you produce them in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I straighten my thick wirey hair and this sets my hair and it feels soft. I buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy transaction!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how well this product keeps my hair straight. Lasts days. Using firewall is like having a home blow out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the high reviews it had received, but I didn&#x27;t find that it worked great for me.  I have fine hair and after using it, my hair seemed to have less fullness or body.  I think this product would work great for women that have thicker, courser hair.  I think it&#x27;s a good product, just not for my hair type!</li>

The end result is that I can use the flat iron frequently without causing damage.  Hair looks glossy, too, and not at all weighed down, nor greasy.  I no longer have ruined ends.  Previously, I had to snip them off between haircuts, or they looked like fried and sizzled bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product about three times a week, I get at least three months&#x27; use from one can.  When traveling, I bring along a much smaller version.</li>
            <li> This flat iron spray is the best!  It&#x27;s a little less expensive online than in the store.  Have ordered it more than once. Great shipping and product.. Timely.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product and can&#x27;t do my hair without it. I have naturally curly hair that loves to frizz in humidity. This spray makes my hair silky, soft and stays that way unless I get it wet. It&#x27;s like having a whole different type of hair. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Firewall is the best flatiron spray I have ever used. I use it once after shampoo and my hair stays smooth until I shampoo again. I love all of the AG products I have tried.</li>
            <li> An excellent product for using before straight ironing your hair. Does not leave hair  sticky feeling like the CHI or the Kenra Platinum Hot Spray brand I&#x27;ve used and works better than these products to give a smoother and softer look. It also give hair a shine. Its more expensive than some other products but worth it.</li>

            <li> Sometimes you get what you pay for.  I have literally tried dozens of expensive brand and drug store heat protection products.  Most either smell bad or dry my hair.  Some don&#x27;t work while others would weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, a good firewall is necessary for anyone applying heat to their hair.  I sometimes spray this on my hair and it removes frizz so well that I barely have to use my iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finally stopped looking for the right heat protection because I have discovered&lt;br /&gt;AG Firewall.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who heat styles their hair. It makes a world of difference, especially when flat ironing. Using it make my hair more touche-ably soft, manageable, smoother and all around improves the look of flat ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray comes out a soft mist and can build to heavy application, so the more fine your hair is, be mindful of how much you&#x27;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth the money and I will not be without it.</li>
            <li> This puts a nice protective layer on my hair. It smells good and adds shine.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say due to a medical problem I have not been able to get a hair cut or color in five months and my hair is dry, frizzy and breaking badly :( .&lt;br /&gt;  After using this product I could not believe the difference! My hair actually looked like it had been trimmed and deeply conditioned, it was so shinny and the texture was unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;  I am hooked and will never be without this product _Please never stop making it :) Goodbye frizzes forever :)&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you for making such an excellent product for an excellent price :) .</li>
            <li> Works well, great product !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great, helps straighten my hair while protecting.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this spray but even the slightest amount causes severe static in my air...instantly.  It does seem to protect from heat but makes my hair a little heavy.  Not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, and would give 5stars but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. I would even say it smells bad. But I guess I&#x27;m spoiled from BedHead and how everything they have smells amazing.</li>
