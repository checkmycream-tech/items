            <li>Love all No. 7 products</li>
            <li>so I was playing it safe.  </li>

            <li>My favorite is the night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE Boot No7 Lift &amp; Luminate Day Cream</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Boots No7 is everything I had hoped for and more.</li>
            <li>I finished my thirty day supply and purchased more.</li>
            <li>WE LOVED THIS VERY MUCH....</li>
            <li>OUR CHILDREN  HAD A LOT OF FUN !!  </li>
            <li>This product works great, leaves skin feeling SO soft and noticeable improvement in age-related skin problems.  </li>
            <li>Just start using it and so far it makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>other wise loved it</li>
            <li>My fine lines are still there and are visible.</li>
            <li>There has been NO CHANGE in my skin with looks, fine lines, texture, etc.</li>
            <li>I have seen the difference in my skin and the disappearance of fine lines since using it.</li>
            <li>and I see fewer fine lines around eyes and lips.</li>
            <li>tend to use it up more quickly because I use it some mornings too.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t honestly say at the moment I have saw any positive results yet</li>
            <li>Light, easy to apply and seems to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my face</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin silky smooth and moistureized.</li>
            <li>After trying numerous brands,this is a great price a number one seller in Europe.</li>
            <li>It goes on lightly</li>
            <li>Love It, really made my skin look better &amp; smoother</li>
            <li>the price for this product was right, but not so sure it did its job</li>
            <li>SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this and have used it every night and day since I got it.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but well worth the price!</li>
            <li>but I can tell you this it does make the shin feel really nice and soft ,,smooth so we will see</li>
            <li>Love it and would recomment it to anyone who wants smooth skin. .</li>
            <li>Liked it very much, am getting ready reorder before Christmas.</li>
            <li>It may very well be a better product</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for 2 weeks and the skin on my face feels so much better and looking better</li>
            <li>things to do is make sure you wear sunscreen .. and moisturize from a very young age.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>I am 75 years old and have been using this for sometime now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use the day time and forget about the night time but even still it has softened the laugh lines around my eyes and lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>How and what&#x27;s in it to be able to smooth out the deep frown lines?</li>
            <li>How and what&#x27;s in it to be able to smooth out the deep frown lines?</li>
            <li>So far, my skin feels smoother &amp; looks better.</li>
            <li>so I think it is worth</li>
            <li>Noticed smoother skin right away.</li>
            <li>What have I got to lose, right?</li>
            <li>She specifically said to write down the areas in my face that has the most prominent wrinkle/deep lines, together we will check them out when I&#x27;m finished with the Serum.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles to be concerned, thanks to my mom&#x27;s good genes,</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t uses this product very much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I  am using my first package.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty faithful.</li>

            <li>;)ar.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Great product , haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say how well it works, but it seems like it&#x27;s all that it&#x27;s sid</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and after a month noticed a definite improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product but didn&#x27;t work any better than other day and night creams I have used.</li>
            <li>it feels nice on my face but not worth the money</li>
            <li>I do not experience dry skin any more since using this product.</li>
            <li>I got up 4 or 5 hours later went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror as I passed by it and notice my neck was had filled out.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Debbie Valo</li>
            <li>It looks promising.</li>
            <li>I really like the serum.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it, so</li>
            <li>So I cannot see much improvements yet.</li>
            <li>Just wish the serum was available in larger package.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>to be thanks..</li>
            <li>Product is not doing all that much to correct lip lines...</li>
            <li>Feels light on skin and actually makes my face lines minimize</li>
            <li>Use it now and then but can&#x27;t remember to use it all the time...don&#x27;t really have problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin very oily</li>
            <li>I should disclose I am also trying rose hip seed oil nightly and have also switched to Olay&#x27;s Total Effects moisturizer (with anti-aging properties) instead of their regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Works just as well or perhaps better than the more expensive ones I have used.  </li>
            <li>WE WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Costs a little more</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m only using it about 2 weeks right now</li>
            <li>I got multiple free samples of this stuff and tried it multiple times</li>
            <li>I have not finished using the first packet and since I am African, it will take longer to see the luminous effect</li>
            <li>I am not sure I love it yet.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used them consistently for a month and there still seems to be plenty left.</li>
            <li>Pores are somewhat diminished and skin feels quite soft.</li>
            <li>Just used for 2 days so far.</li>
            <li>Not heavy like some creams.</li>
            <li>So far no credit to my Credit Card.</li>
            <li>It really wasnt any different than lotion.</li>
            <li>, I was adamant they are just a bunch of hogwash</li>
            <li>The night cream irritates my sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve stopped using that.</li>
            <li>Not bad just for me, not worth it.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m glad I only bought the small samples.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other Boots No7 products I use that have had dramatic, positive results, the Lift &amp; Luminate Day and Night Serum has only had so-so results despite its Good Housekeeping approval ratings.</li>
            <li>but tubes are too small and get used up quickly</li>
            <li>It has only been 37 days, you have to get up really close to my face to be able to see the faint lines where the 2 very deep lines used to be!</li>
            <li>It has only been 37 days, you have to get up really close to my face to be able to see the faint lines where the 2 very deep lines used to be!</li>
            <li>While the cream is thick and smooth going on, I have seen no overall improvement on the lines in those areas.</li>
            <li>No more laugh lines crows feet or cracks in lips when lipstick is applied.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and thankfully this product causes absolutely no irritation or rash.</li>
            <li>Works great but expensive for such a small tube  needs to be bigger or cheaper</li>
            <li>I really like these serum&#x27;s, but wish they came in a bigger tube, although, you only have to use a little, would like it to last longer.</li>

            <li> There has been NO CHANGE in my skin with looks, fine lines, texture, etc.</li>
            <li> I have seen the difference in my skin and the disappearance of fine lines since using it.</li>
            <li> and I see fewer fine lines around eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> tend to use it up more quickly because I use it some mornings too.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t honestly say at the moment I have saw any positive results yet</li>
            <li> Light, easy to apply and seems to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my face</li>
            <li> it leaves your skin silky smooth and moistureized.</li>
            <li> After trying numerous brands,this is a great price a number one seller in Europe.</li>
            <li> It goes on lightly</li>
            <li> Love It, really made my skin look better &amp; smoother</li>
            <li> the price for this product was right, but not so sure it did its job</li>
            <li> SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and have used it every night and day since I got it.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but well worth the price!</li>
            <li> but I can tell you this it does make the shin feel really nice and soft ,,smooth so we will see</li>
            <li> Love it and would recomment it to anyone who wants smooth skin. .</li>
            <li> Liked it very much, am getting ready reorder before Christmas.</li>
            <li> It may very well be a better product</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 2 weeks and the skin on my face feels so much better and looking better</li>
            <li> things to do is make sure you wear sunscreen .. and moisturize from a very young age.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and have been using this for sometime now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I use the day time and forget about the night time but even still it has softened the laugh lines around my eyes and lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> How and what&#x27;s in it to be able to smooth out the deep frown lines?</li>
            <li> How and what&#x27;s in it to be able to smooth out the deep frown lines?</li>
            <li> So far, my skin feels smoother &amp; looks better.</li>
            <li> so I think it is worth</li>
            <li> Noticed smoother skin right away.</li>
            <li> What have I got to lose, right?</li>
            <li> She specifically said to write down the areas in my face that has the most prominent wrinkle/deep lines, together we will check them out when I&#x27;m finished with the Serum.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles to be concerned, thanks to my mom&#x27;s good genes,</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t uses this product very much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I  am using my first package.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty faithful.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)ar.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Great product , haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say how well it works, but it seems like it&#x27;s all that it&#x27;s sid</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and after a month noticed a definite improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product but didn&#x27;t work any better than other day and night creams I have used.</li>
            <li> it feels nice on my face but not worth the money</li>
            <li> I do not experience dry skin any more since using this product.</li>
            <li> I got up 4 or 5 hours later went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror as I passed by it and notice my neck was had filled out.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Debbie Valo</li>
            <li> It looks promising.</li>
            <li> I really like the serum.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it, so</li>
            <li> So I cannot see much improvements yet.</li>
            <li> Just wish the serum was available in larger package.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> to be thanks..</li>
            <li> Product is not doing all that much to correct lip lines...</li>
            <li> Feels light on skin and actually makes my face lines minimize</li>
            <li> Use it now and then but can&#x27;t remember to use it all the time...don&#x27;t really have problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin very oily</li>
            <li> I should disclose I am also trying rose hip seed oil nightly and have also switched to Olay&#x27;s Total Effects moisturizer (with anti-aging properties) instead of their regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works just as well or perhaps better than the more expensive ones I have used.  </li>
            <li> WE WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Costs a little more</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m only using it about 2 weeks right now</li>
            <li> I got multiple free samples of this stuff and tried it multiple times</li>
            <li> I have not finished using the first packet and since I am African, it will take longer to see the luminous effect</li>
            <li> I am not sure I love it yet.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used them consistently for a month and there still seems to be plenty left.</li>
            <li> Pores are somewhat diminished and skin feels quite soft.</li>
            <li> Just used for 2 days so far.</li>
            <li> Not heavy like some creams.</li>
            <li> So far no credit to my Credit Card.</li>
            <li> It really wasnt any different than lotion.</li>
            <li> , I was adamant they are just a bunch of hogwash</li>
            <li> The night cream irritates my sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve stopped using that.</li>
            <li> Not bad just for me, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m glad I only bought the small samples.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other Boots No7 products I use that have had dramatic, positive results, the Lift &amp; Luminate Day and Night Serum has only had so-so results despite its Good Housekeeping approval ratings.</li>
            <li> but tubes are too small and get used up quickly</li>
            <li> It has only been 37 days, you have to get up really close to my face to be able to see the faint lines where the 2 very deep lines used to be!</li>
            <li> It has only been 37 days, you have to get up really close to my face to be able to see the faint lines where the 2 very deep lines used to be!</li>
            <li> While the cream is thick and smooth going on, I have seen no overall improvement on the lines in those areas.</li>
            <li> No more laugh lines crows feet or cracks in lips when lipstick is applied.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and thankfully this product causes absolutely no irritation or rash.</li>
            <li> Works great but expensive for such a small tube  needs to be bigger or cheaper</li>
            <li> I really like these serum&#x27;s, but wish they came in a bigger tube, although, you only have to use a little, would like it to last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so, but to date I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I think I can see a minor change already and some of my skin redness has calmed down.</li>
            <li> Surprised I haven&#x27;t seen other comments about this..</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell</li>
            <li> This product line is extremely inexpensive and actually works!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other items that claim to do the same with no results.  </li>
            <li> It works the same as any other serum I buy.  </li>
            <li> So I used the Serum every single day and night, faithfully, so that I can rub it in to her face the next time see each other that there was no improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li> I use the day cream every single morning in the lines on my forehead and around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> less then if you purchased it in your local stores.</li>
            <li> little over a month ago, (May 2nd)</li>
            <li> other things do the same for less money</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve spent a small amount of fortune, small but nonetheless a fortune, and since I really didn&#x27;t see a difference nor an improvement on all the products I&#x27;ve tried, I just gave</li>
            <li> Have only had it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> my friend actually asked if i had gotten a face lift after just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> only a few days n</li>
            <li> but this Serum seems to be a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> The tiny tubes are a waste for the price in my opinion,</li>
            <li> The small tubes don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I am 41, so I don&#x27;t have deep lines just some pesky little ones that are cropping up!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though.</li>
            <li> My neck was thinning and saggy due to collegan loss.</li>
            <li> I have spent 100s of dollars on every cream you can think of!  </li>
            <li> However, I adore other Boots products, so some of them do work, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Will never use any other product.  </li>
            <li> but I can cut corners in other ways.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the small tube; wish it came in a larger tube.  </li>
            <li> I applied the night no 7 to my neck and then laid down.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way,so don&#x27;t let small quantity  stop you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune and have been a fan of Murad for a couple</li>
            <li> Target was a little out of my way to get to.</li>
            <li> As she was dropping me off at my home, she shoves this little package and made me promise to use it every day/night until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Based on these results, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, I&#x27;ll go back to my previous brand (Principal Secret) for line reduction.</li>
            <li> It worked in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> the humble me.</li>
            <li> the humble me.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money  no noticeble improvement  just using plain virgin olive oil 2x a day  </li>
            <li> I had bad deep wrinkles on my side of my nose from sleeping, forehead and above my lips.</li>
            <li> Very little product for the price</li>
            <li> Save your money doesn&#x27;t work and very little in bottle.....</li>
            <li> my bff gave me a ride to pick up my usual meds at Target, while waiting for my meds, she went to pick up two of this product, No7 Lift &amp; Luminate Day/Night Serum, and insisted I get one for myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, June 7,2014 at 6:53 in the evening, I&#x27;m in my kitchen baking my bff her fave oatmeal cookies (as promised) and \\&quot;eating a Humble Pie\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I compare Boots No7 to my expensive compounded facial cream.</li>
            <li> I could tell an improvement in just a few days!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s quite expensive when you compare the price to the amount of product you receive.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are very small....</li>
            <li> but I have this 2 very deep frown lines on my forehead between my eyebrows, (this from a bad habit of frowning and squinting a lot)</li>
            <li> but it is small and expensive.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed that the quantity was so small as to render this almost a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I hate giving low reviews but here goes anyway.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see any difference and its expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but I must admit...</li>
            <li> Disappointing, but the product seems to work well.</li>
            <li> it absolutely stinks.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy, it&#x27;s unreal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy, it&#x27;s unreal!</li>
            <li> I hate to say I don&#x27;t think it makes one bit of difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED in the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed on the performance.  </li>
            <li> It smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> Just hope it doesn&#x27;t get anymore expensive PLEASE!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received promptly and I do think it is helping</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the serum</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! It really works!! My neck was thinning and saggy due to collegan loss.I heard about the product on the wendy williams show.So I decided to give it a try.Within 2days my night and day boots no.7 arrived.I applied the night no 7 to my neck and then laid down.I got up 4 or 5 hours later went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror as I passed by it and notice my neck was had filled out.It was NOT  wrinkled and sagging like before.I must have stood in front of the mirror 5 to 10 minutes amazed.It worked in just a few hours.I will be ordering more!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 2 weeks and the skin on my face feels so much better and looking better I just ordered the filler for wrinkles hope this works as well as the day and night cream. Thank you so much Debbie Valo</li>
            <li> really rich, very nice product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, my face has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the cream!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week, I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference yet. I&#x27;m going to contintue to use it and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I think I like it! Have only had it a few weeks. Saw it on the Doctors! So fat, so good! :)</li>
            <li> Boots No7 Lift &amp; Luminary is amazing, best product available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I can already see the deepest line fading a bit. It looks promising.</li>
            <li> I like the cream. but it is small and expensive. I don&#x27;t notice it helping out with wrinkles any better then the rest of the wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good product.  I was just disappointed that the quantity was so small as to render this almost a waste of money.  It looks like a sample you&#x27;d get when making a purchase.  Disappointing, but the product seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! You see results almost immediately!! I would recommend it to anyone looking to brighten up and soften the look of their face!&lt;br /&gt;Rachael - Lafayette, LA</li>
            <li> This is a great product it really works for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the serum. it leaves your skin silky smooth and moistureized. I understand it take about 4 weeks to see results. i&#x27;m only using it about 2 weeks right now</li>
            <li> Perfec,t have received many compliments on my skin. After trying numerous brands,this is a great price a number one seller in Europe. A little goes a long way,so don&#x27;t let small quantity  stop you. Mine has lasted over six months .</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and have been using this for sometime now and love it.  Works just as well or perhaps better than the more expensive ones I have used.  And love the idea of being able to get through Amazon.  Target was a little out of my way to get to. And let me not  forget to mention the great PRICE.  Just wished it came in larger tubes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK but not impressive. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. Had seen it on TV and gave it a try but not for me.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about a week and already have noticed a change in my skin.  Pores are somewhat diminished and skin feels quite soft.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money  no noticeble improvement  just using plain virgin olive oil 2x a day  made a bigger difference</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it, so I know I&#x27;ll be ordering more when she needs/wants more. She says it is probable the best stuff she has used.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Just used for 2 days so far. So I cannot see much improvements yet.</li>
            <li> Love It, really made my skin look better &amp; smoother use it along with day &amp; night creams probably would not use it alone, need both sets.  Like results</li>
            <li> It is nice! It has not been 4 weeks yet.  But I&#x27;ll keep it. It is lite. Not heavy like some creams.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft.  I will definitely purchase Boots No7 again.</li>
            <li> Works great but expensive for such a small tube  needs to be bigger or cheaper&lt;br /&gt;Please  other wise loved it</li>
            <li> This product works great, leaves skin feeling SO soft and noticeable improvement in age-related skin problems.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s quite expensive when you compare the price to the amount of product you receive.  If the amount of product was doubled it would be more in keeping with the pricing.</li>
            <li> I would like to make a review on the Day &amp; Night Serum, but I never received it, although I have been billed for it.  So far no credit to my Credit Card.</li>
            <li> did not see any difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve head a lot about it, and wanted to try it myself. My fine lines are still there and are visible. let alone wrinkles. I am diappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> great price and superfast delivery!!!!!!  No7 is by far the BEST anti aging product EVER!!  my friend actually asked if i had gotten a face lift after just a few weeks of use.  no wonder Botox is pissed.  This product line is extremely inexpensive and actually works!!!  No more laugh lines crows feet or cracks in lips when lipstick is applied. I absolutely love love love no7 they are by FAR THE BEST EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this on the Doctors and the Dr. Phil show and I had also read great reviews in magazines and my Mother uses this product.  I have been using it for 6 months and have seen great results.  I use to use Lancôme products and they are way more expensive and I found this product to give me the same results.  I love this and will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see any difference and its expensive.  it feels nice on my face but not worth the money other things do the same for less money</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and have used it every night and day since I got it. There has been NO CHANGE in my skin with looks, fine lines, texture, etc. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the product</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was shown on a prominent talk show.  I&#x27;m very disappointed on the performance.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks with no results as advertised.  When it runs out, I will not purchase more.  I&#x27;ll go back to Olay.</li>
            <li> I  am using my first package. I like the way it feels on my skin. I do not experience dry skin any more since using this product. I have not finished using the first packet and since I am African, it will take longer to see the luminous effect so I&#x27;m giving it time.</li>
            <li> Great serum with the day and night creams.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I saw them advertise on one of the afternoon shows and gave it a try they said it was great and reasonably price. It is great. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> It actually works! I&#x27;ve purchased other items that claim to do the same with no results.  I will continue to purchase this item.  I use the day time and forget about the night time but even still it has softened the laugh lines around my eyes and lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Like the product.  I am not sure I love it yet.</li>
            <li> Like the product okay but tubes are too small and get used up quickly</li>
            <li> Love this product. Just wish the serum was available in larger package.</li>
            <li> Used it as the directions instructed, but I did not notice any difference. It really wasnt any different than lotion.</li>
            <li> I found this same product for under $20 at Walgreens so I think I&#x27;ll purchase it there instead.  I&#x27;ll update with my review of the product after I use it.</li>
            <li> This was a good product and it was rated well. I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my face and I was pretty faithful. I didn&#x27;t like that there were two options. Day and night. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I like my routine to be simple. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again just for that reason. It applies nicely.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this product!! A bit pricey but well worth the price! My skin never felt softer!!</li>
            <li> The tubes are more like a sample size.</li>
            <li> I have spent 100s of dollars on every cream you can think of!  I have a graveyard of it!  I love this stuff!  I could tell almost immediately the reduction of my lines. I am using the anti aging cleanser and eye cream also. I had bad deep wrinkles on my side of my nose from sleeping, forehead and above my lips. I also wish the sizes were larger. A little goes a long way though. Take it from me it works!</li>
            <li> I used these serums religiously and cannot see any difference at all. I&amp;#34;m glad I only bought the small samples.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well and priced well.</li>
            <li> This product did not agree with my skin type. After two uses it died out my skin. I was so hoping it would help my skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find it added anything to my current skincare routine. Not bad just for me, not worth it. A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love Boots No. 7. They&#x27;re the best of ever used. I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune and have been a fan of Murad for a couple but this stuff beats them by a country mile. The difference is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> The bottles are very small....but I&#x27;ve used them consistently for a month and there still seems to be plenty left. Noticed smoother skin right away. Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> When it comes to beauty cream products that claims it&#x27;ll take off wrinkles and will make you look younger, I&#x27;m the biggest skeptic. Since I&#x27;ve spent a small amount of fortune, small but nonetheless a fortune, and since I really didn&#x27;t see a difference nor an improvement on all the products I&#x27;ve tried, I just gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little over a month ago, (May 2nd) my bff gave me a ride to pick up my usual meds at Target, while waiting for my meds, she went to pick up two of this product, No7 Lift &amp; Luminate Day/Night Serum, and insisted I get one for myself. She couldn&#x27;t do her spiel enough of her testimony to make me get one, I was adamant they are just a bunch of hogwash and it&#x27;s all just a hype, that manufacturers will say anything to get you to spend your dollars on their products. Determined and wouldn&#x27;t take no for an answer, unbeknownst to me, my bff bought one for me. As she was dropping me off at my home, she shoves this little package and made me promise to use it every day/night until it&#x27;s gone. She specifically said to write down the areas in my face that has the most prominent wrinkle/deep lines, together we will check them out when I&#x27;m finished with the Serum. I really don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles to be concerned, thanks to my mom&#x27;s good genes, ;) but I have this 2 very deep frown lines on my forehead between my eyebrows, (this from a bad habit of frowning and squinting a lot) so deep I can feel the ridges when I ran my fingers over them. What have I got to lose, right? So I used the Serum every single day and night, faithfully, so that I can rub it in to her face the next time see each other that there was no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, June 7,2014 at 6:53 in the evening, I&#x27;m in my kitchen baking my bff her fave oatmeal cookies (as promised) and \\&quot;eating a Humble Pie\\&quot;! I&#x27;m taking back all that I&#x27;ve said to her, that it&#x27;s a waste of time and money, that it&#x27;s never going to make a difference even if I use No7 Lift&amp;Luminate day/Night serum for a whole year. It has only been 37 days, you have to get up really close to my face to be able to see the faint lines where the 2 very deep lines used to be! How and what&#x27;s in it to be able to smooth out the deep frown lines? It&#x27;s crazy, it&#x27;s unreal! Now it&#x27;s my bff who rubs it in to me, the proverbial \\&quot;I told you so\\&quot; and I&#x27;m speechless! the humble me. ;)ar.

            <li> Just started using but very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  The only complaint I have is the small tube; wish it came in a larger tube.  The small tubes don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Love all No. 7 products</li>
            <li> Great product , haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say how well it works, but it seems like it&#x27;s all that it&#x27;s sid to be thanks..</li>
            <li> WE LOVED THIS VERY MUCH.... OUR CHILDREN  HAD A LOT OF FUN !!  WE WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY ////  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer , reasonable cost</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell but I can tell you this it does make the shin feel really nice and soft ,,smooth so we will see</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as a gift because I am a generous and loving husband and she has some already so I was playing it safe.  She asked for me to order more, so that&#x27;s an endorsement.  Cheaper here than at Target.</li>
            <li> I have used both of these products.  It is not a bad product but didn&#x27;t work any better than other day and night creams I have used.</li>
            <li> Not the best buy. Very little product for the price</li>
            <li> Greaat Product! Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> the price for this product was right, but not so sure it did its job</li>
            <li> i bought this for my daughter who loves it and she seems satisfied.</li>
            <li> product didn&#x27;t impress me</li>
            <li> Love, love No 7 Skincare products!</li>
            <li> Surprised I haven&#x27;t seen other comments about this.. I don&#x27;t care if this stuff works.. it absolutely stinks. It smells disgusting. I can&#x27;t describe it. I got multiple free samples of this stuff and tried it multiple times and it all smells so gross.</li>
            <li> My wife said it was Ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so, but to date I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I think I can see a minor change already and some of my skin redness has calmed down.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Am using it now and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, kinda of pricey but at my age, any thing is better than nothing.  Boots is great, I even sent some of it to my sister in Ohio</li>
            <li> I compare Boots No7 to my expensive compounded facial cream. My skin is very sensitive and thankfully this product causes absolutely no irritation or rash. A definite bargain!</li>
            <li> I really like these serum&#x27;s, but wish they came in a bigger tube, although, you only have to use a little, would like it to last longer.</li>
            <li> Boots No. 7 is a great product.  I think continued use is the answer.  I also use the day and night creams.</li>
            <li> Just start using it and so far it makes my skin look and feel great. Love it and would recomment it to anyone who wants smooth skin. .</li>
            <li> Product is not doing all that much to correct lip lines...</li>
            <li> Unlike the other Boots No7 products I use that have had dramatic, positive results, the Lift &amp; Luminate Day and Night Serum has only had so-so results despite its Good Housekeeping approval ratings. I use the day cream every single morning in the lines on my forehead and around my nose and mouth. While the cream is thick and smooth going on, I have seen no overall improvement on the lines in those areas. The night cream irritates my sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve stopped using that. Based on these results, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, I&#x27;ll go back to my previous brand (Principal Secret) for line reduction. However, I adore other Boots products, so some of them do work, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Liked it very much, am getting ready reorder before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, I will buy again</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t uses this product very much but I likes it when I did</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Feels light on skin and actually makes my face lines minimize</li>
            <li> This product actually works. I have seen the difference in my skin and the disappearance of fine lines since using it. Also, my skin overall has firmed up. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product only a few days n haven&#x27;t saw a difference yet ,maybe after using it longer. It may very well be a better product but I can&#x27;t honestly say at the moment I have saw any positive results yet</li>
            <li> Save your money doesn&#x27;t work and very little in bottle.....</li>
            <li> Use it now and then but can&#x27;t remember to use it all the time...don&#x27;t really have problems with my skin. Wanted to try something.</li>
            <li> I think this dual day and night product is making a difference after using it for about a month now. I should disclose I am also trying rose hip seed oil nightly and have also switched to Olay&#x27;s Total Effects moisturizer (with anti-aging properties) instead of their regular moisturizer. So maybe it&#x27;s a combination, but I&#x27;ve been using the Boots product the longest. It goes on lightly and I see fewer fine lines around eyes and lips. I am 41, so I don&#x27;t have deep lines just some pesky little ones that are cropping up!</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on a talk show as a good product for skin so I thought I would give it a try. So far, my skin feels smoother &amp; looks better. I&#x27;m only on my 1st tube so we will see if it continues to work for me.</li>
            <li> I could tell an improvement in just a few days! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of anti aging products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for months now, it is just as advertised...wonderful!  Light, easy to apply and seems to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the wife if she likes it I like it and it cost a lot  less then if you purchased it in your local stores.</li>
            <li> I love this day and night serum. I recommend it to all ladies. It applies very smooth and does not feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Will never use any other product.  Costs a little more but I can cut corners in other ways. Makes my skin feel so good and  that makes ME feel good so I think it is worth itl  Just hope it doesn&#x27;t get anymore expensive PLEASE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and after a month noticed a definite improvement in my skin texture. I look younger and smoother</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough-feels great</li>
            <li> I think the company could be more generous for what they charge.  The tubes are miniscule.</li>
            <li> As with any &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; type serum, it&#x27;s a lot of hype but no difference in skin texture or results.  It works the same as any other serum I buy.  I did use it for 2 months because I know that you have to give these things time.  So save you money and put it in your plastic surgery fund or botox fund  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best things to do is make sure you wear sunscreen .. and moisturize from a very young age.</li>
            <li> I like it but I won&#x27;t buy it again it makes my skin very oily</li>
            <li> I love this line! I started using it over a year ago. It my favorite out of all the skin care I&#x27;ve tried. My favorite is the night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use it up more quickly because I use it some mornings too. I love the scent! Very subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li> I hate giving low reviews but here goes anyway. I LOVE Boot No7 Lift &amp; Luminate Day Cream but this Serum seems to be a big waste of money. I started by using the day cream and thought I should also get the day and night serum. I hate to say I don&#x27;t think it makes one bit of difference in my skin. The tiny tubes are a waste for the price in my opinion,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I was a bit skeptical, but I must admit...Boots No7 is everything I had hoped for and more. I finished my thirty day supply and purchased more. I am a believer. Great for the seasoned ladies!!!</li>
