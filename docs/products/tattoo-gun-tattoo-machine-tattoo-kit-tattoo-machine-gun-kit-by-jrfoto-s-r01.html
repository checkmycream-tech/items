            <li>so I recommend doing some searching online on how to set up your tattoo machine and the ink is okay not to good</li>
            <li>About To Make Good Money From It, An Buy More Of Your Products.</li>
            <li>Awesome price got here like two day early good guns</li>
            <li>The kit came on time, and works good but needs a better dvd</li>
            <li>when my package got to me the box was kind of beat up then</li>
            <li>bought as a gift for my brother in law loved it :)</li>
            <li>but if i was you i would order some more ink because the ink is not that good.</li>
            <li>The machines are nice and well built.</li>
            <li>just order your own ink.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit for the money.</li>
            <li>Got here nicely packaged .lots of goodies in it.</li>
            <li>Very nice kit works great came fast</li>
            <li>Great sale, not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Very easy to assemble even if you&#x27;ve never used a tattoo machine before</li>
            <li>Other than that, the kit is very nice and perfect for the price...</li>
            <li>The only thing not so good are the Inks, you should buy a kit of good ones!</li>
            <li>everything in this kit is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Overall everthing was perfect the dvd it comes with isnt helpful though</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Wish I could get some more stuff</li>
            <li>But be sure too purchase separate Ink.</li>
            <li>The gun looks better in person.  </li>
            <li>I Really Love Your Product.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this tattoo machine</li>
            <li>and i love how everything came in the box</li>
            <li>For people who are trying to be self-taught, please just read up and do some studying, get an apprenticeship, then hop online and order this. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to rate this 5 stars, but...</li>
            <li>Really happy with these machines, I&#x27;ve been able to do some nice work so far with them.  </li>
            <li>as well I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We just watched YouTube and that was 100% more help than this DVD</li>
            <li>The power supply is ok.</li>
            <li>Better videos on the web if you look.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d be better off looking up instructions on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I love my tattookit I been doing tats alday</li>
            <li>I love tattoos I am covered ...</li>
            <li>Great deal and very helpful</li>
            <li>Too many magnums, not too many people use them.</li>
            <li>i have to buy all the colors which cost way more</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>This kit would best be used for practice and getting the balance of the machines rather than actually inking someone.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>He really likes the equipment and the tat came out great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working better now.</li>
            <li>However, get some better ink.</li>
            <li>Over all i wold purchase more of these.  </li>
            <li>The inks is ok</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The tattoo machines are ok.</li>
            <li>Make sure there are tuned and take the sticker off of the bottom</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what is has on the top not a lion</li>
            <li>Just needs more transfer paper and practice skin</li>
            <li>but if your looking for something to start off with and get a good product for an affordable price than you found the right deal.</li>
            <li>Great buy for decent tattoo artist.</li>
            <li>First, I need to say that it&#x27;s a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>pretty good deal...</li>
            <li>Pretty good tattoo machine for a beginner comes with everything you need to start tattooing.</li>
            <li>The case is brilliant love the key lock.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because these machines are very good machines especially for the price.</li>
            <li>And what help you&#x27;ll get is minimal at best, my apprentice called me at two in the morning hollering with frustration over it.</li>
            <li>Great kit for someone that got rid of all their stuff and wants to start back up, or great for beginners.</li>
            <li>The kit was easy to set up with help from online videos.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s an easy fix to correct this.</li>
            <li>it comes with is strong.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and worth the money.</li>
            <li>My artist that i have is pretty nice just on freestyle with this thing.</li>
            <li>the machines themselves SEEM to be pretty nice quality for the price, but I can&#x27;t for the life of  me figure out why they won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>other than that its a good buy at a good price.</li>
            <li>Nice exactly what the picture desceibed.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it was easy enough to figure out how to put the guns together and my first tattoo came out great!</li>
            <li>The guns work just fine, comes with ALMOST everything you need to pick up and start tatting...</li>
            <li>My kit included everything it said It would and got to me super fast, which I loved.</li>
            <li>Except one machine it has a huge punch on it.</li>
            <li>but overall this kit has everything as described, great for beginners,  </li>
            <li>The box is a light plastic.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a fantastic \\&quot;how to tattoo\\&quot; series on ehow that I&#x27;d reccomend in place of the DVD for the novice, but nothing is going to help a newbie like a hands-on apprenticeship.</li>
            <li>the foot pedal is kinda cheap and</li>
            <li>Overall, definately a great buy, i recommend this for both the beginner and intermediate tattooist.</li>
            <li>The machines are smooth, comfortable  and well made.</li>
            <li>Cheap ink.</li>
            <li>great kit, especially for a novice or a practice set.</li>
            <li>is running smooth also</li>
            <li>quality of everything is really good, he did a tattoo on me the night he got it and even the professional award</li>
            <li>arrived early and everything in good shape.</li>
            <li>so far its good machines for the  beginner.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean and sanitize all parts before first use and after every use!</li>
            <li>I can now get my left are sleeve done for free woohoo!!!</li>
            <li>Overall its very nice</li>
            <li>Everything it comes with is very nice except the ink, which others have recently mentioned.</li>
            <li>but the good part I was able to send it back for a full refund</li>
            <li>This item comes with so much stuff very easy steps on how to use the products.</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>My son loves it and was so excited when I gave it to him.</li>
            <li>bottles of ink are a lil on the small side but great for a starter!</li>
            <li>The tools are clean and everything works.</li>
            <li>mine has some rust on a portion of the shader machine and the tube/grips don&#x27;t seem to fit very snug even with the vise tightened all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to use this kit (for practice or otherwise), one would need further instructions via an experienced artist, YouTube, etc.</li>
            <li>The only thing you would need to purchase with this kit is good inks, and sterilized pads to cover your tattoo.  </li>
            <li>I bought it with the expectations  of a full starter kit</li>
            <li>it just wasn&#x27;t a full starter kit</li>
            <li>Good starting out with!</li>
            <li>so overall it was a good buy</li>
            <li>cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool</li>
            <li>love to brief case it have the professional look ,great bundle accessories and starter guide.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t find good about this kit is the ink.</li>
            <li>Yet to test but its going to b cool.</li>
            <li>its not a bad kit to start with.</li>
            <li>The ink is not bad either.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price or considering that it is a starter kit.</li>
            <li>other than  that I&#x27;m happy with my kit.</li>
            <li>If you do order this kit though, be sure to get some more ink and maybe some extra tips.</li>
            <li>Came quick..</li>
            <li>Ok for practice but to use on actual skin I would suggest getting a better quality machine</li>
            <li>I received the kit on schedule and it was processed quickly.  </li>
            <li>product itself is barely worthy of being called a starter kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I contacted the company, and they were nice enough to send me free replacement clip cords, power supply and foot pedal, and when I hooked the new ones up to my machine, it worked jut fine!</li>
            <li>winning tattoo artist I normally go to was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>it haven&#x27;t touched th ink rather get high quality ink great price although its the same price on the official website</li>
            <li>well there was so much in the kit that was great for her first kit, that we did not want to send it back</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy some higher quality inks for your skin, but other than that it&#x27;s a great kit that should meet just about anyone&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li>,  I recommend replacing the inks since the ones included are on low quality but overall very good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy it as much as i am.</li>
            <li>dont know much about tattooing but seems like it puts ink into skin accurately.</li>
            <li>The video is not really that good.  </li>
            <li>The power supply for the price is well worth it..</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>this kit is like the fancierstudio a04 by eye power that i bought a while back, and that kit was nice</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price if you dont know what your doing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re reasonably familiar with tattoo equipment, this would be a smart purchase.</li>
            <li>the only thing i did was got better ink other than that l works great. .</li>
            <li>the shipping time was pretty quick</li>
            <li>one of the guns didnt work and the other is not that good at all.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this kit for those just starting, since for the most part it is fairly easy to manage.</li>
            <li>This product arrived right on time</li>
            <li>something isn&#x27;t right with the links or something when I click it</li>
            <li>I received it in the mail right on time, and got right to work.</li>
            <li>The kit got evrithin to do the job done , complete and the price is afordable , easy to use , even if you are beginer</li>
            <li>The tattoo guns, tips, needles, and power supply where all working properly, and I was told that for what I paid, it is more than worth it.</li>
            <li>I received the package very fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li>This is my first tattoo kit</li>
            <li>Thanks For Making This Tattoo Kit !</li>
            <li>The power supply is just very basic, I would recommend one that gives more details how your machine is running.</li>
            <li>The needles are standard needles, although they do include a lot magnums, which I don&#x27;t use, so I would recommend ordering more needles that you prefer to use.</li>
            <li>the only downside is that im not to sure about the inks</li>
            <li>is exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, you get what you pay for, buying all this stuff individually would cost you more, so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li>He did the first tat</li>
            <li>One of the guns wasn&#x27;t working at first and his friend did some adjustments to it</li>
            <li>This is my first tattoo set Ive ever bought.  </li>
            <li>(It was my first time using one).</li>
            <li>the fake skin is not the best</li>
            <li>it works like expected good price the inks work better than what i expected</li>
            <li>an sure enough there was....</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this kit over my first tattoo kit.</li>
            <li>free shipping.the ink come with the last eye power kit was sterizied and worked good as primz or some of them other higher end inks.</li>
            <li>It is an eyepower kit that I got with a few more items then described, but I was more then satisfied with what I got for the money spent.</li>
            <li>not much down time, due to moving.&lt;br /&gt;will try to get more practice in and write a better rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>it had a liner and shader and come with some real decent stainless steel guns,that im still using,i have had serval kits and this one is like a pro.</li>
            <li>It came with more then expected, very good starter kit and well worth the money I spent on this little home project.</li>
            <li>pretty decent set for ppl on a budget.</li>
            <li>A very high quality and affordable starter kit, can&#x27;t beat the price, quality for those newbies and beginners wanting to explore the art of tattooing.</li>
            <li>The needles don&#x27;t look very high quality</li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>Who woulda thought its so hard to get good info on how to tattoo properly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The gun is a very solid, heavy metal (great quality).  </li>
            <li>This tattoo kit is really what I needed to start practicing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>For whatever reason when I connect the clip cord to my machine and press the foot petal, it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>You turn it and absolutely nothing happens..</li>
            <li>the 2 guns worked real well</li>
            <li>It came with more disposable tips than I had expected</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Gun is very feel put together for its price.</li>
            <li>The DVD is an absolute joke though.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really show you how to set up your machine correctly, but some internet searches and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, the product is what they listed but don&#x27;t expect much from it.  </li>
            <li>They were very helpful with placing a return, and I&#x27;ll be trying out another kit.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li>but i must say i didnt really think in my mind everything would be like it shows</li>
            <li>I tat up my friend like crazy and this gun is awesome.</li>
            <li>The tattoo machines are good, but the ink sucks.</li>
            <li>I did a few tattoos that turn out nice.</li>
            <li>ok the other colors don&#x27;t .  </li>
            <li>This is everything you will need, (other then the better quality inks).</li>
            <li>i will save$$$$$$$$. stainless steel tips are high and tubes,</li>
            <li>There was a difference in the guns as described, but the company IMMEDIATELY fixed the problem and would strongly recommend to others as well as I will be ordering from them again in the future!</li>
            <li>Most things included are reasonably reliable and the only problem I had was with one of the tattoo machines losing power, but it was a simple repair.</li>
            <li>would recommend the kit for young first timers</li>
            <li>one,the main reason i bought it, it had alot of supplies,such as o rings ink cups  and decent ink,stainless steel tips and tubes,grips,if i bought all this stuff separate</li>
            <li>It goes up high.</li>
            <li>And its high powered you&#x27;ll be doing tatts faster than before...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It even arrived early!!</li>
            <li>Good item to buy, the only thing that sucks was the ink had to buy better ink, other then that you should buy this</li>
            <li>so I felt left in the dark and had to do my own research</li>
            <li>Overall its still worth the buy.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or hassle of sending it back.  </li>
            <li>That kind of sucks  </li>
            <li>The DVD is pretty cheesy but its a good kit for the money</li>
            <li>i have only tried it 2 times and it seems to be fun.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t review products</li>
            <li>Its not hard to put together at all.</li>
            <li>really u will want to get a new power supply if u want to use this set professionally</li>
            <li>There are a few extra things that we had to order, like: Cosco Green Soap, Spray bottle, extra gloves, Mom&#x27;s Ink(for when you are good), Vaseline, etc... but other than that the kit is pretty good.</li>
            <li>came in wrapped very professional.</li>
            <li>LOL CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li>Only problem is i have never seen ink fade that fast from skin.</li>
            <li>im trying to learn the craft and its doing the job so far.  </li>
            <li>We were surprised with everything it came with.</li>
            <li>it came with one sheet of trace paper no green soap no stencil solution</li>
            <li>Complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>the power unit only worked for an hour but for the price I didn&#x27;t expect much...</li>
            <li>as far as I can tell all of the accessory&#x27;s came and match the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not for professional use</li>
            <li>The machines are solid but needed to be adjust thanks to my buddys at the shop.</li>
            <li>but I bought professional ink</li>
            <li>it came early which was a plus</li>
            <li>Machines-get them check by a professional.  </li>
            <li>The kit came within 2 days complete with everything, works well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my son who&#x27;s a natural artist.</li>
            <li>but everything was packed professionally and was everything i ordered.</li>
            <li>Well update one i get it going so far</li>
            <li>The dvd is not much help but worth a view.</li>
            <li>got this kit yesterday , and also the ink isnt so good but ill manage .</li>
            <li>Everything that came with the kit is good,  but its now useless until I go out and buy another power supply.</li>
            <li>The main reason I picked this bundle instead of another bundle was the actual guns.</li>
            <li>The high points of this kit are the only things that matter.   </li>
            <li>Power supply-as long as you dont run it too high</li>
            <li>The instructional DVD was complete garbage...horribly produced and edited and the chinese subtitles lets</li>
            <li>It took the ink well, but it was hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Second one of these bought,both were great for the price,but both had bad power packs,</li>
            <li>So, overall, I&#x27;d reccomend this kit to beginners who have a general idea of what they&#x27;re doing, what the parts of the machine are, things like that.</li>
            <li>I would agree with the other reviews and say that buying new ink is an absolute MUST if you&#x27;re going to be using this machine for anything other than just practice.</li>
            <li>We had to order a new one last week and onky used the other 5 times.</li>
            <li>This product is good the only bad thing about it</li>

            <li> About To Make Good Money From It, An Buy More Of Your Products.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We just watched YouTube and that was 100% more help than this DVD</li>
            <li> The power supply is ok.</li>
            <li> Better videos on the web if you look.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d be better off looking up instructions on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I love my tattookit I been doing tats alday</li>
            <li> I love tattoos I am covered ...</li>
            <li> Great deal and very helpful</li>
            <li> Too many magnums, not too many people use them.</li>
            <li> i have to buy all the colors which cost way more</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> This kit would best be used for practice and getting the balance of the machines rather than actually inking someone.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> He really likes the equipment and the tat came out great.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working better now.</li>
            <li> However, get some better ink.</li>
            <li> Over all i wold purchase more of these.  </li>
            <li> The inks is ok</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The tattoo machines are ok.</li>
            <li> Make sure there are tuned and take the sticker off of the bottom</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what is has on the top not a lion</li>
            <li> Just needs more transfer paper and practice skin</li>
            <li> but if your looking for something to start off with and get a good product for an affordable price than you found the right deal.</li>
            <li> Great buy for decent tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> First, I need to say that it&#x27;s a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> pretty good deal...</li>
            <li> Pretty good tattoo machine for a beginner comes with everything you need to start tattooing.</li>
            <li> The case is brilliant love the key lock.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because these machines are very good machines especially for the price.</li>
            <li> And what help you&#x27;ll get is minimal at best, my apprentice called me at two in the morning hollering with frustration over it.</li>
            <li> Great kit for someone that got rid of all their stuff and wants to start back up, or great for beginners.</li>
            <li> The kit was easy to set up with help from online videos.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s an easy fix to correct this.</li>
            <li> it comes with is strong.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and worth the money.</li>
            <li> My artist that i have is pretty nice just on freestyle with this thing.</li>
            <li> the machines themselves SEEM to be pretty nice quality for the price, but I can&#x27;t for the life of  me figure out why they won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> other than that its a good buy at a good price.</li>
            <li> Nice exactly what the picture desceibed.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it was easy enough to figure out how to put the guns together and my first tattoo came out great!</li>
            <li> The guns work just fine, comes with ALMOST everything you need to pick up and start tatting...</li>
            <li> My kit included everything it said It would and got to me super fast, which I loved.</li>
            <li> Except one machine it has a huge punch on it.</li>
            <li> but overall this kit has everything as described, great for beginners,  </li>
            <li> The box is a light plastic.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a fantastic \\&quot;how to tattoo\\&quot; series on ehow that I&#x27;d reccomend in place of the DVD for the novice, but nothing is going to help a newbie like a hands-on apprenticeship.</li>
            <li> the foot pedal is kinda cheap and</li>
            <li> Overall, definately a great buy, i recommend this for both the beginner and intermediate tattooist.</li>
            <li> The machines are smooth, comfortable  and well made.</li>
            <li> Cheap ink.</li>
            <li> great kit, especially for a novice or a practice set.</li>
            <li> is running smooth also</li>
            <li> quality of everything is really good, he did a tattoo on me the night he got it and even the professional award</li>
            <li> arrived early and everything in good shape.</li>
            <li> so far its good machines for the  beginner.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean and sanitize all parts before first use and after every use!</li>
            <li> I can now get my left are sleeve done for free woohoo!!!</li>
            <li> Overall its very nice</li>
            <li> Everything it comes with is very nice except the ink, which others have recently mentioned.</li>
            <li> but the good part I was able to send it back for a full refund</li>
            <li> This item comes with so much stuff very easy steps on how to use the products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> My son loves it and was so excited when I gave it to him.</li>
            <li> bottles of ink are a lil on the small side but great for a starter!</li>
            <li> The tools are clean and everything works.</li>
            <li> mine has some rust on a portion of the shader machine and the tube/grips don&#x27;t seem to fit very snug even with the vise tightened all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to use this kit (for practice or otherwise), one would need further instructions via an experienced artist, YouTube, etc.</li>
            <li> The only thing you would need to purchase with this kit is good inks, and sterilized pads to cover your tattoo.  </li>
            <li> I bought it with the expectations  of a full starter kit</li>
            <li> it just wasn&#x27;t a full starter kit</li>
            <li> Good starting out with!</li>
            <li> so overall it was a good buy</li>
            <li> cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool</li>
            <li> love to brief case it have the professional look ,great bundle accessories and starter guide.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t find good about this kit is the ink.</li>
            <li> Yet to test but its going to b cool.</li>
            <li> its not a bad kit to start with.</li>
            <li> The ink is not bad either.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price or considering that it is a starter kit.</li>
            <li> other than  that I&#x27;m happy with my kit.</li>
            <li> If you do order this kit though, be sure to get some more ink and maybe some extra tips.</li>
            <li> Came quick..</li>
            <li> Ok for practice but to use on actual skin I would suggest getting a better quality machine</li>
            <li> I received the kit on schedule and it was processed quickly.  </li>
            <li> product itself is barely worthy of being called a starter kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted the company, and they were nice enough to send me free replacement clip cords, power supply and foot pedal, and when I hooked the new ones up to my machine, it worked jut fine!</li>
            <li> winning tattoo artist I normally go to was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> it haven&#x27;t touched th ink rather get high quality ink great price although its the same price on the official website</li>
            <li> well there was so much in the kit that was great for her first kit, that we did not want to send it back</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy some higher quality inks for your skin, but other than that it&#x27;s a great kit that should meet just about anyone&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li> ,  I recommend replacing the inks since the ones included are on low quality but overall very good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy it as much as i am.</li>
            <li> dont know much about tattooing but seems like it puts ink into skin accurately.</li>
            <li> The video is not really that good.  </li>
            <li> The power supply for the price is well worth it..</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> this kit is like the fancierstudio a04 by eye power that i bought a while back, and that kit was nice</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price if you dont know what your doing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reasonably familiar with tattoo equipment, this would be a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> the only thing i did was got better ink other than that l works great. .</li>
            <li> the shipping time was pretty quick</li>
            <li> one of the guns didnt work and the other is not that good at all.</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this kit for those just starting, since for the most part it is fairly easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This product arrived right on time</li>
            <li> something isn&#x27;t right with the links or something when I click it</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail right on time, and got right to work.</li>
            <li> The kit got evrithin to do the job done , complete and the price is afordable , easy to use , even if you are beginer</li>
            <li> The tattoo guns, tips, needles, and power supply where all working properly, and I was told that for what I paid, it is more than worth it.</li>
            <li> I received the package very fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> This is my first tattoo kit</li>
            <li> Thanks For Making This Tattoo Kit !</li>
            <li> The power supply is just very basic, I would recommend one that gives more details how your machine is running.</li>
            <li> The needles are standard needles, although they do include a lot magnums, which I don&#x27;t use, so I would recommend ordering more needles that you prefer to use.</li>
            <li> the only downside is that im not to sure about the inks</li>
            <li> is exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you get what you pay for, buying all this stuff individually would cost you more, so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> He did the first tat</li>
            <li> One of the guns wasn&#x27;t working at first and his friend did some adjustments to it</li>
            <li> This is my first tattoo set Ive ever bought.  </li>
            <li> (It was my first time using one).</li>
            <li> the fake skin is not the best</li>
            <li> it works like expected good price the inks work better than what i expected</li>
            <li> an sure enough there was....</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this kit over my first tattoo kit.</li>
            <li> free shipping.the ink come with the last eye power kit was sterizied and worked good as primz or some of them other higher end inks.</li>
            <li> It is an eyepower kit that I got with a few more items then described, but I was more then satisfied with what I got for the money spent.</li>
            <li> not much down time, due to moving.&lt;br /&gt;will try to get more practice in and write a better rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> it had a liner and shader and come with some real decent stainless steel guns,that im still using,i have had serval kits and this one is like a pro.</li>
            <li> It came with more then expected, very good starter kit and well worth the money I spent on this little home project.</li>
            <li> pretty decent set for ppl on a budget.</li>
            <li> A very high quality and affordable starter kit, can&#x27;t beat the price, quality for those newbies and beginners wanting to explore the art of tattooing.</li>
            <li> The needles don&#x27;t look very high quality</li>
            <li> Very high quality</li>
            <li> Who woulda thought its so hard to get good info on how to tattoo properly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The gun is a very solid, heavy metal (great quality).  </li>
            <li> This tattoo kit is really what I needed to start practicing.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> For whatever reason when I connect the clip cord to my machine and press the foot petal, it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> You turn it and absolutely nothing happens..</li>
            <li> the 2 guns worked real well</li>
            <li> It came with more disposable tips than I had expected</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Gun is very feel put together for its price.</li>
            <li> The DVD is an absolute joke though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really show you how to set up your machine correctly, but some internet searches and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, the product is what they listed but don&#x27;t expect much from it.  </li>
            <li> They were very helpful with placing a return, and I&#x27;ll be trying out another kit.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li> but i must say i didnt really think in my mind everything would be like it shows</li>
            <li> I tat up my friend like crazy and this gun is awesome.</li>
            <li> The tattoo machines are good, but the ink sucks.</li>
            <li> I did a few tattoos that turn out nice.</li>
            <li> ok the other colors don&#x27;t .  </li>
            <li> This is everything you will need, (other then the better quality inks).</li>
            <li> i will save$$$$$$$$. stainless steel tips are high and tubes,</li>
            <li> There was a difference in the guns as described, but the company IMMEDIATELY fixed the problem and would strongly recommend to others as well as I will be ordering from them again in the future!</li>
            <li> Most things included are reasonably reliable and the only problem I had was with one of the tattoo machines losing power, but it was a simple repair.</li>
            <li> would recommend the kit for young first timers</li>
            <li> one,the main reason i bought it, it had alot of supplies,such as o rings ink cups  and decent ink,stainless steel tips and tubes,grips,if i bought all this stuff separate</li>
            <li> It goes up high.</li>
            <li> And its high powered you&#x27;ll be doing tatts faster than before...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It even arrived early!!</li>
            <li> Good item to buy, the only thing that sucks was the ink had to buy better ink, other then that you should buy this</li>
            <li> so I felt left in the dark and had to do my own research</li>
            <li> Overall its still worth the buy.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or hassle of sending it back.  </li>
            <li> That kind of sucks  </li>
            <li> The DVD is pretty cheesy but its a good kit for the money</li>
            <li> i have only tried it 2 times and it seems to be fun.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review products</li>
            <li> Its not hard to put together at all.</li>
            <li> really u will want to get a new power supply if u want to use this set professionally</li>
            <li> There are a few extra things that we had to order, like: Cosco Green Soap, Spray bottle, extra gloves, Mom&#x27;s Ink(for when you are good), Vaseline, etc... but other than that the kit is pretty good.</li>
            <li> came in wrapped very professional.</li>
            <li> LOL CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> Only problem is i have never seen ink fade that fast from skin.</li>
            <li> im trying to learn the craft and its doing the job so far.  </li>
            <li> We were surprised with everything it came with.</li>
            <li> it came with one sheet of trace paper no green soap no stencil solution</li>
            <li> Complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> the power unit only worked for an hour but for the price I didn&#x27;t expect much...</li>
            <li> as far as I can tell all of the accessory&#x27;s came and match the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not for professional use</li>
            <li> The machines are solid but needed to be adjust thanks to my buddys at the shop.</li>
            <li> but I bought professional ink</li>
            <li> it came early which was a plus</li>
            <li> Machines-get them check by a professional.  </li>
            <li> The kit came within 2 days complete with everything, works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who&#x27;s a natural artist.</li>
            <li> but everything was packed professionally and was everything i ordered.</li>
            <li> Well update one i get it going so far</li>
            <li> The dvd is not much help but worth a view.</li>
            <li> got this kit yesterday , and also the ink isnt so good but ill manage .</li>
            <li> Everything that came with the kit is good,  but its now useless until I go out and buy another power supply.</li>
            <li> The main reason I picked this bundle instead of another bundle was the actual guns.</li>
            <li> The high points of this kit are the only things that matter.   </li>
            <li> Power supply-as long as you dont run it too high</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD was complete garbage...horribly produced and edited and the chinese subtitles lets</li>
            <li> It took the ink well, but it was hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Second one of these bought,both were great for the price,but both had bad power packs,</li>
            <li> So, overall, I&#x27;d reccomend this kit to beginners who have a general idea of what they&#x27;re doing, what the parts of the machine are, things like that.</li>
            <li> I would agree with the other reviews and say that buying new ink is an absolute MUST if you&#x27;re going to be using this machine for anything other than just practice.</li>
            <li> We had to order a new one last week and onky used the other 5 times.</li>
            <li> This product is good the only bad thing about it</li>
            <li> it shows me the 38 special tattoo machine and a plain black one, the two I received in the kit</li>
            <li> the only negative thing i really have to say about it is the pictures make&#x27;s it look like a way bigger kit</li>
            <li> Also, the &#x27;lock&#x27; it says it has is so cheap it feels like your going to break the key opening it, so needless to say I wont be locking it.</li>
            <li> The kit comes complete with a \\&quot;liner\\&quot; and a \\&quot;shader\\&quot;, both made of heavy metal.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t expect the machines to hold up for to long.</li>
            <li> He has a friend that&#x27;s been tattooing for a long time and he&#x27;s been doing an apprenticeship with.</li>
            <li> The machines are not high quality...</li>
            <li> Especially for a small personal business.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have had is the gun being loose where the needle goes through and the needles have been known to pop off a few times.</li>
            <li> Long story short waste of money!</li>
            <li> I reccomend this shit for starting artists! !!!</li>
            <li> They are also extremely poor quality, and they will fade extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I knew the ink was most likely going to be crap from reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It sucked  plain and simple one gun didn&#x27;t even work!!!</li>
            <li> did&#x27;nt work at all, the other one had a bad cord that I was able to fix somewhat disappointing,guns are decent,good starter kit.</li>
            <li> The product comes with big ink caps, small ink caps, a black metal ink stand, tracing paper (to transfer tattoo design), inks (which I wouldnt use, they are very watery and does not apply to skin well at all), two guns (one for shading, one for outlining)best quality guns Ive dealt with, a box of sterilzed needles (both for shading and outlining), practice skin, a pair of rubber gloves, instructional video (which has soap opera music in the background which makes it hard to hear), two heavy grips, and needle tips.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This &amp; That-plenty of caps, grommets, rubber bands and other things.    </li>
            <li> One small problem I&#x27;ve found, is it seems like the barrels included are a bit too short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not putting this down as a bad set but should&#x27;ve had disposable tubes instead of the disposable tips overall not a bad starter</li>
            <li> Average but gets the job done</li>
            <li> dvd had no useful info on it though.</li>
            <li> not worth the money i would not recomend buying this.</li>
            <li> just got one for more money for a friend and is crap</li>
            <li> the black works</li>
            <li> It also comes with disposable and non-disposable tips, two sizes of ink cups, rubber bands, tools for your gun, and inks that are usable, but slightly runny.</li>
            <li> Shipped in less than a week, the case was way nicer than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> after less then 10 minutes sparks and then nothing......</li>
            <li> Ink is a bit faded, except for black.</li>
            <li> the only Thing i would say not good is the ink</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel ripped off just a little mislead.  </li>
            <li> and it has been used on a few tattoos but the machines are hit or miss...</li>
            <li> The machines a heavy duty and durable.</li>
            <li> So I got my order a few days ago and kinds upset.  </li>
            <li> Gun worked for a few hours and died on me.</li>
            <li> and like every other review i agree that the ink sucks</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be 5 out of 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for a couple small little things, but I wouldn&#x27;t let them stop you from buying this kit.</li>
            <li> Came with everything it said t had listed did my first tat with it and work bad ass can not stop useing it</li>
            <li> only real complaint is the inks.</li>
            <li> This kit also comes with two packets of ointment, rubber bands, and small accessories youll need.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used a tattoo machine in the past or haven&#x27;t been showed how to use one, you will be pulling your hair out trying to look up the assembly instructions somewhere online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied</li>
            <li> The dvd is pointless as it contains no helpful info</li>
            <li> the wrong color ink and the ink is very low quality and fades.</li>
            <li> after my daughter waited for this with such anticipation to put her art skills to fake skin....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advice: if you´re a rookie don´t use the fake skin that comes with it, you´ll feel disappointed ´cause make a tattoo in real skin is totally different, go to a meat shop and buy pig skin to practice!</li>
            <li> practice skin sucks the metal rust quikly the machianes themselves work</li>
            <li> And the ink sucks</li>
            <li> The DVD kinda sucks, but what do you expect for $60.</li>
            <li> The machine itself was broken, and I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> ; what does that even mean.</li>
            <li> good news is, it came earlier than expected, bad news is, it was hell trying to get it to turn on, sometimes the needle has to be off of the nipple for it to turn on and the dvd is HORRIBLE, i had to learn how to do it myself, the quality was so horrific</li>
            <li> They are pretty horrible, but usable I guess.</li>
            <li> and the practice skin was fairly weak.  </li>
            <li> I used a tiny bit of the black that came in the kit, and its terrible!!!</li>
            <li> Please, only use the ink it comes with for practicing on fake skin!!</li>
            <li> The power supply is already broken.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the DVD because I am being apprenticed at a shop, but the skin worked well, although it is extremely thin, I could practice on both sides of the sheet, if you don&#x27;t like the way the fake skin is working just buy some fruit and tattoo that.</li>
            <li> as a novice, a manual of some sort, other than that worthless dvd, would have been helpful.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Has annoying music playing and the audio is a little off.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying this machine because of the price</li>
            <li> oh yeah, and a lousy dvd.</li>
            <li> Ill keep you posted as I use the kit.</li>
            <li> fake skin is a joke, buy pig skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The included video is absurd.</li>
            <li> sorry for the bad review</li>
            <li> Also, the DVD that&#x27;s included in the kit it grainy, sometimes difficult to hear over the terrible background music, and not the least bit helpful.</li>
            <li> so disappointment sets in...</li>
            <li> I think it was bad when I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience with Amazon nor the company</li>
            <li> don&#x27;nt have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out.i need abox bad</li>
            <li> i shocked...</li>
            <li> The ink is crap..</li>
            <li> Its crap.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, &amp;#34;chromatically rapidness&amp;#34; &amp;#34;stuff Japan&amp;#34; &amp;#34;prevalence USA&amp;#34</li>
            <li> (I submitted a photo of the crap</li>
            <li> The ink is crap.</li>
            <li> even no why they put that crap ink in</li>
            <li> Wtf!!!</li>
            <li> The Video is Horrible,  :-|</li>
            <li> The DVD is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> practice skin sucks the metal rust quikly the machianes themselves work well id get extra products with this</li>
            <li> Overall everthing was perfect the dvd it comes with isnt helpful though so I recommend doing some searching online on how to set up your tattoo machine and the ink is okay not to good but overall this kit has everything as described, great for beginners,  arrived on time and no damage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect I love it</li>
            <li> Everything was great! Only problem is i have never seen ink fade that fast from skin. I would recomend buying different inks with this kit.</li>
            <li> This kit is excellent for beginners. Make sure to clean and sanitize all parts before first use and after every use! (Boiling water, 5-10 min) Would&#x27;ve given 5 stars if the DVD it came with actually worked. Thankfully it was easy enough to figure out how to put the guns together and my first tattoo came out great! Also, the &#x27;lock&#x27; it says it has is so cheap it feels like your going to break the key opening it, so needless to say I wont be locking it. Over all it was a great buy. I was skeptical buying this machine because of the price but it exceedingly fulfilled my expectations! I would definitely recommended this product!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice kit! There was a difference in the guns as described, but the company IMMEDIATELY fixed the problem and would strongly recommend to others as well as I will be ordering from them again in the future! Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> This tattoo kit is really what I needed to start practicing. It&#x27;s great and can&#x27;t wait to get even better at it. Wish I could get some more stuff that way id have extra.</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect for any beginner.. But be sure too purchase separate Ink. Intenze or moms.</li>
            <li> The gun looks better in person.  The gun is a very solid, heavy metal (great quality).  The product comes with big ink caps, small ink caps, a black metal ink stand, tracing paper (to transfer tattoo design), inks (which I wouldnt use, they are very watery and does not apply to skin well at all), two guns (one for shading, one for outlining)best quality guns Ive dealt with, a box of sterilzed needles (both for shading and outlining), practice skin, a pair of rubber gloves, instructional video (which has soap opera music in the background which makes it hard to hear), two heavy grips, and needle tips.  The power cord and petal it comes with is strong.  It goes up high. The box is a light plastic.  This kit also comes with two packets of ointment, rubber bands, and small accessories youll need.  The only thing you would need to purchase with this kit is good inks, and sterilized pads to cover your tattoo.  Its a definate buy.</li>
            <li> DVD did not work at all so I felt left in the dark and had to do my own research but ii figured it out.</li>
            <li> this is a great starter kit, but not for tattooers, just idiots like like to tattoo themselves.:D (like me)&lt;br /&gt;but yeah, there are no instructions of setting up the machines, getting the tubes in, NOTHING. theres an 80s dvd with some rad porn music, but it also unehelpful.</li>
            <li> This product arrived right on time so I was happy about that. Most things included are reasonably reliable and the only problem I had was with one of the tattoo machines losing power, but it was a simple repair. I certainly recommend this kit for those just starting, since for the most part it is fairly easy to manage. If you do order this kit though, be sure to get some more ink and maybe some extra tips.</li>
            <li> This is my first tattoo kit and I like it. The tattoo machines are good, but the ink sucks. Overall its still worth the buy. I did a few tattoos that turn out nice.</li>
            <li> Magnifico kit, exelente calidad, 100% completo, lo unico que le falta son pigmento de mejor calidad, de resto todo magnifico</li>
            <li> I Really Love Your Product. About To Make Good Money From It, An Buy More Of Your Products. Thanks For Making This Tattoo Kit !</li>
            <li> Very nice kit works great came fast the only thing i did was got better ink other than that l works great. .</li>
            <li> I love everything about this tattoo machine and i love how everything came in the box great product no complains.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my tattoo artist aspiring boyfriend and he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It comes with so much!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of everything is really good, he did a tattoo on me the night he got it and even the professional award winning tattoo artist I normally go to was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality.</li>
            <li> something isn&#x27;t right with the links or something when I click it it shows me the 38 special tattoo machine and a plain black one, the two I received in the kit were neither I got like a swam and a dragon looking thing.  sometimes that image is also displayed. didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or hassle of sending it back.  the machines seem to work well im trying to learn the craft and its doing the job so far.  the ink is total bs the black works ok the other colors don&#x27;t .  all in all id say for 65 bucks I don&#x27;t feel ripped off just a little mislead.  I knew the ink was most likely going to be crap from reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Awesome price got here like two day early good guns s***y ink but best deal to start out and do good tattoos if u are a s***y artist love amazon</li>
            <li> Great buy for decent tattoo artist. My artist that i have is pretty nice just on freestyle with this thing. Comes with everything;  Power cords, Power box w/step pad, a box of all types of needles, 7 bottles of ink, 2 guns, all the parts/accessories, oh yeah, and a lousy dvd. But yeah, awesome buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife for christmas, No directions included.  The video is not really that good.  The kit was easy to set up with help from online videos.  About 30 minutes into using it, the power supply spiked to 20 and then started smoking.  So now have to buy another power supply.  That kind of sucks  but the rest of the kit is great for beginners.</li>
            <li> First, I need to say that it&#x27;s a good buy for the money. If you&#x27;re reasonably familiar with tattoo equipment, this would be a smart purchase. Good machines, good needles, passable ink. However, for the tattoo novice, this isn&#x27;t the kit to buy (I bought it for an apprentice to practice with). To begin, it doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions. If you haven&#x27;t used a tattoo machine in the past or haven&#x27;t been showed how to use one, you will be pulling your hair out trying to look up the assembly instructions somewhere online. And what help you&#x27;ll get is minimal at best, my apprentice called me at two in the morning hollering with frustration over it. Also, the DVD that&#x27;s included in the kit it grainy, sometimes difficult to hear over the terrible background music, and not the least bit helpful. There&#x27;s a fantastic \\&quot;how to tattoo\\&quot; series on ehow that I&#x27;d reccomend in place of the DVD for the novice, but nothing is going to help a newbie like a hands-on apprenticeship. So, overall, I&#x27;d reccomend this kit to beginners who have a general idea of what they&#x27;re doing, what the parts of the machine are, things like that. For people who are trying to be self-taught, please just read up and do some studying, get an apprenticeship, then hop online and order this. :)</li>
            <li> My kit included everything it said It would and got to me super fast, which I loved. I would of given 5 stars but my shader doesn&#x27;t work. I was so excited and then that..it sucked, but other than  that I&#x27;m happy with my kit. Thanks</li>
            <li> The DVD is NOT helpful... Other than that I guess its alright...</li>
            <li> It was a good kit everything came with it the only Thing i would say not good is the ink it&#x27;s runny so I would advise you to order some \\&quot; I got intenze ink</li>
            <li> For whatever reason when I connect the clip cord to my machine and press the foot petal, it does absolutely nothing.  The power supply is on and everything is connected, but it just isn&#x27;t making my machine run.  Anybody else have this problem or know what&#x27;s up? the machines themselves SEEM to be pretty nice quality for the price, but I can&#x27;t for the life of  me figure out why they won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d love to rate this 5 stars, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted the company, and they were nice enough to send me free replacement clip cords, power supply and foot pedal, and when I hooked the new ones up to my machine, it worked jut fine! Really happy with these machines, I&#x27;ve been able to do some nice work so far with them.  I would agree with the other reviews and say that buying new ink is an absolute MUST if you&#x27;re going to be using this machine for anything other than just practice.</li>
            <li> The power supply is already broken. I think it was bad when I got it. We had to order a new one last week and onky used the other 5 times.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a family member as they needed something to start off with. Item came on time. Everything was as said in detail.</li>
            <li> The DVD is pretty cheesy but its a good kit for the money and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Came quick..everything was there and it&#x27;s supeisingly good quality as well I&#x27;m satisfied :) I reccomend this shit for starting artists! !!!</li>
            <li> It is awesome connected both guns, they both run flawlessly. The Video is Horrible,  :-| The music was off The hook. The power supply for the price is well worth it.. The case is brilliant love the key lock. It came with more then expected, very good starter kit and well worth the money I spent on this little home project. I can now get my left are sleeve done for free woohoo!!! Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not putting this down as a bad set but should&#x27;ve had disposable tubes instead of the disposable tips overall not a bad starter</li>
            <li> You get what they say their giving u ok set but not the best.... really u will want to get a new power supply if u want to use this set professionally</li>
            <li> I ordered this tattoo kit to try my hand at tattooing. what I received was different then picture showed and description given.</li>
            <li> The kit got evrithin to do the job done , complete and the price is afordable , easy to use , even if you are beginer</li>
            <li> Ok for practice but to use on actual skin I would suggest getting a better quality machine</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because these machines are very good machines especially for the price. I would recommend this product to any beginning tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> The power supply didnt work! The dial wouldn&#x27;t adjust the speed! You turn it and absolutely nothing happens..it stays revved up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for 4 years and the equipment is still good. Good buy.</li>
            <li> The kit came on time, and works good but needs a better dvd and it also shouldnt have the soap opra music in the background!!!!</li>
            <li> it didnt come with instructions to know wat esxh part is usef fod or hoa to set the gun fod outlinr or shading. bit everytbing works grest no issues with it yet.</li>
            <li> The DVD is terrible. We just watched YouTube and that was 100% more help than this DVD it comes with. There are a few extra things that we had to order, like: Cosco Green Soap, Spray bottle, extra gloves, Mom&#x27;s Ink(for when you are good), Vaseline, etc... but other than that the kit is pretty good. We were surprised with everything it came with. Definitely a great starter kit if you don&#x27;t have anything to begin with. Please, only use the ink it comes with for practicing on fake skin!!</li>
            <li> Average but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Great beginners kit. I would suggest buying KURO SUMI ink instead of the default ink .&lt;br /&gt;I was suprised at the quality of the machines and accessories . GREAT KIT!!!</li>
            <li> The machines are not the same,but work good.The SS tips are good,but the RL all look the same.None of the tips are steril..you have to do that.Needles are good.The power supply is ok.The case is not what they say it is made out of.But its good for what it is.The ink is crap..GET RID OF IT.Get some good ink if you are going to try and tattoo some one.And the dvd you get is a joke.Better videos on the web if you look.Everything else is good.To tell the truth..its not a bad kit to start with.Its just some of the things they say you get is not the same as they show.</li>
            <li> The DVD didnt explain enough it was scratched. The machine itself was broken, and I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It sucked  plain and simple one gun didn&#x27;t even work!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied I bought it with the expectations  of a full starter kit it came with one sheet of trace paper no green soap no stencil solution it just wasn&#x27;t a full starter kit</li>
            <li> perfect kit to start with!</li>
            <li> Really great kit...the inks are not the best but do the job. The dvd is pointless as it contains no helpful info and you&#x27;d be better off looking up instructions on YouTube.</li>
            <li> when my package got to me the box was kind of beat up then when I opened the kit my ink was leaking so I wasn&#x27;t too happy but the good part I was able to send it back for a full refund the shipping time was pretty quick so that was a plus .</li>
            <li> POS!!! Dont buy it!!! Waste of money!!!! Its crap. Complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Dont get suckered.  This machine wont do any kinda tattoo you want on ur body.</li>
            <li> I love my tattookit I been doing tats alday make tht money baby</li>
            <li> pretty decent set for ppl on a budget. The guns work just fine, comes with ALMOST everything you need to pick up and start tatting...the foot pedal is kinda cheap and the power unit only worked for an hour but for the price I didn&#x27;t expect much...</li>
            <li> i bought this .and its everything it says it is . it doesn&#x27;t come with any how to&#x60;s so i wouldnt recommend this to someone who doesnt know anything about tattoo machines. ive already done 2 tatts .n got this kit yesterday , and also the ink isnt so good but ill manage . &#x3D;D ..</li>
            <li> Good kit. Comes with everything needed.&lt;br /&gt;Bad CD, unviewible.</li>
            <li> The main reason I picked this bundle instead of another bundle was the actual guns. as far as I can tell all of the accessory&#x27;s came and match the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the power supply and the guns are not what is shown. The guns that came and chrome looking dragon and swan. not the guns that show in the picture over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bait and switch.</li>
            <li> The machains work great !! Good item to buy, the only thing that sucks was the ink had to buy better ink, other then that you should buy this</li>
            <li> Awesome kit. Well worth the money. This is the best product for the price. Good deal. Would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> Great sale, not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I love tattoos I am covered ... my neice is a great artist .... my tattoo lady plans to teach her so we got her this kit. it has everything !great starter kit .... or anytime kit !</li>
            <li> this kit had some good stuff. the 2 guns worked real well</li>
            <li> bought as a gift for my brother in law loved it :) I&#x27;m 100% satisfied, great gift! Great price! Would buy a again!</li>
            <li> This was a great kit! Very easy to use and worth the money. My daughter is learning how to tattoo and this kits is a great way to start. This item comes with so much stuff very easy steps on how to use the products. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I got the kit 2 days after i placed my order so i was real pleased with that. The tattoo guns are great for a beginner like me but if i was you i would order some more ink because the ink is not that good. I hope you enjoy it as much as i am.</li>
            <li> I received this early and faster then expected. It came with everything you see in the pictures. It slings it like it should and I would recommend it to friends and family.. Overall its very nice</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail right on time, and got right to work. Opened the package, delved into the mysterious box to find just what I was looking for. The kit comes complete with a \\&quot;liner\\&quot; and a \\&quot;shader\\&quot;, both made of heavy metal. Along with a box of needles of various sizes. It also comes with disposable and non-disposable tips, two sizes of ink cups, rubber bands, tools for your gun, and inks that are usable, but slightly runny. Overall, definately a great buy, i recommend this for both the beginner and intermediate tattooist. 5 stars man.</li>
            <li> Good starting out with!</li>
            <li> Worked well for what I needed, shader was messed up but they sent a replacement immediately</li>
            <li> Great deal has everything I need at a great price , I&#x27;m in California , and it showed up quickly ,  thank you</li>
            <li> Not for professional use</li>
            <li> It was wonderful the product was exactly what it was on the screen. And its high powered you&#x27;ll be doing tatts faster than before...</li>
            <li> Shipped in less than a week, the case was way nicer than I thought it would be. The machines are solid but needed to be adjust thanks to my buddys at the shop. If you buy this kit you need to order different tubes. All in all I got what I paid for no complaints yet. Ill keep you posted as I use the kit.</li>
            <li> Had bacteria on item.</li>
            <li> Excellent Kit!!! The Guns are really nice, good material and well made!!! The Power supply is not the best, however you can work with it!!! The needles are good! Everything is OK! If you want to begin in this world this is your Kit! The only thing not so good are the Inks, you should buy a kit of good ones! I did a remake work with the inks and the Yellow didn´t work well! I recommend this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: if you´re a rookie don´t use the fake skin that comes with it, you´ll feel disappointed ´cause make a tattoo in real skin is totally different, go to a meat shop and buy pig skin to practice!</li>
            <li> This tattoo kit is amazing. Especially for a small personal business. I rate it 5 out of 5  star&#x27;s. You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Did NOT come with all the parts included. No instructions. The quality was ok, was not the best. If I could buy another I would spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> it is a great kit for the price... dvd had no useful info on it though. for learning how to tattoo its perfect.</li>
            <li> This kit is a very good beginners item for the person who wishes to start his/her career or hobby in tattooing. I recommend this item for the ideal beginner.</li>
            <li> Amazing kit but sometimes the one of the gun stops. And the ink sucks but I bought professional ink and it worked amazingly but shipping it came early which was a plus</li>
            <li> Every thing works. Except one machine it has a huge punch on it.</li>
            <li> I Just Bought This Kit &amp; I Was Just Wondering If It Comes With ate Case Bc Some Of Them Don&#x27;t Come With A Case .</li>
            <li> everything in this kit is very cheaply made. one of the guns didnt work and the other is not that good at all. it came with the wrong color ink and the ink is very low quality and fades. the clip cord has a short. not worth the money i would not recomend buying this.</li>
            <li> It was great!! Bought it as a gotta and she loved it!! It even arrived early!! I was completely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Great deal and very helpful&lt;br /&gt;Sadly mine didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> Great set...everything worked. Everything that was stated to come I  kit was there. No problems. Excellent product sold.</li>
            <li> The high points of this kit are the only things that matter.   Machines-get them check by a professional.  Power supply-as long as you dont run it too high you shouldnt have a problem.  This &amp; That-plenty of caps, grommets, rubber bands and other things.    Too many magnums, not too many people use them. i tossed mine when i opened my box of needles.  too many useless tips and such. disposable tubes should have grips.     other than that its a good buy at a good price. eventually these machines will be in a box forever as i move up the skill ladder but, as a beginner, i was told they are good to go for a while. just get them checked out.</li>
            <li> This product is good the only bad thing about it is ink the ink does not stick now i have to buy all the colors which cost way more then the tattoo kit</li>
            <li> great kit to practice with and it has been used on a few tattoos but the machines are hit or miss...how ever for the price the stuff in the kit pays for itself without the machines so overall it was a good buy just don&#x27;t expect the machines to hold up for to long.</li>
            <li> Nice exactly what the picture desceibed. cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool</li>
            <li> Only problem I have had is the gun being loose where the needle goes through and the needles have been known to pop off a few times.</li>
            <li> after my daughter waited for this with such anticipation to put her art skills to fake skin....after less then 10 minutes sparks and then nothing......so disappointment sets in...well there was so much in the kit that was great for her first kit, that we did not want to send it back so..fingers crossed we ordered another power supply...look out world wait to see her work Jessica G...barely going to be 17 and been an artist as soon as she could hold the fat crayons....anyhow i figure she will need alot of power supplies for back anyhow. would recommend the kit for young first timers...just know that you will have Magyver here and there to make the kit  yours.</li>
            <li> A very high quality and affordable starter kit, can&#x27;t beat the price, quality for those newbies and beginners wanting to explore the art of tattooing. This is a can&#x27;t miss ensemble.</li>
            <li> Came with every thig it promised and looked great but one of the machines didn&#x27;t work after one use which sucked.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. The machines a heavy duty and durable. It came with more disposable tips than I had expected so that&#x27;s a plus. Everything it comes with is very nice except the ink, which others have recently mentioned. I prefer Kuro Sumi ink, though. It&#x27;s a good brand. Other than that, the kit is very nice and perfect for the price... I highly recommend it. Good luck to those looking for something to start with!</li>
            <li> Came with everything it said t had listed did my first tat with it and work bad ass can not stop useing it</li>
            <li> works great. no problems. and an awsome tutorial dvd to get started, shows ya everything ya need to know. i love this kit !!</li>
            <li> I really like it and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> Gun is very feel put together for its price. The DVD is an absolute joke though. But I would recommend any to but this product.</li>
            <li> I give this tattoo kit 4.5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this kit to a novice/beginner. The machines are nice and well built. One small problem I&#x27;ve found, is it seems like the barrels included are a bit too short. But it&#x27;s an easy fix to correct this. The power supply is just very basic, I would recommend one that gives more details how your machine is running. The needles are standard needles, although they do include a lot magnums, which I don&#x27;t use, so I would recommend ordering more needles that you prefer to use. The practice skin they include isn&#x27;t the best, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is the inks. They are pretty horrible, but usable I guess. You do get what you pay for on that. I wouldn&#x27;t use them on a person, but for practice, they are suitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD is horrible. Has annoying music playing and the audio is a little off. Doesn&#x27;t really show you how to set up your machine correctly, but some internet searches and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Had it the next day using the amazon 1 day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be 5 out of 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for a couple small little things, but I wouldn&#x27;t let them stop you from buying this kit.</li>
            <li> Everything works great. DO NOT USE THE INKS THAT COME WITH THE KIT. They are made in china, and they do not have lead regulations. They are also extremely poor quality, and they will fade extremely fast. I bough &amp;#34;Intenze&amp;#34; ink. I didn&#x27;t use the DVD because I am being apprenticed at a shop, but the skin worked well, although it is extremely thin, I could practice on both sides of the sheet, if you don&#x27;t like the way the fake skin is working just buy some fruit and tattoo that. It took the ink well, but it was hard to clean. The tattoo guns, tips, needles, and power supply where all working properly, and I was told that for what I paid, it is more than worth it. This is everything you will need, (other then the better quality inks).</li>
            <li> My son loves it and was so excited when I gave it to him. H</li>
            <li> i looked online for hours trying to find the perfect kit for the best prices. i ordered this kit on the 14th and i just got it on the 20th and once i learned how to set it up it works perfect. this is a must buy product. very happy with this product. 5 stars all day. just order your own ink. the ink that comes with it looks to be trash items. and btw the movie that come&#x27;s with it doesn&#x27;t work for anything. so that&#x27;s also trash. But yeah still a must buy.</li>
            <li> machine and power suply works great! bottles of ink are a lil on the small side but great for a starter!</li>
            <li> I received the kit on schedule and it was processed quickly.  I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience with Amazon nor the company I bought it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is barely worthy of being called a starter kit.  It does have everything you need to tattoo yourself/someone else, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust this equipment.  This kit would best be used for practice and getting the balance of the machines rather than actually inking someone. The instructional DVD was complete garbage...horribly produced and edited and the chinese subtitles lets you know where this product is made.  The machines are not high quality...mine has some rust on a portion of the shader machine and the tube/grips don&#x27;t seem to fit very snug even with the vise tightened all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to use this kit (for practice or otherwise), one would need further instructions via an experienced artist, YouTube, etc. just to set up the machines properly, let alone actually tattoo someone!  The needles don&#x27;t look very high quality and I&#x27;m suspecting they probably aren&#x27;t properly sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the product is what they listed but don&#x27;t expect much from it.  It should be used as ONLY a practice kit so don&#x27;t expect quality tattoos from this equipment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I love it haven&#x27;t touched th ink rather get high quality ink great price although its the same price on the official website</li>
            <li> everything that was listed came in the kit. arrived early and everything in good shape. the only downside is that im not to sure about the inks saw a video on youtube saying to stay away becuase it is chinese inkand contains lead. has anyone tattoed themselves or anyone else with this \\&quot;TATTOO\\&quot; brand of ink????</li>
            <li> is exactly what i ordered. worked perfectly as i hoped and was cheaper that chain or department stores here in town. thank you</li>
            <li> The kit came within 2 days complete with everything, works well.</li>
            <li> love to brief case it have the professional look ,great bundle accessories and starter guide.I would recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I got this to practice and maybe give myself some tattoos. Who woulda thought its so hard to get good info on how to tattoo properly.&lt;br /&gt;The ink that comes with this... Holy crap, &amp;#34;chromatically rapidness&amp;#34; &amp;#34;stuff Japan&amp;#34; &amp;#34;prevalence USA&amp;#34; what does that even mean. I used a tiny bit of the black that came in the kit, and its terrible!!! (I submitted a photo of the crap ink)&lt;br /&gt;The fake skin is a joke, buy pig skin.&lt;br /&gt;The stencil paper does not transfer at all, I assume its old.&lt;br /&gt;And the grip and tubes are rusting already after two uses.... That can&#x27;t be good.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you get what you pay for, buying all this stuff individually would cost you more, so take that into consideration. They were very helpful with placing a return, and I&#x27;ll be trying out another kit.</li>
            <li> Very nice kit, comes nicely packaged. Very high quality and I&#x27;d say its the best deal you&#x27;ll ever get  for tattooing.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit. The machines are smooth, comfortable  and well made. Power supply is well made also. The only thing I didn&#x27;t find good about this kit is the ink. Cheap ink. If it would have had better ink it would be an excellent kit. That is why I took 1 star off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who&#x27;s a natural artist. He has a friend that&#x27;s been tattooing for a long time and he&#x27;s been doing an apprenticeship with. He did the first tat a couple of days after he got the kit. He really likes the equipment and the tat came out great.Con: One of the guns wasn&#x27;t working at first and his friend did some adjustments to it and it&#x27;s working better now.</li>
            <li> It works well. Im sure the profesionals do not use these, but im very happy with the quality of tattoos am producing. The included video is absurd.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Great for beginners very easy to use. However, get some better ink.</li>
            <li> this kit is like the fancierstudio a04 by eye power that i bought a while back, and that kit was nice it had a liner and shader and come with some real decent stainless steel guns,that im still using,i have had serval kits and this one is like a pro. one,the main reason i bought it, it had alot of supplies,such as o rings ink cups  and decent ink,stainless steel tips and tubes,grips,if i bought all this stuff separate it would been couple hundred bucks, so i&#x27;m going to buy this one for the case and the supplies,for the money you can&#x27;nt beat it,i&#x27;ll save about 150.00 like this than buying it piece by piece with the shipping and handling i will save$$$$$$$$. stainless steel tips are high and tubes,grips.you don&#x27;nt have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out.i need abox bad ,mine wore out,thats 20.00,itself.i can&#x27;nt wait to get this kit.  free shipping.the ink come with the last eye power kit was sterizied and worked good as primz or some of them other higher end inks. order you one .  JUST DON&#x27;NT GET THE LAST ONE OR I&#x27;LL BE PISSED, MAYBE THEY WILL PUT ME ONE ON RESERVE TILL NEXT WEEK WHEN I GET THE MONEY. LOL CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time ! . Was amazed by the quality of the product</li>
            <li> This piece of junk showed up dysfunctional I haven&#x27;t even gotten to use it the power supply is busted. Thanks.</li>
            <li> pretty good deal...dont know much about tattooing but seems like it puts ink into skin accurately. as a novice, a manual of some sort, other than that worthless dvd, would have been helpful.  and the practice skin was fairly weak.  definitely worth the price if you dont know what your doing.</li>
            <li> Its a starter kit, good for learning and for the money.  Use the ink it comes with to practice on the paper and or fruit. Then get some name brand ink to start the skin, you well have good results.</li>
            <li> Kept turning off well using it so I&#x27;m giving one starts sorry for the bad review but it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is my first tattoo set Ive ever bought.  The tools are clean and everything works. Its not hard to put together at all. The dvd is not much help but worth a view. Over all i wold purchase more of these.  The ink is not bad either.</li>
            <li> I have not plugged it in and tried it yet but everything was packed professionally and was everything i ordered. Well update one i get it going so far so good tho.</li>
            <li> The machines are great, I have to go on YouTube to find out how to set up the machine though because the DVD is bs. You can&#x27;t understand what the guy is saying. The inks is ok but I would not recommend the inks, buy different inks. otherwise from that the it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect&lt;br /&gt;The guns were awesome&lt;br /&gt;And the case was also very nice thank you....I rate it a five star</li>
            <li> Good starter kit. I wouldn&#x27;t use the ink that&#x27;s in it though since tattoo ink isn&#x27;t regulated and I have no idea where the kit actually comes from. The needles are alright. They get the job done. Very easy to assemble even if you&#x27;ve never used a tattoo machine before (It was my first time using one). The DVD kinda sucks, but what do you expect for $60. All in all, I would recommend this for newbs.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit for the money. You can&#x27;t really complain about anything. If your looking for the best of the best, this isn&#x27;t it but if your looking for something to start off with and get a good product for an affordable price than you found the right deal. I will suggest however that when you order this kit, order different ink. The ink is crap.</li>
            <li> The power supply died on me after just 25 min of use. Everything that came with the kit is good,  but its now useless until I go out and buy another power supply.</li>
            <li> great kit, especially for a novice or a practice set. I&#x27;d buy some higher quality inks for your skin, but other than that it&#x27;s a great kit that should meet just about anyone&#x27;s budget. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> this kit has everything i was promised.  the fake skin is not the best and i dont recommend beginners practicing on it but the product makers tell you that anyway....</li>
            <li> So I got my order a few days ago and kinds upset.  The tattoo machines are ok. Make sure there are tuned and take the sticker off of the bottom cause I did not see the s for shader and l for liner.  The bigger one is a liner.  Set them up and there good to go. Just whatever u do do not use the ink it may look good going in but the ink fades away to nothing when it&#x27;s healed.  I know how to tattoo.  To and get your self some moms tattoo ink.  I don&#x27;t even no why they put that crap ink in</li>
            <li> Great kit,  I recommend replacing the inks since the ones included are on low quality but overall very good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Great item! everything as described.</li>
            <li> so far its good machines for the  beginner. i have only tried it 2 times and it seems to be fun. not much down time, due to moving.&lt;br /&gt;will try to get more practice in and write a better rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Pretty good tattoo machine for a beginner comes with everything you need to start tattooing.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit. I received the package very fast. Everything worked perfect. I normally don&#x27;t review products but I was really impressed with this kit. I have not done any tattoos in years. I have already used both guns on my newest tattoo. It worked great. Great kit for someone that got rid of all their stuff and wants to start back up, or great for beginners.</li>
            <li> it works like expected good price the inks work better than what i expected</li>
            <li> Ink is a bit faded, except for black. Not bad for the price or considering that it is a starter kit.</li>
            <li> Gun worked for a few hours and died on me. Ink wasnt very good either. Great for a beginner tho</li>
            <li> best tattoo kit out there just got one for more money for a friend and is crap</li>
            <li> Second one of these bought,both were great for the price,but both had bad power packs,one power pack did&#x27;nt work at all, the other one had a bad cord that I was able to fix somewhat disappointing,guns are decent,good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Bought this kit to have some spare equipment to play with and I needed another case.  The machines are junk I might use one of the frames.  It is an eyepower kit that I got with a few more items then described, but I was more then satisfied with what I got for the money spent.</li>
            <li> so i recieved my kit today an it was everything they say it is....the guns are great,power supply is okay not the best but it will do,everything works an is running smooth also the power supply is not what&#x27;s in the picture its a eyepower an that&#x27;s what is has on the top not a lion and like every other review i agree that the ink sucks but it&#x27;s a hell of a kit to buy you cant beat the price!!! but i must say i didnt really think in my mind everything would be like it shows but man was i shocked...the only negative thing i really have to say about it is the pictures make&#x27;s it look like a way bigger kit then it is in person when i seen the box it came in i was like\\&quot; there is noway there is a case in there\\&quot; an sure enough there was....lol so looks can be decieving,other then that i hope this give people that want or are intrested a good outlook on what ur buying.....EVERYTHING IS GREAT.!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend he loves it i like it. Dont like is made in china but whatever. Got here nicely packaged .lots of goodies in it. Yet to test but its going to b cool.</li>
            <li> good news is, it came earlier than expected, bad news is, it was hell trying to get it to turn on, sometimes the needle has to be off of the nipple for it to turn on and the dvd is HORRIBLE, i had to learn how to do it myself, the quality was so horrific and i couldn&#x27;t hear a word at all.</li>
            <li> came in wrapped very professional. Everything works gud. I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this kit over my first tattoo kit. Just needs more transfer paper and practice skin but everything came as listed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and they must be written by the seller.  The power box and cords stop working after 10min of use. Wtf!!! I know it&#x27;s an inexpensive piece of equipment, but damn I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to not work at all! Long story short waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tat up my friend like crazy and this gun is awesome. The only problem is if you don&#x27;t know what your doing it doesn&#x27;t have instructions how to put it together.</li>
