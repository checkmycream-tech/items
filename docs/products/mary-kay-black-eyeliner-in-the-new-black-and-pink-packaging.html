            <li>Accurate description and the eyeliner is awesome!</li>
            <li>It is a roll up liner with a very smooth application.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order this for myself, and I love to order this as a gift for friends too.</li>
            <li>I love mary kay</li>
            <li>too!I like it better then</li>
            <li>but I thought it was supposed to be more like a Gel than a pencil.  </li>
            <li>but I think the trade off is worth it when it wears so nicely and doesn&#x27;t come off during the day.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>Love this liner does not smudge wears well easy to put on and remove im very picky with eyemakeup since i wear contacts but overall great buy luv marykay!</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great eye liner stays on for a long while and does not smudge.</li>
            <li>the eyeliner has a good quality i have used such eyeliners and a lot of other items of Mary Kay brand about 10 years and always pleased  and satisfied</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>Really Mary Kay production is of high quality and always have interesting design.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on you have some time to work with it.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this stuff no smudges and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This is the older version but works jsut as well.</li>
            <li>It goes on a nice deep black.</li>
            <li>Any unintentional smudging only happened right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and no issues.</li>
            <li>Could be old.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just old or what</li>
            <li>Too soft smears into raccoon  eyes.</li>
            <li>Once it sets (maybe 10 minutes or so) it stays put really well all day long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general this type of liner doesn&#x27;t last as long as a pencil that you sharpen</li>

            <li> My sister uses this product and says she really likes it, She has trouble finding it any where locally so she typically buys online.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Black Eyeliner in the New Black &amp; Pink Packaging:</li>
            <li> Add a little pressure and you can get it to look like a liquid liner or you can smudge it for a smokier effect.</li>
            <li> The black eye liner goes on pale.</li>
            <li> Its small &amp; fits in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> the expensive stuff!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know of another eyeliner that quite matches up to Mary Kay&#x27;s eyeliner. I will continue to order this for myself, and I love to order this as a gift for friends too.</li>
            <li> the eyeliner has a good quality i have used such eyeliners and a lot of other items of Mary Kay brand about 10 years and always pleased  and satisfied Really Mary Kay production is of high quality and always have interesting design.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day...I have sensitive eyes and no issues. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Five stars!!! I would recommend this eyeliner.  It goes on easy.  Stays on all day and does not smear.  Awesome Liner!</li>
            <li> This is the older version but works jsut as well.</li>
            <li> Its small &amp; fits in my makeup bag. However, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. It does look great on though.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  Great product?</li>
            <li> Mom loved her Mother&#x27;s Day gift! She swears by Mary Kay and I&#x27;m so glad I could make her happy!</li>
            <li> Not up to expectations. The black eye liner goes on pale. Could be old.</li>
            <li> THIS EYELINER IS VERY GOOD AS IT DOES NOT SMUDGE NOR RUN AFTER IT IS APPLIED....WILL BUY AGAIN WHEN NEEDED</li>
            <li> I had never used this eyeliner before but wanted to give it a try. I&#x27;m really happy with it. It is a roll up liner with a very smooth application. It goes on a nice deep black. Add a little pressure and you can get it to look like a liquid liner or you can smudge it for a smokier effect. When you first put it on you have some time to work with it. Once it sets (maybe 10 minutes or so) it stays put really well all day long. Any unintentional smudging only happened right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general this type of liner doesn&#x27;t last as long as a pencil that you sharpen but I think the trade off is worth it when it wears so nicely and doesn&#x27;t come off during the day. It&#x27;s also really reasonably priced. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great eye liner stays on for a long while and does not smudge.</li>
            <li> Love this liner does not smudge wears well easy to put on and remove im very picky with eyemakeup since i wear contacts but overall great buy luv marykay!</li>
            <li> My sister uses this product and says she really likes it, She has trouble finding it any where locally so she typically buys online.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this stuff no smudges and long lasting. I love mary kay it all anti aging too!I like it better then the expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> it was dried out and pulled my eyelids too much to even use and finally the pencil just broke.  I don&#x27;t know if it was just old or what but I thought it was supposed to be more like a Gel than a pencil.  Woudln&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> Thnx.  Great.  Would do business again.</li>
            <li> Too soft smears into raccoon  eyes.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Black Eyeliner in the New Black &amp; Pink Packaging: Accurate description and the eyeliner is awesome! great color and smudge-proof.</li>
