            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>

            <li>My hairstyle lasts all day and even if its raining it stays frizz free</li>
            <li>I got this free in an exchange for a product review</li>
            <li>, it does straighten my hair immediately and it feels silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>okay on the first day I could not get this on.  </li>
            <li>and it is super fast!</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>and shes perfectly straight!</li>
            <li>plus (+) sign to have temperature go higher or (-) to go lower.  </li>
            <li>but with some serum and this my hair is finally tamed :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and essential for my hair routine</li>
            <li>My partner loves it, she has such long gorgeous hair and as you&#x27;d expect maintaining it isn&#x27;t always the easiest of tasks.</li>
            <li>but it really worked</li>
            <li>I also used it to straighten my hair using the chase method and my hair has been straight for 4 weeks now..</li>
            <li>I have walked in the humidity and fog and rain without umbrellas or hats and my hair is STRAIGHT and silky</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>Because u have naturally really curly hair I used to have to spend a HUGE chunk of time w a flat iron.</li>
            <li>barely two passes to get the sections soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After the very first use, the rubber red tips began to fall out.</li>
            <li>so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but felt it was necessary this time.</li>
            <li>this really works for African American hair types and at first before I used it</li>
            <li>I thought it was only for straight hair types</li>
            <li>, I have naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Plus the oil I use makes it last the whole day.</li>
            <li>Things I&#x27;ve learned about it is have to hold down on side button for a few seconds for it to turn on and it will heat up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>when it did it was fine the first couple of times but after that the brushes started coming out causing a very uncomfortable hair pulling experience.</li>
            <li>Such a task is no longer the case thanks to this little beauty.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, it actually gives it volume!</li>
            <li> Her &#x27;chi&#x27; flat iron broke.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair either.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot to get a pony tail crease out, or the hair behind my ear always waves, and I don&#x27;t have to go over it a billion times to get it straight.</li>
            <li> It had absolutely no effect on my hair whatsoever, and I have no idea why anyone would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again, it was not worth the price I paid for it.  </li>

            <li> this really works for African American hair types and at first before I used it I thought it was only for straight hair types but it really worked so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> all directions were in a different language than English and it doesn&#x27;t work anyway</li>
            <li> The company worked out a problem smoothly with me. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife love this brush</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my hair look awesome in the morning and it is super fast! My hairstyle lasts all day and even if its raining it stays frizz free</li>
            <li> In one word...AMAZING!!!! It works great and quickly so I can get my hair done and be on my way to a fabulous hair day.I used to blow out and straighten my hair after not using heat for 16 months.I took relatively small sections and slowly moved the brush and blow dryer down. It only took one pass to get the hair dry and barely two passes to get the sections soft and smooth. I also used it to straighten my hair using the chase method and my hair has been straight for 4 weeks now.. I have walked in the humidity and fog and rain without umbrellas or hats and my hair is STRAIGHT and silky just like it was 4 weeks ago. I love this brush!!</li>
            <li> I have bought so many straighteners in my life, this one, by far, is the best! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, it actually gives it volume! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair either. Also, I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot to get a pony tail crease out, or the hair behind my ear always waves, and I don&#x27;t have to go over it a billion times to get it straight. My mom has the most frizzy, coarse-type hair and a once-over with this and shes perfectly straight! She LOVES it! She comes to my house just to use it, I&#x27;m buying her one of her own for her birthday. I wish I found this sooner, would have literally saved me hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product however it came defective. After the very first use, the rubber red tips began to fall out. A lot of this were stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> One of best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s so easy to use and essential for my hair routine</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. It does not irritate the scalp, rather they massage it. This is an excellent item, good choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.  Took a while to get it.  I find it very difficult to hold on the handle with out burning my hand.  After several used the pink nubs in the brush ends came out , there fore pulling my hair.  I would not buy this again, it was not worth the price I paid for it.  I was very disappointed..</li>
            <li> Things I&#x27;ve learned about it is have to hold down on side button for a few seconds for it to turn on and it will heat up pretty quickly.  Then can press plus (+) sign to have temperature go higher or (-) to go lower.  I have curly, thick, hard to straighten hair.  Have to brush through each section of hair 3-4 times in a row for it to straighten.</li>
            <li> My partner loves it, she has such long gorgeous hair and as you&#x27;d expect maintaining it isn&#x27;t always the easiest of tasks. Such a task is no longer the case thanks to this little beauty. I&#x27;m so glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li> I got this free in an exchange for a product review and i have to say i love the color but not the quality. This took to long to heat up and when it did it was fine the first couple of times but after that the brushes started coming out causing a very uncomfortable hair pulling experience. So use at your own risk and leave a review if your experiences were better then mine. Could use improvement with the brush to with stand more uses and a variety of colors would also be nice.</li>
            <li> okay on the first day I could not get this on.  The second day I tried it and it went on in 1/2 a second.  I have to say this is amazing, it does straighten my hair immediately and it feels silky and smooth.  I plan to buy another as a gift.  thank you very much</li>
            <li> If you want that silky straight hair look buy this lol I love it, I have naturally frizzy hair but with some serum and this my hair is finally tamed :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few ACEVIVI products. This hairbrush plugs in to heat up. It doesn&#x27;t take long, maybe about 2 minutes. I have sprayed my argan hair oil on the bristles and it works magic! Beautiful, shiny hair that is straightened, too. Plus the oil I use makes it last the whole day. No frizz during the humid or cold days. Love the color, too! Super stylish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful gift for my wife. Her &#x27;chi&#x27; flat iron broke. I bought her some Michel Mercier hairbrush, but she never uses it...got this in her favorite color and she loved it. It detangles and I guess it doubles as a flat iron? It heats up and she uses it after the shower. Her hair always looks flawless...well even without the brush...but she uses this a lot so it was great purchase :)</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but felt it was necessary this time. This item is completely and totally useless. It had absolutely no effect on my hair whatsoever, and I have no idea why anyone would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Goodbye to thr days of frizzy curls. This thing is a miracle worker. I have the worst hair for humidity. Because u have naturally really curly hair I used to have to spend a HUGE chunk of time w a flat iron. Not now.  Now I just use this thing. Its amazing how well it works at detangling and smoothing my curls. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Got it for my birthday and I absolutely love it. My hair looked awesome the very first time I used it.</li>
