            <li>Granted, she already knew she liked the fragrance from testing a bunch in the store</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t trying to attract my own gender.  </li>
            <li>Nice for a woman who is respectful of others and does not want an overpowering scent trailing her.</li>
            <li>Most of the items that I have ordered from Amazon I rated with five stars.  </li>
            <li>so I was too :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume.  </li>
            <li>and I believe I like this one a tad bit better.</li>
            <li>Could not have gotten a better product.</li>
            <li>This scent is so lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume -</li>
            <li>BUT be sure to test it out at a store like Macy&#x27;s to make sure the scent works with your body/skin.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance...</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>You have to spray a lot every time you use it to be able to smell something at all.</li>
            <li>For the price and brand name it should be a better perfume.</li>
            <li>and I loved the smell right away.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, soft and feminine fragrance.</li>

            <li>The presentation is pure and elegant.</li>

            <li>it doesn&#x27;t last long and its a bit  pricier but its an awesome fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a more mature, sensual scent.</li>
            <li>Armani Code does in fact inspire desire by the opposite sex (which was my goal), while D&amp;G Desire was nicely complimented by the ladies . . .</li>
            <li>I first came across this fragrance by way of an advertisement insert in a sale catalog</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; kind of fragrance, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The perfume is not authentic, It does however smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so strong that you can&#x27;t breathe when you put it on, yet it last all day.</li>

            <li>It has a very sensual aroma .</li>

            <li>That is just how much I like it.</li>
            <li>The real price of this item is $6.00, but not $60.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My husband really loves it.</li>
            <li>I rarely buy different perfume aside from my favorites.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of his new favorites.</li>
            <li>It was my first and last time buying fragrance by internet.</li>
            <li>Im in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, Completely recommend</li>
            <li>, I usually wear my tried-and-true brands and rarely add to my collection, but this Dolce and Gabbana perfume belongs in any woman&#x27;s fragrance arsenal!  </li>
            <li>This smell is sophisticated and just what I wanted without the cost that usually comes with this perfume when I go to JC Pennys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it with standard shipping and got it six days later.</li>
            <li>and it lasts much longer than the other comparable fragrance that I like</li>
            <li>First of all - it&#x27;s not original.</li>

            <li> very good my excellent product shipment and delivery thanks</li>
            <li> Disappointed because the scent is super faint and doesn&#x27;t last AT ALL!  Wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Most of the items that I have ordered from Amazon I rated with five stars.  This one I will give three stars.</li>
            <li> good price product, bought as a prezzie for family and they were happy with it so I was too :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume.  I first came across this fragrance by way of an advertisement insert in a sale catalog and I loved the smell right away.  I waited to buy it and glad I did because I found it at a great price on Amazon.  Mind you, I usually wear my tried-and-true brands and rarely add to my collection, but this Dolce and Gabbana perfume belongs in any woman&#x27;s fragrance arsenal!  I also have D&amp;G&#x27;s \\&quot;The One\\&quot; perfume and I believe I like this one a tad bit better. It is soft and sensual and a little bit goes a long way.  I am very pleased with this purchase and I am sure it will get noticed when I wear it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with the purchase.  Just what was wanted.  Packaged nicely and smelled wonderful.  Could not have gotten a better product.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I have always purchased it at Macy&#x27;s, when I first put it on in the morning and when I come home from work my boyfriend just loves it also and it still has the smell we love so much. But this time I saw it on amazon and bought it though them it  doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the scent very long at all😞 has anyone else found this to happen?</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Granted, she already knew she liked the fragrance from testing a bunch in the store but it is her new favorite. Plus I bought it on Amazon for 40% cheaper than I&#x27;ve found in any stores. Can&#x27;t be that.</li>
            <li> It has a very sensual aroma . It lasts for mr thru out the day.I would absoulty recomend this perfume.</li>
            <li> The perfume is not authentic, It does however smell good. Fragrance does not last all that long. I went out and bought an authentic bottle from a autorized retailer and was able to tell instantly.</li>
            <li> This scent is so lovely.  Light and sweet, yet musky, vanilla as well.  It lingers and is very nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume - I like that the scent is subtle and I can smell it on myself.  I even use it on my yorkie after her bath.</li>
            <li> Always love being told that I smell great and this product provides that.  Men and women alike have commented about this scent and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and I wear it almost daily.  However I make no recommendations as buying perfume is a very personal choice.  I do however suggest go to Macy&#x27;s find a scent you like then leave it there and buy cheaper here!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft and feminine fragrance. Very subtle. Nice for a woman who is respectful of others and does not want an overpowering scent trailing her.</li>
            <li> Way better price than in Macy&#x27;s!  Smells wonderful...get lots of compliments.  It&#x27;s very soft &amp; subtle.</li>
            <li> Im in my early 20&#x27;s and I wanted a more mature, sensual scent. This is it! BUT be sure to test it out at a store like Macy&#x27;s to make sure the scent works with your body/skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  I am going to purchase the show gel and remaining section of it,  That is just how much I like it.</li>
            <li> Best perfume EVER...get compliments EVERYWHERE when wearing it. They should NOT discontinue it. :(</li>
            <li> It was my first and last time buying fragrance by internet. First of all - it&#x27;s not original. The bottle and pack are awful. The cover of the bottle is clawed. And seems to be opened already. The scent is terrible. I do not recommend buying this perfume. The real price of this item is $6.00, but not $60. Even on sale.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last long and its a bit  pricier but its an awesome fragrance. i get a lot of complements. thanks</li>
            <li> My selection in perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance... It&#x27;s not so strong that you can&#x27;t breathe when you put it on, yet it last all day. My husband really loves it. It&#x27;s one of his new favorites. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> The presentation is pure and elegant. The scent is sensual and sharpens the senses. It lasts all day, Completely recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance as an addition and to spice things up when I don&#x27;t want to wear Armani Code - mistake.  Armani Code does in fact inspire desire by the opposite sex (which was my goal), while D&amp;G Desire was nicely complimented by the ladies . . . but I wasn&#x27;t trying to attract my own gender.  Personally, I like the scent too - but I&#x27;m not trying to attract myself either.  This one will be used for the strictly girls&#x27; nights out (sigh).  Kind of expensive for &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; kind of fragrance, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy different perfume aside from my favorites. This is a beautiful sensual scent and comes in the most beautiful bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. A little goes a long way (I learned this when I took a sample to a wedding and I realized that I needed to air it out) and it lasts much longer than the other comparable fragrance that I like (Fame by Gaga). This smell is sophisticated and just what I wanted without the cost that usually comes with this perfume when I go to JC Pennys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it with standard shipping and got it six days later. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy gal.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, thank you</li>
            <li> Amazing smell- warm with notes of vanilla- perfect for winter. Shipping took a little too long- around 2-3 weeks. I have had it for almost a year and it still smells the same!</li>
            <li> A very nice fragrance. I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day and she couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the scent! The one downside was that the package arrived the day after MD.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the perfume doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all. You have to spray a lot every time you use it to be able to smell something at all. For the price and brand name it should be a better perfume. The bottle is very uncomfortable to use as well.</li>
