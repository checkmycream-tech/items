            <li>Very good price, I want buy two more as gift.</li>
            <li>, I love it。The seller attitude is very good</li>
            <li>It works really good</li>
            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job.  </li>
            <li>and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li>HQ200 smiles good, Philips is good brand .</li>
            <li>razor is good looking</li>
            <li>good dealer.</li>
            <li>Been a good experience using this razor.  </li>
            <li>good ol&#x27; fashioned H2O.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s head doesn&#x27;t pivot as well as they advertise, which means you have to work it into trickier areas</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a good quality, rasonably priced electric razor.</li>
            <li>The trimmer that comes with the unit is a good idea and works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I just take along the trimmer attachment and I am good to</li>
            <li>that might not be good for this type of battery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend a good non-electric razor over this.</li>
            <li>It feel sooo good to shave.</li>
            <li>you are a buyer, China, recommended here for good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you need an electric razor because you can&#x27;t use a blade, don&#x27;t mind reading manuals, and don&#x27;t mind the space this thing takes up, this would be a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the trimmer was integral to the shaver and didn&#x27;t require you to pull off the shaving head to use.s thing takes up, this would be a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>Good quality shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shave and the self cleaning option</li>
            <li>Its surprisingly close on everything but the neck and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Started off good purchased it in November</li>
            <li>it is a good shaver</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t give as close of a shave, and some people prefer that (as a woman, I might say that some men are more physically attractive like that too, hehe).  </li>
            <li>This was ordered for my father - he is very satisfied with the way it works.  </li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the razor and the jet cleaning system and would recommend it to anyone who likes electric shavers.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with I how it works.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Really beautiful stuff, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The results were outstanding!</li>
            <li>When I used the shaver for the first time I was impressed.</li>
            <li>I Love this thing!  </li>
            <li>lots of thoughtful features and it works great.</li>
            <li>It is sleek and looks nice on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Even after 3-4 weeks of use he never felt it was effective.</li>
            <li>Panasonic EA-SA40, ES7037 and ES 7103---Panny makes really, really nice razors.</li>
            <li>Was a nice upgrade going to this one.</li>
            <li>Others may not mind this, but I didn&#x27;t find it cleaned the head any better than good ol&#x27; fashioned H2O.  </li>
            <li>liked the reviews this unit received and the cleaning station idea, so I purchased the 2D</li>
            <li>I feel like I now own a stand-alone shaving laboratory.  </li>
            <li>After that, I was on my own.  </li>
            <li>i already own this model and that is why i bought another as well as a replacement blade</li>
            <li>A nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>I keep a razor handy for any cleanup</li>
            <li>It is OK, but I not so good.</li>
            <li>your kindly help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how it kind of seems to have a mind of its own too...</li>
            <li>good one, so many stuff</li>
            <li>It is light in weight, fits in the palm of my hand very nicely</li>
            <li>The shaver is ultra lite and looks cool does everything you would expect from a good quality shaver at a great price cheers :-)</li>
            <li>but you dont need to jet clean it every day this razor has been across the country and all over and still works great</li>
            <li>The jet clean system was great, might be a bit pricey, but great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am throughly impressed with my new Shaver.</li>
            <li>Ifyou are looking for a new rotary shaver that will accomplish whatever you need, this shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Why: extremely good reviews, reasonable price, three rotating blades, and attractive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>is my preferred (and most cost effective) cleaning method.   </li>
            <li>oh wow it looks amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 20 years, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I have purchsed do far 3 shaving machines which were excellent.  </li>
            <li>Super nice electric razor!  </li>
            <li>Gives a great shave, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>Its so easy and quick to use and does a great job of getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>and it is very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Very light.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any skin irritation marks.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave -no</li>
            <li>And the price is very cheap ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li>My husband says it gives him a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>size is very appropriate, fabrics is comfortable, appear more slender legs.</li>
            <li>which is a great positive since I plan on keeping this for atleast 2yrs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it save my time and clear up very good,</li>
            <li>Even though the shaver itself performs flawlessly, this will be my last Norelco product after more than 40 years of using their shavers.</li>
            <li>Replaced my Norelco Nivea for Men shaver with the SensoTouch 2D and have been pleasantly pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>the most I would give any electric razor is a 4</li>
            <li>can say that this is obviously a quality product designed for those who want to style their beard to the perfect length.  </li>
            <li>shaver itself is sleek and elegant in appearance.</li>
            <li>The best part was the charging station, the self-cleaning, and how lasting its power seemed to be.</li>
            <li>I have done this for MANY years.</li>
            <li>Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade, Mach 3 , Proglide, Hydro5</li>
            <li>We can make electricty, but we can&#x27;t make more water. :-).</li>
            <li>, okay....</li>
            <li>Afta Pre-Electric (better than Lectric Shave or Face-Saver for me),</li>
            <li>SO CLOSE and SO COMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li>I love this shaver and it has moved up to #1 in my shaving armamentarium.</li>
            <li>be prepared to get even more creative.  </li>
            <li>took the \\&quot;21 day challenge\\&quot; and extended it to 60 days, just to make sure.  </li>
            <li>I just got it in the mail a couple of days ago and love the shave of it.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for the ultimate in pens, cameras and electronic devices and this electric razor is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to find one that gave a close shave.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to report that the Phillips Norelco 1160cc/42 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is an exception to this rule.</li>
            <li>satisfied with this shopping exp, although gotta use it for a while to tell whether it will hold.</li>
            <li>Others may not mind this, but I didn&#x27;t find it cleaned the head any better than</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an OK shaver.  </li>
            <li>Most owners of the 3D model would complain of shavings falling out, all over the counter and their shirt.</li>
            <li>But, seriously, enjoy the one you chose!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>His favorite feature is that it is self cleaning</li>
            <li>She said both were sides were good, but she clearly identified the Atra side as superior.  </li>
            <li>There are even better blades on the market today.  </li>
            <li>I believe from the one use that I will like it OK??</li>
            <li>Overall he is happy with it!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This blew my mind when I used it, gentle shaving and does a great job.</li>
            <li>*sleek and adjusts to many contours of face  Cons of this shaver:  </li>
            <li>These newer units don&#x27;t have that adjustment any more</li>
            <li>This is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Ok, but I wish to have a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor.  </li>
            <li>The jet clean system is nice and hassle free, but if the increased price (vs. the razor sold alone without the cleaning station) is a factor in the decision making process the razor would probably be just as good without it, the blades are very easy to manually clean.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received this saver.</li>
            <li>I am sure they shall replace the defective unit in their own sweet time; but, for now, I am receiving a run around.</li>
            <li>One can get a pretty good shave out of most items out there.   </li>
            <li>, I guess it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Shaved very clean, everywhere.</li>
            <li>shaven Very clean</li>
            <li>It looks really cool and provides a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Because some reviews agree the razor gives a very good shave, but have marked it down because of the \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;, in fairness to what most consider an excellent razor it needs to be said that the maintenance referred to is not mandatory.  </li>
            <li>wish you all a happy New Year</li>
            <li>With the amount/type of surface area I have to cover, the rotary seems to be a better fit for my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>works great so far, my husband loves it</li>
            <li>The shaver is comfortable and, by varying the angle of the shaver, I have been able to get all of my neck shaved as well as my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>The product/shipping was fantastic, although would be better if an AU plug was provided.</li>
            <li>but I feel the cheap Norelco that I have, shaves me better</li>
            <li>Truly, there are so many shaving kits available today.</li>
            <li>most important one,</li>
            <li>However, with a wet shave it is excellent!</li>
            <li>good, deliver fast</li>
            <li>Good, fast, good quality, easy to use, design is also in place, then the price is very cheap，i like it</li>
            <li>i gave it as a present and he loved it!</li>
            <li>COOL!   </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so cool!</li>
            <li>Other than that it seems to be working great!</li>
            <li>Norelco replaced it under warranty very quickly.</li>
            <li>1160XCC is easy to set up, and just requires an hour to charge.</li>
            <li>I switched to electric razors when retiring to the Dominican Republic because though razors are easy to find the blades are not.  </li>
            <li>and it opens easy to get rid of hair and charge</li>
            <li>The unit is extremely easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>The top part of the heads pops off and you can clean out the hair reservoir manually.  </li>
            <li>This gives me a close shave and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Everything is OK with this product and it can be a great present.</li>
            <li>It came packaged well and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>this shaver is average or subpar at best.</li>
            <li>Did not shave my husbands beard as good as a normal blade razor.</li>
            <li>When travelling, it always worked fine on the battery charge for about 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razon is fine.</li>
            <li>My previous Philips had an excellent cleaning system.</li>
            <li>and I can maneuver it smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>the fine print, Philips does state that it might take upwards to a week of continual shaving for your face to get used to the unit, and that was my experience.  </li>
            <li>This thing does its job fine as well as charges the razor.</li>
            <li>It is more than I expected and gives a great shave</li>
            <li>But when I need a smooth face for evening activities or even have some time to focus on my shave, then I&#x27;ll be using my Gillette razor instead.</li>
            <li>Most importantly is that it&#x27;s much smoother and more comfortable than the cheaper razors.  </li>
            <li>With this there are no cuts, no bruises, it is smooth and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>so, HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART--</li>
            <li>prefer to clean a razor head with a brush, and this is easy to do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is comfortable holding in the hand.</li>
            <li>plus another 6months for free</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Skin Glide\\&quot;,cleaning and lubricating, helps keep the razor moving smoothly across your skin.  </li>
            <li>As smooth as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Also included with the shaver is a cleaning system which keeps the shaver fit for use.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>I hoped it would give me a smooth shave</li>
            <li>I got this for my son for a Christmas present, and he seems to be really happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a comfortable reliable shave, follow the directions in the box, preferred circular pattern, and enjoy.</li>
            <li>weeks)&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to clean manually</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better success with this razor.  </li>
            <li>My skin was happy with the foil, but after a month, my skin still has not forgiven me for the sudden change in razors.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the self-cleaning.  </li>
            <li>head easily comes apart for cleaning, should one desire to clean it another way.</li>
            <li>The shave is close and leaves face smooth.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>I can get a close shave without having to push the stubble up with my free hand</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave with no chaffing.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The jet clean system is easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning solution and Jet Clean System works well to rid the shaver of hair by shaking it very quickly.</li>
            <li>It gives a fantastic close shave.</li>
            <li>I was replacing an old Norelco and this was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The old one is still in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li>I think it shaves closer, is easy to clean with brush or the Jet Clean System, and since I travel a lot, I appreciate the locking feature which prevents accidental turn on.  </li>
            <li>They used to give a really clean, smooth shave, without the need for cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for a new electric razor... I do recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li>Top Quality, like it very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and the jet clean system is cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty sexy to look at, if that matters.</li>
            <li>SensoTouch 2d works pretty well on the top of my head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric razors in the past and not had the best experience with them.  </li>
            <li>But it all works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system takes up significant counter space.  </li>
            <li>Its cleaning system means that you&#x27;ll need some counter space to store it conveniently and accessibly, but the system itself is so streamlined and easy that it&#x27;s entirely worth</li>
            <li>I have discovered the Jet Clean is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>The shaver charges either when placed in the Jet Clean system or in a separate charging cradle.  </li>
            <li>That alone makes this a contender for a shaver to have, if you are clean shaven.</li>
            <li>Once a week I&#x27;ll put it in the Jet Clean System.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is a bit of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>Have not tried the jet clean system yet.</li>
            <li>The included trimmer is easy to attach and is useful for trimming side burns.</li>
            <li>Just get the equivalent Remington without a cleaner gimmick, and soak the head in antiseptic during the day to clean it.</li>
            <li>The jet clean system I haven&#x27;t used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just another thing to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t use most of them except for the smaller charger that is included.  </li>
            <li>The three blade assembly detaches, so I can clean the unit after every use.</li>
            <li>can and will recommend the Phillips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System to anyone looking for a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably my skin type that is more sensitive to the rotary blades than most</li>
            <li>Bought Philips Norelco razor because of Jet Clean</li>
            <li>you have a equipment to clean your razor</li>
            <li>I bought the Norelco 1160X/42 Senso Touch 2D with the Jet Clean for a friend at Christmas.</li>
            <li>Bought this razor with the Jet Clean  tank.</li>
            <li>I clean my razor in a soapy bath in the sink.  </li>
            <li>I must have discarded it upon opening because I intended on always using the cleaning unit to clean and charge.</li>
            <li>don´t get it because the name of the product is Philips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System</li>
            <li>This is a review for the Philips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System.     </li>
            <li>I use the Jet Clean System every day and the shaver is just like the day I got it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Phillips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Razor with Jet clean system for my husband as a gift.  </li>
            <li>I can see that the Jet Clean solution might be a hassle to order.</li>

            <li>Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean</li>
            <li>Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a (1) week search I settled on the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x Electric Shaver w/ Jet Clean System (Norelco SensoTouch 1160x).  </li>
            <li>Jet Clean System is an all-in-one unit in that it both cleans the shaver and charges it.  </li>
            <li>, you can place the shaver into the Jet Clean System just to charge it.  </li>
            <li>, you can place the shaver into the Jet Clean System just to charge it.  </li>
            <li>He is in the process of learning how to use and clean the razor.</li>
            <li>The Jet Cleaner is really nice too, razor always smells fresh and is ready to go when I want to use it.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s easy to use ,i hope it&#x27;s good for a long time</li>
            <li>My 4401LC is a 20 yr old corded model that still does a very nice job/close shave, with HQ4 heads, but I have to be gentle</li>
            <li>The Jet Clean System is really cool.</li>
            <li>but this 1160X shaves just as close as the older units and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The cleaning fluid for the Jet Clean System can be pricey, but there are some good deals on it with online retailers.</li>
            <li>*Works great with wet shave/shave gel  *</li>
            <li>This time I found out the true colors of Norelco&#x27;s so called customer service.</li>
            <li>I use hot water from the tap to clean and it is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Allways wanted this cleaning system for my razor (mod 1150)but found out for $17 more I could get it with a newer model (1160) than the one I have.</li>
            <li>shaver hugs the face very well and love the flex head technology.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it, I used it for several days and just did not give me a good shave.  </li>
            <li>So Many accessories, and the price is very favorable~&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>This razor is one of the best we have purchased lately.</li>
            <li>This is the latest thst I bought, it is really amaxing.</li>
            <li>its super cool no tug or sensitivity with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally, one could easily find a better wall wart, but Norelco has seen to it that this won&#x27;t be easy by using a non standard plug on the adaptor.</li>
            <li>The Jen Clean system is nice and usefull to clean the razor every now and then, but removing the blades and rinsing the razor off with water is very simple with this razor.  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt that this shaver, the 1160XCC, gives me a quicker and much more comfortable shave than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>you move it quickly over the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, not only do my fingers when rubbing my face after a shave tell me I am getting a better shave, I also find more whisker residue in the chamber than previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave was smooth, with minimal passes, and results were as good as I would get from a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, pivoting tri-blade head has given me a close, clean-feeling shave, and has been able to reach the hard-to-reach places, particularly on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges quickly which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>My last razor was by Braun and it was a lot more powerful and offered a better shave.</li>
            <li>It is good for a quick clean up on a Saturday morning if you don&#x27;t want a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The self cleaning station is amazing as I can hit a button and it will be clean for my next use.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I get my new 1150.</li>
            <li>, I called Philips, and they agreed to send me a new cleaning/charging station &amp; more cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for years, this new style is much better than anything I had used before.</li>
            <li>Attachments: The rotary head pops off easily and you can snap on the straight edge razor for shaping beards and sideburns.</li>
            <li>The cleaning device is a huge plus and it really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>and I still enjoy using it as much as I did when I received it.</li>
            <li>The shaver is OK but a bit loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular razor kind of guy, and I do prefer that to this Philips Norelco electric one.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco works better....</li>
            <li>It is able to clear all hairs on my face, and about 80% of the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li>the money shave a lot better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>the two head(I do not know how to express it ...) is really useful.</li>
            <li>When I am in blade shave mode the Schick Hydro5 is my tool of choice, best blade hands down for me, however this new Norelco 1150x/40 is going to have me using it more than I ever thought possible.   </li>
            <li>love the quick charge feature and that it only takes 50mins for a full charge.</li>
            <li>The 1160XCC comes with the solution you need, and all you need to do is pour it into the special receptacle, and the shaver is clean, gleaming, and good as new, and ready for the next challenge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice razor, it was missing two parts out of the box, I contacted Philips and they are sending them to me.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a fine shaver for when I am in a rush in the mornings and need a quick shave to simply look good at the office.  </li>
            <li>It comes complete with cleaning solution and extremely easy instructions for quick setup.</li>
            <li>I may do it when by its performance I know that it needs more of a cleaning than I can give it with the after-use brushing, or I may do what I have always done with electric razors, and what the manual for this razor calls the \\&quot;extra thorough cleaning method\\&quot;, namely, lift the restraining frame, remove the cutters one by one and clean them and their combs with the brush, reassemble.</li>
            <li>i was on a 3 week trip and it lasted me right up to the end useing it every other day it is a good razor</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a Braun 2000 flat razor for years and it does a very good job, and the flat blade allows me to trim around my beard/goatee when I have one.</li>
            <li>One of my first electric razors over 20 years ago was a rotary razor, and it does not seem that the technology has really advanced that much.</li>
            <li>Well, my first and only foil razor died after an amazing 18 years of faithful use.</li>
            <li>It beats what I used to get with 3 and 4 blade replacement heads like the Mach series, and being able to use it wet or dry is great.</li>
            <li>Does very well if you clean the unit every day.</li>
            <li>But it really does clean the razor thoroughly</li>
            <li>The razor is not bad, but it is certainly overpriced for the results it gives.  </li>
            <li>of irritation is huge, since that&#x27;s why I stopped using my cheapo electric in high</li>
            <li>I called Philips again, and they were very apologetic and said a new wall wart and more solution would be on their way.</li>
            <li>It clogs up pretty quickly but is easy enough to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver, no more razor cuts on my face.</li>
            <li>My old cheap shaver works far better.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to claim that the shaver shaves as well as a blade but without scraping my skin as blades do, thus my skin is not rough.</li>
            <li>I challenged him to try it, since it does seem kind of strange.</li>
            <li>No matter how soft or how hard you push, I did not get burn, the \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; in the floating heads adjusted for a great shave over all surfaces!</li>
            <li>I typically use a Schick razor blade that can be bought in a pack of 8, but I will try to be fair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get shave as close as my old Mach 3 of course, but is very quick and convenient and shaves as close as you can expect an electric razor to shave.  </li>
            <li>Happy that I finally had a working system, I left the bathroom with the unit in the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>My husband has only had the Norelco 1160CXX SensoTouch 2d Shaver for a few weeks, but he said it&#x27;s the best electric shaver that he has owned.  </li>
            <li>*dry shave is average at best  </li>
            <li>I still have my old Norelco arcitec 1060X which still works fine</li>
            <li>So, when the charge light finally comes on, I use the Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li>It took very little effort gave a nice close smooth shave</li>
            <li>Keeping the Jet Clean fluid use down to a minimum is cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who skipped to the very last line, here it is: I plan on using the Phillips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver for many happy years to come.</li>
            <li>I stated earlier, I am sure that eventually I shall receive another replacement but, in the meantime, I am cleaning the shaver heads under running water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pulled the top of the razor off several times already because of the change in design.  </li>
            <li>Some places are just to difficult to get to, but this razor does the best job of any electric razors I have owned.</li>
            <li>Middle of the road in price that work like top of the line shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I have been using it for about a month now.  </li>
            <li>First impression was,</li>
            <li>I found this razor to be pretty close with no irritation or bumps.  </li>
            <li>and/or if there was any concern about product quality or customer service at Philips, I would have rated it higher.</li>
            <li>Overall, an OK shaver.  </li>
            <li>and I was utterly amazed at the smooth shave it gave me!</li>
            <li>well if you need to use it for more than 10 minutes (if you need it for any of those uses, you definitely will be)&lt;br</li>
            <li>like they did my Wahl trimmer, most folks will be out of luck &amp; have to send the razor back for batteries!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned three electric razors over the years, one Remington from many years ago, one mid-level Braun from about 15 years ago, and my current one, a low-end wet/dry Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one I have ever Bern able to use that didn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, get the model above this one (with the docking station) since it is supposed to have a blade design that gets a better shave with fewer strokes.</li>
            <li>the $60 norelco razor I was using before this one did a better job in the same area but not as close shave as this one.  </li>
            <li>This the first electric razor I&#x27;ve had in over 50 years.  </li>
            <li>It is hot tip</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for my husband, he says it offers the best shave overall from other razors he has tried.</li>
            <li>You can buy them at Amazon for $6.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, like pretty much everybody else, they&#x27;re using a design with Li batteries, that aren&#x27;t normally user accessible, with a URL in the owner&#x27;s manual for directions to remove them at the end of the razor&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li>The Jet Clean system is certainly convenient as I can just drop the razor in for a clean following every use and it takes care of the rest.  </li>
            <li>It is very very to shave, and shaved very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing pretty much eliminates all the razor burn</li>
            <li>The new Norelco Senso Touch 2D and the Jet Cleaner are well worth</li>
            <li>works better with shaving cream, dry shaving smells like burning hair.</li>
            <li>But besides such minor nuisance, this is a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is actually a fairly good razor, though I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to speak to reliability, or longevity.</li>
            <li>It took me about two weeks before I figured out how to get close shave on certain areas like the neck below my ears, under my nose and adams apple.</li>
            <li>the three circular heads had problems with cleaning certain parts of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is nice because with older electric shavers the blades always seem to lose their sharp edge.  </li>
            <li>On balance I am very satisfied with the stylish unit, so much so that I have given serious thought to purchasing another shaver as a hot standby when the current shaver decides to stop working!  </li>
            <li>On balance I am very satisfied with the stylish unit, so much so that I have given serious thought to purchasing another shaver as a hot standby when the current shaver decides to stop working!  </li>
            <li>My beard is tough and one thing that always bothered me was the pulling I experienced when going against the grain, so to speak.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a quick test when I got home and the results were better than my old Braun, but I&#x27;ll update this later after a few more tests and charge.</li>
            <li>However, I find it hard to get an even shave and get good lines on my sideburns.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a huge upgrade from the basic norelco razor.  </li>
            <li>Using shaving cream with this Norelco model, he had better success, but only if he spent more time shaving with it than he ever would need to spend with a regular \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li>My face definitely does not feel smooth</li>
            <li>This razor cuts really well, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say that there was much difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s cleaning system was an added benefit, and one I really appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the shower or shaving.</li>
            <li>Is this really an upgrade?</li>
            <li>heck this may not be much of a difference of a shave.</li>
            <li>Using the circular pattern (with and against the grain) with this or any Norelco shaver really gives on a close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ivan</li>
            <li>I do find that I have to use it every couple of days as opposed to once a week with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>This is something I can do in about two minutes while standing in the shower with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>It so much easier to shave with</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Jet Cleaning system\\&quot; helps keep the shaver ready for use.  </li>
            <li>(though i don&#x27;t really know what it</li>
            <li>However, the product is very well designed, maintained and postage was not a hassle.</li>
            <li>Very flexible in getting close to your nose and neck.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it and uses it quite often, but still occasionally wants that &#x27;close&#x27; shave and breaks out the Mach3 disposables.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it and uses it quite often, but still occasionally wants that &#x27;close&#x27; shave and breaks out the Mach3 disposables.  </li>
            <li>I could never get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really had to test out the razor&#x27;s ability to hold a charge, but I&#x27;ve had no problems using it for 10 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>That way my skin stays free from red, irritation marks.</li>
            <li>whole Body wash</li>
            <li>,that&#x27;s very Convenient</li>
            <li>The cutters must not be very close to the edge of shields.  </li>
            <li>really like this stuff,</li>
            <li>Philips/Norelco has every gizmo imaginable: a very fancy swivel head, a separate trimmer attachment, a stand-alone self-cleaning system,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and simple operate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li>Really like the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>So it handles well on curves thanks to the flexible head.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does an excellent job of cutting.    </li>
            <li>The straight edge works quite well.  </li>
            <li>Also very slimlined.</li>
            <li>paying that much for a razor i expect a trimmer that does&#x27;nt look and feel like a 50 cent add on.</li>
            <li>I probably could have saved money and got a lower price razor and not noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>the growth of your hair so that it will become effective at some mysterious later time.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week and liked it enough to return it and order this current model under review.</li>
            <li>Cleaning solution is pretty cheap and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>so I shave every few days and let the stubble come out nice...</li>
            <li>I have shaved with a razor for over 50 years and finally found an electric shaver that gives me a clean and smooth shave equal to a blade shave.</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave and is quiet compared to other shavers.  </li>
            <li>(SensoTouch 2D Electric Shaver with Jen Clean System) does go above and beyond whatever electric shaving experiences you&#x27;ve had before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If there is another similar razor without the jet clean system I would probably buy that.</li>
            <li>I only have to recharge and clean the heads twice a month.</li>
            <li>You have to open the heads carefully to clean</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often since I clean shave and use tweezers or a regular razor to shape the sideburns.     </li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle takes a long time and it seems to go through the cleaning liquid pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using the shaver for two weeks now and each successive shave has been better than the previous one.</li>
            <li>This one has been better than all previous.  </li>
            <li>An 8 pack of Schick blades comes at about $10 a pack (maximum) and each blade can last for multiple (in my experience, many) times.  </li>
            <li>Really love it, especially since I moved from a low end Philips shaver .</li>
            <li>Also found out it won&#x27;t work with my older razor.</li>
            <li>Shaves about as well as my 8 year old norelco, but is much quieter and the battery lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li>until I can get a decent quality wall wart and adapt it to this system, before I can use my razor!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The older Norelco&#x27;s had a 9 adjustment blade depth.</li>
            <li>Little tricky at the neck but feels very smooth to use .</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin and this razor does not irritate his skin!</li>
            <li>The jet clean system is efficient and makes the blades clean and slick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality of Shave:  I only noticed a mild, if any, improvement over my normal razor blade.</li>
            <li>$100+ for a razor should yield a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I still won&#x27;t change the rating though because the cost is too high and part of it is for the cleaning unit that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a high quality electric razor</li>
            <li>He would highly recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by our daughter whose husband has one and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>Anyways, my point is this...don&#x27;t buy an electric shaver if you want a perfectly smooth 100% stubble-free shave because you aren&#x27;t going to get it with this razor or any other electric one no matter how much you pay for</li>
            <li>Because the Jet Clean System charges the shaver everytime you use it, I don&#x27;t know how long the shaver can go between charges.</li>
            <li>After using it nearly every day for nearly three months it&#x27;s still going strong and remains my choice for my daily morning shave.  </li>
            <li>its like bolting a brass horn on a fine stringed instrument, usable but not very functionable.</li>
            <li>Item seems to work fine just not as close of a shave as we expected.</li>
            <li>and I can shave everything in a little more than a minute.</li>
            <li>Product motor won&#x27;t allow it to move far enough to self clean.</li>
            <li>The three floating heads are configured to adjust at exactly the right distances and contours to provide total coverage with a few easy passes.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is wonderful, but the cleaning system is badly designed.  </li>
            <li>Used it and it worked great, his face was so smooth, a day later he got crazy razor bumps...</li>
            <li>I have a fairly sensitive face and this razor does not irritate my face much at all, even shaving dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this as a wet shaver with foam shaving cream and it is extremely comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>He says that with a normal \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor he can just shave and go, but with this razor it seemed to not work at all... or to work on a promise of \\&quot;training\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I prefer a wet/dry razor because just being able to rinse it out everyday</li>
            <li>Took me a few minutes to figure out how to lift off the top of the chamber</li>
            <li>The cleaning system takes a long time to run though (about 2 hours for a full cycle, including drying).  </li>
            <li>According to the normal size to buy can, don&#x27;t need to change anythingworthy。I</li>
            <li>After a few months, it will dip the razor into the solution, but then bring it up again flashing the icon that it needs more solution.  </li>
            <li>He was able to use the razor without the missing parts, it was the protective cap and cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself offers a smooth, flat, rounded head that moves seamlessly over even or uneven surfaces (whether a guy&#x27;s jawline or a woman&#x27;s knee), and the battery lasts for over a dozen shaves or more before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than anything I&#x27;ve had from any previous electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Not the highest model but right in the middle of the Norelco line up in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so I could \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; out the contents with the provided brush, but it only takes a minute or two to clean the chamber and have the razor ready for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quickly and should be cheaper in the long haul than the blades I was using.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ll do to make this razor work, is to find an appropriate power supply with the correct voltage and at least the same current capacity, or greater.</li>
            <li>Extremely close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Back when I graduated from high school I recieved my first Norelco razor in 1984.</li>
            <li>Well, wait, now the 1150x has this new neck pivot device.</li>
            <li>We live in Australia, so when purchasing this item it was thought that an adapter for an AU plug would be included.</li>
            <li>brand new, just as advertised.</li>
            <li>But it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>So, I called Philips again and was told not to worry, as a new wall wart would be included with the replacement cleaning/charging</li>
            <li>receipt of the new wall wart, I set up the cleaning/charging station &amp; connected the new power adaptor.</li>
            <li>so, I unplugged the new wall wart and got out my Fluke again.</li>
            <li>The new adaptor was dead!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is New</li>
            <li>they said they will send me a new one</li>
            <li>My job always has me on my toes, requiring me to leave where I live at a moments notice.</li>
            <li>and I can easily shave with less passes of the razor.  </li>
            <li>more time, 2) use it wet with shaving cream, 3) and go through extensive cleaning up.</li>
            <li>&#x27;pull&#x27; hairs uncomfortably during shaving and has a nice slightly vibrating feeling that is kind of relaxing on the face</li>
            <li>For people with light facial hair, I expect the battery to last about 18 shaves without recharging.      </li>
            <li>Only use the Jet Clean once every two or three weeks since manually cleaning it does a decent enough job.    </li>
            <li>It is a very gentle shave, and did not leave my face and neck red like the Braun often does.</li>
            <li>My new razor glides freely over my face, leaving clean tracks behind it, although removing the blades from its holder for cleaning is somewhat cumbersome.</li>
            <li>My first experience with this Philips rotary razor was very different.    </li>
            <li>The next shave, I decided to use hot water, and shaving gel.</li>
            <li>First it holds a charge longer than any of my smaller shavers that I had used for my goatee.  </li>
            <li>This was my first Phillips and my last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I have found that washing my face with hot water before I shave improves the experience immensely, as does shaving in the shower—</li>
            <li>My first shave left me profoundly disappointed, but I was determined to stick with it, so I went the full week, shaving my head and face every day and by day four the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x was shaving much closer until by day seven the shaver was now as good as my now deceased Advantage</li>
            <li>My beard is not unusually dense, but I do have a full beard</li>
            <li>In the future, when going out with the wife on a special occasion, I&#x27;ll definitely use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The cleaning/charging station is a total profit generating gimmick and a total waste of time, as this razor is nicely designed and extremely easy to clean under a running faucet in only a matter of seconds, so purchase the razor without it, and you might get lucky and get a power adaptor that doesn&#x27;t fail.</li>
            <li>If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving.</li>
            <li>i love how i can wet or dry shave with this</li>
            <li>As for a smooth dry shave, this unit seems to be about the same.</li>
            <li>(Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of our course</li>
            <li>RIght side of face, dry shave eh</li>
            <li>you place the shaver into the cradle upside down, plug the Jet Clean System unit in and turn it on.  </li>
            <li>you place the shaver into the cradle upside down, plug the Jet Clean System unit in and turn it on.  </li>
            <li>For the money I would like to have seen a hard shell case to better protect the shaver when traveling.</li>
            <li>Independent outside observation by a female face tester resulted in her not really being able to tell much difference between the sides.)    </li>
            <li>I like it&#x27;s clear machine</li>
            <li>use to get razor burns every time I use a electric razor, and the only way was to whip out the old Gillette Fusion, and shaving became a very time consuming tasks in the morning.</li>
            <li>The station has to be plugged in, so for the wire not to appear unseemly, the station has to remain near a power outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a Norelco razor for nearly 20 years, having switched to a disposable blade.  </li>
            <li>They work well for my daily routine and work fast.</li>
            <li>It makes the heads last much longer.   </li>
            <li>wow factor there.</li>
            <li>After using this shaver, I then took a blade and went over the same spots to see if I could get any closer.....not really.</li>
            <li>The old one fits but isn&#x27;t compatible with the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>a young guy</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a 3d model, but really needed the self cleaning option and went with the 2d model saving over $100 at my local store.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I used it for all my grooming needs, including sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I would suggest they give the Philps Norelco a try they will be surprised.</li>
            <li>He would rather use his old electric razor.</li>
            <li>I note that the Atra is a 30 year old shaving technology.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to shave with it, and not as close as my 20 year old Remington Triple Foil Shaver.</li>
            <li>70 Years Old</li>
            <li>There is no rotary electric shaver that cleans my neck completely.</li>
            <li>You cannot connect the power plug directly to the Shaver and use it while it is charging.</li>
            <li>Preferred the old popup method.</li>
            <li>15 year old son is now using this for his righteous &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Works very well and charges at the same time.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried a number of razors—any number of traditional ones-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  </li>
            <li>naturally curly hair).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once the drying cycle is complete, the razor will charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once the drying cycle is complete, the razor will charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Boyfriend reported it didn&#x27;t really cut all the hair off his face, not such a close shave.</li>
            <li>My father finds this is really soft and</li>
            <li>The shaver is quiet but powerful, yet so streamlined it&#x27;s hardly bigger than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Not impressed at all, which is surprising because my father and I always bought Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li>But, I figured out as long as I make sure to wash my face with soap after each use, I can dry shave daily with no problems.</li>
            <li>A full charge can last me a week if I shaver every other day for about 10 minutes which is my normal</li>
            <li>A full charge can last me a week if I shaver every other day for about 10 minutes which is my normal</li>
            <li>Never really worked right..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally at the spot where I wanted to either get new replacement foil (another $25+) or try a new system.</li>
            <li>The Jet Clean System is bulky and a waste.</li>
            <li>I have had several Philips three head razors in the past and they all worked better for me than the foil.</li>
            <li>The charging time was quick less than an hour to charge.</li>
            <li>The handle is organically shaped and easy to grasp, and every aspect of the product seems to have been prethought with a little extra care for convenience and ease of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charging light came on, and when I hit the cleaner&#x27;s power button, it began to move the razor into position for cleaning, but it only moved about half way before it froze.</li>
            <li>This new Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch is a nice upgrade except for one advantage the Spectra had, which was the ability to switch between Sensitive or Normal level cutting.    </li>
            <li>I found the shave to be quite close compared to razors of the past, and the handle even pivots to fit the outline of your face.  </li>
            <li>The base is fantastic, I love it!</li>
            <li>or if you get the head wet first.</li>
            <li>:( He had to stop using it but wants to wait and maybe try again as he liked the feel of his skin after his first shave.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver when Gillette came out with yet another more complicated, more expensive and less effective \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; manual razor.</li>
            <li>I figured it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be more expensive to go to an electric shaver as opposed to spending $30/month on replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>The new model works just the same (works well).  </li>
            <li>I still have to use another electric razor to really get a close shave, so definitely don&#x27;t plan on making this your only razor if you like a close shave</li>
            <li>I usually prefer Norelco shavers because I have had good luck with them in the past.</li>
            <li>holy moley, this 1150 contours my scalp/and head like no other razor or blade</li>
            <li>and as always, the Norelco gets my attention first due to its design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that being said, this is a pretty snappy looking electric razor, but performs just like any other forty dollar electric razor as well as your two hundred plus dollar electric razors.  </li>
            <li>, then I told myself, Ill get myself one for sure!</li>
            <li>If the contours of your face have not lent themselves to the contours of electric shavers in the past, or, your neck hair grows in a circular pattern that defeats any electric shaver you have used before, then I recommend giving this shaver a try as I am in a similar situation and the shaver has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>There is a pressure sensitive switch that tells the unit there is sufficient fluid.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this extra mechanism provides a better, cleaner razor, or just gives more parts to break or go wrong, but it looks neat.    </li>
            <li>It takes at least ten minutes and several inspections to make sure I got all of the areas on my neck.  </li>
            <li>My old one I would have to shave with a regular razor after the weekend when I dont shave.</li>
            <li>That is the same as my old foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t what he expected and I even let him pick out.  </li>
            <li>The warranty clearly states they will replace defective units for two years, but today they told me that this is the last time they will replace it, although it&#x27;s only 11 months old.  </li>
            <li>When the fourth replacement tank was also defective, I called Philips again and offered to pay the difference to upgrade to the next higher model, which I was told uses a different tank, if they would credit me the cost of my current model.  </li>
            <li>I would not use it before going into the office as the shave is not close or complete enough.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco finally gave up do I purchased this model to replace.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll then, while observing proper polarity, connect the proper plug from the norelco wall wart to the replacement wall wart, using solder for reliability and shrink tubing to prevent shorting, and beat Norelco at their own game.</li>
            <li>Norelco sent me a new one, which lasted about as long.  </li>
            <li>The shave is much better than any of the other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li>The shaver is slowly lowered into the cleaning reservoir (it attaches to the bottom of the unit) and turns the shaver on, spinning the blades in cycles until they are clean.  </li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what was wrong and thought it might be something I had done (user error) until I read other reviews that described exactly my problem.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll see what I mean when you tell it to clean.</li>
            <li>You can also use shaving gel with the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it twice)  and Its hard to gauge how effective the shaver was being in clipping my hair closely.  </li>
            <li>The resulting shave on flat skin was about the same, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how long the shaver lasts before I have to recharge it.</li>
            <li>I did expect there to be more advancements from my old one to the new, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any outside of the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, the only small complaint that I have is that it takes some effort to make the razor shave really short hairs.</li>
            <li>So overall, for clean shaving, I would not have a problem recommending this since the results are similar to what I was used to with the Braun, but it&#x27;s quieter and gentler on skin - at least to me.</li>
            <li>Later I tried a Remington, then grew a beard, used disposibles and for at least the last 15-17 years have been using a Braun 5416 (buying replacements foils every 2-3 years) to clean my face and a seperate beard trimmer for my moustache.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The process takes up to 30 minutes to complete and when done, the shaver is the raised so it can dry.  </li>
            <li>The process takes up to 30 minutes to complete and when done, the shaver is the raised so it can dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-I find the cleaning system a waste as a simple weekly manual cleaning if you use it dry or daily rinse after shaving if using creams works just as well to keep the head clean and in working order (assuming you lubricate your blades as necessary also).  </li>
            <li>and I certain can feel little stubble remaining after a shave.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far, but am looking forward to trying it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how close and how well this shaver really works I never liked electric razors because they never worked well for me</li>
            <li>A little checking online, though, indicates you can make the fluid yourself cheaply with a little detergent, bottled water and glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will miss a few hairs, despite multiple passes, but in general it works well for a decent shave.</li>

            <li> , I love it。The seller attitude is very good</li>
            <li> It works really good</li>
            <li> Good value.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job.  </li>
            <li> and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li> HQ200 smiles good, Philips is good brand .</li>
            <li> razor is good looking</li>
            <li> good dealer.</li>
            <li> Been a good experience using this razor.  </li>
            <li> good ol&#x27; fashioned H2O.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s head doesn&#x27;t pivot as well as they advertise, which means you have to work it into trickier areas</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a good quality, rasonably priced electric razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer that comes with the unit is a good idea and works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I just take along the trimmer attachment and I am good to</li>
            <li> that might not be good for this type of battery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend a good non-electric razor over this.</li>
            <li> It feel sooo good to shave.</li>
            <li> you are a buyer, China, recommended here for good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you need an electric razor because you can&#x27;t use a blade, don&#x27;t mind reading manuals, and don&#x27;t mind the space this thing takes up, this would be a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the trimmer was integral to the shaver and didn&#x27;t require you to pull off the shaving head to use.s thing takes up, this would be a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> Good quality shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shave and the self cleaning option</li>
            <li> Its surprisingly close on everything but the neck and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Started off good purchased it in November</li>
            <li> it is a good shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t give as close of a shave, and some people prefer that (as a woman, I might say that some men are more physically attractive like that too, hehe).  </li>
            <li> This was ordered for my father - he is very satisfied with the way it works.  </li>
            <li> He is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the razor and the jet cleaning system and would recommend it to anyone who likes electric shavers.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with I how it works.</li>
            <li> We are very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really beautiful stuff, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The results were outstanding!</li>
            <li> When I used the shaver for the first time I was impressed.</li>
            <li> I Love this thing!  </li>
            <li> lots of thoughtful features and it works great.</li>
            <li> It is sleek and looks nice on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Even after 3-4 weeks of use he never felt it was effective.</li>
            <li> Panasonic EA-SA40, ES7037 and ES 7103---Panny makes really, really nice razors.</li>
            <li> Was a nice upgrade going to this one.</li>
            <li> Others may not mind this, but I didn&#x27;t find it cleaned the head any better than good ol&#x27; fashioned H2O.  </li>
            <li> liked the reviews this unit received and the cleaning station idea, so I purchased the 2D</li>
            <li> I feel like I now own a stand-alone shaving laboratory.  </li>
            <li> After that, I was on my own.  </li>
            <li> i already own this model and that is why i bought another as well as a replacement blade</li>
            <li> A nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> I keep a razor handy for any cleanup</li>
            <li> It is OK, but I not so good.</li>
            <li> your kindly help.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how it kind of seems to have a mind of its own too...</li>
            <li> good one, so many stuff</li>
            <li> It is light in weight, fits in the palm of my hand very nicely</li>
            <li> The shaver is ultra lite and looks cool does everything you would expect from a good quality shaver at a great price cheers :-)</li>
            <li> but you dont need to jet clean it every day this razor has been across the country and all over and still works great</li>
            <li> The jet clean system was great, might be a bit pricey, but great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am throughly impressed with my new Shaver.</li>
            <li> Ifyou are looking for a new rotary shaver that will accomplish whatever you need, this shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Why: extremely good reviews, reasonable price, three rotating blades, and attractive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> is my preferred (and most cost effective) cleaning method.   </li>
            <li> oh wow it looks amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 20 years, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have purchsed do far 3 shaving machines which were excellent.  </li>
            <li> Super nice electric razor!  </li>
            <li> Gives a great shave, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> Its so easy and quick to use and does a great job of getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> and it is very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Very light.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any skin irritation marks.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave -no</li>
            <li> And the price is very cheap ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li> My husband says it gives him a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> size is very appropriate, fabrics is comfortable, appear more slender legs.</li>
            <li> which is a great positive since I plan on keeping this for atleast 2yrs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it save my time and clear up very good,</li>
            <li> Even though the shaver itself performs flawlessly, this will be my last Norelco product after more than 40 years of using their shavers.</li>
            <li> Replaced my Norelco Nivea for Men shaver with the SensoTouch 2D and have been pleasantly pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> the most I would give any electric razor is a 4</li>
            <li> can say that this is obviously a quality product designed for those who want to style their beard to the perfect length.  </li>
            <li> shaver itself is sleek and elegant in appearance.</li>
            <li> The best part was the charging station, the self-cleaning, and how lasting its power seemed to be.</li>
            <li> I have done this for MANY years.</li>
            <li> Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade, Mach 3 , Proglide, Hydro5</li>
            <li> We can make electricty, but we can&#x27;t make more water. :-).</li>
            <li> , okay....</li>
            <li> Afta Pre-Electric (better than Lectric Shave or Face-Saver for me),</li>
            <li> SO CLOSE and SO COMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and it has moved up to #1 in my shaving armamentarium.</li>
            <li> be prepared to get even more creative.  </li>
            <li> took the \\&quot;21 day challenge\\&quot; and extended it to 60 days, just to make sure.  </li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail a couple of days ago and love the shave of it.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the ultimate in pens, cameras and electronic devices and this electric razor is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to find one that gave a close shave.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to report that the Phillips Norelco 1160cc/42 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is an exception to this rule.</li>
            <li> satisfied with this shopping exp, although gotta use it for a while to tell whether it will hold.</li>
            <li> Others may not mind this, but I didn&#x27;t find it cleaned the head any better than</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an OK shaver.  </li>
            <li> Most owners of the 3D model would complain of shavings falling out, all over the counter and their shirt.</li>
            <li> But, seriously, enjoy the one you chose!</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> His favorite feature is that it is self cleaning</li>
            <li> She said both were sides were good, but she clearly identified the Atra side as superior.  </li>
            <li> There are even better blades on the market today.  </li>
            <li> I believe from the one use that I will like it OK??</li>
            <li> Overall he is happy with it!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This blew my mind when I used it, gentle shaving and does a great job.</li>
            <li> *sleek and adjusts to many contours of face  Cons of this shaver:  </li>
            <li> These newer units don&#x27;t have that adjustment any more</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  </li>
            <li> Ok, but I wish to have a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor.  </li>
            <li> The jet clean system is nice and hassle free, but if the increased price (vs. the razor sold alone without the cleaning station) is a factor in the decision making process the razor would probably be just as good without it, the blades are very easy to manually clean.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received this saver.</li>
            <li> I am sure they shall replace the defective unit in their own sweet time; but, for now, I am receiving a run around.</li>
            <li> One can get a pretty good shave out of most items out there.   </li>
            <li> , I guess it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Shaved very clean, everywhere.</li>
            <li> shaven Very clean</li>
            <li> It looks really cool and provides a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Because some reviews agree the razor gives a very good shave, but have marked it down because of the \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;, in fairness to what most consider an excellent razor it needs to be said that the maintenance referred to is not mandatory.  </li>
            <li> wish you all a happy New Year</li>
            <li> With the amount/type of surface area I have to cover, the rotary seems to be a better fit for my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> works great so far, my husband loves it</li>
            <li> The shaver is comfortable and, by varying the angle of the shaver, I have been able to get all of my neck shaved as well as my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> The product/shipping was fantastic, although would be better if an AU plug was provided.</li>
            <li> but I feel the cheap Norelco that I have, shaves me better</li>
            <li> Truly, there are so many shaving kits available today.</li>
            <li> most important one,</li>
            <li> However, with a wet shave it is excellent!</li>
            <li> good, deliver fast</li>
            <li> Good, fast, good quality, easy to use, design is also in place, then the price is very cheap，i like it</li>
            <li> i gave it as a present and he loved it!</li>
            <li> COOL!   </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so cool!</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems to be working great!</li>
            <li> Norelco replaced it under warranty very quickly.</li>
            <li> 1160XCC is easy to set up, and just requires an hour to charge.</li>
            <li> I switched to electric razors when retiring to the Dominican Republic because though razors are easy to find the blades are not.  </li>
            <li> and it opens easy to get rid of hair and charge</li>
            <li> The unit is extremely easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> The top part of the heads pops off and you can clean out the hair reservoir manually.  </li>
            <li> This gives me a close shave and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Everything is OK with this product and it can be a great present.</li>
            <li> It came packaged well and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li> this shaver is average or subpar at best.</li>
            <li> Did not shave my husbands beard as good as a normal blade razor.</li>
            <li> When travelling, it always worked fine on the battery charge for about 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razon is fine.</li>
            <li> My previous Philips had an excellent cleaning system.</li>
            <li> and I can maneuver it smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> the fine print, Philips does state that it might take upwards to a week of continual shaving for your face to get used to the unit, and that was my experience.  </li>
            <li> This thing does its job fine as well as charges the razor.</li>
            <li> It is more than I expected and gives a great shave</li>
            <li> But when I need a smooth face for evening activities or even have some time to focus on my shave, then I&#x27;ll be using my Gillette razor instead.</li>
            <li> Most importantly is that it&#x27;s much smoother and more comfortable than the cheaper razors.  </li>
            <li> With this there are no cuts, no bruises, it is smooth and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> so, HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART--</li>
            <li> prefer to clean a razor head with a brush, and this is easy to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is comfortable holding in the hand.</li>
            <li> plus another 6months for free</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Skin Glide\\&quot;,cleaning and lubricating, helps keep the razor moving smoothly across your skin.  </li>
            <li> As smooth as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Also included with the shaver is a cleaning system which keeps the shaver fit for use.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would give me a smooth shave</li>
            <li> I got this for my son for a Christmas present, and he seems to be really happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a comfortable reliable shave, follow the directions in the box, preferred circular pattern, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> weeks)&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to clean manually</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better success with this razor.  </li>
            <li> My skin was happy with the foil, but after a month, my skin still has not forgiven me for the sudden change in razors.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the self-cleaning.  </li>
            <li> head easily comes apart for cleaning, should one desire to clean it another way.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and leaves face smooth.</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> I can get a close shave without having to push the stubble up with my free hand</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave with no chaffing.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The jet clean system is easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning solution and Jet Clean System works well to rid the shaver of hair by shaking it very quickly.</li>
            <li> It gives a fantastic close shave.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an old Norelco and this was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The old one is still in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> I think it shaves closer, is easy to clean with brush or the Jet Clean System, and since I travel a lot, I appreciate the locking feature which prevents accidental turn on.  </li>
            <li> They used to give a really clean, smooth shave, without the need for cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for a new electric razor... I do recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> Top Quality, like it very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and the jet clean system is cool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty sexy to look at, if that matters.</li>
            <li> SensoTouch 2d works pretty well on the top of my head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors in the past and not had the best experience with them.  </li>
            <li> But it all works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system takes up significant counter space.  </li>
            <li> Its cleaning system means that you&#x27;ll need some counter space to store it conveniently and accessibly, but the system itself is so streamlined and easy that it&#x27;s entirely worth</li>
            <li> I have discovered the Jet Clean is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The shaver charges either when placed in the Jet Clean system or in a separate charging cradle.  </li>
            <li> That alone makes this a contender for a shaver to have, if you are clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Once a week I&#x27;ll put it in the Jet Clean System.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is a bit of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> Have not tried the jet clean system yet.</li>
            <li> The included trimmer is easy to attach and is useful for trimming side burns.</li>
            <li> Just get the equivalent Remington without a cleaner gimmick, and soak the head in antiseptic during the day to clean it.</li>
            <li> The jet clean system I haven&#x27;t used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another thing to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t use most of them except for the smaller charger that is included.  </li>
            <li> The three blade assembly detaches, so I can clean the unit after every use.</li>
            <li> can and will recommend the Phillips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System to anyone looking for a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my skin type that is more sensitive to the rotary blades than most</li>
            <li> Bought Philips Norelco razor because of Jet Clean</li>
            <li> you have a equipment to clean your razor</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco 1160X/42 Senso Touch 2D with the Jet Clean for a friend at Christmas.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor with the Jet Clean  tank.</li>
            <li> I clean my razor in a soapy bath in the sink.  </li>
            <li> I must have discarded it upon opening because I intended on always using the cleaning unit to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> don´t get it because the name of the product is Philips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System</li>
            <li> This is a review for the Philips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System.     </li>
            <li> I use the Jet Clean System every day and the shaver is just like the day I got it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Phillips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Razor with Jet clean system for my husband as a gift.  </li>
            <li> I can see that the Jet Clean solution might be a hassle to order.</li>

            <li> Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean</li>
            <li> Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a (1) week search I settled on the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x Electric Shaver w/ Jet Clean System (Norelco SensoTouch 1160x).  </li>
            <li> Jet Clean System is an all-in-one unit in that it both cleans the shaver and charges it.  </li>
            <li> , you can place the shaver into the Jet Clean System just to charge it.  </li>
            <li> , you can place the shaver into the Jet Clean System just to charge it.  </li>
            <li> He is in the process of learning how to use and clean the razor.</li>
            <li> The Jet Cleaner is really nice too, razor always smells fresh and is ready to go when I want to use it.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s easy to use ,i hope it&#x27;s good for a long time</li>
            <li> My 4401LC is a 20 yr old corded model that still does a very nice job/close shave, with HQ4 heads, but I have to be gentle</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean System is really cool.</li>
            <li> but this 1160X shaves just as close as the older units and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid for the Jet Clean System can be pricey, but there are some good deals on it with online retailers.</li>
            <li> *Works great with wet shave/shave gel  *</li>
            <li> This time I found out the true colors of Norelco&#x27;s so called customer service.</li>
            <li> I use hot water from the tap to clean and it is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Allways wanted this cleaning system for my razor (mod 1150)but found out for $17 more I could get it with a newer model (1160) than the one I have.</li>
            <li> shaver hugs the face very well and love the flex head technology.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, I used it for several days and just did not give me a good shave.  </li>
            <li> So Many accessories, and the price is very favorable~&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> This razor is one of the best we have purchased lately.</li>
            <li> This is the latest thst I bought, it is really amaxing.</li>
            <li> its super cool no tug or sensitivity with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, one could easily find a better wall wart, but Norelco has seen to it that this won&#x27;t be easy by using a non standard plug on the adaptor.</li>
            <li> The Jen Clean system is nice and usefull to clean the razor every now and then, but removing the blades and rinsing the razor off with water is very simple with this razor.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt that this shaver, the 1160XCC, gives me a quicker and much more comfortable shave than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> you move it quickly over the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, not only do my fingers when rubbing my face after a shave tell me I am getting a better shave, I also find more whisker residue in the chamber than previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave was smooth, with minimal passes, and results were as good as I would get from a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , pivoting tri-blade head has given me a close, clean-feeling shave, and has been able to reach the hard-to-reach places, particularly on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges quickly which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li> My last razor was by Braun and it was a lot more powerful and offered a better shave.</li>
            <li> It is good for a quick clean up on a Saturday morning if you don&#x27;t want a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The self cleaning station is amazing as I can hit a button and it will be clean for my next use.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I get my new 1150.</li>
            <li> , I called Philips, and they agreed to send me a new cleaning/charging station &amp; more cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for years, this new style is much better than anything I had used before.</li>
            <li> Attachments: The rotary head pops off easily and you can snap on the straight edge razor for shaping beards and sideburns.</li>
            <li> The cleaning device is a huge plus and it really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and I still enjoy using it as much as I did when I received it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is OK but a bit loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular razor kind of guy, and I do prefer that to this Philips Norelco electric one.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco works better....</li>
            <li> It is able to clear all hairs on my face, and about 80% of the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> the money shave a lot better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> the two head(I do not know how to express it ...) is really useful.</li>
            <li> When I am in blade shave mode the Schick Hydro5 is my tool of choice, best blade hands down for me, however this new Norelco 1150x/40 is going to have me using it more than I ever thought possible.   </li>
            <li> love the quick charge feature and that it only takes 50mins for a full charge.</li>
            <li> The 1160XCC comes with the solution you need, and all you need to do is pour it into the special receptacle, and the shaver is clean, gleaming, and good as new, and ready for the next challenge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice razor, it was missing two parts out of the box, I contacted Philips and they are sending them to me.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a fine shaver for when I am in a rush in the mornings and need a quick shave to simply look good at the office.  </li>
            <li> It comes complete with cleaning solution and extremely easy instructions for quick setup.</li>
            <li> I may do it when by its performance I know that it needs more of a cleaning than I can give it with the after-use brushing, or I may do what I have always done with electric razors, and what the manual for this razor calls the \\&quot;extra thorough cleaning method\\&quot;, namely, lift the restraining frame, remove the cutters one by one and clean them and their combs with the brush, reassemble.</li>
            <li> i was on a 3 week trip and it lasted me right up to the end useing it every other day it is a good razor</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a Braun 2000 flat razor for years and it does a very good job, and the flat blade allows me to trim around my beard/goatee when I have one.</li>
            <li> One of my first electric razors over 20 years ago was a rotary razor, and it does not seem that the technology has really advanced that much.</li>
            <li> Well, my first and only foil razor died after an amazing 18 years of faithful use.</li>
            <li> It beats what I used to get with 3 and 4 blade replacement heads like the Mach series, and being able to use it wet or dry is great.</li>
            <li> Does very well if you clean the unit every day.</li>
            <li> But it really does clean the razor thoroughly</li>
            <li> The razor is not bad, but it is certainly overpriced for the results it gives.  </li>
            <li> of irritation is huge, since that&#x27;s why I stopped using my cheapo electric in high</li>
            <li> I called Philips again, and they were very apologetic and said a new wall wart and more solution would be on their way.</li>
            <li> It clogs up pretty quickly but is easy enough to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver, no more razor cuts on my face.</li>
            <li> My old cheap shaver works far better.  </li>
            <li> I am now able to claim that the shaver shaves as well as a blade but without scraping my skin as blades do, thus my skin is not rough.</li>
            <li> I challenged him to try it, since it does seem kind of strange.</li>
            <li> No matter how soft or how hard you push, I did not get burn, the \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; in the floating heads adjusted for a great shave over all surfaces!</li>
            <li> I typically use a Schick razor blade that can be bought in a pack of 8, but I will try to be fair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get shave as close as my old Mach 3 of course, but is very quick and convenient and shaves as close as you can expect an electric razor to shave.  </li>
            <li> Happy that I finally had a working system, I left the bathroom with the unit in the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> My husband has only had the Norelco 1160CXX SensoTouch 2d Shaver for a few weeks, but he said it&#x27;s the best electric shaver that he has owned.  </li>
            <li> *dry shave is average at best  </li>
            <li> I still have my old Norelco arcitec 1060X which still works fine</li>
            <li> So, when the charge light finally comes on, I use the Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li> It took very little effort gave a nice close smooth shave</li>
            <li> Keeping the Jet Clean fluid use down to a minimum is cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who skipped to the very last line, here it is: I plan on using the Phillips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver for many happy years to come.</li>
            <li> I stated earlier, I am sure that eventually I shall receive another replacement but, in the meantime, I am cleaning the shaver heads under running water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pulled the top of the razor off several times already because of the change in design.  </li>
            <li> Some places are just to difficult to get to, but this razor does the best job of any electric razors I have owned.</li>
            <li> Middle of the road in price that work like top of the line shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have been using it for about a month now.  </li>
            <li> First impression was,</li>
            <li> I found this razor to be pretty close with no irritation or bumps.  </li>
            <li> and/or if there was any concern about product quality or customer service at Philips, I would have rated it higher.</li>
            <li> Overall, an OK shaver.  </li>
            <li> and I was utterly amazed at the smooth shave it gave me!</li>
            <li> well if you need to use it for more than 10 minutes (if you need it for any of those uses, you definitely will be)&lt;br</li>
            <li> like they did my Wahl trimmer, most folks will be out of luck &amp; have to send the razor back for batteries!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three electric razors over the years, one Remington from many years ago, one mid-level Braun from about 15 years ago, and my current one, a low-end wet/dry Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one I have ever Bern able to use that didn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, get the model above this one (with the docking station) since it is supposed to have a blade design that gets a better shave with fewer strokes.</li>
            <li> the $60 norelco razor I was using before this one did a better job in the same area but not as close shave as this one.  </li>
            <li> This the first electric razor I&#x27;ve had in over 50 years.  </li>
            <li> It is hot tip</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband, he says it offers the best shave overall from other razors he has tried.</li>
            <li> You can buy them at Amazon for $6.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, like pretty much everybody else, they&#x27;re using a design with Li batteries, that aren&#x27;t normally user accessible, with a URL in the owner&#x27;s manual for directions to remove them at the end of the razor&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean system is certainly convenient as I can just drop the razor in for a clean following every use and it takes care of the rest.  </li>
            <li> It is very very to shave, and shaved very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing pretty much eliminates all the razor burn</li>
            <li> The new Norelco Senso Touch 2D and the Jet Cleaner are well worth</li>
            <li> works better with shaving cream, dry shaving smells like burning hair.</li>
            <li> But besides such minor nuisance, this is a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is actually a fairly good razor, though I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to speak to reliability, or longevity.</li>
            <li> It took me about two weeks before I figured out how to get close shave on certain areas like the neck below my ears, under my nose and adams apple.</li>
            <li> the three circular heads had problems with cleaning certain parts of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is nice because with older electric shavers the blades always seem to lose their sharp edge.  </li>
            <li> On balance I am very satisfied with the stylish unit, so much so that I have given serious thought to purchasing another shaver as a hot standby when the current shaver decides to stop working!  </li>
            <li> On balance I am very satisfied with the stylish unit, so much so that I have given serious thought to purchasing another shaver as a hot standby when the current shaver decides to stop working!  </li>
            <li> My beard is tough and one thing that always bothered me was the pulling I experienced when going against the grain, so to speak.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a quick test when I got home and the results were better than my old Braun, but I&#x27;ll update this later after a few more tests and charge.</li>
            <li> However, I find it hard to get an even shave and get good lines on my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a huge upgrade from the basic norelco razor.  </li>
            <li> Using shaving cream with this Norelco model, he had better success, but only if he spent more time shaving with it than he ever would need to spend with a regular \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li> My face definitely does not feel smooth</li>
            <li> This razor cuts really well, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say that there was much difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s cleaning system was an added benefit, and one I really appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the shower or shaving.</li>
            <li> Is this really an upgrade?</li>
            <li> heck this may not be much of a difference of a shave.</li>
            <li> Using the circular pattern (with and against the grain) with this or any Norelco shaver really gives on a close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks Ivan</li>
            <li> I do find that I have to use it every couple of days as opposed to once a week with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> This is something I can do in about two minutes while standing in the shower with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> It so much easier to shave with</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Jet Cleaning system\\&quot; helps keep the shaver ready for use.  </li>
            <li> (though i don&#x27;t really know what it</li>
            <li> However, the product is very well designed, maintained and postage was not a hassle.</li>
            <li> Very flexible in getting close to your nose and neck.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes it and uses it quite often, but still occasionally wants that &#x27;close&#x27; shave and breaks out the Mach3 disposables.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes it and uses it quite often, but still occasionally wants that &#x27;close&#x27; shave and breaks out the Mach3 disposables.  </li>
            <li> I could never get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really had to test out the razor&#x27;s ability to hold a charge, but I&#x27;ve had no problems using it for 10 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> That way my skin stays free from red, irritation marks.</li>
            <li> whole Body wash</li>
            <li> ,that&#x27;s very Convenient</li>
            <li> The cutters must not be very close to the edge of shields.  </li>
            <li> really like this stuff,</li>
            <li> Philips/Norelco has every gizmo imaginable: a very fancy swivel head, a separate trimmer attachment, a stand-alone self-cleaning system,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and simple operate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li> Really like the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> So it handles well on curves thanks to the flexible head.  </li>
            <li> The shaver does an excellent job of cutting.    </li>
            <li> The straight edge works quite well.  </li>
            <li> Also very slimlined.</li>
            <li> paying that much for a razor i expect a trimmer that does&#x27;nt look and feel like a 50 cent add on.</li>
            <li> I probably could have saved money and got a lower price razor and not noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> the growth of your hair so that it will become effective at some mysterious later time.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week and liked it enough to return it and order this current model under review.</li>
            <li> Cleaning solution is pretty cheap and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so I shave every few days and let the stubble come out nice...</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a razor for over 50 years and finally found an electric shaver that gives me a clean and smooth shave equal to a blade shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave and is quiet compared to other shavers.  </li>
            <li> (SensoTouch 2D Electric Shaver with Jen Clean System) does go above and beyond whatever electric shaving experiences you&#x27;ve had before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there is another similar razor without the jet clean system I would probably buy that.</li>
            <li> I only have to recharge and clean the heads twice a month.</li>
            <li> You have to open the heads carefully to clean</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often since I clean shave and use tweezers or a regular razor to shape the sideburns.     </li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle takes a long time and it seems to go through the cleaning liquid pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for two weeks now and each successive shave has been better than the previous one.</li>
            <li> This one has been better than all previous.  </li>
            <li> An 8 pack of Schick blades comes at about $10 a pack (maximum) and each blade can last for multiple (in my experience, many) times.  </li>
            <li> Really love it, especially since I moved from a low end Philips shaver .</li>
            <li> Also found out it won&#x27;t work with my older razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves about as well as my 8 year old norelco, but is much quieter and the battery lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> until I can get a decent quality wall wart and adapt it to this system, before I can use my razor!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The older Norelco&#x27;s had a 9 adjustment blade depth.</li>
            <li> Little tricky at the neck but feels very smooth to use .</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin and this razor does not irritate his skin!</li>
            <li> The jet clean system is efficient and makes the blades clean and slick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality of Shave:  I only noticed a mild, if any, improvement over my normal razor blade.</li>
            <li> $100+ for a razor should yield a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I still won&#x27;t change the rating though because the cost is too high and part of it is for the cleaning unit that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high quality electric razor</li>
            <li> He would highly recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by our daughter whose husband has one and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Anyways, my point is this...don&#x27;t buy an electric shaver if you want a perfectly smooth 100% stubble-free shave because you aren&#x27;t going to get it with this razor or any other electric one no matter how much you pay for</li>
            <li> Because the Jet Clean System charges the shaver everytime you use it, I don&#x27;t know how long the shaver can go between charges.</li>
            <li> After using it nearly every day for nearly three months it&#x27;s still going strong and remains my choice for my daily morning shave.  </li>
            <li> its like bolting a brass horn on a fine stringed instrument, usable but not very functionable.</li>
            <li> Item seems to work fine just not as close of a shave as we expected.</li>
            <li> and I can shave everything in a little more than a minute.</li>
            <li> Product motor won&#x27;t allow it to move far enough to self clean.</li>
            <li> The three floating heads are configured to adjust at exactly the right distances and contours to provide total coverage with a few easy passes.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is wonderful, but the cleaning system is badly designed.  </li>
            <li> Used it and it worked great, his face was so smooth, a day later he got crazy razor bumps...</li>
            <li> I have a fairly sensitive face and this razor does not irritate my face much at all, even shaving dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this as a wet shaver with foam shaving cream and it is extremely comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> He says that with a normal \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor he can just shave and go, but with this razor it seemed to not work at all... or to work on a promise of \\&quot;training\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I prefer a wet/dry razor because just being able to rinse it out everyday</li>
            <li> Took me a few minutes to figure out how to lift off the top of the chamber</li>
            <li> The cleaning system takes a long time to run though (about 2 hours for a full cycle, including drying).  </li>
            <li> According to the normal size to buy can, don&#x27;t need to change anythingworthy。I</li>
            <li> After a few months, it will dip the razor into the solution, but then bring it up again flashing the icon that it needs more solution.  </li>
            <li> He was able to use the razor without the missing parts, it was the protective cap and cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself offers a smooth, flat, rounded head that moves seamlessly over even or uneven surfaces (whether a guy&#x27;s jawline or a woman&#x27;s knee), and the battery lasts for over a dozen shaves or more before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better than anything I&#x27;ve had from any previous electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Not the highest model but right in the middle of the Norelco line up in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I could \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; out the contents with the provided brush, but it only takes a minute or two to clean the chamber and have the razor ready for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets the job done quickly and should be cheaper in the long haul than the blades I was using.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ll do to make this razor work, is to find an appropriate power supply with the correct voltage and at least the same current capacity, or greater.</li>
            <li> Extremely close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Back when I graduated from high school I recieved my first Norelco razor in 1984.</li>
            <li> Well, wait, now the 1150x has this new neck pivot device.</li>
            <li> We live in Australia, so when purchasing this item it was thought that an adapter for an AU plug would be included.</li>
            <li> brand new, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> But it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> So, I called Philips again and was told not to worry, as a new wall wart would be included with the replacement cleaning/charging</li>
            <li> receipt of the new wall wart, I set up the cleaning/charging station &amp; connected the new power adaptor.</li>
            <li> so, I unplugged the new wall wart and got out my Fluke again.</li>
            <li> The new adaptor was dead!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is New</li>
            <li> they said they will send me a new one</li>
            <li> My job always has me on my toes, requiring me to leave where I live at a moments notice.</li>
            <li> and I can easily shave with less passes of the razor.  </li>
            <li> more time, 2) use it wet with shaving cream, 3) and go through extensive cleaning up.</li>
            <li> &#x27;pull&#x27; hairs uncomfortably during shaving and has a nice slightly vibrating feeling that is kind of relaxing on the face</li>
            <li> For people with light facial hair, I expect the battery to last about 18 shaves without recharging.      </li>
            <li> Only use the Jet Clean once every two or three weeks since manually cleaning it does a decent enough job.    </li>
            <li> It is a very gentle shave, and did not leave my face and neck red like the Braun often does.</li>
            <li> My new razor glides freely over my face, leaving clean tracks behind it, although removing the blades from its holder for cleaning is somewhat cumbersome.</li>
            <li> My first experience with this Philips rotary razor was very different.    </li>
            <li> The next shave, I decided to use hot water, and shaving gel.</li>
            <li> First it holds a charge longer than any of my smaller shavers that I had used for my goatee.  </li>
            <li> This was my first Phillips and my last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I have found that washing my face with hot water before I shave improves the experience immensely, as does shaving in the shower—</li>
            <li> My first shave left me profoundly disappointed, but I was determined to stick with it, so I went the full week, shaving my head and face every day and by day four the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x was shaving much closer until by day seven the shaver was now as good as my now deceased Advantage</li>
            <li> My beard is not unusually dense, but I do have a full beard</li>
            <li> In the future, when going out with the wife on a special occasion, I&#x27;ll definitely use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The cleaning/charging station is a total profit generating gimmick and a total waste of time, as this razor is nicely designed and extremely easy to clean under a running faucet in only a matter of seconds, so purchase the razor without it, and you might get lucky and get a power adaptor that doesn&#x27;t fail.</li>
            <li> If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving.</li>
            <li> i love how i can wet or dry shave with this</li>
            <li> As for a smooth dry shave, this unit seems to be about the same.</li>
            <li> (Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of our course</li>
            <li> RIght side of face, dry shave eh</li>
            <li> you place the shaver into the cradle upside down, plug the Jet Clean System unit in and turn it on.  </li>
            <li> you place the shaver into the cradle upside down, plug the Jet Clean System unit in and turn it on.  </li>
            <li> For the money I would like to have seen a hard shell case to better protect the shaver when traveling.</li>
            <li> Independent outside observation by a female face tester resulted in her not really being able to tell much difference between the sides.)    </li>
            <li> I like it&#x27;s clear machine</li>
            <li> use to get razor burns every time I use a electric razor, and the only way was to whip out the old Gillette Fusion, and shaving became a very time consuming tasks in the morning.</li>
            <li> The station has to be plugged in, so for the wire not to appear unseemly, the station has to remain near a power outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a Norelco razor for nearly 20 years, having switched to a disposable blade.  </li>
            <li> They work well for my daily routine and work fast.</li>
            <li> It makes the heads last much longer.   </li>
            <li> wow factor there.</li>
            <li> After using this shaver, I then took a blade and went over the same spots to see if I could get any closer.....not really.</li>
            <li> The old one fits but isn&#x27;t compatible with the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> a young guy</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a 3d model, but really needed the self cleaning option and went with the 2d model saving over $100 at my local store.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I used it for all my grooming needs, including sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I would suggest they give the Philps Norelco a try they will be surprised.</li>
            <li> He would rather use his old electric razor.</li>
            <li> I note that the Atra is a 30 year old shaving technology.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave with it, and not as close as my 20 year old Remington Triple Foil Shaver.</li>
            <li> 70 Years Old</li>
            <li> There is no rotary electric shaver that cleans my neck completely.</li>
            <li> You cannot connect the power plug directly to the Shaver and use it while it is charging.</li>
            <li> Preferred the old popup method.</li>
            <li> 15 year old son is now using this for his righteous &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works very well and charges at the same time.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried a number of razors—any number of traditional ones-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  </li>
            <li> naturally curly hair).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the drying cycle is complete, the razor will charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the drying cycle is complete, the razor will charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boyfriend reported it didn&#x27;t really cut all the hair off his face, not such a close shave.</li>
            <li> My father finds this is really soft and</li>
            <li> The shaver is quiet but powerful, yet so streamlined it&#x27;s hardly bigger than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all, which is surprising because my father and I always bought Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> But, I figured out as long as I make sure to wash my face with soap after each use, I can dry shave daily with no problems.</li>
            <li> A full charge can last me a week if I shaver every other day for about 10 minutes which is my normal</li>
            <li> A full charge can last me a week if I shaver every other day for about 10 minutes which is my normal</li>
            <li> Never really worked right..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally at the spot where I wanted to either get new replacement foil (another $25+) or try a new system.</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean System is bulky and a waste.</li>
            <li> I have had several Philips three head razors in the past and they all worked better for me than the foil.</li>
            <li> The charging time was quick less than an hour to charge.</li>
            <li> The handle is organically shaped and easy to grasp, and every aspect of the product seems to have been prethought with a little extra care for convenience and ease of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging light came on, and when I hit the cleaner&#x27;s power button, it began to move the razor into position for cleaning, but it only moved about half way before it froze.</li>
            <li> This new Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch is a nice upgrade except for one advantage the Spectra had, which was the ability to switch between Sensitive or Normal level cutting.    </li>
            <li> I found the shave to be quite close compared to razors of the past, and the handle even pivots to fit the outline of your face.  </li>
            <li> The base is fantastic, I love it!</li>
            <li> or if you get the head wet first.</li>
            <li> :( He had to stop using it but wants to wait and maybe try again as he liked the feel of his skin after his first shave.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver when Gillette came out with yet another more complicated, more expensive and less effective \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; manual razor.</li>
            <li> I figured it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be more expensive to go to an electric shaver as opposed to spending $30/month on replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> The new model works just the same (works well).  </li>
            <li> I still have to use another electric razor to really get a close shave, so definitely don&#x27;t plan on making this your only razor if you like a close shave</li>
            <li> I usually prefer Norelco shavers because I have had good luck with them in the past.</li>
            <li> holy moley, this 1150 contours my scalp/and head like no other razor or blade</li>
            <li> and as always, the Norelco gets my attention first due to its design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that being said, this is a pretty snappy looking electric razor, but performs just like any other forty dollar electric razor as well as your two hundred plus dollar electric razors.  </li>
            <li> , then I told myself, Ill get myself one for sure!</li>
            <li> If the contours of your face have not lent themselves to the contours of electric shavers in the past, or, your neck hair grows in a circular pattern that defeats any electric shaver you have used before, then I recommend giving this shaver a try as I am in a similar situation and the shaver has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> There is a pressure sensitive switch that tells the unit there is sufficient fluid.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this extra mechanism provides a better, cleaner razor, or just gives more parts to break or go wrong, but it looks neat.    </li>
            <li> It takes at least ten minutes and several inspections to make sure I got all of the areas on my neck.  </li>
            <li> My old one I would have to shave with a regular razor after the weekend when I dont shave.</li>
            <li> That is the same as my old foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t what he expected and I even let him pick out.  </li>
            <li> The warranty clearly states they will replace defective units for two years, but today they told me that this is the last time they will replace it, although it&#x27;s only 11 months old.  </li>
            <li> When the fourth replacement tank was also defective, I called Philips again and offered to pay the difference to upgrade to the next higher model, which I was told uses a different tank, if they would credit me the cost of my current model.  </li>
            <li> I would not use it before going into the office as the shave is not close or complete enough.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco finally gave up do I purchased this model to replace.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll then, while observing proper polarity, connect the proper plug from the norelco wall wart to the replacement wall wart, using solder for reliability and shrink tubing to prevent shorting, and beat Norelco at their own game.</li>
            <li> Norelco sent me a new one, which lasted about as long.  </li>
            <li> The shave is much better than any of the other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> The shaver is slowly lowered into the cleaning reservoir (it attaches to the bottom of the unit) and turns the shaver on, spinning the blades in cycles until they are clean.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is slowly lowered into the cleaning reservoir (it attaches to the bottom of the unit) and turns the shaver on, spinning the blades in cycles until they are clean.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what was wrong and thought it might be something I had done (user error) until I read other reviews that described exactly my problem.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see what I mean when you tell it to clean.</li>
            <li> You can also use shaving gel with the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it twice)  and Its hard to gauge how effective the shaver was being in clipping my hair closely.  </li>
            <li> The resulting shave on flat skin was about the same, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how long the shaver lasts before I have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> I did expect there to be more advancements from my old one to the new, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any outside of the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, the only small complaint that I have is that it takes some effort to make the razor shave really short hairs.</li>
            <li> So overall, for clean shaving, I would not have a problem recommending this since the results are similar to what I was used to with the Braun, but it&#x27;s quieter and gentler on skin - at least to me.</li>
            <li> Later I tried a Remington, then grew a beard, used disposibles and for at least the last 15-17 years have been using a Braun 5416 (buying replacements foils every 2-3 years) to clean my face and a seperate beard trimmer for my moustache.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The process takes up to 30 minutes to complete and when done, the shaver is the raised so it can dry.  </li>
            <li> The process takes up to 30 minutes to complete and when done, the shaver is the raised so it can dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I find the cleaning system a waste as a simple weekly manual cleaning if you use it dry or daily rinse after shaving if using creams works just as well to keep the head clean and in working order (assuming you lubricate your blades as necessary also).  </li>
            <li> and I certain can feel little stubble remaining after a shave.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far, but am looking forward to trying it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how close and how well this shaver really works I never liked electric razors because they never worked well for me</li>
            <li> A little checking online, though, indicates you can make the fluid yourself cheaply with a little detergent, bottled water and glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will miss a few hairs, despite multiple passes, but in general it works well for a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Razor also very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> All the other Norelcos I have owned haad snap-off clear plastic covers.  </li>
            <li> I seriously doubt that Philips is paying more than $1.00 for these wall warts - probably less!</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, runs all week, and the cleaning base does a fine job.</li>
            <li> I took this razor back to China directly, but until recently, my friend unpacked the package, he found out that the charger is missing.</li>
            <li> I like that the battery last a long time</li>
            <li> Finally, Phillips offers a solution to the problem of being unable to shave due to the shaver losing its charge; plug the shaver into the recharger for a few minutes and the shaver with quick charge the shaver so that it works for a few minutes, long enough to do a quick shave.</li>
            <li> I used it for a very long time and finaly decided to try a different electric as I felt</li>
            <li> My previous electric shaver was a long-time (10 years old?)</li>
            <li> The razor does take up a bit of space, so if your live in a urban apartment with small space</li>
            <li> He wont be going back to a plain old razor anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I would have expected the technology to improve, but it seems like the only improvement is in the cleaning</li>
            <li> It takes about twice as long to get a close shave as it would to use a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Electric razors have also come a long way, but they still can&#x27;t compete against manual shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When he wanted to use it for the second time he realized the battery was not working anymore and went to a Phillips authorized service center nearby</li>
            <li> and this razor has difficulty if the hair is too long.  </li>
            <li> do have to use a disposable razor for cleanup on my neck if I let it grow too long.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for long time.</li>
            <li> For some reason with my beard, I only get average results with a dry shave and this razor was no different.</li>
            <li> This switch is obviously the culprit as all I can get is a blinking orange icon saying there is no or little fluid when there is plenty.</li>
            <li> (I actually shaved one have of my face and neck with the Braun, and the other with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now March 25th, and I&#x27;ll still be waiting (who know how long!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned four other Norelco electric shavers, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned four other Norelco electric shavers, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X</li>
            <li> I bought a brand new cleaner base because I loved the shaver so much, but it failed a few months later.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning I used it as dry and after a week my face was sore.</li>
            <li> I found that dry shaving</li>
            <li> Because I have dry skin shaving without lotion can severely flack my skin, making aftershave lotion a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A single bottle of cleaning solution ships with the shaver;</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Charging/cleaning base has good rubber feet to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to counter surface regardless if wet or dry without slipping around.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Also, there is a spot on my neck just below the jaw bone near my ear that other razors had trouble getting.</li>
            <li> No powerful enough and does not give you that close of a shave.</li>
            <li> shaver worked decently well while it worked and the hair was not more than 2 days long, the cleaner is pretty useless,</li>
            <li> Even though every one of them has a serial number, which easily would have Philips shown that the thing was still within the warranty period, they could not care less, provide zero customer service beyond &amp;#34;no receipt, sorry you are screwed&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be used with or without shaving cream, and wet or dry, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> he past is that they were often times not getting a really smooth close shave, like a baby&#x27;s behind.  </li>
            <li> For everyone else, maybe you can find some Mach 3 Power razors on the Chinese black market.</li>
            <li> It can be used for either a wet or dry</li>
            <li> Even with a new blade, my foil unit always left hairs behind.</li>
            <li> I have used the 1150x for a while, my shave time is getting less and less, and it is very apparent</li>
            <li> It also gives me a very smooth shave with minimal effort and so far no razor burn which I was fearful of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Most of all, I don&#x27;t feel any bad razor burn after using this shaver.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m partially bald, by the way).  </li>
            <li> I like that the head can be rinsed with water and that you can shave wet.  </li>
            <li> I returned a few hours later to find none of the lights on the cleaning/chargingstation lit up.</li>
            <li> For example, to set the travel lock you need to hold onto the on button for three seconds and release; that&#x27;s not very intuitive.  </li>
            <li> there is always few hairs gets left out and when you try to take out those few individual hairs, this razor just doesn&#x27;t grab it.  </li>
            <li> His old one had broken and he was using regular shavers, he was accustom to the electric shavers.</li>
            <li> cleaning base is nice, but not really needed IMO.</li>
            <li> It was definitely not a noise I have heard from any other rechargeable device, so I&#x27;m a little concerned with the quality.  </li>
            <li> They stated they now need a copy of the sales invoice which is certainly no problem</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Extremely long battery life (my husband used this everyday for about 8 minutes and a single charge lasted over 2</li>
            <li> no real reason other than I like variety, and in the summer I water my lawn</li>
            <li> My husband has used quite a few electric razors over the years and has found that majority of them shave the same, some just have better features than others and some are less painful...</li>
            <li> It has taken my skin a little longer than I expected to adjust to dry shaving.</li>
            <li> While I like the razor, the Jet Clean tanks have serious problems, and Philips should stand behind this.</li>
            <li> (head snaps off &amp; on easily)&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomic design that fits comfortably in small hands as well as larger hands</li>
            <li> After reverse shopping and looking at the replacement blade prices (gulp), I began looking at something other than the 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recipient likes it, but complains that it is quite a bit noisier that his other norelco razor.</li>
            <li> Then I shaved one side of my beard with my trusty Atra blade and the other with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I tried foils and other rotaries but</li>
            <li> at first failed to shave as closely as I’d like.  </li>
            <li> In each case, I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the quality of the shave, and have gone back to my tried and true Atra blade.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that he felt it took double the time to accomplish a less effective result.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers aren&#x27;t just for Christmas -- let&#x27;s face it, almost every home has at least one, and they&#x27;re terrific and versatile for both men and women alike, when quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does what it was designed to do and does it extremely well!</li>
            <li> My husband is extremely please with it!</li>
            <li> It is hard for me not to write this review with a little bias, for I am not a man blessed with an abundance of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It also has less tug and pull on the whiskers</li>
            <li> I previously owned alot of lower end Norelco shavers and kept having to replace them every year.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> the 1160X/42 Senso Touch 2D shaver and at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;After waiting 10 days for that replacement to arrive, I was bitterly disappointed to see that no cleaning solution, or more importantly, no wall wart, had been included!</li>
            <li> I have already came back to US and it is expensive for my friend to mail the razor back to me from China, so there is no way for me to replace or return the package.</li>
            <li> first shave was somewhat disappointing.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco replaced an older non-pivoting tri-blade Norelco that I never really liked because it had a hard time getting at those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> A little itch when shaving.</li>
            <li> I hate giving this a lower star rating because of it&#x27;s price, but I feel it is priced higher because of the JetClean system, which as I stated earlier, to me seems to be a waste of resources.&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I have had it for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> The solution is at the line level indicated in the little basin.  </li>
            <li> like I always have in the past with other razors.</li>
            <li> And without shaving cream he felt it was harsh on his skin.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head everyday.</li>
            <li> These two shavers could not handle a stoud beard or the \\&quot;workload\\&quot; a heavy shaver like me demands.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasure to use everyday.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> for the battery, I try not to run the shaver until it is dead.</li>
            <li> Not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble with this unit not working.  </li>
            <li> but it has trouble getting the hairs around the neck -- in comparison</li>
            <li> It takes forever to go round and round with this razor and still my beard is not shaved.</li>
            <li> However, for all intensive purposes, cutting down three days of hair was probably equivalent to a normal blade.  </li>
            <li> In fact, for the past few years I have been using Feather blades on a Merkur razor, so as blade as you can get, and this razor comes close to that.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day for work since I have thick and dark stubble.</li>
            <li> But, I suspect that these power adaptors are all pieces of S&amp;!t, and without a decent wall wart, the razor is useless!</li>
            <li> Even after a month I still have to go over my beard for 5 minutes and by that time my neck is raw.    </li>
            <li> Others that have attempted to get Philips to stand behind the failed cleaning unit have been very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> That said, I have used this razor almost exclusively, beard be darned, for the past month or two and still like it.</li>
            <li> I switched to using shaving cream and no more sore face.</li>
            <li> I usually use a blade during the winter months and an electric during the summer months....</li>
            <li> If you are concerned about facial hair and want to save on those expensive disposables from Gillette then this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> He uses it everyday now in the shower, for the smoothest shave he ever had!</li>
            <li> I usually charge the razor after each use</li>
            <li> Also, not all Li batteries last 10 years, and if they fail within 6 months,</li>
            <li> I tried electric razors in the past (always hand me downs) used them once or twice and always got rid of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It requires the use of Philips-brand fluid that&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a foil razor in the past and did not like it for my face.</li>
            <li> The really lousy part of this issue is the cleaning system is the only way to charge the razor by just placing it in a stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had razors in the past that had small convenient charging stands.</li>
            <li> I was cleaning out my bath vanity and found the small separate charging stand that DOES come with this razor.</li>
            <li> So there is a small separate stand that the charging wire plugs into</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco rotaries for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> But my past experience with Norelco rechargeable shavers is that they would hold a charge for me 2 1/2 to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phillips products for the past 13 years or so.</li>
            <li> Despite the ratings, this is no better or worse than any other electric I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is not very good at shaving my face.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrated, and not to mention you have to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t return things unless they are broken or completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Company does not stand behind warranty, product broke after less than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hardly anyone will bother with this, and these razors will wind up in land fills with the batteries still in them.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Charging/cleaning base is EXTREMELY large and cumbersome</li>
            <li> The travel case is a little shoddy being a thin nylon case.  </li>
            <li> I have always had bad feeling about electric razors they make me think of my grandpas and always make me think of old spice after shave.  </li>
            <li> The newer Panasonic do have larger cutting surfaces that I may have to try someday.   </li>
            <li> My complaint about electric razors int</li>
            <li> My experience with electric shavers prior to this one has been disappointing.</li>
            <li> this thing takes forever to mow your face, I&#x27;ve had norelcos for 10 years and this one sucks</li>
            <li> you will have to change cleaning solution at least twice a month, you can buy them walmart etc...</li>
            <li> At least then I would have an electric shaver I KNOW will work with my skin and give the shave</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Update, 11/08/2014 - I have discovered the Jet Clean is a piece of junk. The one that came with my shaver &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after 4 months. Norelco replaced it under warranty very quickly. The replacement unit only lasted one month and went out with the same problem. There is a pressure sensitive switch that tells the unit there is sufficient fluid. This switch is obviously the culprit as all I can get is a blinking orange icon saying there is no or little fluid when there is plenty. This switch stops the unit from cycling. This time I found out the true colors of Norelco&#x27;s so called customer service. I am sure they shall replace the defective unit in their own sweet time; but, for now, I am receiving a run around. They stated they now need a copy of the sales invoice which is certainly no problem EXCEPT I faxed it to them on 10/31. I called them again on 11/06 and was told they are &amp;#34;weeks behind&amp;#34; in responding to faxes so, this time, I emailed it to them. I called again to check on the email on 11/07. This was done per the instructions of the agent to whom I spoke on 11/06. This time I was told they probably hadn&#x27;t processed it and I should call again on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week which would be 11/11 or 11/12. That would be 13 days after my initial call. This is why I say I am getting a run around.&lt;br /&gt;As I stated earlier, I am sure that eventually I shall receive another replacement but, in the meantime, I am cleaning the shaver heads under running water. Even though the shaver itself performs flawlessly, this will be my last Norelco product after more than 40 years of using their shavers.</li>
            <li> i gave it as a present and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Top Quality, like it very much</li>
            <li> My previous electric shaver was a long-time (10 years old?) Norelco 5810XL.  There is no doubt that this shaver, the 1160XCC, gives me a quicker and much more comfortable shave than my old Norelco.  It also has less tug and pull on the whiskers and I can easily shave with less passes of the razor.  Most of all, I don&#x27;t feel any bad razor burn after using this shaver.  However, this shaver cannot provide a close shave like a manual razor could.  My face definitely does not feel smooth and I certain can feel little stubble remaining after a shave.      The shaver charges either when placed in the Jet Clean system or in a separate charging cradle.  However, there is no plug on the shaver to plug in the charging cord; so when you travel, you&#x27;ll have to take the cradle with you.  My shaver emits a high-pitched whine when it charges.  It was definitely not a noise I have heard from any other rechargeable device, so I&#x27;m a little concerned with the quality.  The Jet Clean system is certainly convenient as I can just drop the razor in for a clean following every use and it takes care of the rest.  One thing I don&#x27;t like though is that after the cleaning finishes (approx. 2 hours), I would expect the unit to resume charging.  But it doesn&#x27;t.  In order to force it to charge, you&#x27;ll have to pull it out of the cradle and let it fall back in.    Overall, this is a fine shaver for when I am in a rush in the mornings and need a quick shave to simply look good at the office.  But when I need a smooth face for evening activities or even have some time to focus on my shave, then I&#x27;ll be using my Gillette razor instead.</li>
            <li> Replaced my Norelco Nivea for Men shaver with the SensoTouch 2D and have been pleasantly pleased with its performance.  I think it shaves closer, is easy to clean with brush or the Jet Clean System, and since I travel a lot, I appreciate the locking feature which prevents accidental turn on.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of the SensoTouch 3D, but I think it is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my boyfriend for Xmas, he loves it!! He has very sensitive skin and this razor does not irritate his skin!</li>
            <li> Great shaver, no more razor cuts on my face. works better with shaving cream, dry shaving smells like burning hair.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts really well, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  I don&#x27;t like the way the plastic cover slides off.  All the other Norelcos I have owned haad snap-off clear plastic covers.  I&#x27;ve pulled the top of the razor off several times already because of the change in design.  This was a gift.</li>
            <li> Great peace of gear!!!</li>
            <li> the most I would give any electric razor is a 4*.  Some places are just to difficult to get to, but this razor does the best job of any electric razors I have owned.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it. It works really good he says.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me not to write this review with a little bias, for I am not a man blessed with an abundance of facial hair.  I typically use a Schick razor blade that can be bought in a pack of 8, but I will try to be fair.  Lets start at the top:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: $150.  An 8 pack of Schick blades comes at about $10 a pack (maximum) and each blade can last for multiple (in my experience, many) times.  And don&#x27;t forget that this product requires replacement blades at an additional cost. So, compare as you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style: I like the package and the charger station.  It is sleek and looks nice on my bathroom counter.  The station has to be plugged in, so for the wire not to appear unseemly, the station has to remain near a power outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use:  It comes with a lot of bells and whistles, which, unfortunately, require a reading of the instruction manual.  Things do get a tad complicated, but are sorted out after a close read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of Shave:  I only noticed a mild, if any, improvement over my normal razor blade. However, for all intensive purposes, cutting down three days of hair was probably equivalent to a normal blade.  I really can&#x27;t say that there was much difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that this is obviously a quality product designed for those who want to style their beard to the perfect length.  However, for those who are not so concerned and merely shave it all off, the difference in quality does not outweigh the space on the counter the recharger takes up or the costs (and hidden costs) of the product.  For those reasons, I rate the product 3 out of 5 stars: Great, but not for me.product 3 out of 5 stars: Great, but not for me.</li>
            <li> One of my first electric razors over 20 years ago was a rotary razor, and it does not seem that the technology has really advanced that much. I have been shaving with a Braun 2000 flat razor for years and it does a very good job, and the flat blade allows me to trim around my beard/goatee when I have one. My first experience with this Philips rotary razor was very different.    The unit is very quiet -- it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it is doing anything. It is a very gentle shave, and did not leave my face and neck red like the Braun often does. The resulting shave on flat skin was about the same, as far as I could tell. (I actually shaved one have of my face and neck with the Braun, and the other with this one. Independent outside observation by a female face tester resulted in her not really being able to tell much difference between the sides.)    That alone makes this a contender for a shaver to have, if you are clean shaven. It is much more difficult to trim around bears with this, and if you do want to trim sideburns or such, you have to pop off the rotary head and snap in a trimmer. Yet another piece to lose! Still, the unit comes with a travel case with room enough for this part.    It charges quickly, runs all week, and the cleaning base does a fine job. It is mechanically motorized and lowers the shaver in to the solution then powers through a cleaning cycle. I am not sure this extra mechanism provides a better, cleaner razor, or just gives more parts to break or go wrong, but it looks neat.    So overall, for clean shaving, I would not have a problem recommending this since the results are similar to what I was used to with the Braun, but it&#x27;s quieter and gentler on skin - at least to me. I do not like it for shaving around bears, and for that I would take my Braun razor over this one any time.    That said, I have used this razor almost exclusively, beard be darned, for the past month or two and still like it.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers aren&#x27;t just for Christmas -- let&#x27;s face it, almost every home has at least one, and they&#x27;re terrific and versatile for both men and women alike, when quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Philips Norelco 1160XCC (SensoTouch 2D Electric Shaver with Jen Clean System) does go above and beyond whatever electric shaving experiences you&#x27;ve had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is sleek and elegant in appearance. (I immediately dubbed mine The Bat-Shaver!  It&#x27;s the Batmobile of electric shavers.) Its cleaning system means that you&#x27;ll need some counter space to store it conveniently and accessibly, but the system itself is so streamlined and easy that it&#x27;s entirely worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1160XCC is easy to set up, and just requires an hour to charge. It comes complete with cleaning solution and extremely easy instructions for quick setup. The shaver itself offers a smooth, flat, rounded head that moves seamlessly over even or uneven surfaces (whether a guy&#x27;s jawline or a woman&#x27;s knee), and the battery lasts for over a dozen shaves or more before needing to be recharged. It can be used with or without shaving cream, and wet or dry, depending on your preference. The shaver is quiet but powerful, yet so streamlined it&#x27;s hardly bigger than a disposable razor. The handle is organically shaped and easy to grasp, and every aspect of the product seems to have been prethought with a little extra care for convenience and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s cleaning system was an added benefit, and one I really appreciated. The 1160XCC comes with the solution you need, and all you need to do is pour it into the special receptacle, and the shaver is clean, gleaming, and good as new, and ready for the next challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this shaver to anyone seeking to pamper themselves or the men in their lives, and it would make a terrific gift for the holidays, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave on!</li>
            <li> Good value.  Works well and has held up well (purchased one year ago)</li>
            <li> Middle of the road in price that work like top of the line shaver.  every thing was wonderful with this order :))</li>
            <li> Really love it, especially since I moved from a low end Philips shaver . Little tricky at the neck but feels very smooth to use .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for a couple of weeks now and it&#x27;s a huge upgrade from the basic norelco razor.  Most importantly is that it&#x27;s much smoother and more comfortable than the cheaper razors.  I find that it shaves closer if once you get to the really short hairs you move it quickly over the surface of your skin.  The jet clean system is efficient and makes the blades clean and slick.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, the only small complaint that I have is that it takes some effort to make the razor shave really short hairs.</li>
            <li> He says that with a normal \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor he can just shave and go, but with this razor it seemed to not work at all... or to work on a promise of \\&quot;training\\&quot; the growth of your hair so that it will become effective at some mysterious later time. Even after 3-4 weeks of use he never felt it was effective. Using shaving cream with this Norelco model, he had better success, but only if he spent more time shaving with it than he ever would need to spend with a regular \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor. And without shaving cream he felt it was harsh on his skin. The best part was the charging station, the self-cleaning, and how lasting its power seemed to be. It&#x27;s also pretty sexy to look at, if that matters. The worst part is that he felt it took double the time to accomplish a less effective result. If he wanted great results, he says, he would have to spend 1) more time, 2) use it wet with shaving cream, 3) and go through extensive cleaning up. Overall he felt this was a disappointing and backward step from using an ordinary manual razor and fulfilled none of the promises of an expensive electric razor. He is pacing back and forth next to me warning you: do not buy. He imagines that if people like electronic razors it&#x27;s not based on this performance of this one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a Norelco razor for nearly 20 years, having switched to a disposable blade.  When the chance came to try a Triple Header again I jumped.  They used to give a really clean, smooth shave, without the need for cleaning solution.  Unfortunately, the quality of the shave isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  Even after a month I still have to go over my beard for 5 minutes and by that time my neck is raw.    If I were going to go back to an electric razor again I might try a foil razor rather than rotary blade.  This Norelco just didn&#x27;t stack up.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have been using it for about a month now.  When I purchased it I was skeptical. I didn&#x27;t think I would get a close shave. Before I purchased this, I used the razor blade and I used to get cuts all over my face and I would put tissues over my face trying to stop the bleeding. The Norelco Senso Touch 2D Electric Shaver is very good. I really like it and I will never go back to the razor blade. With this there are no cuts, no bruises, it is smooth and gives a close shave. In the beginning I used it as dry and after a week my face was sore. I switched to using shaving cream and no more sore face. It took me about two weeks before I figured out how to get close shave on certain areas like the neck below my ears, under my nose and adams apple. Now I get a close shave all over my neck and face. I use hot water from the tap to clean and it is super easy to clean. The Jet Clean System is bulky and a waste. I never took it out of the package.  Over all I am very happy with this product and I would recommend others to try it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is OK but a bit loud. The cleaning stand leaves a lot to be desired.  It doesn&#x27;t do a good job.  It is cumbersome.  I especially didn&#x27;t like the instructions.  They jumbled together 3 or 4 different models to the point I could not tell which one mine was and what instructions went with which shaver.</li>
            <li> It is more than I expected and gives a great shave..close...the cleaning system is great...    I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head everyday. I have done this for MANY years. If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving. Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade, Mach 3 , Proglide, Hydro5 and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors. I have also used Braun, Norelco and Panasonic electrics. One can get a pretty good shave out of most items out there.   I usually use a blade during the winter months and an electric during the summer months....no real reason other than I like variety, and in the summer I water my lawn so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the shower or shaving. We can make electricty, but we can&#x27;t make more water. :-). When I am in blade shave mode the Schick Hydro5 is my tool of choice, best blade hands down for me, however this new Norelco 1150x/40 is going to have me using it more than I ever thought possible.   Just so you know, I have used the following electric razors:   Norelco 4401LC, 7145XL--Overall I am a Norelco fan. They work well for my daily routine and work fast. My 4401LC is a 20 yr old corded model that still does a very nice job/close shave, with HQ4 heads, but I have to be gentle or I&#x27;ll get razor burn on my neck.   Panasonic EA-SA40, ES7037 and ES 7103---Panny makes really, really nice razors. Great wet/dry use. With the amount/type of surface area I have to cover, the rotary seems to be a better fit for my shaving routine. The newer Panasonic do have larger cutting surfaces that I may have to try someday.   Braun Syncho5, 1-150-----Braun just DOES NOT work for my beard and head. Gives me the worst shave ever. Missed hairs everywhere, cheeks, neck, razor burn, you name it. I will never buy another Braun. These two shavers could not handle a stoud beard or the \\&quot;workload\\&quot; a heavy shaver like me demands.   FYI--I also brush out my shaving heads every week no matter what shaver I use. It makes the heads last much longer.   I like electric shavers because they don&#x27;t cause bumps at the base of the back of my neck like blade shaving does. I also like to shave on the go.   I prefer a wet/dry razor because just being able to rinse it out everyday is my preferred (and most cost effective) cleaning method.   Okay, so I get my new 1150. First impression was, oh wow it looks amazing!!!!! 100% wow factor there. The base is fantastic, I love it! No tossing this razor in a drawer or cabinet. Having a lithium battery is a big plus as well! AND MADE IN THE NETHERLANDS, not China! COOL!   Um wait a minute, the Series 8 heads look JUST LIKE my 7145XL! Is this really an upgrade? Also, the head base seems to flex the same as my 7145...heck this may not be much of a difference of a shave. Well, wait, now the 1150x has this new neck pivot device. Hmmmm. This razor was charged when it arrived and I had some stubble so, HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART-- I gave it a test run. For some reason with my beard, I only get average results with a dry shave and this razor was no different. RIght side of face, dry shave eh, okay....but my preshave of choice is Afta Pre-Electric (better than Lectric Shave or Face-Saver for me), and on the left side of my face with the Afta...WOW, nano-near as close as a blade!!!!! So put some Afta on my scalp...holy moley, this 1150 contours my scalp/and head like no other razor or blade I have ever used!!! SO CLOSE and SO COMFORTABLE! Also ZERO razor burn on my neck!   No matter how soft or how hard you push, I did not get burn, the \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; in the floating heads adjusted for a great shave over all surfaces! After using this shaver, I then took a blade and went over the same spots to see if I could get any closer.....not really. Using the circular pattern (with and against the grain) with this or any Norelco shaver really gives on a close shave. I have used the 1150x for a while, my shave time is getting less and less, and it is very apparent, this is a big step up in comfort and overall shaving experience.   I love this shaver and it has moved up to #1 in my shaving armamentarium. It&#x27;s a pleasure to use everyday.</li>
            <li> it‘s good, deliver fast</li>
            <li> I am throughly impressed with my new Shaver. It seems as close as any blade razor. I have shaved with a razor for over 50 years and finally found an electric shaver that gives me a clean and smooth shave equal to a blade shave. Thanks Ivan</li>
            <li> This is not your father&#x27;s electric razor.  Philips has raised the bar with the Norelco 1160cc/42 Senso Touch 2d Electric Shaver.  The razor does take up a bit of space, so if your live in a urban apartment with small space be prepared to get even more creative.  But besides such minor nuisance, this is a really good shaver.  I found the shave to be quite close compared to razors of the past, and the handle even pivots to fit the outline of your face.  Think couture razor that perfectly glides to your face.  If you are concerned about facial hair and want to save on those expensive disposables from Gillette then this is the way to go.  I still prefer gillette razors, but will use the electric every now and then.  My complaint about electric razors int he past is that they were often times not getting a really smooth close shave, like a baby&#x27;s behind.  I found this razor to be pretty close with no irritation or bumps.  So if your concerned about razor bumps this could be another way to go.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a waste of time and money. Even after multiple passes this shaver still misses multiple hairs. My wife was constantly asking me if I shaved and to go re shave. I have shown her how it works and she thinks its a piece of junk. My old cheap shaver works far better.  The snap on head falls off mid shave.  The trimmer does not trim anything.</li>
            <li> works great so far, my husband loves it</li>
            <li> I got this shaver when Gillette came out with yet another more complicated, more expensive and less effective \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; manual razor. I&#x27;m still annoyed that they quit making the \\&quot;Mach 3 Power\\&quot;.  I figured it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be more expensive to go to an electric shaver as opposed to spending $30/month on replacement blades.  I like the idea of the cleaning system and I don&#x27;t mind a shave that&#x27;s not as close as a blade.  My expectations were not that high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the \\&quot;21 day challenge\\&quot; and extended it to 60 days, just to make sure.  I generally don&#x27;t return things unless they are broken or completely useless.  Here is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SensoTouch 2d works pretty well on the top of my head (I&#x27;m partially bald, by the way).  I do find that I have to use it every couple of days as opposed to once a week with a straight razor.  It also takes a lot longer.  The benefit is that I can shave my head while sitting in my office.  It clogs up pretty quickly but is easy enough to clean.  Once a week I&#x27;ll put it in the Jet Clean System.  That seems to keep it running well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad news.  This shaver is not very good at shaving my face.  It takes at least ten minutes and several inspections to make sure I got all of the areas on my neck.  This is something I can do in about two minutes while standing in the shower with a straight razor.  This is no different than the last experience I had with an electric shaver about five years ago.  I would have expected the technology to improve, but it seems like the only improvement is in the cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion; if you&#x27;re a bald man that enjoys neck hair, this shaver is for you.  For everyone else, maybe you can find some Mach 3 Power razors on the Chinese black market.</li>
            <li> Allways wanted this cleaning system for my razor (mod 1150)but found out for $17 more I could get it with a newer model (1160) than the one I have. Also found out it won&#x27;t work with my older razor. The old one fits but isn&#x27;t compatible with the cleaning unit. So it all worked out in the end.</li>
            <li> An excellent product until now!</li>
            <li> I like it&#x27;s clear machine, it save my time and clear up very good, HQ200 smiles good, Philips is good brand .</li>
            <li> Super nice electric razor!  Works with shaving cream too.  Clean up is a bit of a hassle.  I&#x27;m a regular razor kind of guy, and I do prefer that to this Philips Norelco electric one.  Very nice, and you do get a lot of stuff for the price!  So, if you are looking for a new electric razor... I do recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> I switched to electric razors when retiring to the Dominican Republic because though razors are easy to find the blades are not.  And they are quite expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unquestionably this razor gives me the best shave of any I have used. My beard is tough and one thing that always bothered me was the pulling I experienced when going against the grain, so to speak.  With this razor, I do not get that.  This, by itself, is enough to make me like the razor.  Also, there is a spot on my neck just below the jaw bone near my ear that other razors had trouble getting. Consequently I often had hair in those spots.  With this razor, I do not have the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to clean a razor head with a brush, and this is easy to do.  Took me a few minutes to figure out how to lift off the top of the chamber so I could \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; out the contents with the provided brush, but it only takes a minute or two to clean the chamber and have the razor ready for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, not only do my fingers when rubbing my face after a shave tell me I am getting a better shave, I also find more whisker residue in the chamber than previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is good looking and it is very comfortable in my hand.  Very light.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Because some reviews agree the razor gives a very good shave, but have marked it down because of the \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;, in fairness to what most consider an excellent razor it needs to be said that the maintenance referred to is not mandatory.  I am not putting the razor in the cleaner daily and do not intend to.  I may do it when by its performance I know that it needs more of a cleaning than I can give it with the after-use brushing, or I may do what I have always done with electric razors, and what the manual for this razor calls the \\&quot;extra thorough cleaning method\\&quot;, namely, lift the restraining frame, remove the cutters one by one and clean them and their combs with the brush, reassemble.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending 20.00 a month on all those \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot; razor blades, and decided to invest in an electric shaving system. For whatever reasons, I got the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 1160XCC.&lt;br /&gt;My first shave was somewhat disappointing. I was irritated, and the result was certainly not as good as I was used to. The next shave, I decided to use hot water, and shaving gel. The results were outstanding! The shave was smooth, with minimal passes, and results were as good as I would get from a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to give the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 1160XCC five stars because I feel that it works as advertized.</li>
            <li> Very good price, I want buy two more as gift. It is very very to shave, and shaved very clean.&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable holding in the hand. A little itch when shaving. Very quiet machine, I guess it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Shaved very clean, everywhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail a couple of days ago and love the shave of it. I previously owned alot of lower end Norelco shavers and kept having to replace them every year.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver hugs the face very well and love the flex head technology. It so much easier to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;The warranty is also 2yrs plus another 6months for free which is a great positive since I plan on keeping this for atleast 2yrs.&lt;br /&gt;I love the quick charge feature and that it only takes 50mins for a full charge. Have not tried the jet clean system yet.</li>
            <li> Norelco SensoTouch is a great electric shaver.  It looks really cool and provides a nice shave.  The \\&quot;Jet Cleaning system\\&quot; helps keep the shaver ready for use.  This is nice because with older electric shavers the blades always seem to lose their sharp edge.  Once this happens the whisker pulling starts.  The \\&quot;Skin Glide\\&quot;,cleaning and lubricating, helps keep the razor moving smoothly across your skin.  This is a very nice electric razor.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the ultimate in pens, cameras and electronic devices and this electric razor is the best I have ever used.  Seriously.  As smooth as a blade.  The three floating heads are configured to adjust at exactly the right distances and contours to provide total coverage with a few easy passes.  I like the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the handle -- for me, its ergo-dynamic. The cleaning device is a huge plus and it really works as advertised.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> My experience with electric shavers prior to this one has been disappointing. I have never been able to find one that gave a close shave. especially around my neck. I am pleased to report that the Phillips Norelco 1160cc/42 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is an exception to this rule. I have been using the shaver for two weeks now and each successive shave has been better than the previous one. I am now able to claim that the shaver shaves as well as a blade but without scraping my skin as blades do, thus my skin is not rough. The shaver is comfortable and, by varying the angle of the shaver, I have been able to get all of my neck shaved as well as my cheeks and chin. The included trimmer is easy to attach and is useful for trimming side burns. Also included with the shaver is a cleaning system which keeps the shaver fit for use. Finally, Phillips offers a solution to the problem of being unable to shave due to the shaver losing its charge; plug the shaver into the recharger for a few minutes and the shaver with quick charge the shaver so that it works for a few minutes, long enough to do a quick shave. If the contours of your face have not lent themselves to the contours of electric shavers in the past, or, your neck hair grows in a circular pattern that defeats any electric shaver you have used before, then I recommend giving this shaver a try as I am in a similar situation and the shaver has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It works especially well either under water or if you get the head wet first. It&#x27;s easy to clean and the jet clean system is cool (though i don&#x27;t really know what it does)...but it&#x27;s so cool! Regardless, it&#x27;s a great shave and it doesn&#x27;t hurt if you miss a couple days...or a week.</li>
            <li> The cleaner reservoir failed before long, disappointing me. Just get the equivalent Remington without a cleaner gimmick, and soak the head in antiseptic during the day to clean it.</li>
            <li> We live in Australia, so when purchasing this item it was thought that an adapter for an AU plug would be included. Upon receiving the item, it was found that an American style plug was included. This then resulted in us having to buy a plug so that the item could be used. However, the product is very well designed, maintained and postage was not a hassle. The product/shipping was fantastic, although would be better if an AU plug was provided.</li>
            <li> Company does not stand behind warranty, product broke after less than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unfortunately did not buy it at amazon and did not have a receipt. Even though every one of them has a serial number, which easily would have Philips shown that the thing was still within the warranty period, they could not care less, provide zero customer service beyond &amp;#34;no receipt, sorry you are screwed&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver worked decently well while it worked and the hair was not more than 2 days long, the cleaner is pretty useless, showering it under water gives the same results. When travelling, it always worked fine on the battery charge for about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it did not break after such a short time and/or if there was any concern about product quality or customer service at Philips, I would have rated it higher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man for 30 years and this is the best razor I have ever had.  Very flexible in getting close to your nose and neck.  I like that the head can be rinsed with water and that you can shave wet.  The jet clean system I haven&#x27;t used and I don&#x27;t think I will.  It&#x27;s just another thing to keep clean.  The razor I  haven&#x27;t regretted buying.   If there is another similar razor without the jet clean system I would probably buy that.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, nice packaging. brand new, just as advertised. good dealer. trustworthy person. satisfied with this shopping exp, although gotta use it for a while to tell whether it will hold.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received this saver. I hoped it would give me a smooth shave but I feel the cheap Norelco that I have, shaves me better&lt;br /&gt;than the 1160X/42 Senso Touch 2D shaver and at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I got this for my son for a Christmas present, and he seems to be really happy with its performance. He uses it everyday now in the shower, for the smoothest shave he ever had!</li>
            <li> im a young guy and i travel alot, i use this whenever i travel and it works great i dont bring the jet cleaner with me because its big but you dont need to jet clean it every day this razor has been across the country and all over and still works great i love how i can wet or dry shave with this its super cool no tug or sensitivity with this and it opens easy to get rid of hair and charge lasts me for a week trip i was on a 3 week trip and it lasted me right up to the end useing it every other day it is a good razor</li>
            <li> I had another norelco electric shaver. But it was time to get a new one. My old one I would have to shave with a regular razor after the weekend when I dont shave. This one Shave close even when having a 2 day growth. You cant go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Back when I graduated from high school I recieved my first Norelco razor in 1984. I used it for a very long time and finaly decided to try a different electric as I felt the three circular heads had problems with cleaning certain parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;  Later I tried a Remington, then grew a beard, used disposibles and for at least the last 15-17 years have been using a Braun 5416 (buying replacements foils every 2-3 years) to clean my face and a seperate beard trimmer for my moustache.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m finally at the spot where I wanted to either get new replacement foil (another $25+) or try a new system. and as always, the Norelco gets my attention first due to its design.&lt;br /&gt;  I wasn&#x27;t planning on getting one (just looking), but found a $30 off coupon in the store next to the shavers.&lt;br /&gt;  So I picked this one up this evening. I wanted to get a 3d model, but really needed the self cleaning option and went with the 2d model saving over $100 at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;  I gave it a quick test when I got home and the results were better than my old Braun, but I&#x27;ll update this later after a few more tests and charge. Ended up paying $119 with coupon at Meijer.</li>
            <li> Been a good experience using this razor.  Had a lower end version of a Norelco.  Was a nice upgrade going to this one.</li>
            <li> Thus is the best shaver I have ever used. I bought another for my F.in law...he will get it on Fathers Day. I used it for all my grooming needs, including sensitive areas. If your looking for a comfortable reliable shave, follow the directions in the box, preferred circular pattern, and enjoy. Aloha, and God Bless you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read review after review complaining about how this won&#x27;t give a close shave...NEWSFLASH!!! - electric shavers work differently than a manual disposable razor.  They don&#x27;t give as close of a shave, and some people prefer that (as a woman, I might say that some men are more physically attractive like that too, hehe).  Anyways, my point is this...don&#x27;t buy an electric shaver if you want a perfectly smooth 100% stubble-free shave because you aren&#x27;t going to get it with this razor or any other electric one no matter how much you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this is a pretty snappy looking electric razor, but performs just like any other forty dollar electric razor as well as your two hundred plus dollar electric razors.  My husband has used quite a few electric razors over the years and has found that majority of them shave the same, some just have better features than others and some are less painful...but the end result is always the same.  Some pros and cons summarized below for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Attractive design modernizing anybodies bathroom countertop&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely long battery life (my husband used this everyday for about 8 minutes and a single charge lasted over 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to clean manually (head snaps off &amp; on easily)&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomic design that fits comfortably in small hands as well as larger hands&lt;br /&gt;-Charging/cleaning base has good rubber feet to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to counter surface regardless if wet or dry without slipping around.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t &#x27;pull&#x27; hairs uncomfortably during shaving and has a nice slightly vibrating feeling that is kind of relaxing on the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-Charging/cleaning base is EXTREMELY large and cumbersome&lt;br /&gt;-I find the cleaning system a waste as a simple weekly manual cleaning if you use it dry or daily rinse after shaving if using creams works just as well to keep the head clean and in working order (assuming you lubricate your blades as necessary also).  You have to change the cleaning liquid so often that it&#x27;s cost is like doubling your shaving cream expense.  Others may not mind this, but I didn&#x27;t find it cleaned the head any better than good ol&#x27; fashioned H2O.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s head doesn&#x27;t pivot as well as they advertise, which means you have to work it into trickier areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an OK shaver.  My husband likes it and uses it quite often, but still occasionally wants that &#x27;close&#x27; shave and breaks out the Mach3 disposables.  I hate giving this a lower star rating because of it&#x27;s price, but I feel it is priced higher because of the JetClean system, which as I stated earlier, to me seems to be a waste of resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and P.S. Philips...the pics of the guy models getting groped don&#x27;t encourage one to buy the product, but they did make me giggle.ng your shaving cream expense.  Others may not mind this, but I didn&#x27;t find it cleaned the head any better than good ol&#x27; fashioned H2O.  -It&#x27;s head doesn&#x27;t pivot as well as they advertise, which means you have to work it into trickier areas    Overall, an OK shaver.  My husband likes it and uses it quite often, but still occasionally wants that &#x27;close&#x27; shave and breaks out the Mach3 disposables.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors in the past and not had the best experience with them.  I could never get a very close shave.  I&#x27;ve had much better success with this razor.  It doesn&#x27;t get shave as close as my old Mach 3 of course, but is very quick and convenient and shaves as close as you can expect an electric razor to shave.  After using it nearly every day for nearly three months it&#x27;s still going strong and remains my choice for my daily morning shave.  I have a fairly sensitive face and this razor does not irritate my face much at all, even shaving dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes with a lot of parts and I honestly don&#x27;t use most of them except for the smaller charger that is included.  The Jen Clean system is nice and usefull to clean the razor every now and then, but removing the blades and rinsing the razor off with water is very simple with this razor.  I usually charge the razor after each use so I haven&#x27;t really had to test out the razor&#x27;s ability to hold a charge, but I&#x27;ve had no problems using it for 10 minutes or so.  I also like the fact that the charger shuts off as soon as the razor is fully charged.  This razor also feels solid and well made in your hand.  I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a good quality, rasonably priced electric razor.</li>
            <li> Well, my first and only foil razor died after an amazing 18 years of faithful use. I decided to try a rotary style razor, to see if it could stand up to it&#x27;s predecessor. I decided to purchase and test a basic Phillips rotary style shaver. I used it for a week and liked it enough to return it and order this current model under review. I decided on this model because of the reviews. Most owners of the 3D model would complain of shavings falling out, all over the counter and their shirt. I plan on keeping this unit for years to come. After reverse shopping and looking at the replacement blade prices (gulp), I began looking at something other than the 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the reviews this unit received and the cleaning station idea, so I purchased the 2D and I have had it for a little over a month. The unit is extremely easy to maintain. The three blade assembly detaches, so I can clean the unit after every use. It is a very simple to pull off and snap on the rotary blade assembly. The trimmer that comes with the unit is a good idea and works surprisingly well. I don&#x27;t need to take several units when I travel. I just take along the trimmer attachment and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this model picks up the stray hairs on my neck without fail. Even with a new blade, my foil unit always left hairs behind. As for a smooth dry shave, this unit seems to be about the same. My skin was happy with the foil, but after a month, my skin still has not forgiven me for the sudden change in razors. I tried this unit with shaving cream and I was utterly amazed at the smooth shave it gave me! I would not have believed it unless I had tried it myself. My son recently received a Phillips rotary shaver for his birthday. When I told him I used shaving cream and got an incredible shave, he laughed at me and the idea. I challenged him to try it, since it does seem kind of strange. In the future, when going out with the wife on a special occasion, I&#x27;ll definitely use shaving cream. She may never believe I actually used an electric razor to get that razor blade smooooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the cleaning station a couple times and I like the idea of cleaning the heads every time I recharge the unit. I was surprised how long the shaver lasts before I have to recharge it. I only have to recharge and clean the heads twice a month. My beard is not unusually dense, but I do have a full beard and I can shave everything in a little more than a minute. That is the same as my old foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can and will recommend the Phillips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System to anyone looking for a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ----------  (UPDATED  02/24/2013 )  ----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this razor for 11 MONTHS now and I still enjoy using it as much as I did when I received it. It has taken my skin a little longer than I expected to adjust to dry shaving. But, I figured out as long as I make sure to wash my face with soap after each use, I can dry shave daily with no problems. That way my skin stays free from red, irritation marks. It&#x27;s probably my skin type that is more sensitive to the rotary blades than most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the battery, I try not to run the shaver until it is dead. I think I read somewhere that might not be good for this type of battery.  So, when the charge light finally comes on, I use the Jet Clean System. Keeping the Jet Clean fluid use down to a minimum is cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who skipped to the very last line, here it is: I plan on using the Phillips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver for many happy years to come. Truly, there are so many shaving kits available today. I hope this review helps someone to decide which shaving kit to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, should I...  should I grow the beard back now?  Or not.  No, no, NO!  I&#x27;m just kidding!  :^)  But, seriously, enjoy the one you chose!</li>
            <li> love it. so fancy. lots of thoughtful features and it works great.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift. Recipient likes it, but complains that it is quite a bit noisier that his other norelco razor.</li>
            <li> After having a Norelco shaver for 10 years it was time for a change, so I researched  the internet for a nnew one! I am so glad that I chose this one!!! It gives the close shave that I have been waiting for GREAT. And it cleans it self and lubricates  the heads at the same time.  Best choice I ever made.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, I used it for several days and just did not give me a good shave.  My old Norelco works better.... I gave it away to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, since he has never used an electric shaver before, and he loves it. Its so easy and quick to use and does a great job of getting a close shave. He wont be going back to a plain old razor anytime soon. His favorite feature is that it is self cleaning so he doesn&#x27;t have to do it. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 20 years, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. No tug and pull even after several day growth. It is very smooth on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any skin irritation marks. I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far, but am looking forward to trying it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an old Norelco and this was a good deal.  It is a big upgrade from what I&#x27;ve used for 40 years and I like the extra features and cleaner/charger.  I bought the beard trimmer attachment for it and it works like a champ.</li>
            <li> So Many accessories, and the price is very favorable~&lt;br /&gt;With whole Body wash,that&#x27;s very Convenient&lt;br /&gt;the most important one,shaven Very clean</li>
            <li> Bought Philips Norelco razor because of Jet Clean System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner stopping working after only 3 months. This part is only covered for 90 days. Razor also very hard to clean. You have to open the heads carefully to clean inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the who system in the trash after spending over $130.00.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how close and how well this shaver really works I never liked electric razors because they never worked well for me but I am impressed with this one would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on your jaw&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work well on your head (if you go bald)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work well on your neck&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work well if you don&#x27;t use shaving cream (don&#x27;t believe what they say)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work well if you need to use it for more than 10 minutes (if you need it for any of those uses, you definitely will be)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon takes returns!</li>
            <li> The razor is not bad, but it is certainly overpriced for the results it gives.  It takes about twice as long to get a close shave as it would to use a disposable razor.  Also it&#x27;s difficult to trim under your nose or on the jawline.  The cutters must not be very close to the edge of shields.  I&#x27;d recommend a good non-electric razor over this.</li>
            <li> Another life !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no scratches, irritation or shaving foam. all set in two minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;addionally you have a equipment to clean your razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my Dad last year and I used it once, then I told myself, Ill get myself one for sure! Really beautiful stuff, and easy to use. It feel sooo good to shave. You should get one.</li>
            <li> Pretty good electric razor.  The cleaning system takes a long time to run though (about 2 hours for a full cycle, including drying).  Shaves about as well as my 8 year old norelco, but is much quieter and the battery lasts much longer.  Cleaning solution is pretty cheap and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave -no skin irritation even though I had never used anything but a blade for. very good product.!</li>
            <li> This is actually a fairly good razor, though I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to speak to reliability, or longevity. But, the combination cleaning/charging station and the power adaptor are total junk! Upon receipt of the razor, I placed it in the basic &#x27;charge only&#x27; stand, also included with the razor, and charged the batteries. Then, after using it, I placed it into the cleaning/charging station. The charging light came on, and when I hit the cleaner&#x27;s power button, it began to move the razor into position for cleaning, but it only moved about half way before it froze. It was still lit up and still charging the batteries, but it would not move forward with the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I called Philips, and they agreed to send me a new cleaning/charging station &amp; more cleaning solution. However, upon returning to the bathroom, the cleaning/charging station was no longer lit up and the batteries were no longer being charged. I unplugged the power adaptor, hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;wall wart&amp;#34;, from the cleaning/charging station and tested its output with my FLuke 79 multimeter. There was none - no voltage at all! So, I called Philips again and was told not to worry, as a new wall wart would be included with the replacement cleaning/charging station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting 10 days for that replacement to arrive, I was bitterly disappointed to see that no cleaning solution, or more importantly, no wall wart, had been included! I called Philips again, and they were very apologetic and said a new wall wart and more solution would be on their way. So, I waited another 10 days for them to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receipt of the new wall wart, I set up the cleaning/charging station &amp; connected the new power adaptor. The razor was taken into the solution, and the cleaning process began. Happy that I finally had a working system, I left the bathroom with the unit in the cleaning process. I returned a few hours later to find none of the lights on the cleaning/chargingstation lit up. so, I unplugged the new wall wart and got out my Fluke again. The new adaptor was dead!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power adaptors are proving to be the &#x27;Achilles Heal&#x27; of this Norelco razor system. The cleaning/charging station is a total profit generating gimmick and a total waste of time, as this razor is nicely designed and extremely easy to clean under a running faucet in only a matter of seconds, so purchase the razor without it, and you might get lucky and get a power adaptor that doesn&#x27;t fail. But, I suspect that these power adaptors are all pieces of S&amp;!t, and without a decent wall wart, the razor is useless! I ordered this on March 1st. It&#x27;s now March 25th, and I&#x27;ll still be waiting (who know how long!) until I can get a decent quality wall wart and adapt it to this system, before I can use my razor!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, one could easily find a better wall wart, but Norelco has seen to it that this won&#x27;t be easy by using a non standard plug on the adaptor. What I&#x27;ll do to make this razor work, is to find an appropriate power supply with the correct voltage and at least the same current capacity, or greater. I&#x27;ll cut the end off both it, and the Norelco unit. I&#x27;ll then, while observing proper polarity, connect the proper plug from the norelco wall wart to the replacement wall wart, using solder for reliability and shrink tubing to prevent shorting, and beat Norelco at their own game. But, shame on them for trying to make extra profits by including a needless cleaning/charging station &amp; using an extraordinarily cheap and unreliable wall wart! I seriously doubt that Philips is paying more than $1.00 for these wall warts - probably less! You can buy them at Amazon for $6.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, like pretty much everybody else, they&#x27;re using a design with Li batteries, that aren&#x27;t normally user accessible, with a URL in the owner&#x27;s manual for directions to remove them at the end of the razor&#x27;s life. Hardly anyone will bother with this, and these razors will wind up in land fills with the batteries still in them. Also, not all Li batteries last 10 years, and if they fail within 6 months, like they did my Wahl trimmer, most folks will be out of luck &amp; have to send the razor back for batteries!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a mid-range razor to try switching from disposables to electric.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and I enjoy the self-cleaning.  However, I find it hard to get an even shave and get good lines on my sideburns.  It will miss a few hairs, despite multiple passes, but in general it works well for a decent shave.</li>
            <li> very  good  it is New, I love it。The seller attitude is very good, trust&lt;br /&gt;Pants size is very appropriate, fabrics is comfortable, appear more slender legs. According to the normal size to buy can, don&#x27;t need to change anythingworthy。I wish you all a happy New Year</li>
            <li> Great!I really like this stuff, recommended!If you are a buyer, China, recommended here for good.And the price is very cheap ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco replaced an older non-pivoting tri-blade Norelco that I never really liked because it had a hard time getting at those hard to reach places. With this self-cleaning system, Philips Norelco is going to give Braun a run for their money. Simply press a button and the system lowers the shaver into the cleaning liquid and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gyrating, pivoting tri-blade head has given me a close, clean-feeling shave, and has been able to reach the hard-to-reach places, particularly on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with the shave the razor has provided. The shaver includes a travel lock. The razor can be recharged in the cleaning system, or a separate stand-alone stand. It can be used for either a wet or dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head easily comes apart for cleaning, should one desire to clean it another way. The head can also be replaced with the trimmer attachment which is provided. A brush and carrying case are also included.</li>
            <li> I have always had bad feeling about electric razors they make me think of my grandpas and always make me think of old spice after shave.  I tried electric razors in the past (always hand me downs) used them once or twice and always got rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips however has come along way from what I was used to.  First it holds a charge longer than any of my smaller shavers that I had used for my goatee.  It charges quickly which I appreciate.  It also gives me a very smooth shave with minimal effort and so far no razor burn which I was fearful of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who have doubts about electric razors I would suggest they give the Philps Norelco a try they will be surprised.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my father - he is very satisfied with the way it works.  The shave is close and leaves face smooth.</li>
            <li> I still have my old Norelco arcitec 1060X which still works fine and I use it. I bought the Norelco 1160X/42 Senso Touch 2D with the Jet Clean for a friend at Christmas. I recommended this Razor because I had just purchased two of the Senso Touch 1160X, one for a friend for a birthday present and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself. I have never had a problem with Phillips Norelco products.</li>
            <li> The jet clean system was great, might be a bit pricey, but great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to get razor burns every time I use a electric razor, and the only way was to whip out the old Gillette Fusion, and shaving became a very time consuming tasks in the morning. Now with this baby, ALL IS WELL!</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t what he expected and I even let him pick out.  He would rather use his old electric razor.</li>
            <li> It is rare for me to write a negative review like this. Bought this razor with the Jet Clean  tank. Not cheap. In the course of about 8 months, the cleaning tank has broken four times. There obviously is a manufacturing defect in the water level sensor, which renders the tank inoperable. The warranty clearly states they will replace defective units for two years, but today they told me that this is the last time they will replace it, although it&#x27;s only 11 months old.  But what is the point if the tanks have a manufacturing defect?  When the fourth replacement tank was also defective, I called Philips again and offered to pay the difference to upgrade to the next higher model, which I was told uses a different tank, if they would credit me the cost of my current model.  They told me that this was not possible.  While I like the razor, the Jet Clean tanks have serious problems, and Philips should stand behind this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three electric razors over the years, one Remington from many years ago, one mid-level Braun from about 15 years ago, and my current one, a low-end wet/dry Panasonic.  In each case, I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the quality of the shave, and have gone back to my tried and true Atra blade.  But I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a high-end electric razor and see just what the fuss and expense was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Philips/Norelco has every gizmo imaginable: a very fancy swivel head, a separate trimmer attachment, a stand-alone self-cleaning system, and of course a charger.  It&#x27;s fairly complicated.  You definitely need to read the manual to use it.  For example, to set the travel lock you need to hold onto the on button for three seconds and release; that&#x27;s not very intuitive.  Using the self-cleaning system requires some reading as well.  I feel like I now own a stand-alone shaving laboratory.  But it all works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system takes up significant counter space.  It requires the use of Philips-brand fluid that&#x27;s expensive.  A little checking online, though, indicates you can make the fluid yourself cheaply with a little detergent, bottled water and glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what about the shave?  It&#x27;s far better than anything I&#x27;ve had from any previous electric razor.  But I shouldn&#x27;t be the judge.  My wife should be!  As the manual suggests, I waited three weeks to let my \\&quot;beard adjust to the shaving system.\\&quot;  Then I shaved one side of my beard with my trusty Atra blade and the other with this razor.  My wife&#x27;s verdict?  She said both were sides were good, but she clearly identified the Atra side as superior.  I note that the Atra is a 30 year old shaving technology.  There are even better blades on the market today.  Electric razors have also come a long way, but they still can&#x27;t compete against manual shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you need an electric razor because you can&#x27;t use a blade, don&#x27;t mind reading manuals, and don&#x27;t mind the space this thing takes up, this would be a good purchase.  I do wish the trimmer was integral to the shaver and didn&#x27;t require you to pull off the shaving head to use.s thing takes up, this would be a good purchase.  I do wish the trimmer was integral to the shaver and didn&#x27;t require you to pull off the shaving head to use.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave with it, and not as close as my 20 year old Remington Triple Foil Shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver is wonderful, but the cleaning system is badly designed.  After a few months, it will dip the razor into the solution, but then bring it up again flashing the icon that it needs more solution.  Only it doesn&#x27;t.  The solution is at the line level indicated in the little basin.  Norelco sent me a new one, which lasted about as long.  After that, I was on my own.  I bought a brand new cleaner base because I loved the shaver so much, but it failed a few months later.  I looked at it closely and found that the sensors had clogged with white gunk that I can&#x27;t remove.  The gunk blocks the sensors from operating properly.</li>
            <li> I clean my razor in a soapy bath in the sink.  I have had a lot of trouble with this unit not working.  The razon is fine.</li>
            <li> i already own this model and that is why i bought another as well as a replacement blade</li>
            <li> I just received this item and have only used it one time so I can&#x27;t say either way just yet? I believe from the one use that I will like it OK??</li>
            <li> this thing takes forever to mow your face, I&#x27;ve had norelcos for 10 years and this one sucks</li>
            <li> Dose Everything I Want It To, Best one I&#x27;ve Ever Had &amp; I&#x27;m 70 Years Old......So I&#x27;ve Had My Shear Of Them.</li>
            <li> My husband has only had the Norelco 1160CXX SensoTouch 2d Shaver for a few weeks, but he said it&#x27;s the best electric shaver that he has owned.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and simple operate.  He gets a shave that rivals a traditional razor blade shave.  He is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves well.  I have tried a foil razor in the past and did not like it for my face. I have had several Philips three head razors in the past and they all worked better for me than the foil. This one has been better than all previous.  I can get a close shave without having to push the stubble up with my free hand like I always have in the past with other razors. However, the cleaning unit quit working within six months. I wasn&#x27;t sure what was wrong and thought it might be something I had done (user error) until I read other reviews that described exactly my problem. Others that have attempted to get Philips to stand behind the failed cleaning unit have been very dissatisfied. So I guess I&#x27;m just going to forget it and rinse the blades under the faucet. Very disappointed and will definitely reconsider brands for my next purchase. $100+ for a razor should yield a high quality product. My previous Philips had an excellent cleaning system. The really lousy part of this issue is the cleaning system is the only way to charge the razor by just placing it in a stand. I&#x27;ve had razors in the past that had small convenient charging stands. I wish they had included one with this razor.  9/15/14 Update to the review:  I was cleaning out my bath vanity and found the small separate charging stand that DOES come with this razor. I must have discarded it upon opening because I intended on always using the cleaning unit to clean and charge. So there is a small separate stand that the charging wire plugs into and then the razor sits on the stand. I still won&#x27;t change the rating though because the cost is too high and part of it is for the cleaning unit that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> No powerful enough and does not give you that close of a shave. My last razor was by Braun and it was a lot more powerful and offered a better shave. This was my first Phillips and my last.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my Chinese friend, since this is from Amazon which I put a lot of trust in, I didn&#x27;t unpack to check it when I received the package. I took this razor back to China directly, but until recently, my friend unpacked the package, he found out that the charger is missing. I have already came back to US and it is expensive for my friend to mail the razor back to me from China, so there is no way for me to replace or return the package. Though my friend didn&#x27;t blame me, I feel so embarrassing for giving my friend a bad gift. Feeling frustrated about the service provided here.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sweetheart for Christmas. His old one had broken and he was using regular shavers, he was accustom to the electric shavers. He loves it! Too bad it did not come with the small trimmer (the one for nose, ears and such). Overall he is happy with it!</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco razors for over 30 years.  I am very satisfied with the razor and the jet cleaning system and would recommend it to anyone who likes electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor ever!!! This is the only one I have ever Bern able to use that didn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He is very pleased with I how it works. He says shaving used to be a chore, but he actually enjoys shaving now.  It gives a smooth shave with no chaffing.  It is easy to clean.  He would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> A nice shaver.  It gives a good shave and is quiet compared to other shavers.  The jet clean system is easy to set up and use.  The travel case is a little shoddy being a thin nylon case.  For the money I would like to have seen a hard shell case to better protect the shaver when traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband, he says it offers the best shave overall from other razors he has tried. The jet clean system is nice and hassle free, but if the increased price (vs. the razor sold alone without the cleaning station) is a factor in the decision making process the razor would probably be just as good without it, the blades are very easy to manually clean. We are very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric razors before and they never came close to a blade. In fact, for the past few years I have been using Feather blades on a Merkur razor, so as blade as you can get, and this razor comes close to that. It beats what I used to get with 3 and 4 blade replacement heads like the Mach series, and being able to use it wet or dry is great. Only had it about 2 weeks and I love it. The Jet Cleaner is really nice too, razor always smells fresh and is ready to go when I want to use it. Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present and my husband loves it.  Gives a great shave, easy to clean.  Does the job!</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day for work since I have thick and dark stubble. This thing pretty much eliminates all the razor burn I used to get from my &amp;#34;electric razor,&amp;#34; and it makes my face feel like I never hit puberty. If you can afford it, get the model above this one (with the docking station) since it is supposed to have a blade design that gets a better shave with fewer strokes.</li>
            <li> Product motor won&#x27;t allow it to move far enough to self clean. Hoping it&#x27;s just a fluke with the one I received, waiting on the replacement to come in</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high quality electric razor and I found it.  This blew my mind when I used it, gentle shaving and does a great job. The self cleaning station is amazing as I can hit a button and it will be clean for my next use.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer Norelco shavers because I have had good luck with them in the past. The foil covers on foil razors are too delicate and I always seem to have bad luck with them.   Pros of this shaver:  *cleaning system works great (Its not TOO big at all, please).   *Works great with wet shave/shave gel  *battery life is great  *sleek and adjusts to many contours of face  Cons of this shaver:  *dry shave is average at best  *price  *cleaning liquid replacement  Time I have owned (~ 3 weeks)  *I am a grad student so I shave every few days and let the stubble come out nice...I found that dry shaving this shaver is average or subpar at best. However, with a wet shave it is excellent! I keep a razor handy for any cleanup but this shaver performs well. I use gillette shaving foam. When Im done I rinse off the razor head and plop it in the cleaning system.   NOTE: I was reading the manual on how to insert the shaver into the system. I almost used brute force to pull back the cradle that holds the shaver. I thought it was stuck. Then I thought it was a defect. YOU HAVE TO PLUG IN THE CRADLE before it will rest in proper position (automatically moves). I wish the instructions stated this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
            <li> Good, fast, good quality, easy to use, design is also in place, then the price is very cheap，i like it</li>
            <li> It is OK, but I not so good. Next time I will try Panasionc.</li>
            <li> This thing is overrated and overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very little beard on my face, and it takes forever to take them out! you have to keep making circular motion over and over again.  there is always few hairs gets left out and when you try to take out those few individual hairs, this razor just doesn&#x27;t grab it.  Very frustrated, and not to mention you have to clean it.  replace the head every year or so, that&#x27;s 40 bucks every year you have to spend, geez. Phillips company knows how to make money.</li>
            <li> My second in 8 years.  Follow cleaning and maintenance instructions.  They work great.</li>
            <li> Did not shave my husbands beard as good as a normal blade razor.</li>
            <li> I recently, on Oct 17th, bought this product online, and brought it to Peru (Lima) as a gift to my boyfriend. When he wanted to use it for the second time he realized the battery was not working anymore and went to a Phillips authorized service center nearby (Local Address: Av.José Gálvez Barrenechea 1085 San Borja - Email: servicio@nikkeiservice.com) but they replied saying that the warranty does not apply because it&#x27;s a Norelco product,&lt;br /&gt;I don´t get it because the name of the product is Philips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System, how can it doesn&#x27;t belong to the Phillips product family then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please your kindly help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silvia Turin</li>
            <li> This was a fathers day present and it arrived deader than disco.  Not impressed at all, which is surprising because my father and I always bought Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> Never really worked right.. cleaning function lasted six months. Now the razor wont even charge</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Does what it was designed to do and does it extremely well! Extremely close and comfortable shave. Trimmer attachment does well also. Really like the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the Philips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System.     The best part of this shaver is the flexible pivoting head, the lightweight, and the grip which fits so nicely in my hands.  I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 12 years now and my existing shaver is the Norelco Spectra from 2003. This new Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch is a nice upgrade except for one advantage the Spectra had, which was the ability to switch between Sensitive or Normal level cutting.    Shaver: The shaver is well-built and tough. It is light in weight, fits in the palm of my hand very nicely and I can maneuver it smoothly and easily.  It is able to clear all hairs on my face, and about 80% of the hairs on my neck.  So it handles well on curves thanks to the flexible head.  There is no rotary electric shaver that cleans my neck completely. The shaver does an excellent job of cutting.    The Shaver only works wirelessly. It must be charged on its included stand. You cannot connect the power plug directly to the Shaver and use it while it is charging. Charge time is about 1 to 2 hours.    Battery: The Shaver takes about an hour to charge, and it lasted me for 5 weeks, with 2 shaves per week (10 shaves) before I had to recharge.  I have a lot of facial hair, and it is coarse. For people with light facial hair, I expect the battery to last about 18 shaves without recharging.      Cleaning: The top part of the heads pops off and you can clean out the hair reservoir manually.  The cleaning solution and Jet Clean System works well to rid the shaver of hair by shaking it very quickly. Only use the Jet Clean once every two or three weeks since manually cleaning it does a decent enough job.    Attachments: The rotary head pops off easily and you can snap on the straight edge razor for shaping beards and sideburns. The straight edge works quite well.  I don&#x27;t use it often since I clean shave and use tweezers or a regular razor to shape the sideburns.     Ifyou are looking for a new rotary shaver that will accomplish whatever you need, this shaver is excellent.  4.5 out of 5. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband says it gives him a very smooth shave. Also very slimlined. He would highly recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works well. Annoying having to switch the heads for the trimmer. Preferred the old popup method.</li>
            <li> Good quality shaver. When I used the shaver for the first time I was impressed. It took very little effort gave a nice close smooth shave just let the shaver do the work for you. The charging time was quick less than an hour to charge. The shaver is ultra lite and looks cool does everything you would expect from a good quality shaver at a great price cheers :-)</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband because he kept talking about it and wanted to try it so bad. He loved it! Used it and it worked great, his face was so smooth, a day later he got crazy razor bumps...:( He had to stop using it but wants to wait and maybe try again as he liked the feel of his skin after his first shave.</li>
            <li> razor and cleaning system great. detachable trimmer leaves a lot to be desired, poor design on a well thought out razor. its like bolting a brass horn on a fine stringed instrument, usable but not very functionable. paying that much for a razor i expect a trimmer that does&#x27;nt look and feel like a 50 cent add on.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco rotaries for the past 30 years. I tried foils and other rotaries but the best for the money is this one the 1160XCC. Not the highest model but right in the middle of the Norelco line up in my opinion. I use this as a wet shaver with foam shaving cream and it is extremely comfortable shave. And I have a tough beard. The older Norelco&#x27;s had a 9 adjustment blade depth. These newer units don&#x27;t have that adjustment any more but this 1160X shaves just as close as the older units and more comfortable. I use the Jet Clean System every day and the shaver is just like the day I got it. Because the Jet Clean System charges the shaver everytime you use it, I don&#x27;t know how long the shaver can go between charges. But my past experience with Norelco rechargeable shavers is that they would hold a charge for me 2 1/2 to 3 weeks. The cleaning fluid for the Jet Clean System can be pricey, but there are some good deals on it with online retailers. I would have given this system a 5 if it were not for that.&lt;br /&gt;This is probably one of the best Norelco&#x27;s I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this razor again. I bought it for my husband birthday and it didn&#x27;t work well from the beginning especially if you use it without shaving cream. It stopped working after 2 months.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t get a close shave with an electric.  Despite the ratings, this is no better or worse than any other electric I&#x27;ve used.  I would not use it before going into the office as the shave is not close or complete enough.  It is good for a quick clean up on a Saturday morning if you don&#x27;t want a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 15 year old son is now using this for his righteous &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I Love this thing!  It&#x27;s a good shave and the self cleaning option is great!  you will have to change cleaning solution at least twice a month, you can buy them walmart etc...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shaving cream and razor for at least 35 years and decided to try a Norelco because blades are just too darn expensive.  This gives me a close shave and is so easy to use.  Where have you been all these years, Norelco?</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. This razor is one of the best we have purchased lately. Everything is OK with this product and it can be a great present.</li>
            <li> The new Norelco Senso Touch 2D and the Jet Cleaner are well worth the money shave a lot better than my old one.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  I like that the battery last a long time so I don&#x27;t have to keep re-charging ofter.  The shave is much better than any of the other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past but it has trouble getting the hairs around the neck -- in comparison the $60 norelco razor I was using before this one did a better job in the same area but not as close shave as this one.  As a result of this razor having difficulty around the neck, I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple of times although nothing bad.  I still have to use another electric razor to really get a close shave, so definitely don&#x27;t plan on making this your only razor if you like a close shave and this razor has difficulty if the hair is too long.  Overall, I&#x27;ll probably look for something else when it comes time to replace this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Phillips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Razor with Jet clean system for my husband as a gift.  It came packaged well and shipped very quickly.  My husband is extremely please with it!</li>
            <li> Does very well if you clean the unit every day.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Great product.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend bought this shaver for me. It gives a fantastic close shave. Can be used with or without shaving cream or pre shave. Great charge capacity. The Jet Clean System is really cool. Works very well and charges at the same time. I can see that the Jet Clean solution might be a hassle to order. [[ASIN:B003V32UE2 Philips Norelco 1160XCC SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System]] I have been using Norelco shavers for years, this new style is much better than anything I had used before. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Clean shaver!!! Lighter with same gusto!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a good clean shave. It takes forever to go round and round with this razor and still my beard is not shaved.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor, it was missing two parts out of the box, I contacted Philips and they are sending them to me. He was able to use the razor without the missing parts, it was the protective cap and cleaning brush. Other than that it seems to be working great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phillips products for the past 13 years or so. I have purchsed do far 3 shaving machines which were excellent.  This is the latest thst I bought, it is really amaxing.</li>
            <li> good&lt;br /&gt;exellent&lt;br /&gt;nice&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean...&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean...&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried a number of razors—any number of traditional ones-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  All of them irritate my skin to some degree and leave razor bumps (Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of our course naturally curly hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a (1) week search I settled on the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x Electric Shaver w/ Jet Clean System (Norelco SensoTouch 1160x).  Why: extremely good reviews, reasonable price, three rotating blades, and attractive design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco SensoTouch 1160x at first failed to shave as closely as I’d like.  Because I have dry skin shaving without lotion can severely flack my skin, making aftershave lotion a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I have found that washing my face with hot water before I shave improves the experience immensely, as does shaving in the shower—yes the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x can do that.  You can also use shaving gel with the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it twice)  and Its hard to gauge how effective the shaver was being in clipping my hair closely.  And one of the reasons I use an electric shaver is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fine print, Philips does state that it might take upwards to a week of continual shaving for your face to get used to the unit, and that was my experience.  My first shave left me profoundly disappointed, but I was determined to stick with it, so I went the full week, shaving my head and face every day and by day four the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x was shaving much closer until by day seven the shaver was now as good as my now deceased Advantage 7735x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jet Clean System is an all-in-one unit in that it both cleans the shaver and charges it.  A single bottle of cleaning solution ships with the shaver; a replacement bottle cost around $7.65 and is enough to fill up the unit’s reservoir with ¼ of a bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system works thusly: you place the shaver into the cradle upside down, plug the Jet Clean System unit in and turn it on.  The shaver is slowly lowered into the cleaning reservoir (it attaches to the bottom of the unit) and turns the shaver on, spinning the blades in cycles until they are clean.  The process takes up to 30 minutes to complete and when done, the shaver is the raised so it can dry.  Once the drying cycle is complete, the razor will charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x ship with a separate charging stand, you can place the shaver into the Jet Clean System just to charge it.  A full charge can last me a week if I shaver every other day for about 10 minutes which is my normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned four other Norelco electric shavers, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X up to this point has been the Advantage 5655.  I am happy to report that with the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x I have a keeper.  On balance I am very satisfied with the stylish unit, so much so that I have given serious thought to purchasing another shaver as a hot standby when the current shaver decides to stop working!  At least then I would have an electric shaver I KNOW will work with my skin and give the shave I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of you are looking for a well-designed, efficient, affordable electric shaver, the Norelco SensoTouch 1160x.and is enough to fill up the unit’s reservoir with ¼ of a bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system works thusly: you place the shaver into the cradle upside down, plug the Jet Clean System unit in and turn it on.

            <li> Bought for my dad on Fathers Day.......He immediately open and use that seem night. Came well package and works great.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this electric shaver even though I&#x27;ve had terrible electric experiences in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after the month &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; period, I like it. It gets the job done quickly and should be cheaper in the long haul than the blades I was using. Its surprisingly close on everything but the neck and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lack of irritation is huge, since that&#x27;s why I stopped using my cheapo electric in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to use a disposable razor for cleanup on my neck if I let it grow too long. If I keep up with daily shaves, its fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is nice, but not really needed IMO. The cleaning cycle takes a long time and it seems to go through the cleaning liquid pretty quickly. After moving and a vacation, I found myself using the brush and manually cleaning it. If given the choice of getting this kit with the base or getting the 3D model without a base, I&#x27;d get the 3D model.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend reported it didn&#x27;t really cut all the hair off his face, not such a close shave. Item seems to work fine just not as close of a shave as we expected.</li>
            <li> Started off good purchased it in November its January and the washing tank stopped working I called the Philips Co. they said they will send me a new one</li>
            <li> My new razor glides freely over my face, leaving clean tracks behind it, although removing the blades from its holder for cleaning is somewhat cumbersome.</li>
            <li> This thing does its job fine as well as charges the razor. The cleaning solution is the expensive part. But it really does clean the razor thoroughly so I can&#x27;t complain. I like how it kind of seems to have a mind of its own too... you&#x27;ll see what I mean when you tell it to clean.</li>
            <li> A gift for my husband. He is in the process of learning how to use and clean the razor. He is very happy about receiving this razor. It was recommended by our daughter whose husband has one and highly recommended it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> it is a good shaver and I have been using it for long time. this is just a update. The old one is still in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> Ok, but I wish to have a closer shave.</li>
            <li> My job always has me on my toes, requiring me to leave where I live at a moments notice. Whenever that happens I take this razor on the go, and it always does a great job!</li>
            <li> good one, so many stuff</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch 2D It&#x27;s ok,i have use it ,it&#x27;s easy to use ,i hope it&#x27;s good for a long time</li>
            <li> Already did a review on this item.  It is great works perfect and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco finally gave up do I purchased this model to replace.  The new model works just the same (works well).  I did expect there to be more advancements from my old one to the new, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any outside of the cleaning base.  I probably could have saved money and got a lower price razor and not noticed much difference.  That said, I like the razor.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor.  My husband has used Norelco for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> This the first electric razor I&#x27;ve had in over 50 years.  It is hot tip</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my father for Christmas and he read the instructions that night and was using it the next day. He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father as birthday gifts. My father finds this is really soft and the two head(I do not know how to express it ...) is really useful.</li>
