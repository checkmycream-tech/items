            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is OK.  </li>
            <li>Since it can be a regular brush and a styling brush all in one it is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>It eliminates one more item to carry.</li>
            <li>bought this brush on impulse; wish all my impulses had such a happy ending!  </li>
            <li>: &gt; )</li>
            <li>I have bought more brushes over the years in search of one perfect for my hair, and finally, this one is it.</li>
            <li>We love this brush.</li>
            <li>because everytime I use it I am thinking to my self that I need to look for a better brush....</li>
            <li>It goes right through my tangles and ends without much effort and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Great travel product because you don&#x27;t need to bring 2 different brushes.</li>
            <li>It seems gentle on my hair while doing the job to style it nicely...</li>
            <li>I found that the flat part of the buush works great for straightening hair.</li>
            <li>I got my first Conair 2 in 1 brush free with the purchase of a Conair styling appliance and immediately fell in love with it --</li>
            <li>It has the bristle density of a more traditional brush, but it is more easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special...</li>
            <li>so much so, that I ordered to more.  </li>
            <li>And it shipped to my door quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with several features:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it mostly as a flat brush, but I&#x27;m very pleased and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Brush design is nice, however the plastic is kinda rough in spots.  </li>
            <li>this is really turning out to be a decent brush, light in my hand which is nice because I have small hands.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long, curly, wavy, and hard to manage and this is the best brush ever!  </li>
            <li>For some reason this brush really works well when drying hair.</li>
            <li>The micro bristles really keep your hair tamed and in control.</li>
            <li>although it works well as a normal straight brush..</li>
            <li>It has taller, plastic-tipped bristles to help detangle and shorter, more traditional bristles to actually comb through all the hair on one&#x27;s head--</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this I was expecting a simple brush, nothing fancy, but I was surprised by how cool this brush is.</li>
            <li>Easy to change from round to straight.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new hairbrush and spotted this Conair 2 in 1 brush while I was browsing.  </li>
            <li>It does convert from a large flat brush to a rounded brush in seconds, making it really a 2-in-1 brush--great!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>(Put it in the \\&quot;round\\&quot; position, and there is easy access to the trapped</li>
            <li>Its working well with my hear so far...</li>
            <li>Just make sure you press the button to switch it from a flat brush to a round brush.</li>
            <li>so we replaced it with the same cause its awesome on thick and thin hair.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally</li>

            <li> I let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> It also has a flat position.  </li>
            <li> The bristles do not grab the hair so I cannot dry it properly</li>
            <li> The switch (between roller and flat) is very loose</li>
            <li> I reverted back to my regular round brush for drying my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, but not what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely no way helpful to use as round brush..</li>
            <li> basically because it&#x27;s rough plastic in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Round or flat, a brush is a brush is a brush if you are semi-talented.  </li>
            <li> With the press of a button the sides fold down and it becomes something like a circular brush, one that adds some body while you&#x27;re blow drying.</li>
            <li> I keep it at half round and it works well to straighten the hair while drying probably because there&#x27;s holes that the air can get thru.</li>
            <li> and then you can fold the sides in for a half round brush.</li>
            <li> round part made my hair staticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit cumbersome to use and heavy, but as the caption says it does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This pulled out a lot of my hair in very little time.</li>
            <li> I usually dont buy these things online</li>
            <li> This brush is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> my review was too negative.....</li>
            <li> If you think that this brush will replace your round brush then you are wrong...</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to anyone who has a problem with weak hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the thin bristers are falling off already.  </li>
            <li> with no fly away problems, or snapping of hair.  </li>
            <li> sadly it was not the case with this brush..</li>
            <li> The plastic design features an airy base which lets the blast from a hair-dryer penetrate, cutting drying time for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know about others but to me this product smells horrible</li>

            <li> Great all purpose brush. I can now take this one when I travel, instead of packng three others. This brush is getting hard to find. I&#x27;m worried that it may be discontinued.</li>
            <li> For some reason this brush really works well when drying hair. I like that you can change the shape. I keep it at half round and it works well to straighten the hair while drying probably because there&#x27;s holes that the air can get thru.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush.  It has two positions, one where the brush is more curved shape and then you can fold the sides in for a half round brush. The bristles are nice, not the plastic pointed kind, but they are some kind of plastic like material.  Very nice design.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes. Just make sure you press the button to switch it from a flat brush to a round brush.</li>
            <li> Nice works well good brush</li>
            <li> Nothing special...I reverted back to my regular round brush for drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I found that the flat part of the buush works great for straightening hair. round part made my hair staticky.</li>
            <li> Great travel product because you don&#x27;t need to bring 2 different brushes.</li>
            <li> I usually dont buy these things online but I had a gift card and I broke my hair brush that same day so I went for it. Best brush ever ! The micro bristles really keep your hair tamed and in control. It was so good, my mom took mine away so I had to buy another one. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Easy to change from round to straight.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know about others but to me this product smells horrible, I had to wash my face after 10 minutes of applying it. I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.</li>
            <li> This brush is OK.  It&#x27;s lightweight, but not what I had expected.  The bristles do not grab the hair so I cannot dry it properly</li>
            <li> This is my second Conair Brush.  Since it can be a regular brush and a styling brush all in one it is perfect for traveling. It eliminates one more item to carry.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new hairbrush and spotted this Conair 2 in 1 brush while I was browsing.  $5.00 seemed a good price, so I bought it.  I&#x27;m very pleased with several features:&lt;br /&gt;  1.  It has the bristle density of a more traditional brush, but it is more easily cleaned.

It has taller, plastic-tipped bristles to help detangle and shorter, more traditional bristles to actually comb through all the hair on one&#x27;s head--feels so good!&lt;br /&gt;  3.  It does convert from a large flat brush to a rounded brush in seconds, making it really a 2-in-1 brush--great!&lt;br /&gt;  4.  The plastic design features an airy base which lets the blast from a hair-dryer penetrate, cutting drying time for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush on impulse; wish all my impulses had such a happy ending!  : &gt; )</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I was expecting a simple brush, nothing fancy, but I was surprised by how cool this brush is. With the press of a button the sides fold down and it becomes something like a circular brush, one that adds some body while you&#x27;re blow drying. Really good for the price and it seems to be sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> This pulled out a lot of my hair in very little time. I would not recommend to anyone who has a problem with weak hair.</li>
            <li> This brush works as advertised, though I don&#x27;t see the point of it.  Round or flat, a brush is a brush is a brush if you are semi-talented.  It&#x27;s a bit cumbersome to use and heavy, but as the caption says it does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you think that this brush will replace your round brush then you are wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely no way helpful to use as round brush.. i tried multiple times... although it works well as a normal straight brush..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reason, i purchases it was to get 2 in 1 brush.. sadly it was not the case with this brush..</li>
            <li> I got my first Conair 2 in 1 brush free with the purchase of a Conair styling appliance and immediately fell in love with it -- so much so, that I ordered to more.  It has a good grip, is easy to handle and does not tear my hair out.  I let my hair dry naturally so I don&#x27;t know how it is for blow drying your hair.  I&#x27;m using it mostly as a flat brush, but I&#x27;m very pleased and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, curly, wavy, and hard to manage and this is the best brush ever!  It goes right through my tangles and ends without much effort and does a great job.  I have bought more brushes over the years in search of one perfect for my hair, and finally, this one is it.</li>
            <li> Its working well with my hear so far...and it does not rip my hair out, it also keeps frizz locked.</li>
            <li> The switch (between roller and flat) is very loose so it won&#x27;t stay in the roller position.  Also, the thin bristers are falling off already.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> We love this brush. We had one for a couple years and it finally broke so we replaced it with the same cause its awesome on thick and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Brush design is nice, however the plastic is kinda rough in spots.  It does have nice air flow for styling.  I just leave it in curved position al the time.  It also has a flat position.  Simple to change positions and it does hold in the position....I thought it wouldn&#x27;t because of the plastic nature of the brush.  Two stars because everytime I use it I am thinking to my self that I need to look for a better brush....basically because it&#x27;s rough plastic in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/27/2013.....my review was too negative.....this is really turning out to be a decent brush, light in my hand which is nice because I have small hands.  It&#x27;s holding up well, the lock mechanism stays in place always. It seems gentle on my hair while doing the job to style it nicely...with no fly away problems, or snapping of hair.  If you are thinking of getting one at Amazon&#x27;s great price..don&#x27;t hesitate.  And it shipped to my door quick.</li>
            <li> Not what I was wanting. I was wanting a regular brush but i like it alot</li>
