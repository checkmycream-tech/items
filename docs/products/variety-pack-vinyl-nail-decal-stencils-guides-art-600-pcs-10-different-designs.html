            <li>The condition &amp; assortment is great.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>awesome products, thanks</li>
            <li>When I received these vinyls, I was very pleased with them; the quality was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>But I got most of what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Im so truly satisfied...</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed using the decals on my customers</li>
            <li>I find them cute, easy to use and work so well on my nails.</li>
            <li>The glue is really strong</li>
            <li>Which is fine....</li>
            <li>but I will just have to order more ;-)</li>
            <li>but if you have to cut your nails and regrow for some reason or another, I don&#x27;t see why these can&#x27;t work with short nails to, seeing that mine are not to long to begin with, lol!</li>
            <li>I suggest you get some and have fun.</li>
            <li>Not what was described or worth the money</li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought some higher quality ones.</li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>My real rate  -40...</li>
            <li>I am really liking these</li>
            <li>They sent me a whole set plus the amount of vinyls</li>
            <li>The designs are absolutely nothing pictures or described.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get straight lines.</li>
            <li>but they tear in half VERY easily.</li>
            <li>other wise using after polish thinking its dried thru will result in</li>
            <li>Injustice recieved these today, almost a week early so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>I purchased this 6 days ago and have received 2 stencil packets so far.</li>
            <li>Prints are different from the pictures and some designs were to big to even look right on my nails</li>
            <li>Not much of a variety but pretty kool still</li>
            <li>I only received ones that might work on my big toe to look decent.</li>
            <li>Like for the one that is supposed to perform polka dots, not all (only like 3 MAX) of the inner circles stay on the paper so when you peel it off completely.....</li>
            <li>As another customer said they were disappointed about the selection she got, as for me also no straight lines and most are not set design that would be professional, or even look right at all.</li>

            <li> As for the other designs it&#x27;s the same thing and for the zigzag pattern they all stuck together.</li>
            <li> Now my nails are a little above the pads of my fingers</li>
            <li> wait for a day after polish is completely dried thru in order to use these things the next day</li>
            <li> Also, the ones that don&#x27;t have either of those problems,  when you peel it off your mail it brings some of the other nail polish with it or it just rips and you have to start all over.</li>
            <li> I myself will not ever order another set like this due to wasting the money and wont be using them.</li>
            <li> Very sad because it wasn&#x27;t  cheap.</li>
            <li> When I opened the pack up the sets were a lot smaller than I had anticipated and hard to see where to peel them apart.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it ruined half of those sheets.</li>
            <li> But then I noticed a pack was missing, so I contacted the seller.</li>
            <li> I received very little for the price.</li>
            <li> buy no more.</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t buy these again when they run out :/</li>
            <li> I was missing!</li>
            <li> I only got weird ones.</li>
            <li> You get very little and they are difficult to work with because they are extremely sticky.</li>
            <li> however I assumed I would get at least some that were pictured.</li>
            <li> it doesnt wirk n buy that I mean these things are not to be used after polish youd have to polish then</li>
            <li> I spent over thirty dollars on crap like this not worth it.</li>
            <li> Me too so disappointed  ,,the styles are different of that one in pictures</li>
            <li> For 15$ its a little disappointing</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed, definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Some are not even made for nails, just random vinyls!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very. Disappointed. My real rate  -40...none of designs show are in what I received.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it zero stars! None of the vinyls I received are the ones in the pictures. Some are not even made for nails, just random vinyls! Nor are they stencils. The glue is really strong so it pulled off polish that has been on for two hours. Very very disappointed, definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The text details tell you that you&#x27;ll get an assortment so I was nervous. But I got most of what was shown in the picture. I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase. The condition &amp; assortment is great.</li>
            <li> dont buy it doesnt wirk n buy that I mean these things are not to be used after polish youd have to polish then wait for a day after polish is completely dried thru in order to use these things the next day other wise using after polish thinking its dried thru will result in a gooey...mess n youd have to start over its rediculous .wont buy no more.I spent over thirty dollars on crap like this not worth it.</li>
            <li> Injustice recieved these today, almost a week early so that was a plus. When I opened the pack up the sets were a lot smaller than I had anticipated and hard to see where to peel them apart. Also 2 of the sets had spots where the vinyl peeled apart and stuck the sheets together and it ruined half of those sheets. For 15$ its a little disappointing and I probably won&#x27;t buy these again when they run out :/</li>
            <li> I love these! I am really liking these and I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon. I find them cute, easy to use and work so well on my nails. Now my nails are a little above the pads of my fingers but if you have to cut your nails and regrow for some reason or another, I don&#x27;t see why these can&#x27;t work with short nails to, seeing that mine are not to long to begin with, lol! I suggest you get some and have fun.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed. I didn&#x27;t receive any of the prints that are pictured. I only received ones that might work on my big toe to look decent. I will not be ordering these again. I was hoping to use these for me and my daughter but that will not be possible due to the size and prints.</li>
            <li> I never post reviews because I always forget. But I just had to let the potential buyers know why I didn&#x27;t like it the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, they don&#x27;t come off the paper as a stencil. Like for the one that is supposed to perform polka dots, not all (only like 3 MAX) of the inner circles stay on the paper so when you peel it off completely..... it&#x27;s basically just a rectangle sticker. As for the other designs it&#x27;s the same thing and for the zigzag pattern they all stuck together. Which is fine.... but they tear in half VERY easily. I guess you get what you pay for. I went ahead and bought some higher quality ones. Also, the ones that don&#x27;t have either of those problems,  when you peel it off your mail it brings some of the other nail polish with it or it just rips and you have to start all over.</li>
            <li> Prints are different from the pictures and some designs were to big to even look right on my nails</li>
            <li> @aheavens_angel did it come with everything that is shown on the picture?</li>
            <li> awesome products, thanks</li>
            <li> When I received these vinyls, I was very pleased with them; the quality was fantastic! But then I noticed a pack was missing, so I contacted the seller. They sent me a whole set plus the amount of vinyls I was missing!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed. I purchased this 6 days ago and have received 2 stencil packets so far.One packet only had 1 sheet.</li>
            <li> I love these! I wish it had a bigger variety.. but I will just have to order more ;-) They look great on my nails!</li>
            <li> This suck i didn&#x27;t get the ones on the picture I want my money back !!!!</li>
            <li> As another customer said they were disappointed about the selection she got, as for me also no straight lines and most are not set design that would be professional, or even look right at all. I myself will not ever order another set like this due to wasting the money and wont be using them.</li>
            <li> Me too so disappointed  ,,the styles are different of that one in pictures</li>
            <li> Im so truly satisfied... I received my purchase earlier than expected and I really enjoyed using the decals on my customers nails👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Not much of a variety but pretty kool still</li>
            <li> Not what was described or worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. You get very little and they are difficult to work with because they are extremely sticky. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I received very little for the price.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed. If this is 600+ stickers someone needs to learn how to count. The designs are absolutely nothing pictures or described. How do I go about getting a refund bc this is crap. One of the designs looks like the Budweiser crown.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed by what I receive. I didn&#x27;t get any styles that were pictured. I knew it was going to be a mixed assortment however I assumed I would get at least some that were pictured. I didn&#x27;t even get straight lines. I only got weird ones. Very sad because it wasn&#x27;t  cheap.</li>
