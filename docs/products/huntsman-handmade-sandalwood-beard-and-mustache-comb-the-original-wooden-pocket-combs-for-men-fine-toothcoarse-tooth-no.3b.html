            <li>I received this as part of a promotional launch at a discounted rate and it was perfect because I&#x27;m in the process of growing my beard but must keep it groomed as I&#x27;m in a professional consulting role.</li>

            <li>It smells fantastic too!</li>
            <li>Second the craftsmanship is awesome!</li>
            <li>Very well made, and feels great.  </li>
            <li>better than the comb itself is the company.</li>
            <li>next to beard oil, this is the best investment you can make for your beard.</li>
            <li>Love this comb.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I found one.</li>
            <li>Incredibly satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is perfectly sized for the hubs to keep in his back pocket.</li>
            <li>This comb felt much better than any plastic comb through my beard.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been an all around enjoyable</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and smooth on my beard.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great quality.</li>
            <li>Cloth pouch could be better as mine has the stitching coming apart on the one side.</li>
            <li>but it could be more durable.</li>
            <li>Smells good and the teeth have just the right spacing for my beard.</li>
            <li>Every man with any medium to full (ZZ Top) beard should own this.</li>
            <li>Very nice high quality comb.</li>
            <li>This comb seems to be really well made and works really good</li>
            <li>This comb is SWEET!  </li>
            <li>Love the comb and the service from the company was great as well, very personal.  </li>
            <li>Love this comb well made and just looks cool</li>
            <li>Using this comb every morning after a shower and with some oil/conditioner, my beard is much more full and shapely.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Hands down the BEST mustache comb out there.</li>
            <li>I also recommend beard oil to assist in the fine beard care taking.</li>
            <li>Great product got my second comb already.</li>
            <li>This works great for applying beard oil evenly throughout the beard after washing your face or taking a shower (to open up the pores).</li>
            <li>I enjoy that.</li>
            <li>Its very manly and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Fantastic comb.</li>
            <li>The comb has a great scent which my wife loves, which is definitely a bonus.    </li>
            <li>The smell of the sandalwood is so smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;d be worth the money</li>
            <li>I had bought a plastic comb and although I enjoyed using it, it just wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>This is a great comb, it fits my hand nicely, and both the wide and fine tooth sides are useful, I use the wide side to comb out my beard and the fine tooth side to comb my beard balm or oil through it, it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really unique comb, I&#x27;ve never seen a dual sided comb like this.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel because the comb is small and comes with a carry bag.</li>
            <li>My beard looks more groomed from just brushing with it and the comb&#x27;s scent was at first</li>
            <li>was displeasing because it is an unexpected scent but now is very enjoyable to smell while I brush my beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, smells great and even comes with it&#x27;s own little carry pouch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, fast shipping from the company and loved the personally addressed emails from the founder to make sure everything is satisfactory with the comb.</li>
            <li>Best if used slowly.</li>
            <li>Finally, the comb has a very pleasant, natural scent which makes it that much more enjoyable to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It does smell amazing and it comes in a nice little pouch.</li>
            <li>Bought this comb for my boyfriend&#x27;s Birthday and received it quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it, particularly the sandalwood.</li>
            <li>the company I ordered this comb from is super down to earth and it makes me happy to do business with them.</li>
            <li>I own 2 other beard combs and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was uneasy about spending the money on a wooden comb rather than a new plastic one but man, I am so happy that I bought this comb.</li>
            <li>and I love that it comes with its own little bag to keep it in.  </li>
            <li>use coconut oil in my beard everyday, and this is a great way to evenly distribute it throughout my beard.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a deep discount for my honest &amp; unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money no doubt.</li>
            <li>The bristles work great at getting through my thick hair and the shape is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Truly happy I found this because I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about having facial hair at work</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best comb you could possibly purchase for such a task.</li>
            <li>Rarely snags.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and he would make it right.</li>
            <li>Have worn many types of beards over the last 25 years: full, circle beards, doorknockers, etc.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>a great little comb that works amazing on my beard full of curly hair - no catching or yanking.  </li>
            <li>You can tell the company cares about their products as well as their customers and it&#x27;s evident in the quality.</li>
            <li>And the smell, I personally really love the smell of the wooden comb.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I received this comb was how well built it was.</li>
            <li>;  I would personally challenge any negative review...this comb is the best.  </li>
            <li>Really nice quality and love the smell, love it, can&#x27;t seem to put it down for long, constantly combing beard while watching TV</li>
            <li>Very cool, quality wooden comb for maintaining your beard.</li>
            <li>Watching my hubby with his first stroke through his beard with this new beard comb, I knew I had made the right choice in getting this for him.</li>
            <li>Pure awesomeness.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone needing a fine comb for your moustache and facial hair.....</li>
            <li>Fine quality comb and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Very high Quality.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Also comes with its own little storage pouch.</li>
            <li>The smell of the Sandalwood is also very pleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>and they work real well</li>
            <li>Such a smooth feel -</li>
            <li>It really ruined the shape.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>you can really see the work they put in to this comb</li>
            <li>The fragrant sandalwood imparts an ethereal woodsy scent to my beard and really distributes the oil each time I use it.</li>
            <li>Really doesnt snag your hair like the plastic combs.</li>
            <li>My beard thanks you.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>from real wood?</li>
            <li>so very well crafted.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use the pouch anyhow</li>
            <li>First of all it came 4 days early!</li>
            <li>Glides through my beard without any snags and has seemed to help with frizzy, unruly hair due to lack of static from the wood</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that this one didn&#x27;t have that, and it was extremely well finished, I don&#x27;t know if thats because of the sandalwood</li>
            <li>The material is nice, and the small bag it comes in is very convenient for carrying it around.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it to anyone that wants their beard to look well</li>
            <li>Before purchasing and using this comb, my beard hairs would sort of come together and form a big super curl in an area.</li>
            <li>Not only was it different than my previously-purchased plastic comb; it had better ratings.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this comb and the seller...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this huntsmandbeardco product for anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all of my bearded brethren</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li>It fits in my front pocket, but I normally just carry it in in my backpack.</li>
            <li>I am going to order a few more for my brothers</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve noticed that since there are teeth on both sides I can actually twirl the comb in my beard (against the curl) to straighten the curlier hairs out.</li>
            <li>He first uses a few droplets of beard oil to smooth his beard.</li>
            <li>Just got this a few days ago tried it, love it.</li>
            <li>I am new to the beard world and of beardsmanship, so I did a lot of research in the realm of hygiene.</li>
            <li>The comb is very well made and feels very solid.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the craftsmanship of the comb.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the comb with one side that has fine teeth and the other side that has bigger teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever take it in my pocket but just because I&#x27;d be afraid of  breaking such a beautiful comb.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth to the touch, durable enough to be carried around, small and compact enough to be stored, and it&#x27;s exactly what anyone needs in a beard comb.</li>
            <li>I love how wood combs don&#x27;t cause static and don&#x27;t snag my hair, but I&#x27;ve bought other wooden combs in the past and they have had little bits of wood sticking out, almost like splinters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Huntsman offers a beard oil as well that I purchased at the same time as this Comb during a discounted promo offer.</li>
            <li>This comb is fantastic, seriously.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this comb to other people looking for a solid beard comb</li>
            <li>Great beard comb, very solid and sturdy feeling and doesn&#x27;t have a gross artificial sandalwood smell like some other beard combs I&#x27;ve bought off amazon.</li>
            <li>Currently wear medium sideburns and full thick circle beard tapering back on jawline.</li>

            <li> I received this as part of a promotional launch at a discounted rate and it was perfect because I&#x27;m in the process of growing my beard but must keep it groomed as I&#x27;m in a professional consulting role.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes his beard look and it smells really nice too.  </li>

            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Would buy more products from this company.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic too!</li>
            <li> Second the craftsmanship is awesome!</li>
            <li> Very well made, and feels great.  </li>
            <li> better than the comb itself is the company.</li>
            <li> next to beard oil, this is the best investment you can make for your beard.</li>
            <li> Love this comb.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I found one.</li>
            <li> Incredibly satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is perfectly sized for the hubs to keep in his back pocket.</li>
            <li> This comb felt much better than any plastic comb through my beard.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been an all around enjoyable</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and smooth on my beard.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great quality.</li>
            <li> Cloth pouch could be better as mine has the stitching coming apart on the one side.</li>
            <li> but it could be more durable.</li>
            <li> Smells good and the teeth have just the right spacing for my beard.</li>
            <li> Every man with any medium to full (ZZ Top) beard should own this.</li>
            <li> Very nice high quality comb.</li>
            <li> This comb seems to be really well made and works really good</li>
            <li> This comb is SWEET!  </li>
            <li> Love the comb and the service from the company was great as well, very personal.  </li>
            <li> Love this comb well made and just looks cool</li>
            <li> Using this comb every morning after a shower and with some oil/conditioner, my beard is much more full and shapely.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Hands down the BEST mustache comb out there.</li>
            <li> I also recommend beard oil to assist in the fine beard care taking.</li>
            <li> Great product got my second comb already.</li>
            <li> This works great for applying beard oil evenly throughout the beard after washing your face or taking a shower (to open up the pores).</li>
            <li> I enjoy that.</li>
            <li> Its very manly and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic comb.</li>
            <li> The comb has a great scent which my wife loves, which is definitely a bonus.    </li>
            <li> The smell of the sandalwood is so smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;d be worth the money</li>
            <li> I had bought a plastic comb and although I enjoyed using it, it just wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb, it fits my hand nicely, and both the wide and fine tooth sides are useful, I use the wide side to comb out my beard and the fine tooth side to comb my beard balm or oil through it, it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really unique comb, I&#x27;ve never seen a dual sided comb like this.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel because the comb is small and comes with a carry bag.</li>
            <li> My beard looks more groomed from just brushing with it and the comb&#x27;s scent was at first</li>
            <li> was displeasing because it is an unexpected scent but now is very enjoyable to smell while I brush my beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, smells great and even comes with it&#x27;s own little carry pouch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, fast shipping from the company and loved the personally addressed emails from the founder to make sure everything is satisfactory with the comb.</li>
            <li> Best if used slowly.</li>
            <li> Finally, the comb has a very pleasant, natural scent which makes it that much more enjoyable to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It does smell amazing and it comes in a nice little pouch.</li>
            <li> Bought this comb for my boyfriend&#x27;s Birthday and received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it, particularly the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> the company I ordered this comb from is super down to earth and it makes me happy to do business with them.</li>
            <li> I own 2 other beard combs and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was uneasy about spending the money on a wooden comb rather than a new plastic one but man, I am so happy that I bought this comb.</li>
            <li> and I love that it comes with its own little bag to keep it in.  </li>
            <li> use coconut oil in my beard everyday, and this is a great way to evenly distribute it throughout my beard.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a deep discount for my honest &amp; unbiased review.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money no doubt.</li>
            <li> The bristles work great at getting through my thick hair and the shape is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Truly happy I found this because I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about having facial hair at work</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best comb you could possibly purchase for such a task.</li>
            <li> Rarely snags.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and he would make it right.</li>
            <li> Have worn many types of beards over the last 25 years: full, circle beards, doorknockers, etc.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> a great little comb that works amazing on my beard full of curly hair - no catching or yanking.  </li>
            <li> You can tell the company cares about their products as well as their customers and it&#x27;s evident in the quality.</li>
            <li> And the smell, I personally really love the smell of the wooden comb.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I received this comb was how well built it was.</li>
            <li> ;  I would personally challenge any negative review...this comb is the best.  </li>
            <li> Really nice quality and love the smell, love it, can&#x27;t seem to put it down for long, constantly combing beard while watching TV</li>
            <li> Very cool, quality wooden comb for maintaining your beard.</li>
            <li> Watching my hubby with his first stroke through his beard with this new beard comb, I knew I had made the right choice in getting this for him.</li>
            <li> Pure awesomeness.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone needing a fine comb for your moustache and facial hair.....</li>
            <li> Fine quality comb and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very high Quality.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Also comes with its own little storage pouch.</li>
            <li> The smell of the Sandalwood is also very pleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> and they work real well</li>
            <li> Such a smooth feel -</li>
            <li> It really ruined the shape.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> you can really see the work they put in to this comb</li>
            <li> The fragrant sandalwood imparts an ethereal woodsy scent to my beard and really distributes the oil each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Really doesnt snag your hair like the plastic combs.</li>
            <li> My beard thanks you.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> from real wood?</li>
            <li> so very well crafted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use the pouch anyhow</li>
            <li> First of all it came 4 days early!</li>
            <li> Glides through my beard without any snags and has seemed to help with frizzy, unruly hair due to lack of static from the wood</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that this one didn&#x27;t have that, and it was extremely well finished, I don&#x27;t know if thats because of the sandalwood</li>
            <li> The material is nice, and the small bag it comes in is very convenient for carrying it around.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend it to anyone that wants their beard to look well</li>
            <li> Before purchasing and using this comb, my beard hairs would sort of come together and form a big super curl in an area.</li>
            <li> Not only was it different than my previously-purchased plastic comb; it had better ratings.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this comb and the seller...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this huntsmandbeardco product for anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for all of my bearded brethren</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> It fits in my front pocket, but I normally just carry it in in my backpack.</li>
            <li> I am going to order a few more for my brothers</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve noticed that since there are teeth on both sides I can actually twirl the comb in my beard (against the curl) to straighten the curlier hairs out.</li>
            <li> He first uses a few droplets of beard oil to smooth his beard.</li>
            <li> Just got this a few days ago tried it, love it.</li>
            <li> I am new to the beard world and of beardsmanship, so I did a lot of research in the realm of hygiene.</li>
            <li> The comb is very well made and feels very solid.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the craftsmanship of the comb.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the comb with one side that has fine teeth and the other side that has bigger teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever take it in my pocket but just because I&#x27;d be afraid of  breaking such a beautiful comb.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth to the touch, durable enough to be carried around, small and compact enough to be stored, and it&#x27;s exactly what anyone needs in a beard comb.</li>
            <li> I love how wood combs don&#x27;t cause static and don&#x27;t snag my hair, but I&#x27;ve bought other wooden combs in the past and they have had little bits of wood sticking out, almost like splinters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Huntsman offers a beard oil as well that I purchased at the same time as this Comb during a discounted promo offer.</li>
            <li> This comb is fantastic, seriously.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this comb to other people looking for a solid beard comb</li>
            <li> Great beard comb, very solid and sturdy feeling and doesn&#x27;t have a gross artificial sandalwood smell like some other beard combs I&#x27;ve bought off amazon.</li>
            <li> Currently wear medium sideburns and full thick circle beard tapering back on jawline.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and fits well into my carry-on essentials and the aroma that the brush gives off really is addicting.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, thick and durable.</li>
            <li> Small enough to keep in the back of your pocket or throw in with the rest of your toiletries for a trip.</li>
            <li> so you know this is not a cheap piece of wood but will last a long time without a lot of fuss.</li>
            <li> Got the order quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Always used a regular pocket comb with no real complaints to groom it, but the Huntsman IS the Rolls-Royce of beard combs!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a few other people in mind that will be getting these as gifts.  </li>
            <li> He looks less like a caveman.</li>
            <li> It is very durable, so you&#x27;re not going to break it by sitting down awkwardly.</li>
            <li> In the packaging was a little thank</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have worn many types of beards over the last 25 years: full, circle beards, doorknockers, etc. Currently wear medium sideburns and full thick circle beard tapering back on jawline. Always used a regular pocket comb with no real complaints to groom it, but the Huntsman IS the Rolls-Royce of beard combs!!!! Great product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I waited for ample time to use this comb in order to give a good review. Well the comb is fantastic!  It works perfectly to distribute my beard oil and comb my beard, and best of all it does not pull my beard hair. The comb smells amazing and has a nice weight and feel to it. I purchased the comb with one side that has fine teeth and the other side that has bigger teeth. I like to use the bigger teeth side to comb the longer hair of my beard (chin/goatee area) It&#x27;s a really unique comb, I&#x27;ve never seen a dual sided comb like this. It fits in my front pocket, but I normally just carry it in in my backpack. Very sturdy, thick and durable. It should definitely last. Highly recommend this comb and the seller...Huntsman Beard Co., which guarantees their products. The company founder, Luke, even sent me a personal email stating to let him know if I had any problems with the comb and he would make it right.</li>
            <li> Quality Product.  Love the smell.  Small and compact.  Would buy more products from this company.</li>
            <li> Love the comb and the service from the company was great as well, very personal.  I will be purchasing another one for travel purposes soon!</li>
            <li> Bought this comb for my boyfriend and he loves it! It smells fantastic too!</li>
            <li> I couldnâ€™t wait for this comb to get to me,  I ordered this for my nephews birthday because he has a BIG MANLY beard.  This comb is absolutely  beautiful and I love that it comes with its own little bag to keep it in.  My nephew stated that this is the best comb he has ever used on his beard!!! YAY I was so happy to hear how much he liked it, and it really did a good job combing through all that hair without any issues.  The comb itself has a nice aroma to it, itâ€™s just so MANLY!!! You canâ€™t go wrong with this comb for the man in your life that has a beard.  They will LOVE this!!! I have a few other people in mind that will be getting these as gifts.  I received this product at a deep discount for my honest &amp; unbiased review.  I always test each product before leaving my 100% honest review.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb and high quality wood!  I love it!! Great customer service and delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Really nice quality and love the smell, love it, can&#x27;t seem to put it down for long, constantly combing beard while watching TV</li>
            <li> Bought one for me and one for my son. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product got my second comb already.</li>
            <li> First of all it came 4 days early! Second the craftsmanship is awesome! I love it perfect size too. I also would like to say Luke you&#x27;re the man, great customer service . I am going to order a few more for my brothers</li>
            <li> Very cool, quality wooden comb for maintaining your beard. This works great for applying beard oil evenly throughout the beard after washing your face or taking a shower (to open up the pores). The bag it comes in is also a nice touch and good for travel, I suppose. Finally, the comb has a very pleasant, natural scent which makes it that much more enjoyable to use on a daily basis. Very good product, all things considered.</li>
            <li> a great little comb that works amazing on my beard full of curly hair - no catching or yanking.  smells great too.  Small enough to keep in the back of your pocket or throw in with the rest of your toiletries for a trip.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  It&#x27;s great for combing out a curly beard - I keep mine by the computer and just run it through it while I&#x27;m thinking or reading.  They have a pleasant odor, and are good quality - the teeth are are all smooth, even, and aligned guaranteeing I don&#x27;t get any tangles or pulls.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever take it in my pocket but just because I&#x27;d be afraid of  breaking such a beautiful comb.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve noticed that since there are teeth on both sides I can actually twirl the comb in my beard (against the curl) to straighten the curlier hairs out.</li>
            <li> Just awesome.  That&#x27;s all I have to say about it.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb, it fits my hand nicely, and both the wide and fine tooth sides are useful, I use the wide side to comb out my beard and the fine tooth side to comb my beard balm or oil through it, it works great.</li>
            <li> Very well made, and feels great.  Worth the money no doubt.</li>
            <li> The comb works great and helps untangle my beard making it softer and fluffier. The bristles work great at getting through my thick hair and the shape is comfortable to hold. The smell of the Sandalwood is also very pleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better than the comb itself is the company. In the packaging was a little thank you card that also has the company&#x27;s founder&#x27;s email address and a note saying not to  hesitate to email. When I received my comb, there were two broken teeth so I took pictures and sent them off to Luke at 7:33am EST. By 7:49, we had already sent a couple of emails back and forth, and he had confirmation of another brush to be shipped to me immediately. I found that to be a great example of customer service and I won&#x27;t hesistate to buy a Huntsman product again.</li>
            <li> next to beard oil, this is the best investment you can make for your beard. easily the best and most handy beard comb i have ever seen. i am in the habit of absentmindedly combing my beard with this while i read, talk on the phone, etc. it smells great and is quite durable. will buy another when this one starts getting some wear and tear put on it.</li>
            <li> Great Comb! Well made and makes my beard look nice, what more can you ask.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice beard comb.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two different teeth size for different thicknesses of beard.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my son because he had everything he needed except for a beard comb.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, he said it is very nice,  gets the tangles out, and helps when working the conditioner throughout his beard.&lt;br /&gt;It looks very nice now and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a promotional discount for my honest unbiased opinion,  that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve given.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone needing a fine comb for your moustache and facial hair.....Quality product</li>
            <li> Love this comb. Works well, and smells great too.</li>
            <li> This comb is fantastic, seriously. Every man with any medium to full (ZZ Top) beard should own this. The fine bristles keep hairs straight and neat along with that wonderful sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells Great!!!! Works Good. Very high Quality.</li>
            <li> I never even knew this things existed but I&#x27;m glad I found one. I received this as part of a promotional launch at a discounted rate and it was perfect because I&#x27;m in the process of growing my beard but must keep it groomed as I&#x27;m in a professional consulting role. I wish I had known it existed earlier! It&#x27;s small and fits well into my carry-on essentials and the aroma that the brush gives off really is addicting. I also use the oil from Huntsman Beard Co. and they work real well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is a bit scruffy and this combs through everything with ease. Truly happy I found this because I&#x27;ve always been self conscious about having facial hair at work but this allows me to keep a groomed look and still maintain the image I want. You can tell the company cares about their products as well as their customers and it&#x27;s evident in the quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this comb for my boyfriend&#x27;s Birthday and received it quickly. It is beautiful, and the Smell!!!! Delicious.  Boyfriend loved it and couldn&#x27;t stop raving about it, and his beard looks great too.  I would definitely recommend this comb to anyone.</li>
            <li> Awesomeness is happiness! Finding an item that truly works is tough these days, but the Huntsman Beard Comb hits bullseye one every &amp;quot;tooth&amp;quot; with precision. No longer do I have a porcupine on my face, but a well groomed beard with immediate comments of &amp;quot; what did you do differently?&amp;quot;  I would personally challenge any negative review...this comb is the best.  By the way, if you don&#x27;t like the smell of sandle wood then let your wife or girl decide, she&#x27;ll comb your beard for you!  GREAT JOB HUNTSMAN!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this comb well made and just looks cool</li>
            <li> Incredibly satisfied. We received our product within two days off ordering. He looks less like a caveman. I enjoy that. I also recommend beard oil to assist in the fine beard care taking. Cedarwood is an extremely pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I love it, particularly the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Watching my hubby with his first stroke through his beard with this new beard comb, I knew I had made the right choice in getting this for him. This comb slides thru the hairs on his face like butter! Such a smooth feel - no tugging, no tangling. He first uses a few droplets of beard oil to smooth his beard. Absolutely the best comb you could possibly purchase for such a task. It is a very good quality handmade sandalwood comb. It is perfectly sized for the hubs to keep in his back pocket. Also comes with its own little storage pouch. I received this @ no cost in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Used as gifts and all were LOVED!!!!  Thank you for an awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> My husband received this for fathers day and he was very pleased. Its very manly and smells amazing. He likes the pouch it came in, and is constantly combing his beard with it!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing and using this comb, my beard hairs would sort of come together and form a big super curl in an area. It really ruined the shape. Using this comb every morning after a shower and with some oil/conditioner, my beard is much more full and shapely. It feels nicer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a small issue with the teeth on the first comb I received. After contacting the Huntsman Beard owner/founder, he kindly offered to send a replacement, which I accepted. The replacement seems to be in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service associated with this product is exemplary.</li>
            <li> Comb works great and holds up very well for being wood!  Love this product !!</li>
            <li> Great product. Immediately upon opening I was impressed by the quality and finish of the comb. And the smell, I personally really love the smell of the wooden comb. The cotton pouch that it came in is a very nice addition and I would definitely use it when I carry my comb with me. This comb felt much better than any plastic comb through my beard.I highly recommend this huntsmandbeardco product for anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> The comb is very well made and feels very solid. The material is nice, and the small bag it comes in is very convenient for carrying it around. A very nice little product that fulfills its purpose wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I am new to the beard world and of beardsmanship, so I did a lot of research in the realm of hygiene. Something that continued to come up again and again: combs. I had bought a plastic comb and although I enjoyed using it, it just wasn&#x27;t good enough. And after several days of continued research, I found out about the Huntsman Beard Comb. Not only was it different than my previously-purchased plastic comb; it had better ratings. I was uneasy about spending the money on a wooden comb rather than a new plastic one but man, I am so happy that I bought this comb. I love it. Absolutely amazing product. I can&#x27;t wait to see what this company comes up with next.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the craftsmanship of the comb.  Very well made.</li>
            <li> Real solidly crafted comb. A lot thicker and sturdier than I thought it would be. Haven&#x27;t tried carrying it around in my pocket, but feel like it should be sturdy enough to do so on a daily basis. Great earthy smell to the sandalwood and it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in my beard if anyone is worried about that. Glides through my beard without any snags and has seemed to help with frizzy, unruly hair due to lack of static from the wood construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, fast shipping from the company and loved the personally addressed emails from the founder to make sure everything is satisfactory with the comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome, smells great and is exactly what I needed for my beard.</li>
            <li> works great, just what i needed</li>
            <li> Noice. 9/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a birthday present for my boyfriend. After one use I could already tell the difference in his beard texture. My boyfriend loves it and has already requested a second comb!</li>
            <li> Just got this a few days ago tried it, love it. Nice look, it even has a neat scent. Very good workmanship. If you are on the fence, get off! If you have a beard, you deserve this comb!  Your beard will thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and smells great</li>
            <li> My husband loves the beard oil and comb.  We can both see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Great smell, good feel. This is the comb for me</li>
            <li> Works perfect. Feels great. Good size. Fits pocket well and hardly noticeable. Seems well crafted. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic comb. Excellent craftsmanship as well as phenomenal customer service. I highly recommend it for all of my bearded brethren</li>
            <li> This is a very nice comb. It feels good in the hand, and I look forward to grooming!</li>
            <li> This convo is perfect. It&#x27;s smooth to the touch, durable enough to be carried around, small and compact enough to be stored, and it&#x27;s exactly what anyone needs in a beard comb. To top it all off, it smells great and it&#x27;s been an all around enjoyable purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note - the company I ordered this comb from is super down to earth and it makes me happy to do business with them. They are what every small, family run business should strive to be like.</li>
            <li> Great comb, superb quality, and professional/courteous seller.  It doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> This comb is SWEET!  It&#x27;s very well made, smells great and even comes with it&#x27;s own little carry pouch. Probably gonna order another to keep in my man purse.</li>
            <li> Great for grooming. Good scent. Great quality. Nice it comes w a bag.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast delivery, wonderful customer service!</li>
            <li> Wonderful handed crafted comb. I love the way it smells. Just a great product.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Hands down the BEST mustache comb out there. My husband loves his Hunstman comb, loves its quality, its size--everything! Plus, Omegatrade&#x27;s service is superb. Excellent communication. Very fast shipping. Doesn&#x27;t get better than this. You&#x27;ll be happy you got one!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality materials you can really see the work they put in to this comb</li>
            <li> Great beard comb, very solid and sturdy feeling and doesn&#x27;t have a gross artificial sandalwood smell like some other beard combs I&#x27;ve bought off amazon. I would absolutely recommend this comb to other people looking for a solid beard comb</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I received this comb was how well built it was. It also fits in my pocket perfectly as it is not to bulky. The comb has a great scent which my wife loves, which is definitely a bonus.    I love how wood combs don&#x27;t cause static and don&#x27;t snag my hair, but I&#x27;ve bought other wooden combs in the past and they have had little bits of wood sticking out, almost like splinters. I was pleased to find that this one didn&#x27;t have that, and it was extremely well finished, I don&#x27;t know if thats because of the sandalwood but i&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail of beard combs!! The fragrant sandalwood imparts an ethereal woodsy scent to my beard and really distributes the oil each time I use it. This is quality unlike others I&#x27;ve tried and if you&#x27;re a bearded fellow like me, you need to order one for yourself. Now!! To say I&#x27;m happy with this product would be an understatement. Keep making great products like this and you&#x27;ll have a customer for life. Kudos!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend buying this comb. It&#x27;s great quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> A good comb for my husbands beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone with a beard. Really doesnt snag your hair like the plastic combs. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Very high quality. Feels nice and smooth on my beard. Rarely snags. My wife also enjoys the smell of the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> This beard comb is amazing. Well worth the money. It is durable and the perfect size to keep in your pocket wherever you go.</li>
            <li> My beard thanks you. Smells woodsy which adds to the AWESOMENESS of having a beard.</li>
            <li> Combs beard.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel because the comb is small and comes with a carry bag. My beard looks more groomed from just brushing with it and the comb&#x27;s scent was at first was displeasing because it is an unexpected scent but now is very enjoyable to smell while I brush my beard.</li>
            <li> Very nice high quality comb. It has an awesome smell and doesn&#x27;t snag even my very curly beard hair. Does great at distributing my beard oil uniformally</li>
            <li> This comb seems to be really well made and works really good</li>
            <li> Oh, what a delicious smelling beard comb!  And to top that, it glides perfectly through my ginger tinted beard.  I would recommend the Huntsman comb to anyone, it smells great, looks wonderful, and does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Very well made. It is heavy so you know this is not a cheap piece of wood but will last a long time without a lot of fuss. I have even thought about buying one for a friend it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my BF. He loved it. It does smell amazing and it comes in a nice little pouch. This makes a great gift for any bearded man!</li>
            <li> This is a great beard comb! Yes, it&#x27;s a littler overpriced - but the quality is absolutely amazing. One solid cut of sandalwood. You can even see the rings in the wood on each blade. The shape of the comb is perfect. It fits in your pocket just like small wallet or phone. It is very durable, so you&#x27;re not going to break it by sitting down awkwardly. The smell of the sandalwood is so smooth. Definitely not overwhelming by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use coconut oil in my beard everyday, and this is a great way to evenly distribute it throughout my beard. Great comb if you&#x27;re trying to grow a great beard!</li>
            <li> Great product - good craftsmanship Comb is exactly as described. Fits nicely in the hand and pocket.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Works well and has a manly scent.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned. Pure awesomeness.</li>
            <li> Pocket sized? Check&lt;br /&gt;Bristles the perfect stiffness? Check&lt;br /&gt;Made from real wood? Check&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing from the wood? Check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huntsman offers a beard oil as well that I purchased at the same time as this Comb during a discounted promo offer. After using both of these products I can tell the people be Huntsman know what they are doing when it comes to male grooming supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seriously, I wish I could bottle up the smell of this comb and  use it as a body wash. It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  I love the way it makes his beard look and it smells really nice too.  I would recommend this to my bearded friends!</li>
            <li> A great piece, fine teeth that won&#x27;t snag your beard. Biggest surprise is how GREAT the Sandalwood makes your beard smell. Fine quality comb and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful feel and aroma, Nice size for pocket. Surprising quality.</li>
            <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve found!! Thank you</li>
            <li> My husband loves this beard comb!! A+</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Feels great in your beard and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull hair at all. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;d be worth the money but I highly recommend it to anyone that wants their beard to look well taken care of. Order it.</li>
            <li> Hi quality comb. Looks great works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent natural comb...so very well crafted. Best if used slowly. No static electricity. Also works on hair on the head.</li>
            <li> I own 2 other beard combs and this one is my favorite. Smells good and the teeth have just the right spacing for my beard. Cloth pouch could be better as mine has the stitching coming apart on the one side. Don&#x27;t really use the pouch anyhow but it could be more durable.</li>
            <li> Got the order quicker than expected. My dad LOVES the mustache comb. He was very impressed at the quality of the handmade item. He couldn&#x27;t get over how great it was.</li>
