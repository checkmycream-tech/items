            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this designer until I accidently walked in the perfume store of my local mall. They were selling this perfume for about $60. Something told me to go online and check if it was cheaper and it was! I only paid $18 and some change for this bottle and the scent is amazing! It&#x27;s very unique and I get compliments on the smell all the time. I love it.</li>
            <li> on time delivery and very good quality</li>
            <li> This is the best perfum out there. I actually discovered it in the perfum shop in the mall where it was about $75 more than on amazon, so if I were you just get it and you&#x27;ll love it. It has just enough hint of sweet but not too overwhelming. My boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> this will now be my signature perfume. my friend gave it to me as a gift, I used it and received compliments everyday. now, I came back to buy. love, love , love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this fragance for a couple of years.  she just loves it.  I bought it for her for Christmas and she was so excited.  She and I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> My sister asked specifically for this for Christmas and her birthday and she absolutely adores the smell! So do I! It has a light but beautifully noticeable smell! Very chic and elegant for nights out it everyday use as a signature scent. Great price! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Smells great, lasts and very sexy.  I notice every time my wife wears it.  Great choice to please the man in your life.</li>
            <li> I like this scent. It&#x27;s light and feminine, but lasts all day. I&#x27;ll spray it on my clothes, hair or letters and the scent will still be there days later. As far as inexpensive but worthy perfumes go, this is in my sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad that several years back when I first found this scent, I bought this at a retail store. Had I tried it on then went home and bought it on Amazon, I could have saved $50! I was young and dumb. Live and learn...</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas after she tried it on at a mall&lt;br /&gt;store.  As others have said it was 3 times more expensive there.  I&lt;br /&gt;noted that on the bottle that the perfume is truly from France! The&lt;br /&gt;scent is light, sweet, and a little bit sophisticated.  It is just perfect&lt;br /&gt;for a young person.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I bought it for my wedding three years ago and I cant get enough of it. It&#x27;s long lasting and the price is great on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I get lots and lots of compliments. I will purchase more in the future. Everything arrived fast and well pkged. Thank You!</li>

            <li> The bottle is a little different from the original one I bought in LA. Smells similar so hoping it&#x27;s authentic</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I will buy more as funds roll in. This is #1 on my list. I may ever become a reseller of fine fragrances one day.&lt;br /&gt;Jen</li>
            <li> This is a nice perfume. My boss has it and I liked it so I thought I&#x27;d buy it for myself. It smells nice, but you only need a little to go a long way..</li>
            <li> This perfume is soft and yet it stays with you. I get so many compliments when wearing it. I be getting it again for sure.</li>
