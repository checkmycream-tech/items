            <li>One of the best mascaras and wands available</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does clump a tad, but if you are like me and use something to separate your lashes, they will stay separated which is good.</li>
            <li>Good brush applicator and mascara texture.  </li>
            <li>How do so many ppl love it?), Max Factor Lash Perfection (BEST drug store mascara EVER!!!)</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s light, doesnt flake, and gives great volume.</li>
            <li>Fantastic mascara and great price.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great!!</li>
            <li>Nice mascara.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best natural mascara</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing, I love it.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara as part of Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lash Stash To Go&amp;#34; box set, and it was by far the best.</li>
            <li>so I can restock so easily!</li>
            <li>but when it happens, mascara stays fairly put without a disaster to have to clean up.</li>
            <li>I have nice skin, nice lashes, full lips.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>(but I do eat junk food sometimes), but I do love to work out.  </li>
            <li>I still love buying mascara and lip</li>
            <li>Plus, you should always throw away your mascara every 8-9 weeks/3 months at most.</li>
            <li>So make sure,</li>
            <li>Then keep 2-3 tubes you like most</li>
            <li>I will be buying many more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried A LOT of mascaras and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The more you apply, the more chance there is of lashes appearing overly done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure the percentage that my lashes have increased</li>
            <li>Way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;m a mascara snob/junkie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is in the top two..</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, makes my lashes grow and not look clumpy.</li>
            <li>I love all the korre products.</li>
            <li>Its okay on the volume..</li>
            <li>In my top 3 mascaras of all time.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara</li>
            <li>Id say it is competing to be my favorite mascara ever used, close competition</li>
            <li>but it definitely might be the best.</li>
            <li>even though I do have some favorites from that list, I really LOVE</li>
            <li>, LOVE this Volcanic Mineral Mascara, by Korres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use Better than Sex</li>
            <li>Also the price is much better on Amazon than in stores.  </li>
            <li>It takes a lot to get me excited about mascara, but this stuff has done it!</li>
            <li>Great mascara, naturally conditions lashes, thickens without weight or clumps.</li>
            <li>I do really have nice eyelashes,  but who doesn&#x27;t want them better?  </li>
            <li>Makes lashes thicker and&lt;br /&gt;fairly easy to remove.</li>
            <li>smudges easily and runs a lot....</li>
            <li>but oh, boy, I&#x27;ve never had such beautiful, huge lashes before.</li>
            <li>This is utterly fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a credible mascara.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as it use to be.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I bought at the store!!</li>
            <li>Usually the cheaper ones are the best too!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to see it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It has great coverage and makes my eyelashes seem very long.</li>
            <li>I got a sample in a gift set containing about 10 different mascaras and this is far and away the best.</li>
            <li>lol, its not perfect, but its pretty darn good!</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes look longer and full.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is of such good quality that it is almost a &amp;#34;one-coat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I loved it when I tried but they were out of stock that day, so I bought a competitive one and decided to buy the Korres one later.</li>
            <li>so much that I watch how many layers I put on</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my major problem in my quest to find the PERFECT mascara is that my long lashes combined with my oily skin (not to mention the fact that I wear contacts and have allergies, so my eyes water a lot)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky too.</li>
            <li>This mascara has been great, and a much better value than a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Gentle, easily removed, doesn&#x27;t go on in clumps and blobs.</li>
            <li>It may just be easier to go to any local store and buy 10 tubes of mascara that cost $7-12 at most!  </li>
            <li>The brush is not dangerous (after 27 years of applying mascara I still poke myself in the eye, a lot) Very pretty effect.</li>
            <li>That being said, I liked it enough to write a review, and I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on Amazon before, so that is saying something!  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more natural approach.</li>
            <li>Recieved my order super fast!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no such thing as some kind of BB, CC, moisturizer, foundation, powder, eyeshadow, (too many too list) STUFF to make you look suddenly like a movie star!  </li>
            <li>It leaves you with clump-free, soft looking, full fringe to frame your peepers!  </li>
            <li>old, clumpy, brush was cheap.  </li>
            <li>I was IN LOVE the second I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Today is the first day I have worn the mascara, so if I notice any change in how it wears, I will update this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been looking for something natural and normal, but not boring.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use to wear this mascara when it first came out</li>
            <li>After trying no less than 100 brands I will be loyal to this one!</li>
            <li>I would by this for full price and can see this as my new staple.  </li>
            <li>Love it - lashes long</li>
            <li>It would smear if you jump in a pool, but as long as you dont do that you will look fabulous all day!</li>
            <li>I love Korres products, but the mascara was quite dry.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good mascara for a long time and finally found one.</li>
            <li>even though the brush is large you can still reach every lash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to ind good ones  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s things that really do work as well to help.  </li>
            <li>Now, for eye- lashes- the one thing that really does work is Latise.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>You also won&#x27;t need to use as much mascara or care what brand you use.  </li>
            <li>Subtly intense, like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know too much about this brand before but saw it on display at sephora and decided to try it there.</li>
            <li>and I really like their products.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also; no such thing as some kind of sponge or applicator; which will make your skin look younger or smoother.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a very thick formula, but it&#x27;s very, very buildable and not at all clumpy.</li>
            <li>This mascara is long lasting and gives a nice volume to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, but seems to smudge and leave black under my eyes.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s expected, easily removed with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>If the mascara is older than 3 months, then you&#x27;re buying something toxic.  </li>
            <li>in all, I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you don&#x27;t have an issue with smudging!  :)</li>
            <li>So I immediately ordered 3 of them in Amazon to make sure I have enough to last for a while.  </li>
            <li>If it can make my baby-fine blond lashes look good, you should at least give it a try!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, thick and full.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy, I had high expectations for this product</li>
            <li>When, some ladies/girls reach a certain age or just a certain stage in their life; (yes, even a a 27yr old woman does/can look 42yrs old).  </li>
            <li>It just darkened up my lashes and left them with a natural, soft feel -- which is fine if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but I prefer mascara that lengthens and separates my lashes, and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, no real complaints.</li>
            <li>and they are know by their natural stuff, which I don&#x27;t care to much</li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t run under normal conditions.</li>
            <li>It is ok, you need a few coats</li>
            <li>Makes lashes full and long, without clumping.</li>
            <li>For starters what I like about it is: its texture, the big brush and the way it makes my lashes look full, flirty yet natural.  </li>
            <li>I like to use a lash primer (Wet and and Wild- works just fine).</li>
            <li>They need to be new too.  </li>
            <li>Product is new, still liquid.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it looks very natural, and it STAYS ON ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>Chanel and Wet and Wild make the same up in many of their items.  </li>
            <li>made me interested in this mascara, but now that I see all the rave reviews, I definitely have to try it.</li>
            <li>Like the comment from the first and only review, I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and can see myself reaching for this continuously.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I apparently am the first person to review, I&#x27;d be interested to see what other people think.</li>
            <li>The only make-up you ever, ever need to spend a little more money on is- Lip-gloss and lipstick.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 45yrs old.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was NATURAL</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this mascara.</li>
            <li>Organic, natural, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>brand is already known for its commitment to quality, natural products, and the complete ingredient list for this mascara excludes mica.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I wonder if the company was getting rid of some old stock</li>
            <li>So Far this product does not irritate my eyes and appears to stay on well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>if your lashes are just OK, you will now have thick, long lashes very soon!  </li>
            <li>There are some really good ones out there if you look around, and not all of them are the really expensive department store mascaras.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many from cheap (ELF, Revlon, Essie, Wet &amp; Wild) to way expensive (Lancôme, Smash box, Dior Show) and</li>
            <li>I then, purchased this same mascara brand new or a month old form a hi end department store.  </li>
            <li>Barely makes my lashes look longer or thicker!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even look 30 years old yet in my face and my body is even looks younger.  </li>
            <li>If you stop, your lashes will just go back to you old ones.  </li>
            <li>Be kind to others andmake up for the things you did wrong.  </li>
            <li>By maybe 10-11pm it will be a bit less intense and start to wear off (possibly some eye rubbing in here too, not like crazy though, I am wearing mascara after all lol), but its not enough to say you would need to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural natural blonde with long hair</li>
            <li>Goes on light and wasn&#x27;t irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Typically reviews are spot-on, but I do not understand the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>I have had a super hard time finding it in stores and online - even the Sephora website no longer carries this product.</li>
            <li>I mean if you&#x27;re really wanting to buy this particular mascara, then do so.  </li>
            <li>Ladies always use a primer, but just don&#x27;t let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>every day basically, if not longer, and the mascara typically is on the whole day.</li>

            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of mascaras and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The more you apply, the more chance there is of lashes appearing overly done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure the percentage that my lashes have increased</li>
            <li> Way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;m a mascara snob/junkie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is in the top two..</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, makes my lashes grow and not look clumpy.</li>
            <li> I love all the korre products.</li>
            <li> Its okay on the volume..</li>
            <li> In my top 3 mascaras of all time.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara</li>
            <li> Id say it is competing to be my favorite mascara ever used, close competition</li>
            <li> but it definitely might be the best.</li>
            <li> even though I do have some favorites from that list, I really LOVE</li>
            <li> , LOVE this Volcanic Mineral Mascara, by Korres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use Better than Sex</li>
            <li> Also the price is much better on Amazon than in stores.  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot to get me excited about mascara, but this stuff has done it!</li>
            <li> Great mascara, naturally conditions lashes, thickens without weight or clumps.</li>
            <li> I do really have nice eyelashes,  but who doesn&#x27;t want them better?  </li>
            <li> Makes lashes thicker and&lt;br /&gt;fairly easy to remove.</li>
            <li> smudges easily and runs a lot....</li>
            <li> but oh, boy, I&#x27;ve never had such beautiful, huge lashes before.</li>
            <li> This is utterly fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a credible mascara.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as it use to be.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I bought at the store!!</li>
            <li> Usually the cheaper ones are the best too!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to see it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> It has great coverage and makes my eyelashes seem very long.</li>
            <li> I got a sample in a gift set containing about 10 different mascaras and this is far and away the best.</li>
            <li> lol, its not perfect, but its pretty darn good!</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes look longer and full.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is of such good quality that it is almost a &amp;#34;one-coat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I loved it when I tried but they were out of stock that day, so I bought a competitive one and decided to buy the Korres one later.</li>
            <li> so much that I watch how many layers I put on</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my major problem in my quest to find the PERFECT mascara is that my long lashes combined with my oily skin (not to mention the fact that I wear contacts and have allergies, so my eyes water a lot)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky too.</li>
            <li> This mascara has been great, and a much better value than a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Gentle, easily removed, doesn&#x27;t go on in clumps and blobs.</li>
            <li> It may just be easier to go to any local store and buy 10 tubes of mascara that cost $7-12 at most!  </li>
            <li> The brush is not dangerous (after 27 years of applying mascara I still poke myself in the eye, a lot) Very pretty effect.</li>
            <li> That being said, I liked it enough to write a review, and I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on Amazon before, so that is saying something!  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more natural approach.</li>
            <li> Recieved my order super fast!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no such thing as some kind of BB, CC, moisturizer, foundation, powder, eyeshadow, (too many too list) STUFF to make you look suddenly like a movie star!  </li>
            <li> It leaves you with clump-free, soft looking, full fringe to frame your peepers!  </li>
            <li> old, clumpy, brush was cheap.  </li>
            <li> I was IN LOVE the second I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Today is the first day I have worn the mascara, so if I notice any change in how it wears, I will update this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been looking for something natural and normal, but not boring.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use to wear this mascara when it first came out</li>
            <li> After trying no less than 100 brands I will be loyal to this one!</li>
            <li> I would by this for full price and can see this as my new staple.  </li>
            <li> Love it - lashes long</li>
            <li> It would smear if you jump in a pool, but as long as you dont do that you will look fabulous all day!</li>
            <li> I love Korres products, but the mascara was quite dry.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good mascara for a long time and finally found one.</li>
            <li> even though the brush is large you can still reach every lash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to ind good ones  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s things that really do work as well to help.  </li>
            <li> Now, for eye- lashes- the one thing that really does work is Latise.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> You also won&#x27;t need to use as much mascara or care what brand you use.  </li>
            <li> Subtly intense, like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know too much about this brand before but saw it on display at sephora and decided to try it there.</li>
            <li> and I really like their products.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also; no such thing as some kind of sponge or applicator; which will make your skin look younger or smoother.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very thick formula, but it&#x27;s very, very buildable and not at all clumpy.</li>
            <li> This mascara is long lasting and gives a nice volume to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but seems to smudge and leave black under my eyes.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s expected, easily removed with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> If the mascara is older than 3 months, then you&#x27;re buying something toxic.  </li>
            <li> in all, I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you don&#x27;t have an issue with smudging!  :)</li>
            <li> So I immediately ordered 3 of them in Amazon to make sure I have enough to last for a while.  </li>
            <li> If it can make my baby-fine blond lashes look good, you should at least give it a try!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, thick and full.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, I had high expectations for this product</li>
            <li> When, some ladies/girls reach a certain age or just a certain stage in their life; (yes, even a a 27yr old woman does/can look 42yrs old).  </li>
            <li> It just darkened up my lashes and left them with a natural, soft feel -- which is fine if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but I prefer mascara that lengthens and separates my lashes, and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, no real complaints.</li>
            <li> and they are know by their natural stuff, which I don&#x27;t care to much</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t run under normal conditions.</li>
            <li> It is ok, you need a few coats</li>
            <li> Makes lashes full and long, without clumping.</li>
            <li> For starters what I like about it is: its texture, the big brush and the way it makes my lashes look full, flirty yet natural.  </li>
            <li> I like to use a lash primer (Wet and and Wild- works just fine).</li>
            <li> They need to be new too.  </li>
            <li> Product is new, still liquid.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it looks very natural, and it STAYS ON ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Chanel and Wet and Wild make the same up in many of their items.  </li>
            <li> made me interested in this mascara, but now that I see all the rave reviews, I definitely have to try it.</li>
            <li> Like the comment from the first and only review, I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and can see myself reaching for this continuously.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I apparently am the first person to review, I&#x27;d be interested to see what other people think.</li>
            <li> The only make-up you ever, ever need to spend a little more money on is- Lip-gloss and lipstick.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 45yrs old.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was NATURAL</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Organic, natural, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> brand is already known for its commitment to quality, natural products, and the complete ingredient list for this mascara excludes mica.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I wonder if the company was getting rid of some old stock</li>
            <li> So Far this product does not irritate my eyes and appears to stay on well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> if your lashes are just OK, you will now have thick, long lashes very soon!  </li>
            <li> There are some really good ones out there if you look around, and not all of them are the really expensive department store mascaras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many from cheap (ELF, Revlon, Essie, Wet &amp; Wild) to way expensive (Lancôme, Smash box, Dior Show) and</li>
            <li> I then, purchased this same mascara brand new or a month old form a hi end department store.  </li>
            <li> Barely makes my lashes look longer or thicker!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even look 30 years old yet in my face and my body is even looks younger.  </li>
            <li> If you stop, your lashes will just go back to you old ones.  </li>
            <li> Be kind to others andmake up for the things you did wrong.  </li>
            <li> By maybe 10-11pm it will be a bit less intense and start to wear off (possibly some eye rubbing in here too, not like crazy though, I am wearing mascara after all lol), but its not enough to say you would need to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural natural blonde with long hair</li>
            <li> Goes on light and wasn&#x27;t irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Typically reviews are spot-on, but I do not understand the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I have had a super hard time finding it in stores and online - even the Sephora website no longer carries this product.</li>
            <li> I mean if you&#x27;re really wanting to buy this particular mascara, then do so.  </li>
            <li> Ladies always use a primer, but just don&#x27;t let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> every day basically, if not longer, and the mascara typically is on the whole day.</li>
            <li> To be fair with this mascara (due to the cold season)</li>
            <li> now and had to wipe away faint black from under my eyes about 3 times (probably no one else would notice the smudges, but I am looking for them), but my eyelashes themselves still look amazing.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for however long it will last me.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to see some improvements, but within 3 months- they all had WOW lashes!  </li>
            <li> I like a mascara to lift my long eyelashes away from my lids.</li>
            <li> Took me a long time to find this</li>
            <li> Is actually better at lengthening than my previous brand, which is expensive and has the initials &amp;#34;CD&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This mascara is extremely black and made my lashes bigger instantly.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out a bit faster than I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I allow my lashes to dry 100%.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any chemicals hampering my already Chronic Dry Eyes.</li>
            <li> I am scared to order it again because I don&#x27;t want another dry tube.</li>
            <li> However, throughout the years I noticed that the mascara wasn&#x27;t creammy but dry.</li>
            <li> or if this mascara is generally of a dry consistency.</li>
            <li> they all use Latise every single day and for years now..  </li>
            <li> The downside- you have to use it every single night and forever.  </li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I have naturally very long eyelashes, but they are thin, so I need mascara to make them look thicker.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that sometimes I get that raccoon thing going on but that is only if I don&#x27;t take it off all the way at night or rub my eyes for a while.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no clumps</li>
            <li> I even put the bottle in a cup of very warm water for 5 minutes and it still was horrible.  </li>
            <li> However, these are my real long dark lashes too.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find!</li>
            <li> It runs like crazy and put huge dark circles under my eyes...</li>
            <li> This mascara was horrible and I even bought it again locally for even more money- larger tube though.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t by any other mascara after discovering Korres.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different brands in the past year.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think people who like this stuff; have not tried 10 brands at their local convenient store in a 2 week period lately?  </li>
            <li> but it does get a lil clumpy but like the dark glossy color it gives.</li>
            <li> Dark, Liquidy, volume enhancing.</li>
            <li> When I did finally receive it, the mascara was all dried up!!  </li>
            <li> I got this one for less than $9 when it is over $20 in store.  </li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY mascara out there:  Diorshow (Hate!- smudges under my eyes like crazy!), Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (love that it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all and &amp; comes off easily when washing your face, but it clumps a lot), Maybelline Great Lash (HATE!  </li>
            <li> The product I did receive was a dried up korres mascara which I could have purchased at another store for half of what I paid ......</li>
            <li> I sometimes tint my lashes for a few months and no mascara.  </li>
            <li> You need to switch every few days.  </li>
            <li> It was all dried out.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have found that does what it claims without irritating my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I got a few compliments at work.</li>
            <li> but I think its dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have to apply a few times</li>
            <li> but it comes off in little tiny fibers, not some crazy black mess.</li>
            <li> the mascara you&#x27;re buying on Amazon or anywhere is not expired past 3 months.  </li>
            <li> And i have tried a lot of them in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I used it once so sending back is difficult.</li>
            <li> Again, 3 months or less- THROW IT AWAY!!  </li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look freakishly long like they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> I think korres may have stopped making it since it is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll have longer, thick lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this mascara was 10 years old, but it was horrible in every single way  </li>
            <li> I mean, also if you can afford it as well.  </li>
            <li> I mean-</li>
            <li> I mean try it, if you want.</li>
            <li> But then I had a really hard time finding it anywhere, even online!  </li>
            <li> This mascara sucks!</li>
            <li> color, non irritating.</li>
            <li> Used to buy this mascara regularly through Sephora and was very disappointed they have stopped carrying it online.  </li>
            <li> I would not know how to rate this product as I received the wrong mascara.</li>
            <li> My lashes were close to looking fake.  </li>
            <li> but it was really disappointing...</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Just bad formula period.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this mascara to stay put so badly, but it has smudged a bit. :(  </li>
            <li> (I HATE racoon eyes).</li>
            <li> hate that this has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Yes, they all hated it.  </li>
            <li> This product was horrible.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara</li>
            <li> Horrible as well.  </li>
            <li> (Mica is often mined by children in awful working conditions!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> plus it smells absolutely horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems to dry out a bit faster than I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;Good color, non irritating.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  Used to buy it at Sephora but then they stopped carrying it!</li>
            <li> This product was horrible. Typically reviews are spot-on, but I do not understand the positive reviews for this product. It runs like crazy and put huge dark circles under my eyes...I looked like a raccoon! I used once and never used it again!</li>
            <li> I like a mascara to lift my long eyelashes away from my lids. This didn&#x27;t do that. Goes on light and wasn&#x27;t irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love it - lashes long</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! Every day is a good eyelash day with this stuff! Very happy with it! I ordered another one to have on hand too!</li>
            <li> I was so wanting to try this and it was a nightmare!  This mascara was horrible and I even bought it again locally for even more money- larger tube though.  I do really have nice eyelashes,  but who doesn&#x27;t want them better?  Rimmel Brand is probably the BEST Mascara&#x27;s on the market  You may not like one or tow of them- try another.  I can afford $1000 mascara ever week and it does the same thing as a $7.99 mascara does.  I&#x27;m super picky too. I like to use a lash primer (Wet and and Wild- works just fine). Ladies always use a primer, but just don&#x27;t let it dry completely. Baby powder works too. I 1st use one mascara for fullness, then another for lengthening.  I allow my lashes to dry 100%. The,  I curl my lashes and thy look PERFECT! about 99.9% of the time.  I purchase mascara online all the time and I keep some. but do return a a lot of them.  It&#x27;s hard to ind good ones  Usually the cheaper ones are the best too!  The only make-up you ever, ever need to spend a little more money on is- Lip-gloss and lipstick.  I have nice skin, nice lashes, full lips. I&#x27;m a natural natural blonde with long hair and I&#x27;m 45yrs old. I don&#x27;t even look 30 years old yet in my face and my body is even looks younger.  I do eat well (but I do eat junk food sometimes), but I do love to work out.  I&#x27;ve had no plastic surgery as of yet, However, I&#x27;m all for it, when I need it.  Beauty- Externally is sometimes all about LUCK. That&#x27;s it!!  There&#x27;s no such thing as some kind of BB, CC, moisturizer, foundation, powder, eyeshadow, (too many too list) STUFF to make you look suddenly like a movie star!  There&#x27;s also; no such thing as some kind of sponge or applicator; which will make your skin look younger or smoother.  Your fingers work best!!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by gimmicks.  When, some ladies/girls reach a certain age or just a certain stage in their life; (yes, even a a 27yr old woman does/can look 42yrs old).  It&#x27;s your genes, lifestyle, and it maybe something called Karma?  Be kind to others andmake up for the things you did wrong.  Tell the truth and apologize. There&#x27;s things that really do work as well to help.  It&#x27;s called Plastic Surgery, but it doesn&#x27;t help everyone.  Beauty does come from within too.  Botox, Fraxcel, Laser resurfacing are all really great!  I&#x27;ve sen some of my friends have had all these things done and still do.  Now, for eye- lashes- the one thing that really does work is Latise.  I mean, also if you can afford it as well.  Cost- $70-$100 per month.  The up side is though-  if your lashes are just OK, you will now have thick, long lashes very soon!  It really does work. I have 5 friends (all had short, wimpy lashes too) they all use Latise every single day and for years now..  It took a few weeks to see some improvements, but within 3 months- they all had WOW lashes!  The downside- you have to use it every single night and forever.  If you stop, your lashes will just go back to you old ones.  Also, the cheapest mascara will be your favorites!!  (There&#x27;s really no such thing).  Chanel and Wet and Wild make the same up in many of their items.  You also won&#x27;t need to use as much mascara or care what brand you use.  I mean- you&#x27;ll have longer, thick lashes.  I sometimes tint my lashes for a few months and no mascara.  However, these are my real long dark lashes too.  I still love buying mascara and lip gloss all the time though.  Just keep in mind; with mascara - you need to switch every 2 days with 2-3 different mascara&#x27;s.  They need to be new too.  It&#x27;s like your hair and shampoo.  You need to switch every few days.  Plus, you should always throw away your mascara every 8-9 weeks/3 months at most. This is not my opinion- it&#x27;s called SCIENCE!  So make sure, the mascara you&#x27;re buying on Amazon or anywhere is not expired past 3 months.  If the mascara is older than 3 months, then you&#x27;re buying something toxic.  It&#x27;s also garbage.  To be fair with this mascara (due to the cold season) I did wait a day to use the mascara. This stuff was old, clumpy, brush was cheap.  Worst mascara I&#x27;ve seen or used in my life!!  Just bad formula period.  I even put the bottle in a cup of very warm water for 5 minutes and it still was horrible.  FYI- Mascara trick for people who know make-up.  I then, purchased this same mascara brand new or a month old form a hi end department store.  Horrible as well.  I mean if you&#x27;re really wanting to buy this particular mascara, then do so.  However, Seller- When did you get this mascara?  List this and expiration date as well.  All mascara brands (are not regulated by any FDA or OSHA) and all have a year expiration date on them.  This is not correct.  Again, 3 months or less- THROW IT AWAY!!  I&#x27;m not sure if this mascara was 10 years old, but it was horrible in every single way  I mean try it, if you want. I did, because I heard- great stuff. Just a bunch of hype!!  I even had my friends buy and use it!!  I never told any of them; that I had bought this and didn&#x27;t like it at all!  I told them to go get it and it&#x27;s awesome!  They all returned every tube of this stuff to the mall. Yes, they all hated it.  I think people who like this stuff; have not tried 10 brands at their local convenient store in a 2 week period lately?  It may just be easier to go to any local store and buy 10 tubes of mascara that cost $7-12 at most!  Then, try each one every 2 days. Then keep 2-3 tubes you like most and yes, return the used ones you don&#x27;t like. Yes, you can do this at any store for 30 days with a receipt.  Goof luck ladies!!!</li>
            <li> Great mascara, naturally conditions lashes, thickens without weight or clumps. Creates younger looking lashes. I won&#x27;t by any other mascara after discovering Korres.</li>
            <li> its a good mascara nothing too fancy but it does get a lil clumpy but like the dark glossy color it gives.</li>
            <li> This mascara sucks! It was all dried out.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I have naturally very long eyelashes, but they are thin, so I need mascara to make them look thicker.  I have tried EVERY mascara out there:  Diorshow (Hate!- smudges under my eyes like crazy!), Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (love that it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all and &amp; comes off easily when washing your face, but it clumps a lot), Maybelline Great Lash (HATE!  Barely makes my lashes look longer or thicker!  How do so many ppl love it?), Max Factor Lash Perfection (BEST drug store mascara EVER!!!), Lancome, Bobbi Brown, MAC, L&#x27;Oreal, Bijoux, Covergirl, EVERYTHING...  So now you get an idea of what brands I&#x27;ve tried and what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara goes on LIKE A DREAM!!!  It leaves you with clump-free, soft looking, full fringe to frame your peepers!  I was IN LOVE the second I put it on.  Unfortunately, my major problem in my quest to find the PERFECT mascara is that my long lashes combined with my oily skin (not to mention the fact that I wear contacts and have allergies, so my eyes water a lot) often leave me with racoon eyes from my mascara rubbing off.  I wanted this mascara to stay put so badly, but it has smudged a bit. :(  That being said, I liked it enough to write a review, and I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on Amazon before, so that is saying something!  I&#x27;ve had the mascraa on for 6.5 hrs. now and had to wipe away faint black from under my eyes about 3 times (probably no one else would notice the smudges, but I am looking for them), but my eyelashes themselves still look amazing.  Today is the first day I have worn the mascara, so if I notice any change in how it wears, I will update this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you don&#x27;t have an issue with smudging!  :)</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was NATURAL so it wouldn&#x27;t endanger my eyes. I don&#x27;t need any chemicals hampering my already Chronic Dry Eyes. I was pleasantly surprised with this mascara. I hope they continue making this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara. I will be buying many more. It is one of the best natural mascara I&#x27;ve tried- And i have tried a lot of them in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> This is utterly fantastic stuff. Subtly intense, like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Ordering another tube so I never run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have tried in quite some time. Makes lashes thicker and&lt;br /&gt;fairly easy to remove. Bought 2 from Amazon because it was sold at at Sephora!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara and it&#x27;s all I use now. Absolutely no clumps and it gives great volume and definition! I just bought 2 more for when I run out of the one I have now!</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it looks very natural, and it STAYS ON ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mascara. Have been looking for something natural and normal, but not boring. This fits the bill. So sad Korres has reduced their makeup supply in the US (at Sephora, anyway), but so glad I found it here. Have purchased multiple times.</li>
            <li> Organic, natural, inexpensive.  Performs and does everything it promises.  Lengthens, gives volume. Love this one!</li>
            <li> I found this mascara while researching mica-free products. (Mica is often mined by children in awful working conditions!)&lt;br /&gt;This brand is already known for its commitment to quality, natural products, and the complete ingredient list for this mascara excludes mica.  (Here is the web site for the manufacturer:)&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that made me interested in this mascara, but now that I see all the rave reviews, I definitely have to try it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, but I was very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t find that it increased the volume or length of my lashes at all. It just darkened up my lashes and left them with a natural, soft feel -- which is fine if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but I prefer mascara that lengthens and separates my lashes, and this wasn&#x27;t it. My fave mascara was discontinued so I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different brands in the past year. I guess my search continues!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! I have really sensitive eyes and this is the only mascara that does not bother my eyes at all. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara before and absolutely loved it!  But then I had a really hard time finding it anywhere, even online!  I was so excited to see it on Amazon.com.  When I did finally receive it, the mascara was all dried up!!  I was so upset. I bought it in January for $20. Now I see the cost has doubled. What&#x27;s up with that?  I am scared to order it again because I don&#x27;t want another dry tube. Especially with the cost. I wonder if the company was getting rid of some old stock and I got stuck.</li>
            <li> Works great, stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but seems to smudge and leave black under my eyes. plus it smells absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Volume and length.  No clumping and no flaking.  Awesome</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to get me excited about mascara, but this stuff has done it! It is absolutely amazing, I love it. It makes my eyelashes look freakishly long like they&#x27;re fake. I got a sample in a gift set containing about 10 different mascaras and this is far and away the best. I&#x27;m so happy to find it here on amazon so I can restock so easily!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised.  Product is new, still liquid.  Applies well and is good quality.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of mascaras and this one is my favorite. Goes on easy, thick and full. It stays put all day - no racoon eyes. It would smear if you jump in a pool, but as long as you dont do that you will look fabulous all day!</li>
            <li> I use to wear this mascara when it first came out and it was amazing. It made my eyelashes look longer and full. However, throughout the years I noticed that the mascara wasn&#x27;t creammy but dry. It flakes a lot and makes no difference on my eyelashes. Don&#x27;t know what happened to the product but it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as it use to be.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I bought at the store!! Love it</li>
            <li> This mascara has a great brush that keeps your lashes defined and clump free while giving them a good coat of mascara. The mascara itself is of such good quality that it is almost a &amp;#34;one-coat&amp;#34; mascara. I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of mascaras recently after buying three different low-quality kinds in a row. There are some really good ones out there if you look around, and not all of them are the really expensive department store mascaras.</li>
            <li> I am always searching for the best mascara and this one is in my top 5. This mascara gives me the length with sufficient fullness (not a ton of volume but it&#x27;s a sufficient amount) that doesn&#x27;t clump. I don&#x27;t put on layer after layer so I can&#x27;t say what happens in that scenario. This mascara doesn&#x27;t run under normal conditions. Sometimes I work out after my 8 hour workday and if I sweat a lot some of it comes off but it comes off in little tiny fibers, not some crazy black mess. Not a crier but when it happens, mascara stays fairly put without a disaster to have to clean up. Washes well with face soap followed by an actual eye makeup remover. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras and wands available</li>
            <li> Used to buy this mascara regularly through Sephora and was very disappointed they have stopped carrying it online.  Very glad to have found it here.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, no real complaints. Is actually better at lengthening than my previous brand, which is expensive and has the initials &amp;#34;CD&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not a very thick formula, but it&#x27;s very, very buildable and not at all clumpy. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have found that does what it claims without irritating my eyes.  If it can make my baby-fine blond lashes look good, you should at least give it a try!</li>
            <li> It is ok, you need a few coats</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as part of Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lash Stash To Go&amp;#34; box set, and it was by far the best. I have had a super hard time finding it in stores and online - even the Sephora website no longer carries this product. It&#x27;s light, doesnt flake, and gives great volume.</li>
            <li> I would not know how to rate this product as I received the wrong mascara. When I contacted amazon for a return, my request was forwarded to the merchant... And was ignored. The product I did receive was a dried up korres mascara which I could have purchased at another store for half of what I paid ......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a credible mascara. No clumping if you use a sparing hand. The more you apply, the more chance there is of lashes appearing overly done. I prefer a more natural approach. One coat is enough to define my lashes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great!!</li>
            <li> Nice mascara. Goes on evenly and my lashes stay flexible, stays put (I HATE racoon eyes). The brush is not dangerous (after 27 years of applying mascara I still poke myself in the eye, a lot) Very pretty effect. After trying no less than 100 brands I will be loyal to this one!</li>
            <li> They make the claim that this mascara increases lash volume by 600%. I decided to give it a try and LOVED IT!! I don&#x27;t know for sure the percentage that my lashes have increased but oh, boy, I&#x27;ve never had such beautiful, huge lashes before. I didn&#x27;t know too much about this brand before but saw it on display at sephora and decided to try it there. I loved it when I tried but they were out of stock that day, so I bought a competitive one and decided to buy the Korres one later. I found it here on Amazon and after I used it for several days, I immediately returned the competitive one I had bought. And that was a Dior, way more expensive than Korres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the brand on-line and they are know by their natural stuff, which I don&#x27;t care to much but it&#x27;s always great to know you&#x27;re putting quality ingredients in your face. This mascara is extremely black and made my lashes bigger instantly. I put it on in the morning before work and when I got home at night it was still the same way. Lasted all day and I got a few compliments at work. Way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;m a mascara snob/junkie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I apparently am the first person to review, I&#x27;d be interested to see what other people think.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that actually gives some life and body to my lashes.  I asked for it in Sephora and was told that they were no longer selling it because it was taken off the market.  So I immediately ordered 3 of them in Amazon to make sure I have enough to last for a while.  I hope Amazon will still have some after I run out.  Otherwise, I need to find a similar mascara SOON!</li>
            <li> ive been wearing mascara for 40 years. this is in the top two.. even though the brush is large you can still reach every lash. I think korres may have stopped making it since it is so hard to find. stockpile it while you can.</li>
            <li> Gentle, easily removed, doesn&#x27;t go on in clumps and blobs.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, makes my lashes grow and not look clumpy. Can be layerrd well. Took me a long time to find this</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative to Chanel and Dior mascaras. Makes lashes full and long, without clumping. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love all the korre products. This mascara is long lasting and gives a nice volume to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> smudges easily and runs a lot.... Don&#x27;t buy, I had high expectations for this product but it was really disappointing...</li>
            <li> So Far this product does not irritate my eyes and appears to stay on well.</li>
            <li> Dark, Liquidy, volume enhancing. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Burned my eyes! Its okay on the volume..</li>
            <li> Recieved my order super fast! Impressed with the product too! I have sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t make them itchy or anything! Only complaint is that sometimes I get that raccoon thing going on but that is only if I don&#x27;t take it off all the way at night or rub my eyes for a while. But that&#x27;s expected, easily removed with eye makeup remover. Would recommend this product :D</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> In my top 3 mascaras of all time.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day, holds a curl almost as well as a waterproof formula (my lashes are pin-straight) and still washes off well.  Love this mascara but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find!</li>
            <li> So close to giving it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does clump a tad, but if you are like me and use something to separate your lashes, they will stay separated which is good. My eyelashes are definitely longer using this product than others--so much that I watch how many layers I put on or I might be a raccoon lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im up from 630am-12am every day basically, if not longer, and the mascara typically is on the whole day. By maybe 10-11pm it will be a bit less intense and start to wear off (possibly some eye rubbing in here too, not like crazy though, I am wearing mascara after all lol), but its not enough to say you would need to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product, i&#x27;d give it like a 4.55 stars lol, its not perfect, but its pretty darn good! Id say it is competing to be my favorite mascara ever used, close competition but it definitely might be the best.</li>
            <li> I just got this mascara yesterday at Sephora.  I got it as a 100 point sample and used it this morning.  For starters what I like about it is: its texture, the big brush and the way it makes my lashes look full, flirty yet natural.  I&#x27;ve had this on since about 7:30ish and its still on and not flaked on my glasses or under my eyes.  I will continue to use this for however long it will last me.  I would by this for full price and can see this as my new staple.  Like the comment from the first and only review, I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and can see myself reaching for this continuously.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of items from this line and I really like their products.  I&#x27;ve had many from cheap (ELF, Revlon, Essie, Wet &amp; Wild) to way expensive (Lancôme, Smash box, Dior Show) and even though I do have some favorites from that list, I really LOVE, LOVE this Volcanic Mineral Mascara, by Korres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with all this being said, This Review Gets A...FIVE STAR!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I have been searching for a good mascara for a long time and finally found one. It lengthens my lashes without clumping. It also gives them volume! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I like it but I think its dried out.  I have to apply a few times</li>
            <li> Korres Volcanic Mineral  Mascara wowed me!  My lashes were close to looking fake.  Good brush applicator and mascara texture.  Next time I need mascara again --- Badger is the place and Korres is the one!!</li>
            <li> hate that this has been discontinued. Loved this!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat of a mascara junkie and use multiple ones.  This is one of my favorites.  I also use Better than Sex, Julep go Big and Loreal Voluminous.  If I am going to use just one mascara then it is this one. It has great coverage and makes my eyelashes seem very long. Also the price is much better on Amazon than in stores.  I got this one for less than $9 when it is over $20 in store.  Will definitely be purchasing it online again.</li>
            <li> This mascara has been great, and a much better value than a more expensive brand. It makes your lashes look thicker, does not flake or smudge and has not caused any issues with my contacts. I am glad I discovered this !</li>
            <li> I love Korres products, but the mascara was quite dry. I used it once so sending back is difficult. But I would like to know if this is just a one time thing or if this mascara is generally of a dry consistency.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara and great price.  Just wish, as a redhead, that I could have found it in brown for the same price.</li>
