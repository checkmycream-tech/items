            <li>It works great for my bridges!</li>
            <li>Great for flossing around my implant and bridge!</li>
            <li>Perfect, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for under a permanent bridge.</li>
            <li>It works great for that.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great for bridges.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price.</li>
            <li>I love this floss!!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for many years and it works perfect.</li>
            <li>Platypus flossers are wonderful, easy to use, and the easiest of all the flossers in terms of &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product from Oral B, a must in your bathroom</li>
            <li>this is the best stuff to clean in between your teeth....</li>
            <li>this is the best stuff to clean your teeth with....</li>
            <li>It works well when one is used to it and seems to be perfect for one with implants that need to be kept clean.</li>
            <li>Originally, it was VERY good.  </li>
            <li>This is a great and easy product to use.</li>
            <li>But I can not find it in stores any more, so I was delighted to find it in Amazon.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice, and when you get it, you will see how effective this floss is.</li>
            <li>Best product I have used.with my relatively new bridge.</li>
            <li>It threaded easily, and the spongy part did a good job of cleaning under the bridge.  </li>
            <li>Its just what i was looking for with a great price and fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li>The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than threading your own bridgework floss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found any I liked better for use with my bridge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now, with all of these tools, I can floss faster and more easily!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now, with all of these tools, I can floss faster and more easily!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with a permanent bridge because it is easily inserted and effectively cleans food particles as well as plaque.</li>
            <li>Love the product and have used it for years</li>
            <li>My daughter just got her braces and it took her more than an hour to floss her teeth (leaving out the molars) since the floss shreds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product from its inception many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I will never purchase another product by this (formerly) reputable outfit again.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>It took a lot of work to floss my top teeth and the floss</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product and I am so glad he did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to floss everything without it.  </li>
            <li>I use the G-U-M Go Betweens back here, also, because they are perfect for clearing packed food from between my brackets and around the arch</li>
            <li>I use the G-U-M Go Betweens back here, also, because they are perfect for clearing packed food from between my brackets and around the arch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK..</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use that I tend to use the Superfloss more often than the Platypus flossers.  </li>
            <li>The price was so good and delivery was so fast.</li>
            <li>and I can easily floss without losing grip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The tip is coated so it&#x27;s easy to get it between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can easily tell by feel where to place the Platypus under the wire between my brackets.  </li>
            <li>Product is fine.  </li>
            <li>The thread is as good as expected however, the point could use more wax to be able to use  without threading.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t even fit under the arch wire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, this product serves its unique purpose well, so I still give it 4/5.</li>
            <li>use it to clean hearing aids</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to clean under my bridge.  </li>
            <li>Super floss was good but regular</li>
            <li>I was originally hoping to be able to use one or two of these flosses per session to clean my whole mouth, but in practice I use one for my permanent retainer and I pick up the nice, waxed regular floss (also from Oral-B, coincidentally) to do the rest of my mouth.</li>
            <li>This product is excellant for cleanng between teeth and aiding in maintaining a bright smile when used with daily brushing.</li>
            <li>Using Oral B Super Floss takes a while to adjust to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>A very durable, never-shedding super floss!</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I had a similar floss by Dentek, that I really liked, but could not find again.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product, quality control is an issue right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li>this new version is a caricature of the original</li>
            <li>Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  </li>
            <li>Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a really great product that I have a hard time finding at the store.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to buy floss threaders to make them all work, which is what you&#x27;re trying to avoid if you buy this product in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I have had many issues with my teeth and as a result, I now have several implants and a bridge.</li>
            <li>Works much better then the threaders and regular floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand and type of floss since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>I recently got two implant bridges and the dentist told me to use Super Floss to clean around the implant posts.</li>
            <li>Had a major oral surgery that required implants and a dental bridge and this Oral-B Super Floss is perfect for helping get into difficult areas betwen teeth.</li>
            <li>I went from being in tears trying to floss my teeth to finally heaving a sigh of relief with a smile once I figured out how to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s short, flimsy, &amp; bends so easily, it doesn&#x27;t do the job it was designed to accomplish</li>
            <li>It works great for its intended purposes, and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the stiffened insert end could be a little stiffer.</li>
            <li>the floss portion used to be much thicker, fluffier &amp; stronger.</li>
            <li>Flosser s work really well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, these flossers do NOT work when the brackets are placed very closely together.  </li>
            <li>This is obviously a product where no one at Oral-B who is involved with the manufacturing actually uses their own product.  </li>
            <li>The threader end is stiff so you can push it between your teeth very easily.</li>
            <li>although I wish they&#x27;d cost less, of course:-)</li>
            <li>Amazon was the only place where I could find this super floss.</li>
            <li>Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution.</li>
            <li>A regular simple floss would have been better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>The stiff end of this floss is sturdy and works quite well as a threader for retainers and braces, and the spongy middle portion seems to do a good job of cleaning out the dirt on the sides of your teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li>if you have a little more of a gap in between your teeth where food gets stuck...</li>
            <li>I also love how this little box fits neatly in my purse, and that the strands are pre-cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The threader is flimsy and the spongy part is not nearly as thick.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years, and my dental office visits are trouble free!</li>
            <li>the threader part used to be longer &amp; stiffer, thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework, especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li>It works even better than the stiff threader my orthodontist provided.  </li>
            <li>They work fine -only order because can&#x27;t buy locally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li>I took a star off because I often have to get a new piece</li>
            <li>All of the floss boxes were open at the top and they all looked like they&#x27;d had a very rough life already</li>
            <li>I do NOT try to use this floss where I would normally used regular, waxed floss, and really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would even try that.</li>
            <li>It has been quite the journey during the first week getting used to them and all their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;:  the sores in my inner cheek, the difficulty eating food and eliminating certain foods I used to eat, and especially the challenge of keeping my teeth and gums</li>
            <li>But the regular floss portion of this product is definitely subpar -- it is not waxed enough to be comfortable to floss with, and it is not tough enough to make it through your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>I bought some recently after many years and it is clearly NOT the same product!</li>
            <li>Love this product, which is hard to find these days.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The shape of the regular section is roundish, compared to the more ribbon-like, flatter Glide, which contributes to the difficulty in getting it into narrow spaces.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li>Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li>This is so much more convenient than the floss theaders with regular dental floss, and the thick cushiony section for wide spaces is useful, too.</li>
            <li>I can easily thread its tiny, narrow, stiff end right in between the narrowest of crevices (under the arch wire) in order to floss.  </li>
            <li>As time has gone by, the \\&quot;suits\\&quot; have apparently penny-pinched the manufacturing to the extent that you literally have to toss 25-30% of any box, and the rest of the box BARELY works.  </li>
            <li>Out of a box of 50, you can barely use 35-40 of the threaded flossers.  </li>
            <li>If your teeth or gums are sensitive, or if your teeth are close together (as my molars are), I&#x27;d recommend Glide or a regular floss used with a threader instead.</li>
            <li>As reviews have stated, the floss is more round than others causing it to barely make it&#x27;s way through tight teeth.</li>
            <li>I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home, usually, its the only hanger thats empty.</li>

            <li> Had a major oral surgery that required implants and a dental bridge and this Oral-B Super Floss is perfect for helping get into difficult areas betwen teeth.</li>
            <li> I went from being in tears trying to floss my teeth to finally heaving a sigh of relief with a smile once I figured out how to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s short, flimsy, &amp; bends so easily, it doesn&#x27;t do the job it was designed to accomplish</li>
            <li> It works great for its intended purposes, and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the stiffened insert end could be a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> the floss portion used to be much thicker, fluffier &amp; stronger.</li>
            <li> Flosser s work really well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, these flossers do NOT work when the brackets are placed very closely together.  </li>
            <li> This is obviously a product where no one at Oral-B who is involved with the manufacturing actually uses their own product.  </li>
            <li> The threader end is stiff so you can push it between your teeth very easily.</li>
            <li> although I wish they&#x27;d cost less, of course:-)</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only place where I could find this super floss.</li>
            <li> Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution.</li>
            <li> A regular simple floss would have been better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> The stiff end of this floss is sturdy and works quite well as a threader for retainers and braces, and the spongy middle portion seems to do a good job of cleaning out the dirt on the sides of your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li> if you have a little more of a gap in between your teeth where food gets stuck...</li>
            <li> I also love how this little box fits neatly in my purse, and that the strands are pre-cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The threader is flimsy and the spongy part is not nearly as thick.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and my dental office visits are trouble free!</li>
            <li> the threader part used to be longer &amp; stiffer, thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework, especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> It works even better than the stiff threader my orthodontist provided.  </li>
            <li> They work fine -only order because can&#x27;t buy locally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> I took a star off because I often have to get a new piece</li>
            <li> All of the floss boxes were open at the top and they all looked like they&#x27;d had a very rough life already</li>
            <li> I do NOT try to use this floss where I would normally used regular, waxed floss, and really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would even try that.</li>
            <li> It has been quite the journey during the first week getting used to them and all their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;:  the sores in my inner cheek, the difficulty eating food and eliminating certain foods I used to eat, and especially the challenge of keeping my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> But the regular floss portion of this product is definitely subpar -- it is not waxed enough to be comfortable to floss with, and it is not tough enough to make it through your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought some recently after many years and it is clearly NOT the same product!</li>
            <li> Love this product, which is hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The shape of the regular section is roundish, compared to the more ribbon-like, flatter Glide, which contributes to the difficulty in getting it into narrow spaces.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li> Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li> This is so much more convenient than the floss theaders with regular dental floss, and the thick cushiony section for wide spaces is useful, too.</li>
            <li> I can easily thread its tiny, narrow, stiff end right in between the narrowest of crevices (under the arch wire) in order to floss.  </li>
            <li> As time has gone by, the \\&quot;suits\\&quot; have apparently penny-pinched the manufacturing to the extent that you literally have to toss 25-30% of any box, and the rest of the box BARELY works.  </li>
            <li> Out of a box of 50, you can barely use 35-40 of the threaded flossers.  </li>
            <li> If your teeth or gums are sensitive, or if your teeth are close together (as my molars are), I&#x27;d recommend Glide or a regular floss used with a threader instead.</li>
            <li> As reviews have stated, the floss is more round than others causing it to barely make it&#x27;s way through tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home, usually, its the only hanger thats empty.</li>
            <li> Although Oral B Super Floss offers several features for people with braces, bridges, and other dental work, including a wide, spongy area for teeth that are further apart, I found the regular floss section to be hard to get between teeth that are close together and harsh feeling against them.</li>
            <li> The threader part is way too soft, it bends and will not go in the tight spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of the same product and it&#x27;s like pulling rope through your mouth...much too larger to go through</li>
            <li> I have braces and have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Due to how my teeth need to move and rotate properly, my orthodontist placed the brackets on two adjoining teeth (on each side) very, very closely together, so the Platypus flosser does not fit at all in between these teeth because the space between the brackets is too narrow.  </li>
            <li> This could have been easily avoided with the proper shipping filler materials and a decent quality control check before sending them off on their apparently brutal journey.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product in the past, but now the product is useless.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps all those frustrated souls who, like me, struggle with very crowded teeth and newly placed braces and who were beginning to think flossing effectively would be impossible.  </li>

            <li> Years ago I used this product around some widely spaced teeth I had</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> They work like a charm and are getting harder and harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is better priced and less painful.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in the drug stores and other stores.</li>
            <li> and no doubt a rough trip from soap.com to our place!  </li>
            <li> I hope I don&#x27;t have to depend on soap.com for any future purchases due to this poor example of their packaging.</li>
            <li> The new superfloss I bought with the coupon is just as bad, totally unusable.  </li>
            <li> had read the poor reviews, and always try to keep an open mind.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your  funds.  </li>
            <li> I like the really fluffy part after the threader.</li>
            <li> I was impossible to floss her molars since you couldn&#x27;t see the floss (if was colored instead of just white, it might have been difficult but not impossible).</li>
            <li> This one had ends that were supposed to be stiff, but</li>
            <li> because sometimes the hard plastic part that lets you push the floss through the tight spaces is too flimsy to work.</li>
            <li> However, you cannot shipped small cardboard packages inside an envelope.  </li>
            <li> The box received was broken and crushed.</li>
            <li> I still use this product because it&#x27;s less expensive than the competition, but probably not much longer.  </li>
            <li> While that doesn&#x27;t change it&#x27;s usefulness, it&#x27;s aggravating to deal with the broken down boxes.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It has a sturdy threader and thick, durable spongy floss.</li>
            <li> Now it is a mere shadow of itself, and as such is totally useless.</li>
            <li> Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too thin and cuts my gums.  </li>
            <li> The probe (rigid end section) is almost as limp as overcooked pasta, rendering the hapless user unable to insert/thread the product where it has to go.  </li>
            <li> There must have been a bad run of these at some point, judging by the negative comments I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is the \\&quot;suits\\&quot; who ruined this product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When the order arrived, the boxes were open and ripped.  They didn&#x27;t look like an unopened product.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only place where I could find this super floss. It&#x27;s great for under a permanent bridge.</li>
            <li> my dentist recommended</li>
            <li> Love the product and have used it for years but this time when it arrived...several boxes and they were all crushed.</li>
            <li> My daughter just got her braces and it took her more than an hour to floss her teeth (leaving out the molars) since the floss shreds. I was impossible to floss her molars since you couldn&#x27;t see the floss (if was colored instead of just white, it might have been difficult but not impossible). Won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> so this is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used!!! It can get under the permanent retainer I have on my lower teeth, I used to use those threaders which are not as convenient. I love this floss!!</li>
            <li> I have braces and have been using this product for a long time. But I can not find it in stores any more, so I was delighted to find it in Amazon. A very durable, never-shedding super floss! Do not use others. The price was so good and delivery was so fast.</li>
            <li> This is IMHO the best floss you can get with or without braces. It takes some practice, and when you get it, you will see how effective this floss is. The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth. It will shred if you get it caught on your braces or if you snag it on something but again it takes practice to avoid doing that. I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home, usually, its the only hanger thats empty. Annoying so I have had to buy online.</li>
            <li> I have two bridges and use this product every day along with regular floss. I do NOT try to use this floss where I would normally used regular, waxed floss, and really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would even try that. It works great for its intended purposes, and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the stiffened insert end could be a little stiffer. Sometimes it takes 4-5 attempts to get it under a bridge. It&#x27;s actually a 4.5 star product for me....although I wish they&#x27;d cost less, of course:-)</li>
            <li> Years ago I used this product around some widely spaced teeth I had and I loved it. I bought some recently after many years and it is clearly NOT the same product! I recently got two implant bridges and the dentist told me to use Super Floss to clean around the implant posts. The threader is flimsy and the spongy part is not nearly as thick. Instead get TePe Bridge and Implant Floss. It has a sturdy threader and thick, durable spongy floss.</li>
            <li> We got the product we are used to using.</li>
            <li> use it to clean hearing aids</li>
            <li> The stiff end of this floss is sturdy and works quite well as a threader for retainers and braces, and the spongy middle portion seems to do a good job of cleaning out the dirt on the sides of your teeth. But the regular floss portion of this product is definitely subpar -- it is not waxed enough to be comfortable to floss with, and it is not tough enough to make it through your whole mouth. I was originally hoping to be able to use one or two of these flosses per session to clean my whole mouth, but in practice I use one for my permanent retainer and I pick up the nice, waxed regular floss (also from Oral-B, coincidentally) to do the rest of my mouth. Nonetheless, this product serves its unique purpose well, so I still give it 4/5.</li>
            <li> This is so much more convenient than the floss theaders with regular dental floss, and the thick cushiony section for wide spaces is useful, too. I took a star off because I often have to get a new piece because sometimes the hard plastic part that lets you push the floss through the tight spaces is too flimsy to work.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.  They work like a charm and are getting harder and harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge and been using superfloss.  I was satisfied with the product in the past, but now the product is useless.  The threader part is way too soft, it bends and will not go in the tight spots.  I&#x27;ve had to go back to threaders and regular floss.   I called customer service, they sent me a coupon and a mail back packet for the defective stuff.  The new superfloss I bought with the coupon is just as bad, totally unusable.  Don&#x27;t buy this product, quality control is an issue right now.</li>
            <li> Product is fine.  However, you cannot shipped small cardboard packages inside an envelope.  All boxes of floss were smashed.  While that doesn&#x27;t change it&#x27;s usefulness, it&#x27;s aggravating to deal with the broken down boxes.</li>
            <li> This product is excellant for cleanng between teeth and aiding in maintaining a bright smile when used with daily brushing.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in the drug stores and other stores. This is a great and easy product to use. I have dental implants and I don&#x27;t need a floss finder to floss.</li>
            <li> I still use this product because it&#x27;s less expensive than the competition, but probably not much longer.  I&#x27;ve used this product from its inception many years ago.  Originally, it was VERY good.  It threaded easily, and the spongy part did a good job of cleaning under the bridge.  As time has gone by, the \\&quot;suits\\&quot; have apparently penny-pinched the manufacturing to the extent that you literally have to toss 25-30% of any box, and the rest of the box BARELY works.  You&#x27;d have to buy floss threaders to make them all work, which is what you&#x27;re trying to avoid if you buy this product in the first place.  Out of a box of 50, you can barely use 35-40 of the threaded flossers.  The quality control is terrible.  This is obviously a product where no one at Oral-B who is involved with the manufacturing actually uses their own product.  They&#x27;ve penny-pinched to the point they can probably afford to use [[ASIN:B000GGJCDY Crest Glide Threader Dental Floss Packets - 30 Ea]].  The sad thing is the \\&quot;suits\\&quot; who ruined this product probably got company awards for their \\&quot;innovative\\&quot; cost-cutting.</li>
            <li> I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s wrong with it?&lt;br /&gt;1- the threader part used to be longer &amp; stiffer, thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework, especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it&#x27;s short, flimsy, &amp; bends so easily, it doesn&#x27;t do the job it was designed to accomplish&lt;br /&gt;2- the floss portion used to be much thicker, fluffier &amp; stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself, and as such is totally useless. And, it shreds!&lt;br /&gt;I had read the poor reviews, and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution.</li>
            <li> The box received was broken and crushed. However, since it was contained in a plastic box, I did not complain. The thread is as good as expected however, the point could use more wax to be able to use  without threading.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than threading your own bridgework floss.  Pricey but worth it. All in one floss!  I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Although Oral B Super Floss offers several features for people with braces, bridges, and other dental work, including a wide, spongy area for teeth that are further apart, I found the regular floss section to be hard to get between teeth that are close together and harsh feeling against them. The shape of the regular section is roundish, compared to the more ribbon-like, flatter Glide, which contributes to the difficulty in getting it into narrow spaces. If your teeth or gums are sensitive, or if your teeth are close together (as my molars are), I&#x27;d recommend Glide or a regular floss used with a threader instead.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY floss I use.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of the same product and it&#x27;s like pulling rope through your mouth...much too larger to go through but these are the perfect size and I can easily floss without losing grip. The threader end is stiff so you can push it between your teeth very easily. The fuzzy part gets up under the gums without hurting you. It&#x27;s just a really great product that I have a hard time finding at the store. It&#x27;s either sold out or they don&#x27;t carry it but I know I can always get it here :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to clean under my bridge.  It works great for that.  The regular floss part of it does not work well on the rest of my teeth... it&#x27;s too thin and cuts my gums.  I use a different floss for that!</li>
            <li> great product! Its just what i was looking for with a great price and fast shipping too!! what a consept in this day and age!!!</li>
            <li> If the floss were not sealed in a plastic wrap, I would have returned all 4 boxes.  The shipping envelope was very poor and with no filler materials whatsoever.  All of the floss boxes were open at the top and they all looked like they&#x27;d had a very rough life already and no doubt a rough trip from soap.com to our place!  This could have been easily avoided with the proper shipping filler materials and a decent quality control check before sending them off on their apparently brutal journey. I hope I don&#x27;t have to depend on soap.com for any future purchases due to this poor example of their packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for my permanent retainers.</li>
            <li> I use it for my bridge and for flossing the rest of my teeth. Great product.  I buy it by the dozen.</li>
            <li> Flosser s work really well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your  funds.  The probe (rigid end section) is almost as limp as overcooked pasta, rendering the hapless user unable to insert/thread the product where it has to go.  I will never purchase another product by this (formerly) reputable outfit again.</li>
            <li> Had a major oral surgery that required implants and a dental bridge and this Oral-B Super Floss is perfect for helping get into difficult areas betwen teeth. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff to clean in between your teeth....if you have a little more of a gap in between your teeth where food gets stuck...this is the best stuff to clean your teeth with....a must buy</li>
            <li> Love this product, which is hard to find these days. I&#x27;m so afraid the manufacturer is discontinuing it</li>
            <li> Using Oral B Super Floss takes a while to adjust to.  It works well when one is used to it and seems to be perfect for one with implants that need to be kept clean.</li>
            <li> Quality item.  Thank you.  Klara</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and my dental office visits are trouble free!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores. Love them.</li>
            <li> After getting my braces on and having this product recommended to me by the assistant at the orthodontist&#x27;s office, I went out and bought a pack of this. While flossing is easier, the regular floss was a pain in the rear-end to use. As reviews have stated, the floss is more round than others causing it to barely make it&#x27;s way through tight teeth. It took a lot of work to floss my top teeth and the floss did not even go in between my bottom teeth. It was painful and did not work for me, so I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars since it may work for some.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a permanent bridge because it is easily inserted and effectively cleans food particles as well as plaque.</li>
            <li> Works great for bridges. I&#x27;ve tried Thornton bridge cleaner floss. Oral-B is better priced and less painful. I will continue to use Oral-B Superfloss for my bridge and regular Glide for the rest of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had many issues with my teeth and as a result, I now have several implants and a bridge. My dentist recommended this product and I am so glad he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works. It allows me to get under my bridge and my implants. The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s easy to use. The tip is coated so it&#x27;s easy to get it between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s high quality so it doesn&#x27;t shred. I made the mistake of trying a cheaper store brand and two things happened: 1. the floss shredded and was useless 2. it loosened my bridge. So I say you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li> There must have been a bad run of these at some point, judging by the negative comments I&#x27;ve seen. However, the batch we just got was perfect. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I am a 46-year-old woman who just got braces.  It has been quite the journey during the first week getting used to them and all their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;:  the sores in my inner cheek, the difficulty eating food and eliminating certain foods I used to eat, and especially the challenge of keeping my teeth and gums clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on different orthodontics flossing devices, and I ending up buying Platypus orthodontic flossers along with Oral-B Superfloss, G.U.M. Go Betweens Proxabrushes, regular floss to be used occasionally with the threader from my orthodontist, and a 10X magnification mirror.  I went from being in tears trying to floss my teeth to finally heaving a sigh of relief with a smile once I figured out how to keep my teeth clean.  Here is what I have found works best:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Platypus flossers are wonderful, easy to use, and the easiest of all the flossers in terms of &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;.  That is, I don&#x27;t have to look in the mirror to use them.  I can easily tell by feel where to place the Platypus under the wire between my brackets.  However, these flossers do NOT work when the brackets are placed very closely together.  This is the case with my bicuspids and cuspids.  Due to how my teeth need to move and rotate properly, my orthodontist placed the brackets on two adjoining teeth (on each side) very, very closely together, so the Platypus flosser does not fit at all in between these teeth because the space between the brackets is too narrow.  It won&#x27;t even fit under the arch wire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that case, the Oral-B Superfloss is my perfect solution.  I can easily thread its tiny, narrow, stiff end right in between the narrowest of crevices (under the arch wire) in order to floss.  It works even better than the stiff threader my orthodontist provided.  I wouldn&#x27;t be able to floss everything without it.  It is so easy to use that I tend to use the Superfloss more often than the Platypus flossers.  I also love how this little box fits neatly in my purse, and that the strands are pre-cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my premolars and molars, both the Superfloss and these Platypus flossers work almost equally well.  Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  I use the G-U-M Go Betweens back here, also, because they are perfect for clearing packed food from between my brackets and around the arch wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror. Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  I needed both hands to separate my lips and cheek from the flossing area, and I couldn&#x27;t do that while holding a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, with all of these tools, I can floss faster and more easily!  I hope this helps all those frustrated souls who, like me, struggle with very crowded teeth and newly placed braces and who were beginning to think flossing effectively would be impossible.  It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  Don&#x27;t give up, and you will find the solution that is best for you.fits neatly in my purse, and that the strands are pre-cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my premolars and molars, both the Superfloss and these Platypus flossers work almost equally well.

            <li> It works great for my bridges!</li>
            <li> Great for flossing around my implant and bridge! Works much better then the threaders and regular floss. Would recommend for anyone with implants.</li>
            <li> Super floss was good but regular non-waxed floss portion was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Best product I have used.with my relatively new bridge.</li>
            <li> Good product from Oral B, a must in your bathroom</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for many years and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> They work fine -only order because can&#x27;t buy locally.</li>
            <li> I had a similar floss by Dentek, that I really liked, but could not find again. This one had ends that were supposed to be stiff, but bent over when I tried to push between my teeth. A regular simple floss would have been better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and type of floss since it first came out.  I&#x27;ve never found any I liked better for use with my bridge.  I like the really fluffy part after the threader.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.. Wish that it were thicker</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. (Implants)  Could not finish out the day without it.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I was looking for.</li>
