            <li>so I decided to order more</li>
            <li>I have been in love with this scent for some years.</li>
            <li>the green apple is perfect for the summer, so i thought for the winter red delicious would be a good choice.</li>

            <li>It still offers same great scent!</li>
            <li>and then its a nice sweet but mature smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>AND IT LASTS I pulled out a winter coat from last year and could smell my red delicious on it, didn&#x27;t need to spray again.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it smells better on you than me, but by all means try before you buy, because this one can completely change on skin.</li>
            <li>the  fragrance notes are: Lychee, Vanilla Bean, Champagne, Amber, Apple, Red Raspberry, Patchouli, Rose.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for,this as I love dkny red</li>
            <li>i was so right.</li>
            <li>In the bottle it smells exactly like the sort of perfume I like.  </li>
            <li>On my skin it smells exactly like what I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I will order  more later.</li>
            <li>When I firstly ordered it, the item was damaged.</li>
            <li>I will be shopping for more in the future</li>
            <li>fast delivery, just what was ordered, wife loves it</li>
            <li>figured i&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra and buy the real deal from a recognized seller.</li>
            <li>This did not smell at all like the perfume from department stores possibly old?</li>
            <li>Reasonable priced for a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>at first the perfume comes off a little strong, but you have to let it sit for a little while</li>

            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my Mom and she loves the scent.</li>
            <li> I wish this smelled as good on my skin as it does in the bottle.  In the bottle it smells like yummy, red, juicy, fruity perfume.  On my skin it smells like heavy floral, musky perfume.  In the bottle it smells exactly like the sort of perfume I like.  On my skin it smells exactly like what I don&#x27;t.  Hopefully it smells better on you than me, but by all means try before you buy, because this one can completely change on skin.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume. It still offers same great scent!</li>
            <li> This was a total fake! I know DKNY fragrances and I am disappointed that I spent so much money on a knock off! Please do not waste your money on this item. Spend the extra and buy the real deal from a recognized seller. Really disappointing....</li>

            <li> It was a gift for my mom and is very happy with perfume, recommended 100%</li>
            <li> DKNY Red Delicious smells amazing on the right person. Out of all the fragrances I wear I receive 90 percent of of compliments when wearing this. The regular delicious can be suffocating and strong with more than one spray, red delicious is perfect and lasts all day with just 2 or 3. AND IT LASTS I pulled out a winter coat from last year and could smell my red delicious on it, didn&#x27;t need to spray again. PLEASE PLEASE BRING THIS BACK...UN-DISCONTINUE IT...if that&#x27;s even a word.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this scent for some years. Its a simplistic scent in which to me is a light berry or fruity smell. Based off of Fragrance.net the  fragrance notes are: Lychee, Vanilla Bean, Champagne, Amber, Apple, Red Raspberry, Patchouli, Rose. It&#x27;s a great scent , which you will love. It will be great for day as well as evening wear.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for,this as I love dkny red but this was not dkny red. It smells awful</li>
            <li> This DKNY doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same sent that I remember  from a smaller size that I received as a gift a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> This product does not even deserve 1 star! When I firstly ordered it, the item was damaged. Wonderful Amazon team replaced an item for me. I though that would be it.... I only used perfume once when it just came and all the time it was on the shelf. Today I wanted to use it but the sprayer broke!!! Really???!!!</li>
            <li> i had the green apple dkny, well it was my mothers and i just never gave it back. i LOVED the way that smelled but figured i&#x27;d try something new. the green apple is perfect for the summer, so i thought for the winter red delicious would be a good choice. i was so right. at first the perfume comes off a little strong, but you have to let it sit for a little while and then its a nice sweet but mature smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance!  My mom always requests this as a gift.</li>
            <li> Not scent, I prefer the regular Be Delicious, but this one is an interesting difference to the others.</li>
