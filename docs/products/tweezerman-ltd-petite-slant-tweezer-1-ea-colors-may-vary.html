            <li>Good tweezers, but the case doesn&#x27;t stay together.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and the woman I&#x27;m dating just bought her own pair because she loved mine.  </li>
            <li>They were amazing.  </li>
            <li>This mini-tweezer in its own case is so well-designed, and made.</li>
            <li>This compact tweezer is nice and comes with case, if you keep in pocket you won&#x27;t jab yourself.</li>
            <li>The light is perfect, you Don&#x27;t have to twist or turn your head to get the room light</li>
            <li>Case is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>A nice addition to a bugout bag or emergency kit.</li>
            <li>And nice to have a case to keep safe.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the first ones I ordered these.</li>
            <li>The case is nice to have and makes packing it for travel easy and safe (you don&#x27;t have to worry about it puncturing your shampoo accidentally in your dopp kit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Favorite tweezers ever.  </li>
            <li>My favorite tweezers.</li>
            <li>They effortlessly are able to grab and hold onto the hair when I tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I like this size better than the longer ones, as I feel they offer a bit more control.</li>
            <li>Just the tweezers I&#x27;ve been looking for, but wish we were able to pick the color of the case.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>So, I think these are going to suit my need much better.</li>
            <li>I do not think these ones are as good as the first ones.  </li>
            <li>This is sharp and perfect!  </li>
            <li>Comes apart easily.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these tweezers, nice tight grip at the end and a great carrying case.</li>
            <li>The mirror with light allows the smallest and thinnest of hairs to be seen.</li>
            <li>This is the first pair I have not been satisfied with.</li>
            <li>I read a review where another customer mentioned that Tweezerman products coming from India where not as good as the Italian ones.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I gave a couple out last year to my sisters and they love them as well!</li>
            <li>She is right, the Tweezerman I received are from India and compared to other Tweezerman products they are not as good.</li>
            <li>The tweezers themselves are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>The case, however, is fragile and comes apart at the hinge pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Great value; works as well as the expensive german kind.</li>
            <li>Combine this with Tweezerman LTD slant tweezers and you get great tools for those white and black hairs that pop up.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to pull out the super fine hairs like the other ones I have from tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>I got these after buying another pair a few years back and they were great</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure, because mine are very girly pink.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; no problem holding the smaller size, although I do have decent manual dexterity.</li>
            <li>Also easy to dig a hole in skin; got to be careful.</li>
            <li>I looked on the box, and I found the main difference...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Will probably buy a few more of these.</li>
            <li>rotating part of case looks a lit bit fragile, but strong enough.</li>
            <li>The lifetime sharpening that Tweezerman offers is just an added bonus!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also stick to the full size tweezers next time, they&#x27;re not that much smaller than the regular sized Tweezerman tweezers.  </li>
            <li>just right to see the hair only to loose it when you reach for the tweezers.</li>
            <li>I tried looking locally for great tweezers that would get those menacing little hairs, reading the packages, tilting them every which way to make sure they closed completely.</li>

            <li> Like that the tweezers come with a small plastic cap for the very tip of the tweezers, in addition to the overall case.</li>
            <li> They are thin and makes it easier to grab the hair even if the are super short.</li>
            <li> I have another set with comes in a case and every single time I pull them out to use, the cap is off.  </li>

            <li> Bought for my husband then it showed up pink!</li>

            <li> Like the few reviews down, I didn&#x27;t want pink!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands because Tweezerman will not be outdone in this space.  </li>

            <li> The tweezers are still secure in the base</li>
            <li> I recently dropped them tip down on tile and dented them badly.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a wee frustrating to hunt in my suitcase of a purse for the cap.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is sharp and perfect!  Small sized to keep in my drawer and works just like the real size!  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Favorite tweezers ever.  I guard them from my family so they don&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li> My favorite tweezers.</li>
            <li> Colors may vary... that&#x27;s for sure, because mine are very girly pink. I hate pink... good tweezers though</li>
            <li> it is well done. I has excellent quality. it is sharp and well polished, it has convenient size.  rotating part of case looks a lit bit fragile, but strong enough. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have had 6 pairs of these and only replaced because I lost them. This is the first pair I have not been satisfied with. They feel like the final polishing/finishing was not done. They do not perform as I have come to expect from tweezerman. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Used these to pull a big sliver out of my kids foot. This thing is well built and the case is an added bonus. Will probably buy a few more of these.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grab the hair as easily as other tweezers. Otherwise, they are a nice size and the case is great to protect them.</li>
            <li> The tweezers themselves are nice and sharp. The case, however, is fragile and comes apart at the hinge pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband then it showed up pink! Feel disappointed and tricked by the green picture. But it works.</li>
            <li> These are some seriously awesome Tweezers.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands because Tweezerman will not be outdone in this space.  I&#x27;m a guy, and the woman I&#x27;m dating just bought her own pair because she loved mine.  The case is nice to have and makes packing it for travel easy and safe (you don&#x27;t have to worry about it puncturing your shampoo accidentally in your dopp kit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I received a pair of Tweezerman tweezers (Swiss made) about 8 years ago as a gift from my sister.  They were amazing.  I recently dropped them tip down on tile and dented them badly.  I decided to stick with the brand and get these.  Not even close to the same quality.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they work pretty well, but not remotely as well as my old pair despite them being several years old.  I looked on the box, and I found the main difference... These are &amp;#34;Made In India&amp;#34;.  I would also stick to the full size tweezers next time, they&#x27;re not that much smaller than the regular sized Tweezerman tweezers.  Keep shopping!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, exactly as described. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Tweezerman honors all their products and happily keeps your items in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers ever made. They effortlessly are able to grab and hold onto the hair when I tweeze my eyebrows. The case comes apart, but is so great for carrying in my purse. I like this size better than the longer ones, as I feel they offer a bit more control.The lifetime sharpening that Tweezerman offers is just an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are absolutely great stocking stuffers-I gave a couple out last year to my sisters and they love them as well!</li>
            <li> The tweezers are good but the carry case is horrible.  Comes apart easily.  I would give 5 stars for the tweezers, 1 star for the case.</li>
            <li> I got these after buying another pair a few years back and they were great and I needed some for my purse.  I do not think these ones are as good as the first ones.  They don&#x27;t seem to pull out the super fine hairs like the other ones I have from tweezerman.  I wont spend the money on another pair now.</li>
            <li> This mini-tweezer in its own case is so well-designed, and made. Perfect for travel or purse. Wouldn&#x27;t go on vacation without it! Great price and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Just the tweezers I&#x27;ve been looking for, but wish we were able to pick the color of the case. Like the few reviews down, I didn&#x27;t want pink!</li>

            <li> I like tweezerman products. This compact tweezer is nice and comes with case, if you keep in pocket you won&#x27;t jab yourself.</li>
            <li> Combine this with Tweezerman LTD slant tweezers and you get great tools for those white and black hairs that pop up. The mirror with light allows the smallest and thinnest of hairs to be seen. I was so happy with the first ones I ordered these. The light is perfect, you Don&#x27;t have to twist or turn your head to get the room light just right to see the hair only to loose it when you reach for the tweezers. I tried looking locally for great tweezers that would get those menacing little hairs, reading the packages, tilting them every which way to make sure they closed completely. I would get them home and they may work for a short time but eventually I&#x27;m out looking for another one. Not any more. I have a travel set, a purse set, and a set in the bathroom. Mr.Tweezeman is my tweezers!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these tweezers, nice tight grip at the end and a great carrying case.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers, but the case doesn&#x27;t stay together.  I have dispensed with the case and just keep them loose in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I read a review where another customer mentioned that Tweezerman products coming from India where not as good as the Italian ones. He/She is right, the Tweezerman I received are from India and compared to other Tweezerman products they are not as good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; no problem holding the smaller size, although I do have decent manual dexterity. Grabs those little &amp;#34;barely out of the skin&amp;#34; hairs. Also easy to dig a hole in skin; got to be careful. Like that the tweezers come with a small plastic cap for the very tip of the tweezers, in addition to the overall case.</li>
            <li> Great tweezer. And nice to have a case to keep safe.</li>
            <li> Great value; works as well as the expensive german kind. Case is a nice touch.  Tweezerman is a great brand.</li>
            <li> Like so well, I buy them for my friends.</li>
            <li> I think these are going to be perfect in my purse.  I have another set with comes in a case and every single time I pull them out to use, the cap is off.  The tweezers are still secure in the base but it&#x27;s just a wee frustrating to hunt in my suitcase of a purse for the cap.  The &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; on these aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  So, I think these are going to suit my need much better.</li>
            <li> Great stainless-steel product with a convenient carrying and protective case.  A nice addition to a bugout bag or emergency kit.</li>
