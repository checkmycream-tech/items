            <li>My cuticles are much better after washing with this soap.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more when this is gone.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the maker would work on creating a better scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very rich lather, unlike most olive oil soaps.</li>

            <li>It is great for people who have lots of allergies and are sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>the soap is very creamy and good for the skin</li>
            <li>It is so easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It has a strong medicinal odor that has a way of filling the room.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, gentler than brush cleaners.</li>
            <li>Keeps fine brush hair intact if used along with conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fantastic replacement for chef&#x27;s soap we can&#x27;t t get anymore.</li>
            <li>I am used to the original cream colored Savon de Marseille, with a clean scent.</li>
            <li>I would buy this product again and would recommend it to anyone who wants your body to feel soft and smell great  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap to clean oil paint of brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap originally to clean an antique oil painting.  </li>
            <li>Very nice for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Cleans up quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the easy shipping.</li>
            <li>Did not get out my old grease stain in fav sweatshirt but love the fragrance and smoothness as a hand soap.</li>
            <li>This comes in a very large bar that lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>Finally finished that huge block of Savon De Marseille that we bought in Nice in early April 2013.</li>
            <li>Love, love this soap and lasts much longer than other soap bars (handmade or mass produced).  </li>
            <li>Love the natural fragrance and how gentle &amp; moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap very much-</li>
            <li>Very gentle too.</li>
            <li>This soap is far, far better.</li>
            <li>It is outstanding for people with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>she loves the soap and the shape....will certainly buy again</li>
            <li>This soap is so gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The unscented version, which is what I bought, does have a very soapy scent.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>and she was very please</li>
            <li>Has a lovely subtle scent and leaves skin clean yet moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It just crumbles into many odd shaped unusable slivers.  </li>
            <li>A little scrub brush sits on top of it</li>
            <li>I am used to my German Kernseife, which is something similar to this, but the smell of the German soap is more neutral.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I really like.</li>
            <li>Run the soap under water, and the messy coating disappears, leaving an olive oil soap so rich you won&#x27;t need lotion after the bath.  </li>

            <li> I bought this as a small every day type of gift for my fiance......</li>
            <li> The soap provides very little lather;  its square shape makes it difficult to use; it is just not what it should be.  </li>
            <li> One of Amazon buyer reviews suggested cutting the cube of soap into pieces and using it that way.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this soap in the past, but this one smells terrible...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love my soap.  Thanks for the easy shipping.</li>
            <li> love this soap .  It  leave your body so soft and feels great.  I would buy this product again and would recommend it to anyone who wants your body to feel soft and smell great  thank you</li>
            <li> I use it on dishes. Cleans up quickly. Doesn&#x27;t dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have bought this soap in the past, but this one smells terrible...a very strong plastic smell. I have used it over 20 times, hoping the smell came from the packaging. No luck.</li>
            <li> the soap is very creamy and good for the skin but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all. I am used to my German Kernseife, which is something similar to this, but the smell of the German soap is more neutral.</li>
            <li> This soap is so gentle on the skin. It is great for people who have lots of allergies and are sensitive to chemicals. This comes in a very large bar that lasts quite a while. This is the only soap I really like.</li>
            <li> LOVE this soap.  Love the natural fragrance and how gentle &amp; moisturizing it is.  My husband and I each have sensitive/dry skin.  Also, it lasts!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soapmaker, and I&#x27;ve made many batches of 100% olive oil soap. This soap is far, far better. It has a very rich lather, unlike most olive oil soaps. The unscented version, which is what I bought, does have a very soapy scent. If this isn&#x27;t what you want, I&#x27;d suggest buying the scented.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  It arrived, looking like an old cube of dried out chocolate -- white, crumbly, caky.  That is, in fact, the only reason I awarded four stars instead of five.  Run the soap under water, and the messy coating disappears, leaving an olive oil soap so rich you won&#x27;t need lotion after the bath.  Even in Texas.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Very nice for dry skin. However the pungent smell is not that great. I am used to the original cream colored Savon de Marseille, with a clean scent.</li>
            <li> When I visited France years ago, I really liked the Marseille soap.  On returning, I found a source, and got it for several years, until the source stopped carrying it.  That soap was outstanding.  THIS soap, on the other hand, is not even close!  The soap provides very little lather;  its square shape makes it difficult to use; it is just not what it should be.  Buyer beware!  \\&quot;Marseille Soap\\&quot; is a generic term, but all soap with the name is not the same!  NOT recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to clean oil paint of brushes. Works fine, gentler than brush cleaners. Keeps fine brush hair intact if used along with conditioner. Arrived earlier than expected. Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Did not get out my old grease stain in fav sweatshirt but love the fragrance and smoothness as a hand soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a small every day type of gift for my fiance......she loves the soap and the shape....will certainly buy again</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my fruits and veggies and nothing works better.  A little scrub brush sits on top of it and I use it all the time.  Nothing like it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!! Leaves a nice clean and smooth feel to your skin. My cuticles are much better after washing with this soap. I even used it to shampoo my hair and it worked great!!</li>
            <li> It is a fine soap, just not so much better than others.</li>
            <li> Olive oil soap has been recommended by all instructors I&#x27;ve had in felting classes.  It is so easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Fantastic replacement for chef&#x27;s soap we can&#x27;t t get anymore. No scent and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I like this soap very much- makes my skin feel very nice. I don&#x27;t like the smell however and next order will consider the lavender.</li>
            <li> Happy that these soaps are available on Amazon.! Finally finished that huge block of Savon De Marseille that we bought in Nice in early April 2013.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap originally to clean an antique oil painting.  An antique dealer recommended it.  I could not stand the way it smelled.  It has a strong medicinal odor that has a way of filling the room.  One of Amazon buyer reviews suggested cutting the cube of soap into pieces and using it that way.  Forget that.  It just crumbles into many odd shaped unusable slivers.  It set around my house for about 6 months unused.  Several weeks ago I decided to try bathing with it since it was 72% olive oil and I have dry skin.  Well, now I am a believer.  It is outstanding for people with dry skin.  I plan to buy more when this is gone.  I just wish the maker would work on creating a better scent.</li>
            <li> I think that the size of the soaps are not the standard size, they are smaller than I expected . I grew up in France and was &amp;#34; raised&amp;#34; with&lt;br /&gt; the &amp;#34; Savon de Marseille &amp;#34; !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;AT</li>
            <li> The wife has used it before, a friend left a bar for her and she was very please how well it works on  stains, she knew what she was into.</li>
            <li> Love, love this soap and lasts much longer than other soap bars (handmade or mass produced).  Has a lovely subtle scent and leaves skin clean yet moisturized.  Very gentle too.</li>
