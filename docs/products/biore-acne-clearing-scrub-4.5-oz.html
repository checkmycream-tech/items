            <li>again has proven to be the best remedy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>Also smells great.</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid is great for acne</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and works great for that too..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s milder than Benzoyl Peroxide, but still very effective.</li>
            <li>It also has a great smell and was a good price, so I would recommend.</li>
            <li>You do feel that it cleans well and does have a pleasant sent.  </li>
            <li>I think this product does a good job, but i rather [[ASIN:B000FQNQNM B000FQNQNM]]</li>
            <li>I thought that the cooling sensation was good and meant that it was working</li>
            <li>The lumpiness and discoloration is dissipating and my skin looks good.</li>

            <li>Good scrub for oily skin.</li>
            <li>good product.update</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve used from Biore.</li>
            <li>It is a really great product my daughter has been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scrub!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell and texture of the scrub and am happy with the results on my skin.</li>
            <li>I liked this as a face wash.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how effective it is after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li>also liked the scent a lot.</li>
            <li>This is great, especially because in order to get the best results you need to use it twice</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I have seen some progress with my acne.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and found that this seems to be doing the most good.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a nice moisterizer after this product to keep it from over drying skin.</li>
            <li>could honestly see a difference in my face after using this scrub just twice.</li>
            <li>Biore products are VERY the very best.</li>
            <li>and I really liked that this product kept my face oil-free and not shiny throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I really love this face wash, and I especially love getting it for cheap using Amazon&#x27;s coupon.&lt;br /&gt;Feels really nice, with a cool feeling after washing.  </li>
            <li>This has been one of the best scrubs I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Scrub is nice and gentle...exfoliates without feeling like you&#x27;ve just removed the top 10 layers of your face.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best two types of acne fighting ingredients I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>more it.  </li>
            <li>it got more oil and dirt off my skin even after using it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>To me it just works better than the Biore..</li>
            <li>I love the citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It is a great face scrub and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The scrub does make my face smoother but it also over dries my skin and causes more blemishes.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several Biore products, and this is among the best.</li>
            <li>so didn&#x27;t wear any makeup on top of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many scrubs over the years.  </li>
            <li>This has got to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>(with 2% salicylic acid), the Acne Clearing Scrub is thicker and more gelatinous (and of course is somewhat abrasive whereas the Ice Cleanser is not)</li>
            <li>Makes my skin nice and smooth after I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Esp in the winter months when my skin teds to break out more.</li>
            <li>Make sure to lotion afterwards to prevent dryness.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer something with more grit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like it better as a cleanser,</li>
            <li>There are more beads in it</li>
            <li>This is more of a gel than the Pore Unclogging Scrub</li>
            <li>After washing my face a couple of times I have noticed that I am breaking out more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so what might work for me might not be the best for your skin.  </li>
            <li>this may not be your favorite.</li>
            <li>This scrub also seems to be working its magic on my acne issues.</li>
            <li>love all the Biore products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I have buy one more for myself</li>
            <li>but I love the way it makes my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>system is MUCH, MUCH better than Proactive, which I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is looser and spreads more easily and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Biore has picked up on the great cleanser St. Ives has been making for years, and created their own formula similar to it.</li>
            <li>Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is a great scrub that even people with sensitive skin can use.  </li>
            <li>The Biore Acne Clearing Scrub has a nice orange or citrus smell that also helps calm your skin and prevent any irritation.</li>
            <li>Until now, I&#x27;ve always used Olay face stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sold on this, I just really love the cooling effects, I can&#x27;t get over how refreshing and energizing it is, its better than a morning cup of coffee to get you started for the day.</li>
            <li>The minty sensation in this product is too strong and it stings all over your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great new option for those who want a more mild exfoliant but still get the same great results from the buffing and the acne fighting results from the Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li>Felt fine in the shower if a bit abrasive.</li>
            <li>There are not a lot of grit for my likening, but it works fine to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>and I do not recommend it to people trying to get rid of mild acne!</li>
            <li>They all have mild acne (a dozen pimples at a time at the most).  </li>
            <li>My daughter has mild acne and my son&#x27;s is more severe.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff right here.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s cheap that you want, then&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scrub lightly exfoliates and</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the warming anti blackhead cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was taken aback by the fantastic icy/hot sensation when using this scrub...</li>
            <li>the product itself rinses away easily leaving the skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and non greasy</li>
            <li>primary ingredient is salicylic acid, which is associated with Reye&#x27;s Syndrome in children and adolescents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this product a couple of times, but it&#x27;s been great for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>My pores appeared to be minimized, my skin didn&#x27;t feel overly oily, and my complexion looked fresh and glowing (I love when that glowing look comes from clean looking skin rather than oily looking skin).</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads leaves skin feeling smooth, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with this face scrub.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth and cool and just refreshed after using this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got an amazing light, clean (faintly citrusy) scent and perfect texture.  </li>
            <li>This is a product you can truly use to get your face clean and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even want to put makeup on, it feels that clean.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating granules are great for sloughing off dead skin and I love the fresh orange fragrance.</li>
            <li>Used it for over a month and was supposed to make acne better, not worse.</li>
            <li>Really sensitive and really warm to the touch.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation seems a bit more gentle than some others.</li>
            <li>If you need full strength acne prevention and exfoliation</li>
            <li>this is a good cleansing product to use as a daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub, it just really wakes my face up in the morning and energizes my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent and leaves my skin feeling clean without that chemical burn feeling</li>
            <li>Really helps for acne I found it gentle and really nice for my skin not drying.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, which is nice for a facial</li>
            <li>It is mild, has a non offensive orangey smell.  </li>
            <li>have mild rosacea, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it or cause it to flare up.  </li>
            <li>Each month, hormonal changes cause mild acne.</li>
            <li>It is mildly abrasive and has 1% salicylic acid</li>
            <li>The Biore Acne Clearing Scrub was gentle enough on my skin so that I can use it every day without causing my skin any irritation which is great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Biore Acne Clearing Scrub might work for mild cases, but hormones and heredity don&#x27;t seem to respond to anything but time.</li>
            <li>Since this product is completely new to market, I haven&#x27;t been able to see it&#x27;s full effects</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well satisfied with this facial scrub, though not so impressed as to give it 5 stars or have it become my new standard.</li>
            <li>This was a refreshing change from my normal face wash.</li>
            <li>The smell is perhaps a bit medicinal but not unpleasant and is gone anyway as soon as you rinse.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a gel, with less salicyclic acid and more scrubbing beads, this is pretty good and certainly is effective in dealing with acne and cleaning your pores, but I&#x27;d choose Biore&#x27;s other scrub over this one.</li>
            <li>It also came with a pore strip for your nose; the pore strip was really great and made my acne less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I like Biore&#x27;s about as well as other clearing scrubs; I&#x27;d be happy to use it again, but will probably continue to stick to what&#x27;s most easily available or cheapest among similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(if I use the 2% more than once a day will cause redness); but con since it&#x27;s also less effective.</li>
            <li>It was pleasantly scented and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>so it does a very good facial cleanse, thoroughly removing the top layer of dead cells and leaving the skin tingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a great everyday scrub.</li>
            <li>St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]]</li>
            <li>If you want to scrub your entire face, I think this spread more smoothly and work better, but my cheeks are sensitive to abrasive scrubs</li>
            <li>Biore Acne Clearing Scrub smells like oranges and leaves skin feeling tingly and fresh.</li>
            <li>of my all time favorite cleansers is [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub]], which has Salicylic Acid and an exfoliant in it to scrub off old skin cells and any oil from the skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re looking for a salicylic acid-based scrub.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s ideal for occasional facial cleaning</li>
            <li>This scrub is also good for older adults with occasional blemishes or oily skin and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>have two other Biore products and the \\&quot;Steam Activated Cleanser\\&quot; is REALLY good as well.  </li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>Right.</li>
            <li>I got this scrub at target because I had received a $3 off in Seventeen Magazine, and $1 off right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Biore products, particularly their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The product has left my skin with a cool and refreshing feel after use.</li>
            <li>&quot; just smooth like after you use a decent cleanser.</li>
            <li>It rinses away cleanly, foams gently, and has no scent.  </li>
            <li>My face feels cleaner and the most important thing is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>This by far has been the best facial scrub I have tried to date and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>the scent is quite nice, and it left my face feeling very refreshed, so it deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This Biore Acne scrub has salicylic acid that helps remove dry skin and with the combination of the scrub this will give your skin a nice polished glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This worked fine, but I think I prefer Biore&#x27;s other scrub better.</li>
            <li>on my face in the shower because it works great and well, it is a pretty simple routine using only one product!  </li>
            <li>After just a week of using this product, I actually got more acne on my face</li>
            <li>Threw this out first opportunity.</li>
            <li>As for the acne attack, this is quite respectable in the field with enough salicylic acid to work on zits.  </li>
            <li>and they said my entire top layer of my skin was having an allergic reaction...</li>
            <li>product is a softer, gentler version of many acne facial washes.  </li>
            <li>You can use this daily to treat pimples and help renew your skin, but you might be better off alternating as to not irritate your skin too soon.  </li>
            <li>every scrub it&#x27;s not recommended for those who suffer with acne as bacterias might spread (chemical peels are better such as glycolic acid).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the citrusy scent of this facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I love Biore and this is something I definitely needed for the oily skin and horrendously stubborn</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I love Biore products and use them daily</li>
            <li>Would definitely reccommend! : )</li>
            <li>; Acne Clearing Scrub is a gentle cleansing scrub with a fresh citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub and will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li>I tend to have more sensitive skin and was pleased to note that I had no major reactions to this product; the first time I used it I noticed an increased redness in my cheeks but that has gone away and was perhaps just my skin adjusting to the new product.  </li>
            <li>In fact after using it the first time I wished for it to be more &#x60;scrub-y&#x27; but after several days of use I could see that the gentle polish it provides was working</li>
            <li>It has 1% salicylic acid, which for me provides a nice balance of acne fighting without extreme drying.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I can feel it opening my pores and deep cleaning my face, and I love the citrus smell, it really wakes me up.</li>
            <li>but I must say, my knee-jerk reaction is positive.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I love scrubs as I never feel normal washes get down deep enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned with The Steam Activated Cleanser to wet my face first and afterwards, massage the product in for a couple of minutes and let it stay on for at least 5 minutes to get the best</li>
            <li>It has a nice orange scent and a slight \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; sensation as you gently cleanse away dirt, oil and makeup.  </li>
            <li>my cheeks felt really warm and tight.</li>
            <li>So when you put it on your face you tight away can smell the scent, the scent is actually really nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly gentle scrub, unlike harsher exfoliating products.</li>
            <li>I am really unsatisfied with this product</li>
            <li>I really like the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The exfoliant is gentle also.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And let me tell you this much I am very dissatisfied with this scrub.</li>
            <li>product, much to my surprise, did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>really clears up my face</li>
            <li>It lathers very well - almost too well, in fact, since it takes some effort to rinse off.</li>
            <li>The scent make me think of citrus fruit, and was very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Just started using face scrub and by the 2nd day my face looks clearer and so smooth..</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>One daughter, age 19, is ready to give up and try prescription Acutane.</li>
            <li>but I would caution teenagers against frequent or overly-aggressive scrubbing because it could irritate the skin and leave it red and sore and more prone to blemishes.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for all ages because it&#x27;ll help clear away dead skin and prevent any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did leave my face feeling clean and smooth, but not smooth from the \\&quot;scrub,\\</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it did clean well, but did absolutely nothing to prevent acne or reduce acne.</li>
            <li>Since the steam of the shower opens your pores, the micro beads exfoliate your face getting deep into your pores and unclogging them leaving your face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>but I do believe firmly in the benefits of exfoliation, and the active ingredient in this is probably the best mild chemical exfolent which you can use on a daily basis, if your skin is sensitive, like mine is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin buffed and all the dirt, oils and makeup are removed, and the active ingredients help heal acne and prevent more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Both have the gritty scrub feeling that exfoliates your skin and leaves it feeling tingly clean.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for about a minute before I rinse and work it into my skin for a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Not having zits, now with less pollution because wax is better than plastic in microscrubbing.</li>
            <li>Makes my face really feel clean, though it does leave my skin fairly dry.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the product and whatya know,my acne went back to the mild acne it was.</li>
            <li>Because this product contains salicylic acid it should aid in reducing redness that occurs from blemishes but keep in mind that salicylic is not a drying agent and will most likely only address skin&#x27;s redness.  </li>
            <li>my face was still super red and putting on my makeup hurt!</li>
            <li>I have used this scrub a couple of times so far and while I have no major breakouts to confirm the scrubs efficacy on reducing acne I can say it is gentle and would be suitable for every-other-day or daily use.  </li>
            <li>It gets deep down leaving my skin clean and smooth, but is still gentle.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this for anyone with blackheads, whiteheads or pimples.  </li>
            <li>Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is a strong facial exfoliate but its gentle enough on your skin to not cause any damage to your skin.</li>
            <li>I found it a little too creamy and it took more water and time to rinse.</li>
            <li>This is a mild scrub but has done wonders on my eruption and also gently removed my dry skin.</li>
            <li>so I felt a scrubbing action, but not so much that it felt like I was sandblasting my face.</li>
            <li>but it rinses equally well and both leave your face feeling tingly fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to clean well, lathers sufficiently, and prevents acne about as well for me as other salicylic acid products - although I note that this is only 1% strength, vs 2% in most similar products.</li>
            <li>The abrasive content was just right - enough</li>
            <li>This is ok as a general cleanser, but it isn&#x27;t gritty enough for me as a scrub.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t stop new acne either.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser has a very light citrus scent but it&#x27;s not overwhelming in any way.</li>
            <li>However, I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the second Biore scrub that I have tried and this one is more abrasive than the (blue and white)</li>
            <li>It rinses away easily and it did seem to dry up breakouts a bit, so it is beneficial overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful combination, but doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li>Burns real good the first few times, but this is one the few products I actually seen a difference with after sticking with it a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>This product may be very useful to someone with less sensitive skin, but its just not for me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Biore product for those of us who get occasional breakouts, but are old enough not to want to completely dry out our oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say its the best out there, but definitely not too bad.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t clear up my acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally, I do not have what I&#x27;d consider sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so it seems to be extra gentle.</li>
            <li>B001ET6XNO Oxy Maximum Action Face Wash, 6 Fl-Ounce (177 ml)</li>
            <li>I use it with the biore cleanser directly after...sticking with this one.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, this passed the two day test and the manufacturer&#x27;s claims are true.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t classify my skin as sensitive but</li>
            <li>all the spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li>The salicylic acid is only 1%, whereas most everyday acne washes have 2%.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine little scrub that did exactly what I expected it to do:  provide sufficient scrubbing and all that effects with the power to attack acne.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly bad skin (acne everywhere, like on my neck and stuff), and this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda citrusy with a super slight mint scent as an under tone.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin and have occasional issues with adult acne.</li>
            <li>So if you are thinking of using this for acne in an adolescent, you will definitely want to talk to your dermatologist first and probably look for a different product.</li>
            <li>The percentage of sal Acid is low, and the scrubbing beads are rounded and gentle enough</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it dries my skin out a bit, but not horribly</li>
            <li>If you have the oily T-Zone, you know that&#x27;s a major accomplishment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few days my skin actually broke out more than usual, but they say that&#x27;s a sign that the product is working.</li>
            <li>My acne isn&#x27;t completely eliminated but I&#x27;ve noticed the occurrence of new acne is far less frequent since I&#x27;ve been using this scrub.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, though, so I just alternate using this with a gentler wash and/or use a face moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>Cleans deeply, prevents acne, and makes my skin feel soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I wish it had been available when I was young and really had troubled skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used other cleansing scrubs that almost hurt as you put them on your face, but this Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is gentle.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty much tried all Biore products and I have found a product that actually does what it claims to do - at least for</li>
            <li>particular product a bit lower down the scale, which might be what you&#x27;re looking for if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>have combination skin, but because my face is drier and more sensitive than it used to be, I shy away from the harsher scrubs of my youth.</li>
            <li>I love that Biore has finally made a product similar to the St. Ives scrub, since this version has a little less exfoliant in it, which my daughter prefers over my St. Ives.</li>
            <li>My says he has no more black heads and must make sure I&#x27;m never out of this product, so I&#x27;m ordering a pk of 2</li>
            <li>They all started using this and the results were apparent by the following day.</li>
            <li>salicylic acid in my experience is a pretty harsh ingredient and has a tendency to sometimes irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>actually use this on my arms and legs as well as my face when I&#x27;m in the shower, and it takes off that little layer of dead skin and clears it away, leaving the newer soft smooth layer on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The active ingredient in this (salicylic acid) is the same that is used in the Proactiv Gentle Formula but 1% instead of 2%</li>

            <li> So, I&#x27;m really very happy with this one from Biore:  </li>

            <li> Salicylic acid is great for acne</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and works great for that too..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s milder than Benzoyl Peroxide, but still very effective.</li>
            <li> It also has a great smell and was a good price, so I would recommend.</li>
            <li> You do feel that it cleans well and does have a pleasant sent.  </li>
            <li> I think this product does a good job, but i rather [[ASIN:B000FQNQNM B000FQNQNM]]</li>
            <li> I thought that the cooling sensation was good and meant that it was working</li>
            <li> The lumpiness and discoloration is dissipating and my skin looks good.</li>

            <li> Good scrub for oily skin.</li>
            <li> good product.update</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve used from Biore.</li>
            <li> It is a really great product my daughter has been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and texture of the scrub and am happy with the results on my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked this as a face wash.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how effective it is after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> also liked the scent a lot.</li>
            <li> This is great, especially because in order to get the best results you need to use it twice</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I have seen some progress with my acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and found that this seems to be doing the most good.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a nice moisterizer after this product to keep it from over drying skin.</li>
            <li> could honestly see a difference in my face after using this scrub just twice.</li>
            <li> Biore products are VERY the very best.</li>
            <li> and I really liked that this product kept my face oil-free and not shiny throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash, and I especially love getting it for cheap using Amazon&#x27;s coupon.&lt;br /&gt;Feels really nice, with a cool feeling after washing.  </li>
            <li> This has been one of the best scrubs I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Scrub is nice and gentle...exfoliates without feeling like you&#x27;ve just removed the top 10 layers of your face.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best two types of acne fighting ingredients I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> more it.  </li>
            <li> it got more oil and dirt off my skin even after using it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> To me it just works better than the Biore..</li>
            <li> I love the citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It is a great face scrub and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The scrub does make my face smoother but it also over dries my skin and causes more blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several Biore products, and this is among the best.</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t wear any makeup on top of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many scrubs over the years.  </li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li> (with 2% salicylic acid), the Acne Clearing Scrub is thicker and more gelatinous (and of course is somewhat abrasive whereas the Ice Cleanser is not)</li>
            <li> Makes my skin nice and smooth after I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Esp in the winter months when my skin teds to break out more.</li>
            <li> Make sure to lotion afterwards to prevent dryness.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer something with more grit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it better as a cleanser,</li>
            <li> There are more beads in it</li>
            <li> This is more of a gel than the Pore Unclogging Scrub</li>
            <li> After washing my face a couple of times I have noticed that I am breaking out more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so what might work for me might not be the best for your skin.  </li>
            <li> this may not be your favorite.</li>
            <li> This scrub also seems to be working its magic on my acne issues.</li>
            <li> love all the Biore products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I have buy one more for myself</li>
            <li> but I love the way it makes my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> system is MUCH, MUCH better than Proactive, which I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is looser and spreads more easily and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Biore has picked up on the great cleanser St. Ives has been making for years, and created their own formula similar to it.</li>
            <li> Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is a great scrub that even people with sensitive skin can use.  </li>
            <li> The Biore Acne Clearing Scrub has a nice orange or citrus smell that also helps calm your skin and prevent any irritation.</li>
            <li> Until now, I&#x27;ve always used Olay face stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sold on this, I just really love the cooling effects, I can&#x27;t get over how refreshing and energizing it is, its better than a morning cup of coffee to get you started for the day.</li>
            <li> The minty sensation in this product is too strong and it stings all over your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great new option for those who want a more mild exfoliant but still get the same great results from the buffing and the acne fighting results from the Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> Felt fine in the shower if a bit abrasive.</li>
            <li> There are not a lot of grit for my likening, but it works fine to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> and I do not recommend it to people trying to get rid of mild acne!</li>
            <li> They all have mild acne (a dozen pimples at a time at the most).  </li>
            <li> My daughter has mild acne and my son&#x27;s is more severe.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff right here.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s cheap that you want, then&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scrub lightly exfoliates and</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the warming anti blackhead cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was taken aback by the fantastic icy/hot sensation when using this scrub...</li>
            <li> the product itself rinses away easily leaving the skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and non greasy</li>
            <li> primary ingredient is salicylic acid, which is associated with Reye&#x27;s Syndrome in children and adolescents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product a couple of times, but it&#x27;s been great for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> My pores appeared to be minimized, my skin didn&#x27;t feel overly oily, and my complexion looked fresh and glowing (I love when that glowing look comes from clean looking skin rather than oily looking skin).</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating beads leaves skin feeling smooth, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with this face scrub.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and cool and just refreshed after using this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got an amazing light, clean (faintly citrusy) scent and perfect texture.  </li>
            <li> This is a product you can truly use to get your face clean and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even want to put makeup on, it feels that clean.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating granules are great for sloughing off dead skin and I love the fresh orange fragrance.</li>
            <li> Used it for over a month and was supposed to make acne better, not worse.</li>
            <li> Really sensitive and really warm to the touch.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation seems a bit more gentle than some others.</li>
            <li> If you need full strength acne prevention and exfoliation</li>
            <li> this is a good cleansing product to use as a daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it just really wakes my face up in the morning and energizes my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh scent and leaves my skin feeling clean without that chemical burn feeling</li>
            <li> Really helps for acne I found it gentle and really nice for my skin not drying.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, which is nice for a facial</li>
            <li> It is mild, has a non offensive orangey smell.  </li>
            <li> have mild rosacea, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it or cause it to flare up.  </li>
            <li> Each month, hormonal changes cause mild acne.</li>
            <li> It is mildly abrasive and has 1% salicylic acid</li>
            <li> The Biore Acne Clearing Scrub was gentle enough on my skin so that I can use it every day without causing my skin any irritation which is great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Biore Acne Clearing Scrub might work for mild cases, but hormones and heredity don&#x27;t seem to respond to anything but time.</li>
            <li> Since this product is completely new to market, I haven&#x27;t been able to see it&#x27;s full effects</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well satisfied with this facial scrub, though not so impressed as to give it 5 stars or have it become my new standard.</li>
            <li> This was a refreshing change from my normal face wash.</li>
            <li> The smell is perhaps a bit medicinal but not unpleasant and is gone anyway as soon as you rinse.</li>
            <li> If you want more of a gel, with less salicyclic acid and more scrubbing beads, this is pretty good and certainly is effective in dealing with acne and cleaning your pores, but I&#x27;d choose Biore&#x27;s other scrub over this one.</li>
            <li> It also came with a pore strip for your nose; the pore strip was really great and made my acne less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I like Biore&#x27;s about as well as other clearing scrubs; I&#x27;d be happy to use it again, but will probably continue to stick to what&#x27;s most easily available or cheapest among similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (if I use the 2% more than once a day will cause redness); but con since it&#x27;s also less effective.</li>
            <li> It was pleasantly scented and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> so it does a very good facial cleanse, thoroughly removing the top layer of dead cells and leaving the skin tingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a great everyday scrub.</li>
            <li> St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]]</li>
            <li> If you want to scrub your entire face, I think this spread more smoothly and work better, but my cheeks are sensitive to abrasive scrubs</li>
            <li> Biore Acne Clearing Scrub smells like oranges and leaves skin feeling tingly and fresh.</li>
            <li> of my all time favorite cleansers is [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub]], which has Salicylic Acid and an exfoliant in it to scrub off old skin cells and any oil from the skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re looking for a salicylic acid-based scrub.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s ideal for occasional facial cleaning</li>
            <li> This scrub is also good for older adults with occasional blemishes or oily skin and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> have two other Biore products and the \\&quot;Steam Activated Cleanser\\&quot; is REALLY good as well.  </li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> Right.</li>
            <li> I got this scrub at target because I had received a $3 off in Seventeen Magazine, and $1 off right on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Biore products, particularly their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The product has left my skin with a cool and refreshing feel after use.</li>
            <li> &quot; just smooth like after you use a decent cleanser.</li>
            <li> It rinses away cleanly, foams gently, and has no scent.  </li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner and the most important thing is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> This by far has been the best facial scrub I have tried to date and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> the scent is quite nice, and it left my face feeling very refreshed, so it deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This Biore Acne scrub has salicylic acid that helps remove dry skin and with the combination of the scrub this will give your skin a nice polished glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This worked fine, but I think I prefer Biore&#x27;s other scrub better.</li>
            <li> on my face in the shower because it works great and well, it is a pretty simple routine using only one product!  </li>
            <li> After just a week of using this product, I actually got more acne on my face</li>
            <li> Threw this out first opportunity.</li>
            <li> As for the acne attack, this is quite respectable in the field with enough salicylic acid to work on zits.  </li>
            <li> and they said my entire top layer of my skin was having an allergic reaction...</li>
            <li> product is a softer, gentler version of many acne facial washes.  </li>
            <li> You can use this daily to treat pimples and help renew your skin, but you might be better off alternating as to not irritate your skin too soon.  </li>
            <li> every scrub it&#x27;s not recommended for those who suffer with acne as bacterias might spread (chemical peels are better such as glycolic acid).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the citrusy scent of this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I love Biore and this is something I definitely needed for the oily skin and horrendously stubborn</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love Biore products and use them daily</li>
            <li> Would definitely reccommend! : )</li>
            <li> ; Acne Clearing Scrub is a gentle cleansing scrub with a fresh citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub and will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> I tend to have more sensitive skin and was pleased to note that I had no major reactions to this product; the first time I used it I noticed an increased redness in my cheeks but that has gone away and was perhaps just my skin adjusting to the new product.  </li>
            <li> In fact after using it the first time I wished for it to be more &#x60;scrub-y&#x27; but after several days of use I could see that the gentle polish it provides was working</li>
            <li> It has 1% salicylic acid, which for me provides a nice balance of acne fighting without extreme drying.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I can feel it opening my pores and deep cleaning my face, and I love the citrus smell, it really wakes me up.</li>
            <li> but I must say, my knee-jerk reaction is positive.  </li>
            <li> Works great, I love scrubs as I never feel normal washes get down deep enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned with The Steam Activated Cleanser to wet my face first and afterwards, massage the product in for a couple of minutes and let it stay on for at least 5 minutes to get the best</li>
            <li> It has a nice orange scent and a slight \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; sensation as you gently cleanse away dirt, oil and makeup.  </li>
            <li> my cheeks felt really warm and tight.</li>
            <li> So when you put it on your face you tight away can smell the scent, the scent is actually really nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly gentle scrub, unlike harsher exfoliating products.</li>
            <li> I am really unsatisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I really like the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The exfoliant is gentle also.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And let me tell you this much I am very dissatisfied with this scrub.</li>
            <li> product, much to my surprise, did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> really clears up my face</li>
            <li> It lathers very well - almost too well, in fact, since it takes some effort to rinse off.</li>
            <li> The scent make me think of citrus fruit, and was very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just started using face scrub and by the 2nd day my face looks clearer and so smooth..</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> One daughter, age 19, is ready to give up and try prescription Acutane.</li>
            <li> but I would caution teenagers against frequent or overly-aggressive scrubbing because it could irritate the skin and leave it red and sore and more prone to blemishes.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for all ages because it&#x27;ll help clear away dead skin and prevent any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did leave my face feeling clean and smooth, but not smooth from the \\&quot;scrub,\\</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it did clean well, but did absolutely nothing to prevent acne or reduce acne.</li>
            <li> Since the steam of the shower opens your pores, the micro beads exfoliate your face getting deep into your pores and unclogging them leaving your face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> but I do believe firmly in the benefits of exfoliation, and the active ingredient in this is probably the best mild chemical exfolent which you can use on a daily basis, if your skin is sensitive, like mine is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin buffed and all the dirt, oils and makeup are removed, and the active ingredients help heal acne and prevent more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Both have the gritty scrub feeling that exfoliates your skin and leaves it feeling tingly clean.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about a minute before I rinse and work it into my skin for a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Not having zits, now with less pollution because wax is better than plastic in microscrubbing.</li>
            <li> Makes my face really feel clean, though it does leave my skin fairly dry.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product and whatya know,my acne went back to the mild acne it was.</li>
            <li> Because this product contains salicylic acid it should aid in reducing redness that occurs from blemishes but keep in mind that salicylic is not a drying agent and will most likely only address skin&#x27;s redness.  </li>
            <li> my face was still super red and putting on my makeup hurt!</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub a couple of times so far and while I have no major breakouts to confirm the scrubs efficacy on reducing acne I can say it is gentle and would be suitable for every-other-day or daily use.  </li>
            <li> It gets deep down leaving my skin clean and smooth, but is still gentle.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this for anyone with blackheads, whiteheads or pimples.  </li>
            <li> Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is a strong facial exfoliate but its gentle enough on your skin to not cause any damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> I found it a little too creamy and it took more water and time to rinse.</li>
            <li> This is a mild scrub but has done wonders on my eruption and also gently removed my dry skin.</li>
            <li> so I felt a scrubbing action, but not so much that it felt like I was sandblasting my face.</li>
            <li> but it rinses equally well and both leave your face feeling tingly fresh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to clean well, lathers sufficiently, and prevents acne about as well for me as other salicylic acid products - although I note that this is only 1% strength, vs 2% in most similar products.</li>
            <li> The abrasive content was just right - enough</li>
            <li> This is ok as a general cleanser, but it isn&#x27;t gritty enough for me as a scrub.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t stop new acne either.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser has a very light citrus scent but it&#x27;s not overwhelming in any way.</li>
            <li> However, I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second Biore scrub that I have tried and this one is more abrasive than the (blue and white)</li>
            <li> It rinses away easily and it did seem to dry up breakouts a bit, so it is beneficial overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful combination, but doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> Burns real good the first few times, but this is one the few products I actually seen a difference with after sticking with it a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> This product may be very useful to someone with less sensitive skin, but its just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Biore product for those of us who get occasional breakouts, but are old enough not to want to completely dry out our oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say its the best out there, but definitely not too bad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clear up my acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, I do not have what I&#x27;d consider sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so it seems to be extra gentle.</li>
            <li> B001ET6XNO Oxy Maximum Action Face Wash, 6 Fl-Ounce (177 ml)</li>
            <li> I use it with the biore cleanser directly after...sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, this passed the two day test and the manufacturer&#x27;s claims are true.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t classify my skin as sensitive but</li>
            <li> all the spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> The salicylic acid is only 1%, whereas most everyday acne washes have 2%.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine little scrub that did exactly what I expected it to do:  provide sufficient scrubbing and all that effects with the power to attack acne.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly bad skin (acne everywhere, like on my neck and stuff), and this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda citrusy with a super slight mint scent as an under tone.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and have occasional issues with adult acne.</li>
            <li> So if you are thinking of using this for acne in an adolescent, you will definitely want to talk to your dermatologist first and probably look for a different product.</li>
            <li> The percentage of sal Acid is low, and the scrubbing beads are rounded and gentle enough</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it dries my skin out a bit, but not horribly</li>
            <li> If you have the oily T-Zone, you know that&#x27;s a major accomplishment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few days my skin actually broke out more than usual, but they say that&#x27;s a sign that the product is working.</li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t completely eliminated but I&#x27;ve noticed the occurrence of new acne is far less frequent since I&#x27;ve been using this scrub.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, though, so I just alternate using this with a gentler wash and/or use a face moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Cleans deeply, prevents acne, and makes my skin feel soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I wish it had been available when I was young and really had troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used other cleansing scrubs that almost hurt as you put them on your face, but this Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is gentle.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty much tried all Biore products and I have found a product that actually does what it claims to do - at least for</li>
            <li> particular product a bit lower down the scale, which might be what you&#x27;re looking for if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> have combination skin, but because my face is drier and more sensitive than it used to be, I shy away from the harsher scrubs of my youth.</li>
            <li> I love that Biore has finally made a product similar to the St. Ives scrub, since this version has a little less exfoliant in it, which my daughter prefers over my St. Ives.</li>
            <li> My says he has no more black heads and must make sure I&#x27;m never out of this product, so I&#x27;m ordering a pk of 2</li>
            <li> They all started using this and the results were apparent by the following day.</li>
            <li> salicylic acid in my experience is a pretty harsh ingredient and has a tendency to sometimes irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> actually use this on my arms and legs as well as my face when I&#x27;m in the shower, and it takes off that little layer of dead skin and clears it away, leaving the newer soft smooth layer on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this (salicylic acid) is the same that is used in the Proactiv Gentle Formula but 1% instead of 2%</li>
            <li> I tend to rank things from most effective to least effective:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month on a daily basis and have not experienced any dryness on my face as I have with most other scrubs.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have extremely oily skin with light acne.</li>
            <li> scrub is gentle on my face and does not over dry my skin or make it tight.  </li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube easily and is creamy and thick with little scrubbing beads in it.</li>
            <li> After purchasing it little did I know that it does the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I also use a facial moisturizer with this product, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have adult, normal-to-oily, slightly olive complexion.  </li>
            <li> The salacyclic acid and exfoliation of the scrub helps to clear dead skin cells and cleans pores to help prevent further acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s both a positive and a negative:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work any differently from other washes as far as acne control, but I like the slight tingling and the scrubbing beads.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face in the shower because I am far too messy to wash it in the sink.</li>
            <li> I cleaned my face off mid day in case my makeup was irritating it and by night had to spread some aloe vera on it to cool it down.</li>
            <li> so it gives a stronger scrub, but it has only 1% salicyclic acid (whereas the other has 2%).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry after using it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a 1% concentration of salicylic acid, which is half as much as the Neutrogena salicylic acid washes and scrubs (my usual brand) which contain 2%.</li>
            <li> I can feel it cleaning deep down into my pores.</li>
            <li> I also use the blackhead strips about once a month to remove dirt deep down in my pores.</li>
            <li> My cheeks and chin are flaming red and slightly puffy.</li>
            <li> B007S0DJE4 Alaffia African Black Soap For All Skin and Hair Types]])</li>
            <li> It actually helped keep the oily T-zone area be less shiny.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a little while, then tried to go back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product but it reacted horribly with my skin.</li>
            <li> Now, I still have some trouble with blemishes and white heads, but my skin is no longer as oily as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So that, while there are lots and lots of particles, they don&#x27;t rough up</li>
            <li> Everything gets wet.</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to the blackhead scrub that I have used except it is orange instead of green.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and a little goes long</li>
            <li> I like to use a scrub on my face during showers, and usually select a product with salicylic acid to help keep slightly acne-prone skin clear.</li>
            <li> It does contain some Menthol (which gives that cooling sensation when you wash and can irritate your skin) but not a large amount.  </li>
            <li> I have been breaking out for a little while now but chalked it up to other things but have finally narrowed it down to washing my face with this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin is also extremely dry and tight.</li>
            <li> i use my other cleanser</li>
            <li> I spent three hours in a tanning bed!</li>
            <li> You still get the feeling that your face is being scrubbed without the discomfort of other scrubs.  </li>
            <li> my needs, I&#x27;m happier with the other scrub because I&#x27;m looking to concentrate on one area (my nose).</li>
            <li> other acne washes cause.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, by the third day of using this product, my skin started feeling itchy, especially the upper portion of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It kills the acne and dries out the skin when it&#x27;s extremely oily and nothing else will work.</li>
            <li> Any other time, I prefer cleansers with Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, as well as their other products.</li>
            <li> As happens with that ingredient, this does tend to leave the face a little dry, but no more than other products of the same type.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used face cleansing products with either Salicylic Acid or Benzoyl Peroxide as the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin less dried out and less likely to flake or peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also when I washed it off even though I didn&#x27;t scrub hard my face was Red!  </li>
            <li> I like that this scrub didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling raw and dry.</li>
            <li> small amount goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner and seem to have less breakouts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not allergic to perfumes or odd</li>
            <li> Washed my cheeks, lower half of my face and chin and rinsed it off in the morning.</li>
            <li> I also now have an odd texture to my skin.</li>
            <li> This leave my pores tight and invisible.  </li>
            <li> The dermatologist has prescribed different topical lotions, expensive, not very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly drying but noting to harsh.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;s a bit less harsh</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about my kids putting medicine on their skin</li>
            <li> so I did a little research.</li>
            <li> This did not leave my skin dried out even with everyday use</li>
            <li> This is too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I look like I&#x27;ve been crying for hours.</li>
            <li> There is a grapefruit-ish scent that I found to be a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Honestly this is one of the worst acne scrubs that I have bought in a while.</li>
            <li> The scrub also isn&#x27;t too harsh on your skin and the beads don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> In fact, after using this product a few times I found my skin to look noticeably fresher and healthier.</li>
            <li> Scub\\&quot; is a rub that has orange or orange particles in it that helps to agitate and remove dead skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The results of using this scrub is almost immediately and you can see the renewed skin within just a few days.</li>
            <li> This is a less expensive version of similar products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product, but I&#x27;d suggest caution when using it, for it feels soft, but is actually quite harsh.</li>
            <li> I have been slightly stressed lately and was breaking out around my chin and lower cheek</li>
            <li> Both of those ingredients cause an allergic reaction in a small fraction of the population so if you have an allergy to aspirin or notice any rash, hives, itching, redness, swelling or difficulty breathing then</li>
            <li> In the past when I&#x27;ve had issues with trying to control break-outs, Benzoyl Peroxide has been my go to ingredient.</li>
            <li> Now the problem with breakouts is that if I pick and scratch, it leaves dark marks and scars behind.  </li>
            <li> The consistency looks like it would be thick in the bottle</li>
            <li> but when you squeeze it on to your hand you&#x27;ll see that it isn&#x27;t thick at all.</li>
            <li> Slow shipment though.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO MAGIC OR SECRET INGREDIENT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better or worse than others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The gel is very thick and jam-packed with scrubbing particles.  </li>
            <li> The formula is almost like a gel it is very thick</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t make it any worse.</li>
            <li> She tried Clinique&#x27;s expensive 3-step program after Pro-Active didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It was really unpleasant</li>
            <li> in a bad way.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me break out extremely badly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It sort of keep my pimples at bay for some short times but it does not reduce the incoming&lt;br /&gt;of more it.  and the Biore cleanser is not that great either......i use my other cleanser&lt;br /&gt;and it got more oil and dirt off my skin even after using it. if it&#x27;s cheap that you want, then&lt;br /&gt;this is it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I think this product does a good job, but i rather [[ASIN:B000FQNQNM B000FQNQNM]] To me it just works better than the Biore.. My face feels cleaner and seem to have less breakouts</li>
            <li> when I get the product, the cleaning scrub already leaked out. I don&#x27;t know whether it is the transportation problem or the product&#x27;s problem?</li>
            <li> Burns real good the first few times, but this is one the few products I actually seen a difference with after sticking with it a few weeks.  I found a way to get it on my back too and its helping there as well.</li>
            <li> Works great, I love scrubs as I never feel normal washes get down deep enough. This did not leave my skin dried out even with everyday use</li>
            <li> The product has left my skin with a cool and refreshing feel after use. The scrub lightly exfoliates and I love the citrus scent. It is a great face scrub and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this 3-7 days a week. I also use a facial moisturizer with this product, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin. It&#x27;s a fairly gentle scrub, unlike harsher exfoliating products. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean and smooth. Would recommend to everyone.  I also enjoy the warming anti blackhead cleanser. Great value.</li>
            <li> This is too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Did work for me. Used it for over a month and was supposed to make acne better, not worse. You can try it but I wouldn&#x27;t put lots of money to it.</li>
            <li> I liked this as a face wash.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work any differently from other washes as far as acne control, but I like the slight tingling and the scrubbing beads.  My face feels cleaner and the most important thing is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  A lot of acne cleansers seem to be too drying, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash, and I especially love getting it for cheap using Amazon&#x27;s coupon.&lt;br /&gt;Feels really nice, with a cool feeling after washing.  Makes my face really feel clean, though it does leave my skin fairly dry. I have sensitive skin, though, so I just alternate using this with a gentler wash and/or use a face moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> This product says that it is an acne clearing scrub. After purchasing it little did I know that it does the complete opposite. After just a week of using this product, I actually got more acne on my face then I had before using this product. I was being looked at by all my family members because they noticed a drastic change in my acne...in a bad way. I stopped using the product and whatya know,my acne went back to the mild acne it was. I am really unsatisfied with this product and I do not recommend it to people trying to get rid of mild acne!</li>
            <li> The scrub does make my face smoother but it also over dries my skin and causes more blemishes. However, I do have very sensitive skin. This product may be very useful to someone with less sensitive skin, but its just not for me.</li>
            <li> It was what I asked for and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Since this product is completely new to market, I haven&#x27;t been able to see it&#x27;s full effects but I must say, my knee-jerk reaction is positive.  It&#x27;s got an amazing light, clean (faintly citrusy) scent and perfect texture.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how effective it is after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me break out extremely badly. I stopped using it for a little while, then tried to go back and I broke out again. Threw this out first opportunity.</li>
            <li> next time I may try different one without particles</li>
            <li> Its a great everyday scrub. Cleans deeply, prevents acne, and makes my skin feel soooo soft. Ive used this for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I could definitely tell the difference after using this scrub. Although I did not have any acne, my face definitely felt cleaner and softer after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the scent a lot. This is a good product for all ages because it&#x27;ll help clear away dead skin and prevent any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several Biore products, and this is among the best.</li>
            <li> This is a fine little scrub that did exactly what I expected it to do:  provide sufficient scrubbing and all that effects with the power to attack acne.  As a scrub, this is what I like in scrubs: scrubby, none of that wussy barely-there exfoliates. This is a product you can truly use to get your face clean and exfoliated.  As for the acne attack, this is quite respectable in the field with enough salicylic acid to work on zits.  As happens with that ingredient, this does tend to leave the face a little dry, but no more than other products of the same type.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has a very light citrus scent but it&#x27;s not overwhelming in any way. The consistency looks like it would be thick in the bottle but when you squeeze it on to your hand you&#x27;ll see that it isn&#x27;t thick at all. You only need a dime size squeeze because it spreads so evenly. This is great, especially because in order to get the best results you need to use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks now and I can honestly say that I have seen some progress with my acne. The first few days my skin actually broke out more than usual, but they say that&#x27;s a sign that the product is working. By day four my skin cleared up. I really like the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been slightly stressed lately and was breaking out around my chin and lower cheek area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I do not have what I&#x27;d consider sensitive skin. I do not buy makeup or creams or lotions based on sensitive skin and have never really had a problem. I&#x27;m not allergic to perfumes or odd scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this only ONCE. Washed my cheeks, lower half of my face and chin and rinsed it off in the morning. Felt fine in the shower if a bit abrasive. Was my day off so didn&#x27;t wear any makeup on top of it. By mid afternoon my cheeks felt really warm and tight. By the next day, my cheeks, chin, and around my lips were RED. Really sensitive and really warm to the touch. When I went to work my co-workers asked if I had a fever. I cleaned my face off mid day in case my makeup was irritating it and by night had to spread some aloe vera on it to cool it down. By the next day.. I look Iike I spent three hours in a tanning bed! My cheeks and chin are flaming red and slightly puffy. I look like I&#x27;ve been crying for hours. My skin is also extremely dry and tight. Went to the doctor and they said my entire top layer of my skin was having an allergic reaction... akin to a medium sunburn. I am even peeling my skin is so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never recommend this product to anyone and threw it away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many scrubs over the years.  This has got to be my favorite.  I wish it had been available when I was young and really had troubled skin.  Now, I still have some trouble with blemishes and white heads, but my skin is no longer as oily as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, but because my face is drier and more sensitive than it used to be, I shy away from the harsher scrubs of my youth. But I don&#x27;t want a milk toast scrub either; why bother?  So, I&#x27;m really very happy with this one from Biore:  The gel is very thick and jam-packed with scrubbing particles.  In my mind, the particles seem to be--how to say this--more \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; maybe?  So that, while there are lots and lots of particles, they don&#x27;t rough up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like I mentioned in the title, the fragrance cannot be beat!  I look forward to using it each day, and I believe I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have used other cleansing scrubs that almost hurt as you put them on your face, but this Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is gentle.  You still get the feeling that your face is being scrubbed without the discomfort of other scrubs.  I enjoy the smell and texture of the scrub and am happy with the results on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Biore products for years, though I tend to simply use my current hair and body wash ([[ASIN:B007S0DJE4 Alaffia African Black Soap For All Skin and Hair Types]]) on my face in the shower because it works great and well, it is a pretty simple routine using only one product!  I have adult, normal-to-oily, slightly olive complexion.  I don&#x27;t break out regularly but I do get clogged pores and I wanted to see if this scrub would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a softer, gentler version of many acne facial washes.  The salicylic acid is only 1%, whereas most everyday acne washes have 2%.  The exfoliant is gentle also.  In fact after using it the first time I wished for it to be more &#x60;scrub-y&#x27; but after several days of use I could see that the gentle polish it provides was working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to [[ASIN:B001BADF7I Biore&#x27;s Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser]] (with 2% salicylic acid), the Acne Clearing Scrub is thicker and more gelatinous (and of course is somewhat abrasive whereas the Ice Cleanser is not) but it rinses equally well and both leave your face feeling tingly fresh.  I can recommend them both!</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes my skin nice and smooth after I&#x27;ve used it.  It&#x27;s slightly drying but noting to harsh.  I love it. Esp in the winter months when my skin teds to break out more.</li>
            <li> This was a refreshing change from my normal face wash. I can feel it cleaning deep down into my pores.</li>
            <li> Not having zits, now with less pollution because wax is better than plastic in microscrubbing. Right? Right.</li>
            <li> It is a really great product my daughter has been pleased with the results.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really helps for acne I found it gentle and really nice for my skin not drying. I would buy it again. Slow shipment though.</li>
            <li> I have three teens who have inherited my skin. They all started using this and the results were apparent by the following day. They all have mild acne (a dozen pimples at a time at the most).  The active ingredient in this (salicylic acid) is the same that is used in the Proactiv Gentle Formula but 1% instead of 2% so it seems to be extra gentle. This is also a fraction of the price of Proactiv. THERE IS NO MAGIC OR SECRET INGREDIENT TO OVER THE COUNTER ACNE MEDICINE. They all use benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as antibacterial ingredients. I was a little concerned about my kids putting medicine on their skin so I did a little research. Both of those ingredients cause an allergic reaction in a small fraction of the population so if you have an allergy to aspirin or notice any rash, hives, itching, redness, swelling or difficulty breathing then you should stop. Allergies that lead to difficulty breathing are life-threatening, and should be treated as medical emergencies.</li>
            <li> Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is a great scrub that even people with sensitive skin can use.  You can use this daily to treat pimples and help renew your skin, but you might be better off alternating as to not irritate your skin too soon.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  Make sure to lotion afterwards to prevent dryness.  I recommend it for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I was taken aback by the fantastic icy/hot sensation when using this scrub... I&#x27;ve never used a product that felt quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of ingredient power I tend to rank things from most effective to least effective:&lt;br /&gt;1. Benzoyl Peroxide 10%&lt;br /&gt;2. Benzoyl Peroxide 5%&lt;br /&gt;3. Salicylic Acid 2%&lt;br /&gt;4. Salicylic Acid 1%&lt;br /&gt;5. Sodium Laureth Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product a bit lower down the scale, which might be what you&#x27;re looking for if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re struggling with outbreaks, then I can&#x27;t recommend Oxy enough [[ASIN:B001ET6XNO Oxy Maximum Action Face Wash, 6 Fl-Ounce (177 ml) (Pack of 4)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something with a gritty texture I recommend [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]]</li>
            <li> This is ok as a general cleanser, but it isn&#x27;t gritty enough for me as a scrub. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is actually scrubbing and I prefer something with more grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did leave my face feeling clean and smooth, but not smooth from the \\&quot;scrub,\\&quot; just smooth like after you use a decent cleanser. It rinses away easily and it did seem to dry up breakouts a bit, so it is beneficial overall. The scent is light, which is nice for a facial product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it better as a cleanser, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a scrub. If you don&#x27;t like the really gritty scrubs, you will probably like this one quite well.</li>
            <li> I have oily/acne prone skin, after two days of using this product my skin became irritated and I was constantly scratching my face. I noticed smaller bumps were beginning to surface on my skin. Returned it to the store on the third day</li>
            <li> This is the second Biore scrub that I have tried and this one is more abrasive than the (blue and white) Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub. There are more beads in it so it gives a stronger scrub, but it has only 1% salicyclic acid (whereas the other has 2%). It seems that this is positioned as a slightly different product depending on what you prefer. I also noticed that there is a texture difference between the two scrubs. This is more of a gel than the Pore Unclogging Scrub and it is looser and spreads more easily and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my needs, I&#x27;m happier with the other scrub because I&#x27;m looking to concentrate on one area (my nose). If you want to scrub your entire face, I think this spread more smoothly and work better, but my cheeks are sensitive to abrasive scrubs so I tend to wash my face with something which is not as abrasive as a scrub. Also, this does not leave your face tingling in the same way that the Pore Unclogging Scrub does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked fine, but I think I prefer Biore&#x27;s other scrub better. If you want more of a gel, with less salicyclic acid and more scrubbing beads, this is pretty good and certainly is effective in dealing with acne and cleaning your pores, but I&#x27;d choose Biore&#x27;s other scrub over this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub a couple of times so far and while I have no major breakouts to confirm the scrubs efficacy on reducing acne I can say it is gentle and would be suitable for every-other-day or daily use.  There is a grapefruit-ish scent that I found to be a bit heavy but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be long-lasting and the product itself rinses away easily leaving the skin feeling clean.  Because this product contains salicylic acid it should aid in reducing redness that occurs from blemishes but keep in mind that salicylic is not a drying agent and will most likely only address skin&#x27;s redness.  I tend to have more sensitive skin and was pleased to note that I had no major reactions to this product; the first time I used it I noticed an increased redness in my cheeks but that has gone away and was perhaps just my skin adjusting to the new product.  If you are looking for a simple, moderately priced facial scrub with some potential benefits in reducing redness caused by acne/skin irritations I would recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Biore product for those of us who get occasional breakouts, but are old enough not to want to completely dry out our oily skin.  It has 1% salicylic acid, which for me provides a nice balance of acne fighting without extreme drying.  It is mild, has a non offensive orangey smell.  It does contain some Menthol (which gives that cooling sensation when you wash and can irritate your skin) but not a large amount.  However, if peppermint bothers you, this may too.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is one of the worst acne scrubs that I have bought in a while. My face was breaking out a couple of weeks ago and I say this at the store and decided to buy it. After washing my face a couple of times I have noticed that I am breaking out more then I was during my middle school years. I have been breaking out for a little while now but chalked it up to other things but have finally narrowed it down to washing my face with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage children hoping it would help with their acne.  I even tried it myself to see how it cleaned.  You do feel that it cleans well and does have a pleasant sent.  However, it didn&#x27;t do anything for either of my children.  My daughter has mild acne and my son&#x27;s is more severe.  There was no change at all in either one of them and it didn&#x27;t stop new acne either.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it did clean well, but did absolutely nothing to prevent acne or reduce acne.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clear up my acne like I had hoped it would but it didn&#x27;t make it any worse. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have extremely oily skin with light acne. On to the next product.</li>
            <li> I got this scrub at target because I had received a $3 off in Seventeen Magazine, and $1 off right on the bottle. So I got this for $2. And let me tell you this much I am very dissatisfied with this scrub. So when you put it on your face you tight away can smell the scent, the scent is actually really nice so that&#x27;s why it got 2 stars. It smells kinda citrusy with a super slight mint scent as an under tone. The formula is almost like a gel it is very thick and it has exfoliating beads in it. The scrub also isn&#x27;t too harsh on your skin and the beads don&#x27;t hurt. However the scrub makes your face burn! The minty sensation in this product is too strong and it stings all over your face. Also when I washed it off even though I didn&#x27;t scrub hard my face was Red!  When i woke up in the morning my face was still super red and putting on my makeup hurt! It was really unpleasant and I used it several times and I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product. I also did not notice any improvement in my skin. It also came with a pore strip for your nose; the pore strip was really great and made my acne less noticeable. I will be returning the scrub but I will pick up a box of the pore strips for your nose.</li>
            <li> This is great. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry after using it. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two days and the result is irritated, itchy, red skin. I also now have an odd texture to my skin. It is almost as if the product burned my skin. I thought that the cooling sensation was good and meant that it was working but soon after rinsing the face wash my skin burned. It also makes my skin burn when I apply makeup afterwards. I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product but it reacted horribly with my skin.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the best scrubs I have used so far. I have been using it for about a month on a daily basis and have not experienced any dryness on my face as I have with most other scrubs. It has a fresh scent and leaves my skin feeling clean without that chemical burn feeling other acne washes cause. I have fewer breakouts now and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff right here. I have incredibly bad skin (acne everywhere, like on my neck and stuff), and this stuff is pretty good. I wouldn&#x27;t say its the best out there, but definitely not too bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and found that this seems to be doing the most good. I use it with the biore cleanser directly after...sticking with this one. Scrub is nice and gentle...exfoliates without feeling like you&#x27;ve just removed the top 10 layers of your face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub! It gets deep down leaving my skin clean and smooth, but is still gentle. Also smells great. I definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and have combination and still struggling with breakouts and blackheads.  Now the problem with breakouts is that if I pick and scratch, it leaves dark marks and scars behind.  I have pretty much tried all Biore products and I have found a product that actually does what it claims to do - at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount goes a long ways.  It has a nice orange scent and a slight \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; sensation as you gently cleanse away dirt, oil and makeup.  Since the steam of the shower opens your pores, the micro beads exfoliate your face getting deep into your pores and unclogging them leaving your face feeling clean and refreshed.  I don&#x27;t know much about salicylic acid, but I have definitely noticed fewer blemishes and blackheads in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is gentle on my face and does not over dry my skin or make it tight.  It actually helped keep the oily T-zone area be less shiny.  My face felt smooth and non greasy all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so what might work for me might not be the best for your skin.  This by far has been the best facial scrub I have tried to date and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer claims this product will improve blemishes in two days. Bring it on, I say. I&#x27;ve been dealing with a blemish problem for two weeks now and had been on the verge of making an appointment with my dermatologist. A breakout in an area by my left eye area is embarrassing for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and lathered this on my face and rinsed thoroughly. It was pleasantly scented and left my skin feeling soft and smooth. The lumpiness and discoloration is dissipating and my skin looks good. This is a mild scrub but has done wonders on my eruption and also gently removed my dry skin. As far as I am concerned, this passed the two day test and the manufacturer&#x27;s claims are true.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Good scrub for oily skin. There are not a lot of grit for my likening, but it works fine to exfoliate. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and a little goes long way.&lt;br /&gt;As every scrub it&#x27;s not recommended for those who suffer with acne as bacterias might spread (chemical peels are better such as glycolic acid). But because the consistency is on watery side it can be used as a mask without massaging. Salicylic acid is great for acne so it should help. Also I use it occasionally as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well satisfied with this facial scrub, though not so impressed as to give it 5 stars or have it become my new standard. I like to use a scrub on my face during showers, and usually select a product with salicylic acid to help keep slightly acne-prone skin clear. I like Biore&#x27;s about as well as other clearing scrubs; I&#x27;d be happy to use it again, but will probably continue to stick to what&#x27;s most easily available or cheapest among similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clean well, lathers sufficiently, and prevents acne about as well for me as other salicylic acid products - although I note that this is only 1% strength, vs 2% in most similar products. The exfoliation seems a bit more gentle than some others. So if you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;s a bit less harsh this may be your best bet. If you need full strength acne prevention and exfoliation this may not be your favorite. The smell is perhaps a bit medicinal but not unpleasant and is gone anyway as soon as you rinse.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and have occasional issues with adult acne. I wouldn&#x27;t classify my skin as sensitive but salicylic acid in my experience is a pretty harsh ingredient and has a tendency to sometimes irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, much to my surprise, did not irritate my skin at all. In fact, after using this product a few times I found my skin to look noticeably fresher and healthier. This scrub also seems to be working its magic on my acne issues. My acne isn&#x27;t completely eliminated but I&#x27;ve noticed the occurrence of new acne is far less frequent since I&#x27;ve been using this scrub. The exfoliating granules are great for sloughing off dead skin and I love the fresh orange fragrance. All in all a great scrub!</li>
            <li> really clears up my face</li>
            <li> Biore Acne Clearing Scrub smells like oranges and leaves skin feeling tingly and fresh. The exfoliating beads leaves skin feeling smooth, clean and shiny. The salacyclic acid and exfoliation of the scrub helps to clear dead skin cells and cleans pores to help prevent further acne breakouts. I recommend using a nice moisterizer after this product to keep it from over drying skin. If you are prone to acne, breakouts, and have oily skin this is a good cleansing product to use as a daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne but I do believe firmly in the benefits of exfoliation, and the active ingredient in this is probably the best mild chemical exfolent which you can use on a daily basis, if your skin is sensitive, like mine is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use this on my arms and legs as well as my face when I&#x27;m in the shower, and it takes off that little layer of dead skin and clears it away, leaving the newer soft smooth layer on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am prone to blackheads in my T-Zone, and this washes them away with regular use.  This leave my pores tight and invisible.  If you have the oily T-Zone, you know that&#x27;s a major accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild rosacea, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it or cause it to flare up.  The percentage of sal Acid is low, and the scrubbing beads are rounded and gentle enough so they don&#x27;t cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the Biore products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  This one is up there with the best cleansers, including department store brands.  It rinses away cleanly, foams gently, and has no scent.  I can highly recommend this for anyone with blackheads, whiteheads or pimples.  Try it on your chest and arms also.  It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product my son had acne and I gave it to him couple of days acne gone he loves it never gave it back to me now I have buy one more for myself I don&#x27;t have acne but I love the way it makes my skin looks and feels. It brighten Your skin  tone, good product.update all the spots are completely gone. My says he has no more black heads and must make sure I&#x27;m never out of this product, so I&#x27;m ordering a pk of 2 so we&#x27;ll always have one in the house.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Biore products, particularly their [[ASIN:B006RFZ66K Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips, 24 Count]] and their[[ASIN:B0009EILHG Biore Pore Perfect Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser, Cools &amp; Clears , 6.7 fl oz (198 ml)]], so I was eager to try this acne clearing scrub. Granted, I don&#x27;t have acne, but I do have problem skin. I was hoping this would help to keep my pores clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could honestly see a difference in my face after using this scrub just twice. My pores appeared to be minimized, my skin didn&#x27;t feel overly oily, and my complexion looked fresh and glowing (I love when that glowing look comes from clean looking skin rather than oily looking skin). Unfortunately, by the third day of using this product, my skin started feeling itchy, especially the upper portion of my cheeks. My nose also started peeling. Basically, my skin was getting dried out, which might actually be what someone with acne-prone skin needs in a face wash, but this was just too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the citrusy scent of this facial scrub. It comes out of the tube easily and is creamy and thick with little scrubbing beads in it. But this, too, wasn&#x27;t quite to my liking. I found it a little too creamy and it took more water and time to rinse. This wasn&#x27;t a problem in the shower, but when washing at the sink, there were a couple of occasions where my eyes became irritated from rinsing (basically because there was still product on my face that I hadn&#x27;t anticipated). I don&#x27;t hate this product, but I&#x27;d suggest caution when using it, for it feels soft, but is actually quite harsh.</li>
            <li> I love Biore and this is something I definitely needed for the oily skin and horrendously stubborn acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two other Biore products and the \\&quot;Steam Activated Cleanser\\&quot; is REALLY good as well.  My skin was tinkling for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system is MUCH, MUCH better than Proactive, which I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biore \\&quot;Acne Clearing Scub\\&quot; is a rub that has orange or orange particles in it that helps to agitate and remove dead skin.  I&#x27;ve learned with The Steam Activated Cleanser to wet my face first and afterwards, massage the product in for a couple of minutes and let it stay on for at least 5 minutes to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This again has proven to be the best remedy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biore products are VERY the very best.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used face cleansing products with either Salicylic Acid or Benzoyl Peroxide as the active ingredients. These are by far the best two types of acne fighting ingredients I&#x27;ve found. In the past when I&#x27;ve had issues with trying to control break-outs, Benzoyl Peroxide has been my go to ingredient. It kills the acne and dries out the skin when it&#x27;s extremely oily and nothing else will work. Any other time, I prefer cleansers with Salicylic Acid. It&#x27;s milder than Benzoyl Peroxide, but still very effective. It leaves skin less dried out and less likely to flake or peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my all time favorite cleansers is [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub]], which has Salicylic Acid and an exfoliant in it to scrub off old skin cells and any oil from the skin. This Biore Acne Scrub is very similar to the St. Ives, in that they both use Salicylic Acid and they both exfoliate. Biore has picked up on the great cleanser St. Ives has been making for years, and created their own formula similar to it. It&#x27;s a powerful combination, but doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. It leaves your skin buffed and all the dirt, oils and makeup are removed, and the active ingredients help heal acne and prevent more breakouts. I love that Biore has finally made a product similar to the St. Ives scrub, since this version has a little less exfoliant in it, which my daughter prefers over my St. Ives. It&#x27;s a great new option for those who want a more mild exfoliant but still get the same great results from the buffing and the acne fighting results from the Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Arrived timely with no issues. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Each month, hormonal changes cause mild acne. Since beginning to use Biore Acne Clearing Scrub, I have noticed a definite improvement. My only complaint is that it dries my skin out a bit, but not horribly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary ingredient is salicylic acid, which is associated with Reye&#x27;s Syndrome in children and adolescents. So if you are thinking of using this for acne in an adolescent, you will definitely want to talk to your dermatologist first and probably look for a different product.</li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with this face scrub. The abrasive content was just right - enough so I felt a scrubbing action, but not so much that it felt like I was sandblasting my face. It lathers very well - almost too well, in fact, since it takes some effort to rinse off. The scent make me think of citrus fruit, and was very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 1% concentration of salicylic acid, which is half as much as the Neutrogena salicylic acid washes and scrubs (my usual brand) which contain 2%. That&#x27;s both a positive and a negative: pro because it&#x27;s gentler on my skin (if I use the 2% more than once a day will cause redness); but con since it&#x27;s also less effective. It&#x27;s also more expensive than the Neutrogena salicylic acid versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scent is quite nice, and it left my face feeling very refreshed, so it deserves 5 stars. Definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re looking for a salicylic acid-based scrub.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it just really wakes my face up in the morning and energizes my skin. I can feel it opening my pores and deep cleaning my face, and I love the citrus smell, it really wakes me up. My face feels so smooth and cool and just refreshed after using this, I don&#x27;t even want to put makeup on, it feels that clean. Until now, I&#x27;ve always used Olay face stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sold on this, I just really love the cooling effects, I can&#x27;t get over how refreshing and energizing it is, its better than a morning cup of coffee to get you started for the day. Well, me, anyways, I can&#x27;t speak for everyone! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love Biore products and use them daily but I had not used this one yet. I wash my face in the shower because I am far too messy to wash it in the sink. Everything gets wet. This product is very similar to the blackhead scrub that I have used except it is orange instead of green. Both have the gritty scrub feeling that exfoliates your skin and leaves it feeling tingly clean. I leave it on for about a minute before I rinse and work it into my skin for a deep clean. I use the scrub about once a week and just a regular Biore liquid face wash the rest of the week so I don&#x27;t over dry my skin. I also use the blackhead strips about once a month to remove dirt deep down in my pores. I would recommend this product, as well as their other products. I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve used from Biore.</li>
            <li> Just started using face scrub and by the 2nd day my face looks clearer and so smooth..I have oily skin and works great for that too..Would definitely reccommend! : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product a couple of times, but it&#x27;s been great for my oily skin. Even thought it&#x27;s a scrub, I can use this product daily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. I have very oily skin and I really liked that this product kept my face oil-free and not shiny throughout the day. It also has a great smell and was a good price, so I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Bior&amp;eacute; Acne Clearing Scrub is a gentle cleansing scrub with a fresh citrus fragrance. It is mildly abrasive and has 1% salicylic acid so it does a very good facial cleanse, thoroughly removing the top layer of dead cells and leaving the skin tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ideal for occasional facial cleaning but I would caution teenagers against frequent or overly-aggressive scrubbing because it could irritate the skin and leave it red and sore and more prone to blemishes. This scrub is also good for older adults with occasional blemishes or oily skin and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Biore Acne Clearing Scrub is a strong facial exfoliate but its gentle enough on your skin to not cause any damage to your skin. This Biore Acne scrub has salicylic acid that helps remove dry skin and with the combination of the scrub this will give your skin a nice polished glow. I like that this scrub didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling raw and dry. The Biore Acne Clearing Scrub was gentle enough on my skin so that I can use it every day without causing my skin any irritation which is great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of using this scrub is almost immediately and you can see the renewed skin within just a few days. The Biore Acne Clearing Scrub has a nice orange or citrus smell that also helps calm your skin and prevent any irritation. I love this scrub and will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> This is a less expensive version of similar products. It&#x27;s no better or worse than others we&#x27;ve tried. One daughter, age 19, is ready to give up and try prescription Acutane. She tried Clinique&#x27;s expensive 3-step program after Pro-Active didn&#x27;t work. The dermatologist has prescribed different topical lotions, expensive, not very effective. Biore Acne Clearing Scrub might work for mild cases, but hormones and heredity don&#x27;t seem to respond to anything but time.</li>
