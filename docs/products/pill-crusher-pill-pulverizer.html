            <li>Does a very good job of crushing.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of turning most pills of brittle to medium/hard self-consistency into a semi-fine powder.  </li>
            <li>Love this pill crusher but the rubber edges eventually come off requiring you to purchase another if you&#x27;re hand strength isn&#x27;t great or you have tender skin.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>This model is very top of the line.</li>

            <li>This pill crusher works amazing turns the pills into dust.</li>
            <li>Also, if it hurts your hand, why not set it on the table while you&#x27;re crushing the pill or do what I do and hold the product on its sides in the air and twist both sides simultaneously, the pressure of the bottom of the pill crusher against the hand isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li>This is a really great device for crushing pills.</li>
            <li>I use this to give my daughter her pills and this crusher is amazing.</li>
            <li>Works great for crushing pills into a powder</li>
            <li>It gets 3 stars because it is priced well and the top design with the rubber cushions is good.  </li>
            <li>whatever is handy.  </li>
            <li>The price is super-cheap too, considering how effective it is.    </li>
            <li>With literally a \\&quot;turn of the screw\\&quot;, this pulverizer is highly effective.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to crush up pills for my dog an it works wonders, was impressed with this for real</li>
            <li>its job well and is a nice buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>If I just wanted to break a pill apart, this kind of works.  </li>

            <li>It does a really nice job</li>
            <li>It crushes the pills really good and can crush more than one t a time.</li>
            <li>It crushes them effectively, but not into a powder.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>This crushes my pills up nicely.  </li>
            <li>This has to be the best pill crusher out there, used it to grind up my multivitamins... work really well...</li>
            <li>Effective... up to a point.</li>
            <li>Nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I think it will work nicely when I need it.</li>
            <li>Works really good, easy to use too.</li>
            <li>very easy to turn.  </li>
            <li>It also cleans very easily.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use and has lasted over a year.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I Used this for my cats medicine and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>is one that in one good turn will crush the pill into fine powder.  </li>
            <li>It is easier, faster and more effective.  </li>
            <li>but they arent good -- but theyre cheap (and are what I would consider durable for the price).</li>
            <li>I wish they had rubber on both sides, though, gripping the plastic kind of hurts after a while.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Also, it would have been nice if the maker had made the bottom with rubber grips like the top.</li>
            <li>real clean..</li>
            <li>This pill crusher did a good job of crushing the pills.  </li>
            <li>Annihilate those pills with just one compression; this crusher means business and yields a very fine powder.</li>
            <li>So easy!</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong!</li>
            <li>A very good and decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>-- I have found these to be the best -- they are quick and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Finally, a pill crusher that works amazingly well, and comes at a great price!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed at a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is easy to use and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, I have arthritus, and does a good job crushing.</li>
            <li>Although this is effective in breaking up the pill to an appreciable degree - it does not pulverize, or make into fine powder (the kind you can mix into fruit juice or water).&lt;br /&gt;Might not seem important to most...</li>
            <li>Fits my huge multivitamin!</li>
            <li>bought this Pill Crusher to see if it would work better</li>
            <li>You just unscrew the top to get the content.</li>
            <li>Why didn&#x27;t the top design and materials get repeated on the bottom?  </li>
            <li>For a tiny, inexpensive gadget, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Worked okay for one pill.</li>
            <li>But, neded to twist the top on &amp;.off</li>
            <li>The Ultra Pill Crusher by Apex Medical is the BEST pill crusher I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>My opinion is that it couldn&#x27;t be any better than it is</li>
            <li>Excellent product for a ridiculously low price.</li>
            <li>Worked much better than the one we had.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews of many pill crushers before purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve tried it many ways, it still sticks.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of the pill popping when crushing it!</li>
            <li>and I already love it.</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of pill crushers-including a hammer...always hoping that the next one would be the best.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I bought one locally and works GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>I had tried others and most don&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>I am able to crush all four pills at once.</li>
            <li>Best regards,    John Younger</li>
            <li>I think the bottom should be made more like the top.</li>
            <li>Like it better than the one from Walmart.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>and we like the grip you can get on the top because it isn&#x27;t just  &lt;</li>
            <li>After having to put them in her mouth for her and watch her struggle to swallow I wanted a better way for her to get the medicine she needed.</li>
            <li>By gripping both top and bottom</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would also be advantageous for parents who need to get pills into balky kids, mix &#x27;em in with a favorite \\&quot;treat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>We have a lovable dog who has been part of our family for 14 years.</li>
            <li>It takes no time or effort to crush pills (one or many) to smithereens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pointed tip at the end of the top part of the pill crusher is the trick.  </li>
            <li>This make it more uniform sizes of powder, which I sprinkle in his food.</li>
            <li>This crusher is okay and</li>
            <li>just okay....  </li>
            <li>It works great and even has room in the handle to hold whole pills.</li>
            <li>think that there must be a better pill crusher out there.  </li>
            <li>It also has many threads</li>
            <li>all takes more time</li>
            <li>She has rheumatoid arthritis and is still able to use it to crush her pills.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have bought and reviewed many a pill crusher as my son has a multiple-pill-a-day regimine and is tube fed.</li>
            <li>It would be better though if the bottom had ribber coating like the top because you have to grip the bottom while turning the top.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t crush too many an once, gets stuck if you put too many in.</li>
            <li>If you have problems with your hands, the shape of the top makes it easier to use than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Does okay for a couple of pills at a time</li>
            <li>love this gadget.  </li>
            <li>We had problems with the powdered medication getting stuck up inside the crusher and then in the plastic grooves that the top spins on.</li>
            <li>It works, what more can be said for an inexpensive crusher.  </li>
            <li>You do have to have patience screwing the top on and off, but no doubt that it works.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this pill crusher is much better.</li>
            <li>This worked better than the cup idea.</li>
            <li>I was better able to mix into her food.</li>
            <li>My skin came off from trying to turn the top.  </li>
            <li>(I have a channel lock and patience and, yes, going through that hassle is still better than the two-spoon method.).  </li>
            <li>(I have a channel lock and patience and, yes, going through that hassle is still better than the two-spoon method.).  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I bought it and will use it often.</li>
            <li>Comfort grip on the top but not on the  bottom.</li>
            <li>If you have too many pills, you can rip some skin</li>
            <li>I know she is still winning</li>
            <li>I have tried about seven different pill crushers, and this one is the BEST!!!!  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Using this pill crusher is much better than my &amp;#34;hit it inside a plastic bag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have not been able to swallow my pills if taking them after supper and sometimes during the day.  </li>
            <li>I used to take two spoons and crush my pills, but this does a much better job</li>
            <li>The top has&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li>The top is pointed and the bottom has the matching contour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found cheaper crushers that I like much better.</li>
            <li>Crushes pills ok, but not without a lot of pain.  </li>
            <li>Even bought an extra one for school, excellent product!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have back-up if needed, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many pill crushers and with the exception of a mortar and pestle, this one beats them all.  </li>
            <li>I would really love to give this product the 5 stars it deserves, but I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but hey..It did the job :-)</li>
            <li>It is sturdy, and better made than others I have used.</li>
            <li>I gave up on it and used my Magic Bullet.  </li>
            <li>But I guess the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make it any more.</li>
            <li>Works okay, won&#x27;t grind some pills if you put them all in at once.</li>
            <li>Not the best I had to buy a different one  the ulrais not that</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The crusher works just as beautifully as when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped me and it&#x27;s very handy to take when traveling.  </li>
            <li>This is very effective -- and a real lifesaver</li>
            <li>Easy to turn (even with arthritis and carpel tunnel) and crushes to a very fine powder.  </li>
            <li>The design for grip &amp; turning is well thought out and makes the crushing very easy.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and had no problem crushing my tablets with this.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use and had no problems crushing the heck out of whatever pill I put in there...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The design of the pill crusher has some pluses, with the top being easy to grip and turn, and it may work okay to crush two or three pills, but it doesn&#x27;t work well to crush a number of pills and</li>
            <li>It works great - plenty of space for crushing large tablets as well.</li>
            <li>It is made with quality material and it makes pill crushing so easy and effortless!  </li>
            <li>it crushes very finely which is important.</li>
            <li>And the powder was very fine from the crushing.  </li>
            <li>When I needed a new one, I read the reviews on Amazon and purchased this one and its been great.</li>
            <li>Twist the top until it crushes the pill(s) easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and pleased with results.</li>
            <li>The top and bottom handle areas are easy to grip.</li>
            <li>but it easily jams with more than two.</li>
            <li>Always twist from the rubber top or place a tower over the bottom to make the work easy.</li>
            <li>Eighty something parents are able to crush their multitude of pills easily to take in pudding or apple sauce.</li>
            <li>So by crushing pills, I am better able to control my ailments.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve probably been warned about this before, but make sure your pill is safe to take after crushing.</li>
            <li>I use this to crush tablets that I give to my dog, its light, yet strong and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean after use.  </li>
            <li>Crushes and powders pills well.  very easy to clean and decontaminate with rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the top allows the crushing of pills easier on hands and wrist</li>
            <li>had bought Fit &amp; Healthy Tablet Splitter and Crusher from CVS store before</li>
            <li>saw Fit &amp; Healthy Tablet Splitter and Crusher on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The top is comfortable to use but the bottom hurts my hands.</li>
            <li>My mom has a peg tube (feeding tube), and I read the reviews on this before ordering to make sure that it crushes pills sufficiently to fit through the tube.  </li>
            <li>The cheap pill crusher from Wal-Mart works much better.</li>
            <li>Very durable, good price too...</li>
            <li>Plus, for some reason, I find it to be just kind of fun. ^_^</li>
            <li>Comfortable &amp; easy twist top.</li>
            <li>We crush our dog&#x27;s pills to a more granular texture, but you can turn the crushing handle to turn the pills into a fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited about being able to use this gadget to crush up a Tylenol or antibiotic pill for her and make taking medications easier in the years ahead when she outgrows the liquid medications.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product or the splitter!  </li>
            <li>Other than this concern, we found this to be an excellent product that should give you long-term use.</li>
            <li>My puppy&#x27;s supplements are the size of sweet tarts and this one can handle it!</li>

            <li>This thing is so easy.</li>
            <li>Easily washable.</li>
            <li>Grind easily with almost no effort needed.</li>
            <li>The rubber on the top is a great idea - why not make the bottom the same?  </li>
            <li>Once again, the style of handle on this one makes it easy to tighten and loosen.</li>
            <li>Pulverizes pills easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use,</li>
            <li>So easy to use no muscle strength required.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Put the pill in and turn and pills turn into a granular dust which is easily added to food or drink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the bottom should be as easy to grip as the top&lt;br /&gt;but works</li>
            <li>This pill crusher is a dream and makes the process so easy.</li>
            <li>This does the job thoroughly and easily.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ergonomic design, easy to turn&lt;br</li>
            <li>So easy</li>
            <li>easy to use, crushes a pill well.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, keeps powder inside and not on the grooves.</li>
            <li>Grinds fairly easily but the bottom portion lacks any rubbery portions, which would keep the plastic from biting in to your hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise the device crushes pills to satisfaction and makes them easy to administer to your pets&#x27; food.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Made grinding pills for my wife easy.  </li>

            <li>Pills crush easily.  </li>
            <li>The grip makes it easy to smash those pills.</li>
            <li>The unit fits so easily into the grooves.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use easy to grip works like a charm and makes any pill powder.</li>
            <li>Takes a strong grip to twist the cap to crush the pills.</li>
            <li>You don;t have to be strong at all to use this.</li>
            <li>I have really strong</li>
            <li>After that I decided to renew my search for a good pill crusher and turned to Amazon to find one highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It works well when crushing one at a time, but takes a while to get a fine powder when crushing more than one.</li>
            <li>I have a special needs child who has a feeding tube, and she receives many medications that she can&#x27;t take by mouth.</li>
            <li>it pulverizes even the toughest, hardest pills into fine granules than can be flushed easily through an Ng tube.</li>
            <li>This crusher makes the medicine a fine powder which is easy to mix and administer through a 1.0 ml oral syringe without issue.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased it as it does the job quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I have used others before, and this is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash and has held up nicely thus far.</li>
            <li>Its also designed to make the crushing efficient and also shaped to make it easy to use by those with mobility/joint issues.</li>
            <li>It pulverizes my vitamins into a fine powder that I mix into protein shakes.</li>
            <li>I just use a towel which works fine.</li>
            <li>I can adjust how fine I wish to crush the foods.  </li>
            <li>My co-workers and I in my hospital unit all think the crusher works just fine</li>
            <li>Works fine - even on some of the hardest pills.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to finely grind pills into &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;, then combine with peanut butter and stick to the roof of her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Crushing pills is not always easy as it is but the pill pulverizer does make the job easer.</li>
            <li>you will get a fine powder with minimum  effort and no arthritis pain</li>
            <li>If they manufactured the top and bottom using the same soft grip as the top, then this would be the perfect tool for crushing pills.</li>
            <li>The handle design makes it easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Crushes everything into a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Advertising that it&#x27;s ideal for people with limited strength is a joke.</li>
            <li>Well made, easy to clean, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is important because of the fine power will NOT get caught up in the threads and therefore wasting some of the pill.</li>
            <li>For a little plastic gadget, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This little pill crusher is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>sometimes a film of fine powder will cling to the sides of the crushing chamber; we found this powder film to be the case when crushing the aspirin tablets to a powder.</li>
            <li>and it is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Crushes meds up easy and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes crushing the cats&#x27; pill medications a snap.</li>
            <li>The pill crusher is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Simply great and the screws on the outside, so you don&#x27;t get powder cakes into the part of the device that has threads where it crushes.</li>
            <li>I was crushing the pills in a spoon</li>
            <li>The great thing about this pill crusher is that the grooves are on the outside so the pill dust doesn&#x27;t accumulate in them.</li>

            <li>Some had remarked on how comfortable it is to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...</li>
            <li>My husband has a time crushing worm pill for our finicky dogs with spoon or fork.  </li>
            <li>This pill crusher is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>; I think I&#x27;m working some aggro out while crushing these pills.</li>
            <li>If the legs do break, but the crushing chamber never does, it will remain at four</li>
            <li>If the legs do break, but the crushing chamber never does, it will remain at four</li>
            <li>Cheap,</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is easy to clean by wiping or rinsing.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that the crushing surfaces would be dimpled, instead of smooth.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean and store.  </li>
            <li>Easier for the crushing.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so I can slip pills into my husbands drink to knock him out and then tell him how great he was last night.  </li>
            <li>The pill crusher is simple, works great, and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with pills and this handy pill crusher works great.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I made the right choice..</li>
            <li>Knob-style which fits very nicely in hand and has blue no-slip grips.</li>
            <li>Pill crushing for administration through PEG tube became a quick and easy task with this device.</li>
            <li>Crushing a pill into a fine powder is quick and almost effortless compared to using the mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li>It is quick, easy, and gives us peace of mind.</li>
            <li>This is a super easy way to crush pills.</li>
            <li>This pill crusher works great for crushing glucosamine pills for my Golden Retriever which I mix in her food daily.</li>
            <li>While this thing feels a bit flimsy when you first pick it up, it sure works well.  </li>
            <li>Not arthritis friendly and still leaves chunks while wasting a lot of med on the screw mechanism.</li>
            <li>Not even worth returning!</li>
            <li>, I do not recomend this for safely crushing pills it just looks cool and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter did use this successfully and is planning on trying to take medication without help, when next she needs it.</li>
            <li>Ok for partially crushing overly large supplements</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really crushes the pills almost immediately into a very fine powder, with no chunks at all.</li>
            <li>I needed to grind pills to a very fine powder and this did the trick very well.</li>
            <li>I tried it tonight for the first time and was blown away by how easy this was to operate and how finely it pulverized TWO pills at once with virtually no strength required.</li>
            <li>If mine were to break today by my own doing, I would repurchase the same one, or consider buying an electric pill grinder, but this is just so much more portable..</li>
            <li>For now it is a clean recommend.</li>
            <li>the product is very cheap and it does its job very efficiently for any kind/size of pill or caplet.</li>
            <li>However, I have a large number of pills to pulverize, so most individuals may not have this problem.</li>
            <li>I am about to have bariatric surgery and won&#x27;t be able to swallow my fairly large metformin medication -- a diabetes drug.</li>
            <li>Just as a mater of caution in order for a life time of any crusher, it is best to cut up the hard pills in a Pill Splitter, but if need be this Crusher will crush the hardest pill.    </li>
            <li>was right in saying you won&#x27;t get a fine powder.</li>
            <li>It really does \\&quot;pulverize\\&quot; the pill so that the result is fine granules that are easy to swallow or add to liquid.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this product for long, but so far it has been great!</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter has difficulty swallowing tablets so now she can crush her own, add some apple sauce</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a really good pill crusher, this one is the only one to get in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The grip top makes it so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>If you are able to swallow pills, this is to much work.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.</li>
            <li>This item sounded good but have fallen short for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, i found that a good size pair of lineman&#x27;s pliers made short work of the 4 pills, turning each into powder with one squeeze.</li>
            <li>A true &amp;#34;pulverizer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is a good device if you just want to break the pill up into smaller fragments, it is not a crusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not do a good job if there are several pills at once.</li>
            <li>if I wanted to take a full does when the force of smashing the pills would split the foil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cheap, which makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product all around easy to use and includes a little storage area underneath blue cap on the top of the item.</li>
            <li>I have NO upper body strength at all, and I was able to use this pill crusher easily!</li>
            <li>Like I said earlier the design was really nice and easy to use with my arthritis.</li>
            <li>Works excellent and because there is no blades or metal grater, their is little concern of losing a large % of the pill volume.  </li>
            <li>All 3 people didn&#x27;t know such a fine device exists and were thrilled.  </li>
            <li>little device works well as it allows you to get a good grip when turning the top to crush the meds.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a very useful product when I need to take very large pills.</li>
            <li>What is especially clever is the shape of the pill cavity.</li>
            <li>the threads work quickly when opening and closing.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and got here as described.</li>
            <li>actually crushes pills, which many of the ones you buy at drug stores don&#x27;t seem to be able to do.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the pill gets caught sideways but a quick shake and it flattens out again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several different models of pill crushers, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s portable, but I stopped using it quite quickly.</li>
            <li>great price and completely crushes the vitamins for my young daughter</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, as always.</li>
            <li>I was able to crush a large adult vitamin with this little gadget......works beautifully !!!  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied especially after considering the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I was crushing up glucosamine pills for my dog to put in his food, this thing could do a couple at a time and did exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Works very very well!</li>
            <li>Which i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li>This crusher works for large tablets and is easy to turn.</li>
            <li>Depending on how far you turn the top, you can get various sizes of crumbs or if you turn it all the way, you get a nice fine dust.</li>
            <li>This is a neat little gadget, it does not take up much room, and most of the time I am very pleased with the way it works, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It absolutely pulverizes a pill very quickly.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I smiled and dropped the old one in the trash.</li>
            <li>It works fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This item works very well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews before I purchased this product and all were positive, well they must&#x27;ve been crushing one pill at a time, I have to crush up all of my husbands</li>
            <li>The top is larger and easy to grasp and turn.</li>
            <li>The shape of the top makes it fairly easy to turn to get the finest powder possible.</li>
            <li>This really crushes pills to a fine powder.  </li>
            <li>It does absolutely pulverize the pills that I crush, into a fine powder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting the pill positioned correctly and crushing in steps is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is fairly large and fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little gadget works great for her.</li>
            <li>The little pill crusher works great.</li>
            <li>It takes several times of loosening and tightening to get it to a fine powder and the powder sticks to the top.  </li>
            <li>It is an ingenious product -- it miraculously crushes any vitamins/pills into fine powder with a simple twist of the cap.  </li>
            <li>The top of the crusher is nicely protected with soft coating, but they should have done the same for the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It made pill crushing so much easier</li>
            <li>It is cheap, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>I like how much easier the pill crushing is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes crushing pills much easier,&lt;br /&gt;especially</li>
            <li>I really like the beveled surfaces in the crushing chamber.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had know about this years ago - possibly the best $6 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>Now if only they could make the bottom a wee bit more comfortable on the hands, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Simple effective product.</li>
            <li>This is problematic in that one still has to do more \\&quot;crushing\\&quot; (ie- grinding) after your meds have been through the crusher (the pieces are too big to fit through, say, a feeding tube).</li>
            <li>But if you need your pills crushed, this is good for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li>The grinder does cost $20, but so well worth it.</li>
            <li>I work at a elementary school and must dispense a \\&quot;horse</li>
            <li>I can also see it as useful for pet owners when dogs and cats are troublesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>soft and well made as the crusher top is; the bottom is wicked on the hand</li>
            <li>The grinder does cost $20, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This crusher, by FAR, has been our favorite.</li>
            <li>This lets the pieces scatter more naturally and not pile up to create a stress point.  </li>
            <li>This lets the pieces scatter more naturally and not pile up to create a stress point.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers were right when they said one of the things they liked about this unit was that the threads were on the OUTSIDE of the unit NOT on the inside of the cylinder.</li>
            <li>Crushing larger pills requires holding the sharp edges of the bottom and applying a fair amount of pressure to turn the top.  </li>
            <li>The only way it could be better is to have a compartment for pill storage, making it travel friendly.</li>
            <li>I stood there in utter amazement that a little five dollar piece of plastic works so beautifully and could have spared me the discomfort and unpleasantness I lived with for years (not to mention the dentist&#x27;s bill, which I assure you was MUCH more than five dollars).</li>
            <li>Still hurt when crushed by hand, so gave this a try, now a very fine power and mix with a drink and medicine is taken as needed!</li>
            <li>pulverizer is the right word.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hold it just right in my hand so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>The design exerts a great deal of force on the pill chamber without having to screw it very tightly.  </li>
            <li>The result was a finely and equally ground pill,  easily emptied, and with a small-sized residue which mixes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mother takes a couple very large pills that her pill splitter can&#x27;t split.</li>
            <li>and they are smooth enough to turn easily.</li>
            <li>The crushing part is easy if you only have one or two pills in the container.</li>
            <li>The crusher is designed for easy, solid gripping for good torque while grinding (some of the small ones dont work well for this reason).</li>
            <li>Yes the grip on the bottom is different from the rubber-padded grip on the top, but I find that the three-lobe design does not require gripping as tightly as many other designs.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an exceptionally useful device for crushing vitamin pills (or the non-coated pills of your choice) and beats the hell out of the two spoon crushing method (You don&#x27;t want to deal with that, so</li>
            <li>and it is not hard to crush medicine, when holding the bottom of the crusher you might need to use a towel so the bottom will not hurt your hand if you are crushing a lot of medicine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend easy to use especially for someone like me who has tendinitis, super easy to use &amp; turn.</li>
            <li>The design is great and the large vitamins and calcium pulverize well in just a few turns.</li>
            <li>As someone who has never been able to swallow pills due to whatever strange mental thing my brain does to actively stop me from doing so, even when I try my best to trick it; This pill crusher works great.</li>
            <li>I have one at work and one at home, as I have to take several large pills throughout the day, and this makes it so easy to take these supplements I really need to stay healthy.  </li>
            <li>How hard could it honestly be for them to make a rubber top and bottom to this?</li>
            <li>Had been using a different model that tore up our hands daily and didn&#x27;t come close to achieving the great powdered consistency that this did.</li>
            <li>You simply put the pill(s) inside the crushing chamber and turn the crushing handle until you crush the pills to the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>He said that he was able to use this one without difficulty, and asked me to buy him a few more of them.</li>
            <li>works great especially for those big &amp;#34;horse tabs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I can see what I have crushed and if the pill needs more crushing.</li>
            <li>I have an old injury to my wrist and it makes it so easy to crush pills now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold the crushing chamber in my left hand and turn the crusher top part with my right and the little blue covers on the 3 corners help me hold on to the top and turn it easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As stated earlier, our only concern with this device is when you turn a pill into a powder, some of that powder clings as a film to the sides of the crushing chamber so you will not get the full dose of your medication; we estimate that up to 5% of your pill may cling to the crushing container wall as a fine powder film.</li>
            <li>This was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Considering the reasonable cost, I am very happy with it since many crushers are much more expensive or, if cheaper, much less durable.</li>
            <li>The top half of the unit is rubberized &amp; easy to grip</li>
            <li>You just screw the top down and the pills become a fine powder.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I did the first pill for her</li>
            <li>It is a well designed product that performs exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I think people of many different strengths can use it.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for in order to crush pills.</li>
            <li>And thanks to the reviewer who suggested this!</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t exactly</li>
            <li>We have used many Pill Crushers on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Most of these cross thread, and are useless, however, this Pill Crusher is excellent, and pulverizes even the hardest pill.    </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get the same grip on the bottom as you do on the top.</li>
            <li>It did seem to crush the pills pretty well.</li>
            <li>It actually crushes the pills (don&#x27;t do more than about 3 at a time</li>
            <li>This really hurts to turn with pills in it!  </li>
            <li>can be a bit difficult for me sometimes; and this works perfectly for that.</li>
            <li>okay if you just need to crush a pill or two, but I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li>I LIKE this pill crusher but wish the bottom was the same as the top.  </li>
            <li>She is able to crush a very tiny pill without any problems!</li>
            <li>I think this product works better on different types of pills.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a Tylenol product, would work better since it&#x27;s a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>Soft grips is needed so that this is a comfortable device for all ages to use.  </li>
            <li>the top portion is comfy, where the blue rubber pieces are.  </li>
            <li>Why they did not just make the bottom the same as the top is something that I cannot understand.  </li>
            <li>and it hurts your hands--not the top part with the blue but the bottom part.  </li>
            <li>So I do a first crush, then open the top a bit, shake it up</li>
            <li>If I were to redesign this I&#x27;d put the same rubber moldings on the top section on the bottom section as well.  </li>
            <li>I have alot of problems with my hands and found this to be the best one I&#x27;ve ever used,I bought two thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hold up,was I wrong.</li>
            <li>It works well and is not difficult to use..</li>
            <li>I saw those heavier duty ones first hand in the hospital</li>
            <li>I found this works okay for larger pills</li>
            <li>and you wouldn&#x27;t think so at first....</li>
            <li>My only qualm with this is if you are storing pills inside this unit, it doesn&#x27;t have any sort of child safe lid, so I have to keep this away from my toddler to prevent any accidental ingestion.  </li>
            <li>It really makes the pill DUST !</li>
            <li>I love that the threads are on the outside of the jar so the medication does not get stuck in between the threads.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much easier!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give this five stars if the bottom was constructed with the same design/materials as the top.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I first received it, but it works great!</li>
            <li>Everything gets crushed and flows threw her g-tube nicely.</li>
            <li>The first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first saw it</li>
            <li>The external &amp;#34;twisty part&amp;#34; keeps most of the drug in the cylinder.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has rubberized blue gribs on the top that helps when turning the pill crusher.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it seemed the best out of others shown.</li>
            <li>And this does that, and I am pretty content with the performance.</li>
            <li>I did keep the crush hoping I would be able to use it at a later date.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;m using this type of product.</li>
            <li>It looks well made and is good and heavy, sturdy.  </li>
            <li>hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a marble mortar &amp; pestle at home for my previous crushing jobs, but this works better and is easier to transfer the powder to a syringe to mix with water.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I gave this item five stars because it is durable, easy to use, and priced right.</li>
            <li>I use this to grind bute pills for horses (\\&quot;pills\\&quot; are very large) and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Turn a little more and it starts crushing the pill.</li>
            <li>The bottom section needs to have some kind of rubber or other covering - it digs in to the hand when turning.</li>
            <li>It has no rough bumps which never allow the pills to turn to a fine powder</li>
            <li>It is big enough that you can get a good grip on it and</li>
            <li>I was really hoping the extra diameter of the crusher would allow me to get more power to the crusher itself...</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t bother to write reviews, but was so delighted with this product that I felt compelled to give it a stellar review.</li>
            <li>Clean up is super easy, and the little hidden compartment is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The crushing chamber is made from the same plastic as the legs and though thicker than the legs, is still far more likely to crack or break if too much force is applied in crushing a tablet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The crushing chamber is made from the same plastic as the legs and though thicker than the legs, is still far more likely to crack or break if too much force is applied in crushing a tablet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pill/tablet will center in the bottom and the pointy top will go right through and crushes nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping</li>
            <li>and she says it&#x27;s the first one her hands can really grip.</li>
            <li>My hands are soft and while it&#x27;s not the most comfortable feeling in the world, it&#x27;s certainly not discouraging to the point that it should make you think twice about getting this.</li>
            <li>If one wants true powder, not little chunks or grains, this is it!</li>
            <li>Crushes pills nicely, but it does not take it down to power..</li>
            <li>This was a simple procedure that is easy to repeat and thoroughly crushes the pills.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly as simple and easy as that.</li>
            <li>Any powder left in the crusher comes out easily with a tap.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and has a big compartment to shake up and recrush for finer pieces.</li>
            <li>, it actually turns tablets into powder which I can then easily mix into my cat&#x27;s food.</li>
            <li>it lasted over a good year and a half but the top just snapped in half in my hands while in use.</li>
            <li>I like it because its strong and sturdy and crushes pretty well, sometimes large pieces are left over so you have to moving it around to make sure all is crushed</li>
            <li>The bottom of the crusher should have the same coating as the top - the gripping ridges are sharp and hurt my hands when trying to really pulverize a pill.</li>
            <li>I am certain it was these vitamins that did it.</li>
            <li>I put 3 large dog pills in it at a time with no problems.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, she uses it on large pill and vitamins she has to take.</li>
            <li>I think I have gone through about a dozen different models over the past 2.5 years, and this one works best by far.  </li>
            <li>It cleans nicely and is much bigger than I expected, around 3 inches in diameter, easy to grip and the blue color portion is a soft touch rubberized plastic which is easy on the hands.  </li>
            <li>I use the larger compound pills for thyroid and this crushes them up just fine.</li>
            <li>This thing actually pulverizes the pill into fine powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine enough for my use.</li>
            <li>I use it to crush some medication into a fine powder to be mixed into breastmilk for my baby.</li>
            <li>works fine, optimistic that it&#x27;ll last for years of use.</li>
            <li>you could spend way more for a professional one rated best,but if you&#x27;re crushing less than a dozen pills a day,why?</li>
            <li>The top blue and white portion is soft and easy on your hand.  </li>
            <li>Great little item for anyone who has to try to give animals regular medication.</li>
            <li>Small (easily portable), easy to use, and works very well to crush pills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend unscrewing once or twice after the initial crushing, tapping the crusher to re-situate the material into the middle, and re-tightening again to get a fine crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best way to use it is to screw down until the tablet breaks, unscrew a little then screw down some more and repeat this until the tablet is powered.  </li>

            <li>Amazing how few drugstores carry a pill crusher.</li>
            <li>I take different medicines every day including a huge antibiotic pill</li>
            <li>We had been crushing the tablets with a wooden kitchen mallet, which was a real chore, but then found this pill crusher.</li>
            <li>This product definitely pulverizes huge Glucosamine caplets.  </li>
            <li>I find it easier to halve larger pills before crushing.</li>
            <li>Crushes pills very well without accumulating residue.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind so much the pills getting stuck as much as the design of the bottom, but that is probably why it is priced so well...</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t try crushing multiple pills at a time as that didn&#x27;t fit the dosing schedule, but seems likely that even that would work.</li>
            <li>And I dont have to walk all the way back to the nurses station to access the crusher -- because this will fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li>Works very well for my son&#x27;s allergy pills.</li>
            <li>When crushing several pills I had to loosen the vice, then shake the contents to re-adjust their position and then tighten the vice /crusher again.  </li>
            <li>The picture/description doesn&#x27;t show it, but the bottom is conical, so the dust gathers in the center if you tap it on the table, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven</li>
            <li>No complaints, exept one - it is not enough convinient to bear it in hand when crushing.</li>
            <li>With this pill crusher and the Apex Ultra Pill Splitter it made my morning routine so, so much easier</li>
            <li>I had a sore throat and really couldn&#x27;t swallow my antibiotics.</li>
            <li>I like the way it crushers medicine and that part does really well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone in need of crushing pills.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li>I definitely appreciated it.</li>
            <li>This is not only highly effective for crushing (especially with a twisting back and forth motion), but also lends itself well to mixing the powdered meds with water and pulling up into a syringe.</li>
            <li>pill crusher has a simple but rugged design that fits comfortably in your hands during use.</li>
            <li>I was using a spatula in a bowl to crush my dog&#x27;s pills, but this is so much easier.  </li>
            <li>For a plastic pill crusher, I didn&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my dog&#x27;s glucosamine and oral flea meds because he won&#x27;t take them whole.</li>
            <li>is how I have learned to get a very satisfactory powder of supplements.............</li>
            <li>thus only two stars for this unwise, reckless and bizarre manufacturing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to crush pills than using a spoon.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and have to crush medications for patients very often.</li>
            <li>There is 1 vitamen tab that it does not crush very well, that might be because I try to crush 5 at a time.  </li>
            <li>It really does pulverize the pills so I can put them in his food</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really crush up my anavite pills very well - not even if I put them in one at a time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>have to maybe unturn and turn again about 3-4 times to really crash pill</li>
            <li>Can not swallow the pill whole or even in thirds...</li>
            <li>But it seems very sturdy, so</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t tell how much medication we were losing out of the crusher</li>
            <li>Very well designed.</li>
            <li>This thing makes the process so much simpler than trying to crush them in a bowl with a spoon.</li>
            <li>I kick myself for not getting this much sooner.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this pill crusher since we&#x27;d tried others that did not crush very well.  </li>
            <li>We have to crush all of our daughter&#x27;s pills to get them through her G-tube and this really does the job.  </li>
            <li>However, the bottom is very abrasive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonably priced pill crusher.  </li>
            <li>This pill crusher really pulverizes as stated.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this pill crusher.</li>
            <li>This pill crusher really works</li>
            <li>I forgot to use this to crush my multivitamin pill (which wasn&#x27;t even a whole one,</li>
            <li>and I was very scared.</li>
            <li>Still, it works really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Pill Crusher - absolutely..</li>
            <li>Pill Pulverizer - not so much.</li>
            <li>having engaged the item, and therefore having expected the job to have been completed at that point.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, on balance, this is not a horrible gadget.</li>
            <li>This helped me so much.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this does a very exacting job.</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble swallowing pills for whatever reason, but this effectively solves that problem for me.</li>
            <li>This is only effective for smaller pills - but not for anything like a multi-vitamin.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good pill crusher because I was always making a mess crushing pills under spoons or other things.  </li>
            <li>; - I honestly thought it was a waste of money..</li>
            <li>The knob is large and rubberized to make it user friendly, possibly even for arthritic</li>
            <li>It is light and made of strong polypropylene and last a long time.</li>
            <li>overall works much better than crushing with a spoon or other utensil.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, very easy to use and crushes pills with very little effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple other models and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The item is better than other brand, however, one design flaw.  </li>
            <li>It makes light work of both tiny and huge pills with little effort, which is great for me since my mom has cancer, and she takes fist fulls of pills that need to be crushed for her peg tube on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>There were so many other pill crushers to choose from..</li>
            <li>I bought one of the crappy plastic ones and used it for a year and it broke and never really crushed the pills to powder, just more tiny chunks.</li>
            <li>Relatively neat and clean process.</li>
            <li>This little device is able to easily, EASILY crush a large pill into mostly powder and a few tiny pieces.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs or wants to crush up their pills.</li>
            <li>I have tried various pill crushers over the years to crush meds for my son and daughter with special needs.  </li>
            <li>But it was perfect, small, exactly the size for a one pill, I didn&#x27;t have to turn the top part so tight, because it was small</li>
            <li>As far as how it crushes... it does pulverize ;-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice and small to take with us everywhere.  </li>
            <li>You just insert the pills and screw down the top.  </li>
            <li>I like to hold the pulverizer in my hands instead of putting it down on a table top when using it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to shake the dust into my mouth and wash it down with water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the element that pushes down on the pills, so you can&#x27;t grind the pills by screwing the top.  </li>
            <li>The cover squeezes down the more you tighten it.</li>
            <li>Takes a little more time than I&#x27;d like but really does pulverise &#x27;em</li>
            <li>I also think that the bowl coming to a point is a plus compared to the flat bottom container that the other one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to invent one of these for all ages to use and work properly because its really a simple design that manufacturer&#x27;s  seem to struggle with getting it perfect.</li>
            <li>When you put the tablets in the pill crusher, you just turn the knob and the pills are crushed, it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li>Both the bottom and top pieces are slightly conical.</li>
            <li>With no strength required my dog&#x27;s pill is crushed so easily, and I can mix it into her food.  </li>
            <li>IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE THE SPLITTR FUNCTION, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS ODD BECAUSE MANY PRODUCTS ARE DUAL FUNCTION...</li>
            <li>Giving him that many pills one after another is not viable nor is having each pill compounded individually (you cannot compound multiple medicines - they would not have the correct dosages).  </li>
            <li>It also leaves a powdery residue all over the device, so if you need a precise amount of medication there really is no way to tell how much you are losing.</li>
            <li>I re&#x27;cd this one quickly, and it simply cannot pulverize my mom&#x27;s pills.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have personally is that the powder seems to get stuck to the top, so I have to remove it with my fingers in order to get it into the drink I intend to mix the powder with.</li>
            <li>Maybe with a smaller, more fragile pill it might work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using so many different meds crushers over the last 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This works easily and no extreme force is necessary.</li>
            <li>When these pills are crushed I know my body is getting the full benefit of the supplements since they are so much more digestible taken in crushed form.</li>
            <li>And as an extra bonus, the crusher seems surprisingly sturdy and like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a pill crusher.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that needs to crush something.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend unless you wanna drop close to $100 on a pro metal crusher.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The crushing chamber has smooth walls so the crushed pills are not trapped in any tiny crevices, but</li>
            <li>I would highly, highly recommend this for anyone tube fed.</li>
            <li>The price was a touch high for a pill crusher, but it was delivered to my door, so it&#x27;s a wash on that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>other thing of note....is that it will not crush more than one pill and barely will crush one large vitamin.  </li>
            <li>You have to have strong hands to really crank it down when you have a bunch of pills in.</li>
            <li>It will do whole small pills pretty easily.</li>
            <li>also the lack of fine grind makes it harder to dissolve in liquid of my choice.</li>
            <li>softer more comfortable feel to it (blue in the photos), whereas the bottom is a little less comfortable, but that&#x27;s still just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got it to crush rather large glucocimine, chondroitin tabs (that are fairly soft) because my dogs leave them in their bowl .</li>
            <li>It is a little bulky, but I think that is to allow more leverage when turning the handle.</li>
            <li>Want it a little more \\&quot;fine\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li>This little gadget is ok, in that in does crash the pills, but you need to apply a generous amount of twisting pressure to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Solid, thick transparent crushing chamber (not pliable at all).&lt;br /&gt;- Rubberized, &amp;#34;EZ-grip&amp;#34; edges.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy threading (you can spin it down to &amp;#34;crush depth&amp;#34; in one spin if you&#x27;re good).&lt;br /&gt;- Very thorough crushing (It powdered the tablet, which is optimal).&lt;br /&gt;- Very fast to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use even with arthritis and when you&#x27;re in extreme pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice because it won&#x27;t dull or wear out (</li>
            <li>It really crushes pills down to a fine powder.  </li>
            <li>and it smashes slowly into a fine powder and the handles are rubberized to protect my hands and the design gives me great leverage to twist down, I have only used once</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, easy to clean; nothing wrong at all with its design!</li>
            <li>so all my meds have to be crushed to fit through the tubing.  </li>
            <li>The top half is easy to grip but the bottom half hurts my hands to hold.  </li>
            <li>- all in all - this beats crushing a pill between 2 spoons - not much - but some....</li>
            <li>I wish the bottom half was as easy on the hands as the top half.</li>
            <li>I think I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth, so I&#x27;m back to buy another one.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous pill crushers with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li>good for small pills acouple  not for big ones</li>
            <li>This crusher was well worth the money, and I would definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>You spin the top down until it comes up against the pill and then a little effort easily breaks the pill.</li>
            <li>It crushes the pill into small pieces which would likely be adequate if it is to be dissolved into liquid, but I need to continually loosen and again tighten the top to repeatedly crush it.  </li>
            <li>The powdered pills are then easily mixed in apple sauce or something similar for easy ingestion.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave any big chunks, the whole pill actually turns into powder which makes it super easy to fill up your empty pill capsules.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about being strong enough to crush larger pills, but this makes it almost effortless.</li>
            <li>It crushes into such a fine powder (I put it through twice) that he didn&#x27;t even bat an eyelash the first time he took his crushed pills today.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend crushing enteric coated tablets with it (or crushing them at all with anything since that coating is there for a really good reason) because the extra pressure needed to crush that kind of tablet may hasten the failure of the base part.  </li>
            <li>x&#x27;s a day even after spliting them and only crushing a few at a time this product did not crush the pills enough for him to safely swallow.</li>
            <li>Crushes to powder and is easy to twist down to crush the pills.</li>
            <li>Easily crushes pills down to powder.</li>
            <li>I like this, it does crush up giant pills into a fine powder, if you twist and untwist enough times.</li>
            <li>It works good, I just wish it crushed them a little finer.</li>
            <li>This product is decent at crushing pills, but i found it leaves too much of the crushed pill residue at the bottom, so we&#x27;d have to frequently wash, and scrub pretty hard to clean this thing.</li>
            <li>I am new to healthcare giving, and my mom is on a lot of medicine that has to be givin by her peg.  </li>
            <li>I used to just put my pills in some aluminum foil and smash the heck out of them, but that&#x27;s much more strenuous than twisting this and sometimes not very effective</li>
            <li>And since the bottom is also conical, any pill crumbs fall towards the center so when you can back off a bit and re-tighten the top, everything is converted to powder.</li>
            <li>It turns one pill to powder or if you try 2 at a time, it&#x27;s more of a crushed aggregate that you can easily add to yogurt or any thick drink like a shake.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much force and the wide blue nodes are easy to grip.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap enough to have several to avoid cross-contamination of meds</li>
            <li>It works ok, but it takes a while to twist it open and closed.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to crush more than 4 regular sized pills at once.</li>
            <li>I did have to shake it a little the first time because some larger pieces were in the cup, but an extra turn took care of them nicely.</li>
            <li>This pulverizes, not just &amp;#34;crushes&amp;#34;. Brings what you need actually down to a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Before I used very old one</li>
            <li>Then I bought a mortar &amp; pestle, because I actually need them ground down to a very fine powder</li>
            <li>This gives the top a bit of a point which immediately breaks the pill with very little effort.</li>
            <li>you are no longer getting a little more twist down; look at the clear bottom of the crusher;&lt;br /&gt;The pill should be evenly spread on bottom;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise twist back and forth some more.............</li>
            <li>also has a small storage place on the top.</li>
            <li>The other one I bought is a smaller rectangle one that has a cutter on top and the crusher in the bottom.</li>
            <li>If this ever breaks, I will purchase the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is able to crush a big supplement for me.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, this is the easiest to use and especially made to powder your pills.</li>
            <li>I can see it being ok for small pills</li>
            <li>I had considered a small mortar and pestle but am glad I chose this.</li>
            <li>That evening I used it for the first time and actually yipped in delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for those who need exactly that - it&#x27;s a big deal.</li>
            <li>100%.&lt;br /&gt;It is really strongly constructed and looks like it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>If you are using for multiple patients remember to clean out thoroughly between uses -- you do not want to cross contaminate (with meds) between patients.</li>
            <li>The pill crusher has two parts, a clear plastic crushing chamber that is threaded on the outside and a crushing handle that is made from a high-density (hard) polypropylene.</li>
            <li>I tried crushing 1 large pill, 1/2 of a medium-sized pill, and 2 halves of really small pills at once.</li>
            <li>The plastic of the base that touches the table is more brittle (it&#x27;s harder, but more brittle) than the top.  </li>
            <li>If you just use it for the same pill every time,it shouldn&#x27;t even be a concern after the first pill because the amount of pill that empties out should be equivalent to a complete pill.</li>
            <li>But to get it to crush into fine powder, I have to unscrew it a little and crush it again tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It even ha trouble crushing one kill at a time, requiring me to back off the screw down top shake and try to crush again.</li>
            <li>B000VSXDQY Silent Knight Pill Crusher]] that can crush a lot of pills at once but leaves large bits.</li>
            <li>I wanted to crush several large pills at once -- did not work --</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m assuming a lot of people get them for similar reasons or people can&#x27;t swallow really large pills, but this crusher doesn&#x27;t work for that at all.</li>
            <li>I was worried about how it would do on such a large pill, but it does crush it well.  </li>
            <li>My wife takes some large pills daily.</li>
            <li>I thought this little twist crusher may be the answer to crushing pills every day for our dog.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been crushing my little dog&#x27;s pills in this pill crusher for over 6 months now.  </li>
            <li>but I was only able to crush the pill a little bit.  </li>
            <li>It has lips on the top and bottom, allowing you to get lots of leverage to crush those hard pills.</li>
            <li>Good product, just a little messy trying to get the powder out</li>
            <li>The top part is gentle on the hand to grasp and turn, but the bottom part is sharp-edged and tough on the hands.</li>
            <li>also it is clear</li>
            <li>The clear plastic cuts into your hand otherwise.</li>
            <li>It is clear</li>
            <li>and it is clear they save a lot of time.</li>
            <li>I tried using water to clear it out</li>
            <li>I have to crush my 4 year old son&#x27;s pills.</li>
            <li>The bottom grip has not been a problem for me - a complete non-issue.  </li>
            <li>It completely pulverizes the pills and there isn&#x27;t any residue to scrape off.  </li>
            <li>My old crusher pushed some of the crumbs out to the sides.</li>
            <li>is as complete.</li>
            <li>Then at my last dental exam my dentist noticed I had a chipped molar which required a filling -- the use of the dreaded drill -- the whole nine yards.</li>
            <li>I have a 12 year old, g-tube dependant daughter who requires three doses of anticonvulsant per day.</li>
            <li>I just bought another one of these pill crushers since the one we have now is over three years old</li>
            <li>I find it takes so much effort that I went back to hitting pills with a hammer.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s simple and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>though, completely pulverizes tablets.</li>
            <li>My eighty year old mother has a cat that takes medicine every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several and this one really seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Surprised me.  </li>
            <li>and I always end up cleaning those with an old tooth brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Medicine is typically a much softer pill than supplements and smaller.</li>
            <li>I was using two table spoons to crush ball pills which frequently just launched them across the room.</li>
            <li>I use this pill pulverizer for personal use, and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>but it was a considerable amount.</li>
            <li>I can divide my bottle of dye-free ibuprofen among my various duplicates of this and have everything all ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for a quality product and at such a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;via</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than smaller crushers.</li>
            <li>and I nearly choked on the pill.</li>
            <li>This works easier by far and saves my wrist.</li>
            <li>By far the easiest pill crusher that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to crush my five year old medication...</li>
            <li>B004XVJI2S Musselman&#x27;s Natural Unsweetened Apple Sauce 24 oz]]</li>
            <li>I ordered it I was concerned that the 93 year old would not have the strength to use it to crush a pill</li>
            <li>the way, I am not the 93 year old; I gave it to him as a gift.</li>
            <li>This is my replacement for the old mortice and pestal.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a mortar and pestle to crush my cat&#x27;s pills but wanted something smaller and more portable, since the mortar and pestle is heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li>An excellent little tool that, with proper care and feeding, will PROBABLY live a long and destructive life crushing to bits the tablets of your choice.  </li>
            <li>the price.or crushing them at all with anything since that coating is there for a really good reason) because the extra pressure needed to crush that kind of tablet may hasten the failure of the base part.  </li>
            <li>She has arthritis and is pretty weak, but she can use this just fine.  </li>
            <li>Only drawback is that the base edges are kind of sharp as most of us hold it in our hands while we are crushing meds.</li>
            <li>I have broken more pills splitters and grinders due to their cheap design and construction.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend it for crushing spices, herbs or other such things.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend it for crushing spices, herbs or other such things.  </li>
            <li>For those who suffer arthritis and it is hard for them to turn the upper top since the pill might be too large, do the following:</li>
            <li>if someone who is a hemophiliac and older had something similar happen, they would have bled to death...</li>
            <li>, make sure this little crusher is absolutely dry before you crush anything in it.</li>
            <li>It works well enough for 1 pill, but it does not have the depth to take two pills high.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend, especially for this price!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know there was such an easy non messy way to crush pills.</li>
            <li>This worked like a charm at first but then after continued use, I found that the powder (from the crushed medications) would somehow get on the outer side of the threads</li>
            <li>This little thing gets the job done and quick.</li>
            <li>With absolutely no strain on my fingers or wrist, my pill was crushed to a fine powder.  </li>
            <li>So I purchased this and it crushed the horse pills to a fine powder with minimal to no effort at all.</li>
            <li>if you have large pills you might need to crush the pills, open the lid, then crush them a second time to get them to a powder consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very solid, the barrel is large enough to accommodate the largest of pills, and the conical shape helps to shake the powder out.  </li>
            <li>I have mild arthritis in my fingers with constant pain, some swelling and decreased ability to grip in some fingers but with full range of mobility in all fingers still.  </li>
            <li>I was able to crush several pills together without twisting hard.  </li>
            <li>This little gem has the potential to become one of my VERY rare five star items.  </li>
            <li>Also, the internal action of the crusher doesn&#x27;t crush the pills completely.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this because many of my medications are now difficult to swallow whole, I am undergoing chemo-therapy and one of the side effects is a sore throat and swelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34, so I have no problem operating this, but I feel older, less capable persons wouldn&#x27;t have a problem using this model.  </li>
            <li>Would be better if the base was made like to top.  </li>
            <li>The best part is the base is one solid piece</li>
            <li>This product crushes tablets down to a very fine powder with little effort.  </li>
            <li>The threads are long enough so you can get them completely started before coming up against a whole pill</li>
            <li>But other than that it does exactly what it says on its description.</li>
            <li>The only negative I have with this product is that the bottom handle is not grippy like the top, and with the hard turns you have to give occasionally in crushing a pill, it will sometimes dig into your hand.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is the bottom of it hurts to holt on to, it has somewhat shart edges that can&#x27;t really get a good grip on so it can be painful for those with sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>This one almost got it half right.</li>
            <li>Hard to really crush large tablets!</li>
            <li>It works great for one and lousy for the other.  </li>
            <li>Although this crusher can handle several pills at once, I would suggest only crushing maybe 2 or 3 pills at a time (depending on size and type) -- you get a finer grind with less effort.</li>
            <li>To get a fine powder with no lumps simply unscrew the cap a turn or two, shake the contents a little for even distribution and then toggle back and forth.</li>
            <li>The mechanism used is smart, you twist it closed to crush the pill opposed to anything that would have springs (that break)</li>
            <li>Yes, the process results in a significant amount of powder, but there is also a considerable amount of small solid chips and pieces.</li>
            <li>This pill crusher it easy to use, just a slight turn and pills are crushed.  </li>
            <li>The bottom half should is silicon or rubber like the top half.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on large pills but not so well on small pills.  </li>
            <li>If used in this way, the design of the base makes it very easy to hold stationary while crushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m crushing a REALLY hard pill - cat medicine - vitamin-ish - no coating.  </li>
            <li>I continue to try to find a satisfactory solution to crushing the hard tablets..</li>
            <li>If you shake it while the crushed pill is inside, the pill powder will actually come out of the top a little bit.</li>
            <li>The Duramed red and clear pill crusher does not compare to this one in quality</li>
            <li>The several times I have tried I have ended up pouring the pieces into my old worn out crusher to finish the job.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old pill crusher.</li>
            <li>Our 16 year old cat takes five pills a day, and this finally allows me to give him pills without stress.</li>
            <li>The bottom lips are a bit \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; to say, so you could scrape yourself if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li>Does crush pills well, even hard ones, but the design for the bottom, which looks great for griping, is really hard on your bottom hand!</li>
            <li>I had one of the other pill crushers and, as another reviewer pointed it out, the threads would jam unless I split the pills into smaller pieces first.</li>
            <li>It crushes pills but some of it stays on the plastic and there are lots of large pieces left that do not get crushed by this contraption.</li>
            <li>The sharp edges/ridges on the bottom really cut into my hand.  </li>
            <li>I found it much easier to screw and grind the pills with this one because of the 3 leaf handle as opposed to the two twist knobs of the other brand.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to twist than other crushers I have used.</li>
            <li>However, what is the point of the rubberized top when the rough, hard plastic bottom will give you blisters?</li>
            <li>It can also be used to cut any pill in half by slowly turning the top down until it hits the pill and then turn just a tad more and your pill will break in half.</li>
            <li>Everything inside gets crushed without a lot of elbow grease, and it is easy to empty the crushed pills into a cup, your hand, etc.  </li>
            <li>down until it no longer turns (there is an initial resistance until the pill fractures the first time).&lt;br /&gt;Twist</li>
            <li>I generally rate things based on several factors, one of which is durability (or how long it will last under normal use).  </li>
            <li>Breaking big pills in half first is helpful.</li>
            <li>I put his pills into the crusher (some are small, others are tiny), screw it down and am left with a very fine powder.  </li>
            <li>It may not be obvious from the photo, but the white &amp; blue knob screws into the lower clear cup.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast - as it in arrived the same day as the other items that shipped 2 day with my prime membership.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because I found that the clear bottom half felt a little less comfortable without the rubberized gribs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grinding up large pills for my dog and one of the previous reviewers</li>
            <li>I wanted to break large calcium tablet in half.</li>
            <li>Only complaint--they put nice rubber cushions on one part of the grinder but not on both parts so it can be uncomfortable tp grind up big tabs or multiple tabs.</li>
            <li>The most common complaint about this pill crusher, which does an *excellent* job, is that the base hurts people&#x27;s hands during use.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to break the pill and hoped that it would live up to the claim.  </li>
            <li>It does the job right - making a powder instead of just small chunks (or a mix of the 2).</li>
            <li>I received it in a small, clear bag with a barcoded label, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>Much simpler and less work than all the scewing and unscrewing.</li>
            <li>I use hand tools all day long at my profession,  and am here to tell you that if you have to use this more than once per day, it&#x27;s going to get irritating.</li>
            <li>it finally broke, so I went on amazon and saw this one get fairly good reviews, so I ordered one, but it was very uncomfortable to use and it hurt my hands.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a screw-on cap, so if the pill didn&#x27;t fully crush the first time, you have to screw, then unscrew, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this one for crushing those hard to swallow pills!</li>
            <li>As a result crushing even one whole pill usually creates so much powder as it is twisted, parts of the pill are cushioned and do not powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only slight issue is that the screw section is too tall since I am only crushing one little pill.  </li>
            <li>Prior to buying, I was not sure if the product will be good for grinding half of an already small pill.</li>
            <li>It works very well and requires little effort.</li>
            <li>This little gem really does work, and works well.</li>
            <li>This little gadget really works well.  </li>
            <li>This little guy gets the job done really well.</li>
            <li>This little crusher works very well</li>
            <li>this is really effective takes 3 seconds to crush a large pill, its idiot proof, plus it has a storage under that blue cap!</li>
            <li>For anyone who uses tea pills for their animals, you know that they are the most spit out because they are so round and hard</li>
            <li>It even has a very small hidden top pill compartment for storing your daily dosage, or pills on the go.      </li>
    </ol>

            <li> A friend recommended this and it is absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> no arthritis of any kind...</li>
            <li> It does a really nice job</li>
            <li> It crushes the pills really good and can crush more than one t a time.</li>
            <li> It crushes them effectively, but not into a powder.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> This crushes my pills up nicely.  </li>
            <li> This has to be the best pill crusher out there, used it to grind up my multivitamins... work really well...</li>
            <li> Effective... up to a point.</li>
            <li> Nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I think it will work nicely when I need it.</li>
            <li> Works really good, easy to use too.</li>
            <li> very easy to turn.  </li>
            <li> It also cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and has lasted over a year.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I Used this for my cats medicine and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> is one that in one good turn will crush the pill into fine powder.  </li>
            <li> It is easier, faster and more effective.  </li>
            <li> but they arent good -- but theyre cheap (and are what I would consider durable for the price).</li>
            <li> I wish they had rubber on both sides, though, gripping the plastic kind of hurts after a while.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Also, it would have been nice if the maker had made the bottom with rubber grips like the top.</li>
            <li> real clean..</li>
            <li> This pill crusher did a good job of crushing the pills.  </li>
            <li> Annihilate those pills with just one compression; this crusher means business and yields a very fine powder.</li>
            <li> So easy!</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong!</li>
            <li> A very good and decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> -- I have found these to be the best -- they are quick and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Finally, a pill crusher that works amazingly well, and comes at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed at a great price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is easy to use and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, I have arthritus, and does a good job crushing.</li>
            <li> Although this is effective in breaking up the pill to an appreciable degree - it does not pulverize, or make into fine powder (the kind you can mix into fruit juice or water).&lt;br /&gt;Might not seem important to most...</li>
            <li> Fits my huge multivitamin!</li>
            <li> bought this Pill Crusher to see if it would work better</li>
            <li> You just unscrew the top to get the content.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t the top design and materials get repeated on the bottom?  </li>
            <li> For a tiny, inexpensive gadget, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Worked okay for one pill.</li>
            <li> But, neded to twist the top on &amp;.off</li>
            <li> The Ultra Pill Crusher by Apex Medical is the BEST pill crusher I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> My opinion is that it couldn&#x27;t be any better than it is</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a ridiculously low price.</li>
            <li> Worked much better than the one we had.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews of many pill crushers before purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve tried it many ways, it still sticks.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the pill popping when crushing it!</li>
            <li> and I already love it.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of pill crushers-including a hammer...always hoping that the next one would be the best.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I bought one locally and works GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I had tried others and most don&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I am able to crush all four pills at once.</li>
            <li> Best regards,    John Younger</li>
            <li> I think the bottom should be made more like the top.</li>
            <li> Like it better than the one from Walmart.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> and we like the grip you can get on the top because it isn&#x27;t just  &lt;</li>
            <li> After having to put them in her mouth for her and watch her struggle to swallow I wanted a better way for her to get the medicine she needed.</li>
            <li> By gripping both top and bottom</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would also be advantageous for parents who need to get pills into balky kids, mix &#x27;em in with a favorite \\&quot;treat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> We have a lovable dog who has been part of our family for 14 years.</li>
            <li> It takes no time or effort to crush pills (one or many) to smithereens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pointed tip at the end of the top part of the pill crusher is the trick.  </li>
            <li> This make it more uniform sizes of powder, which I sprinkle in his food.</li>
            <li> This crusher is okay and</li>
            <li> just okay....  </li>
            <li> It works great and even has room in the handle to hold whole pills.</li>
            <li> think that there must be a better pill crusher out there.  </li>
            <li> It also has many threads</li>
            <li> all takes more time</li>
            <li> She has rheumatoid arthritis and is still able to use it to crush her pills.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have bought and reviewed many a pill crusher as my son has a multiple-pill-a-day regimine and is tube fed.</li>
            <li> It would be better though if the bottom had ribber coating like the top because you have to grip the bottom while turning the top.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t crush too many an once, gets stuck if you put too many in.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with your hands, the shape of the top makes it easier to use than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Does okay for a couple of pills at a time</li>
            <li> love this gadget.  </li>
            <li> We had problems with the powdered medication getting stuck up inside the crusher and then in the plastic grooves that the top spins on.</li>
            <li> It works, what more can be said for an inexpensive crusher.  </li>
            <li> You do have to have patience screwing the top on and off, but no doubt that it works.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, this pill crusher is much better.</li>
            <li> This worked better than the cup idea.</li>
            <li> I was better able to mix into her food.</li>
            <li> My skin came off from trying to turn the top.  </li>
            <li> (I have a channel lock and patience and, yes, going through that hassle is still better than the two-spoon method.).  </li>
            <li> (I have a channel lock and patience and, yes, going through that hassle is still better than the two-spoon method.).  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I bought it and will use it often.</li>
            <li> Comfort grip on the top but not on the  bottom.</li>
            <li> If you have too many pills, you can rip some skin</li>
            <li> I know she is still winning</li>
            <li> I have tried about seven different pill crushers, and this one is the BEST!!!!  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Using this pill crusher is much better than my &amp;#34;hit it inside a plastic bag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have not been able to swallow my pills if taking them after supper and sometimes during the day.  </li>
            <li> I used to take two spoons and crush my pills, but this does a much better job</li>
            <li> The top has&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li> The top is pointed and the bottom has the matching contour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found cheaper crushers that I like much better.</li>
            <li> Crushes pills ok, but not without a lot of pain.  </li>
            <li> Even bought an extra one for school, excellent product!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d have back-up if needed, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many pill crushers and with the exception of a mortar and pestle, this one beats them all.  </li>
            <li> I would really love to give this product the 5 stars it deserves, but I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but hey..It did the job :-)</li>
            <li> It is sturdy, and better made than others I have used.</li>
            <li> I gave up on it and used my Magic Bullet.  </li>
            <li> But I guess the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make it any more.</li>
            <li> Works okay, won&#x27;t grind some pills if you put them all in at once.</li>
            <li> Not the best I had to buy a different one  the ulrais not that</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The crusher works just as beautifully as when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped me and it&#x27;s very handy to take when traveling.  </li>
            <li> This is very effective -- and a real lifesaver</li>
            <li> Easy to turn (even with arthritis and carpel tunnel) and crushes to a very fine powder.  </li>
            <li> The design for grip &amp; turning is well thought out and makes the crushing very easy.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and had no problem crushing my tablets with this.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and had no problems crushing the heck out of whatever pill I put in there...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The design of the pill crusher has some pluses, with the top being easy to grip and turn, and it may work okay to crush two or three pills, but it doesn&#x27;t work well to crush a number of pills and</li>
            <li> It works great - plenty of space for crushing large tablets as well.</li>
            <li> It is made with quality material and it makes pill crushing so easy and effortless!  </li>
            <li> it crushes very finely which is important.</li>
            <li> And the powder was very fine from the crushing.  </li>
            <li> When I needed a new one, I read the reviews on Amazon and purchased this one and its been great.</li>
            <li> Twist the top until it crushes the pill(s) easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pleased with results.</li>
            <li> The top and bottom handle areas are easy to grip.</li>
            <li> but it easily jams with more than two.</li>
            <li> Always twist from the rubber top or place a tower over the bottom to make the work easy.</li>
            <li> Eighty something parents are able to crush their multitude of pills easily to take in pudding or apple sauce.</li>
            <li> So by crushing pills, I am better able to control my ailments.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve probably been warned about this before, but make sure your pill is safe to take after crushing.</li>
            <li> I use this to crush tablets that I give to my dog, its light, yet strong and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean after use.  </li>
            <li> Crushes and powders pills well.  very easy to clean and decontaminate with rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the top allows the crushing of pills easier on hands and wrist</li>
            <li> had bought Fit &amp; Healthy Tablet Splitter and Crusher from CVS store before</li>
            <li> saw Fit &amp; Healthy Tablet Splitter and Crusher on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The top is comfortable to use but the bottom hurts my hands.</li>
            <li> My mom has a peg tube (feeding tube), and I read the reviews on this before ordering to make sure that it crushes pills sufficiently to fit through the tube.  </li>
            <li> The cheap pill crusher from Wal-Mart works much better.</li>
            <li> Very durable, good price too...</li>
            <li> Plus, for some reason, I find it to be just kind of fun. ^_^</li>
            <li> Comfortable &amp; easy twist top.</li>
            <li> We crush our dog&#x27;s pills to a more granular texture, but you can turn the crushing handle to turn the pills into a fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited about being able to use this gadget to crush up a Tylenol or antibiotic pill for her and make taking medications easier in the years ahead when she outgrows the liquid medications.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product or the splitter!  </li>
            <li> Other than this concern, we found this to be an excellent product that should give you long-term use.</li>

            <li> Grind easily with almost no effort needed.</li>
            <li> The rubber on the top is a great idea - why not make the bottom the same?  </li>
            <li> Once again, the style of handle on this one makes it easy to tighten and loosen.</li>
            <li> Pulverizes pills easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use,</li>

            <li> Put the pill in and turn and pills turn into a granular dust which is easily added to food or drink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the bottom should be as easy to grip as the top&lt;br /&gt;but works</li>
            <li> This pill crusher is a dream and makes the process so easy.</li>

            <li> easy to use, crushes a pill well.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, keeps powder inside and not on the grooves.</li>
            <li> Grinds fairly easily but the bottom portion lacks any rubbery portions, which would keep the plastic from biting in to your hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise the device crushes pills to satisfaction and makes them easy to administer to your pets&#x27; food.</li>

            <li> I have really strong</li>
            <li> After that I decided to renew my search for a good pill crusher and turned to Amazon to find one highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It works well when crushing one at a time, but takes a while to get a fine powder when crushing more than one.</li>
            <li> I have a special needs child who has a feeding tube, and she receives many medications that she can&#x27;t take by mouth.</li>
            <li> it pulverizes even the toughest, hardest pills into fine granules than can be flushed easily through an Ng tube.</li>
            <li> This crusher makes the medicine a fine powder which is easy to mix and administer through a 1.0 ml oral syringe without issue.</li>

            <li> I bought this to finely grind pills into &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;, then combine with peanut butter and stick to the roof of her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Crushing pills is not always easy as it is but the pill pulverizer does make the job easer.</li>
            <li> you will get a fine powder with minimum  effort and no arthritis pain</li>
            <li> If they manufactured the top and bottom using the same soft grip as the top, then this would be the perfect tool for crushing pills.</li>
            <li> The handle design makes it easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Crushes everything into a fine powder.</li>

            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is important because of the fine power will NOT get caught up in the threads and therefore wasting some of the pill.</li>
            <li> For a little plastic gadget, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This little pill crusher is GREAT!  </li>
            <li> sometimes a film of fine powder will cling to the sides of the crushing chamber; we found this powder film to be the case when crushing the aspirin tablets to a powder.</li>
            <li> and it is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Crushes meds up easy and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes crushing the cats&#x27; pill medications a snap.</li>

            <li> I was crushing the pills in a spoon</li>

            <li> This pill crusher is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> ; I think I&#x27;m working some aggro out while crushing these pills.</li>
            <li> If the legs do break, but the crushing chamber never does, it will remain at four</li>
            <li> If the legs do break, but the crushing chamber never does, it will remain at four</li>
            <li> Cheap,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is easy to clean by wiping or rinsing.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the crushing surfaces would be dimpled, instead of smooth.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean and store.  </li>
            <li> Easier for the crushing.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>

            <li> I have trouble with pills and this handy pill crusher works great.  </li>

            <li> Crushing a pill into a fine powder is quick and almost effortless compared to using the mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li> It is quick, easy, and gives us peace of mind.</li>
            <li> This is a super easy way to crush pills.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher works great for crushing glucosamine pills for my Golden Retriever which I mix in her food daily.</li>
            <li> While this thing feels a bit flimsy when you first pick it up, it sure works well.  </li>
            <li> Not arthritis friendly and still leaves chunks while wasting a lot of med on the screw mechanism.</li>
            <li> Not even worth returning!</li>
            <li> , I do not recomend this for safely crushing pills it just looks cool and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter did use this successfully and is planning on trying to take medication without help, when next she needs it.</li>
            <li> Ok for partially crushing overly large supplements</li>
            <li> /&gt;This really crushes the pills almost immediately into a very fine powder, with no chunks at all.</li>
            <li> I needed to grind pills to a very fine powder and this did the trick very well.</li>
            <li> I tried it tonight for the first time and was blown away by how easy this was to operate and how finely it pulverized TWO pills at once with virtually no strength required.</li>
            <li> If mine were to break today by my own doing, I would repurchase the same one, or consider buying an electric pill grinder, but this is just so much more portable..</li>
            <li> For now it is a clean recommend.</li>
            <li> the product is very cheap and it does its job very efficiently for any kind/size of pill or caplet.</li>
            <li> However, I have a large number of pills to pulverize, so most individuals may not have this problem.</li>
            <li> I am about to have bariatric surgery and won&#x27;t be able to swallow my fairly large metformin medication -- a diabetes drug.</li>
            <li> Just as a mater of caution in order for a life time of any crusher, it is best to cut up the hard pills in a Pill Splitter, but if need be this Crusher will crush the hardest pill.    </li>
            <li> was right in saying you won&#x27;t get a fine powder.</li>
            <li> It really does \\&quot;pulverize\\&quot; the pill so that the result is fine granules that are easy to swallow or add to liquid.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product for long, but so far it has been great!</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter has difficulty swallowing tablets so now she can crush her own, add some apple sauce</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a really good pill crusher, this one is the only one to get in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The grip top makes it so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> If you are able to swallow pills, this is to much work.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> This item sounded good but have fallen short for my purpose.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, i found that a good size pair of lineman&#x27;s pliers made short work of the 4 pills, turning each into powder with one squeeze.</li>
            <li> A true &amp;#34;pulverizer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a good device if you just want to break the pill up into smaller fragments, it is not a crusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job if there are several pills at once.</li>
            <li> if I wanted to take a full does when the force of smashing the pills would split the foil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cheap, which makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product all around easy to use and includes a little storage area underneath blue cap on the top of the item.</li>
            <li> I have NO upper body strength at all, and I was able to use this pill crusher easily!</li>
            <li> Like I said earlier the design was really nice and easy to use with my arthritis.</li>
            <li> Works excellent and because there is no blades or metal grater, their is little concern of losing a large % of the pill volume.  </li>
            <li> All 3 people didn&#x27;t know such a fine device exists and were thrilled.  </li>
            <li> little device works well as it allows you to get a good grip when turning the top to crush the meds.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a very useful product when I need to take very large pills.</li>
            <li> What is especially clever is the shape of the pill cavity.</li>
            <li> the threads work quickly when opening and closing.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and got here as described.</li>
            <li> actually crushes pills, which many of the ones you buy at drug stores don&#x27;t seem to be able to do.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the pill gets caught sideways but a quick shake and it flattens out again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several different models of pill crushers, this is the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s portable, but I stopped using it quite quickly.</li>
            <li> great price and completely crushes the vitamins for my young daughter</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, as always.</li>
            <li> I was able to crush a large adult vitamin with this little gadget......works beautifully !!!  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied especially after considering the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I was crushing up glucosamine pills for my dog to put in his food, this thing could do a couple at a time and did exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works very very well!</li>
            <li> Which i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> This crusher works for large tablets and is easy to turn.</li>
            <li> Depending on how far you turn the top, you can get various sizes of crumbs or if you turn it all the way, you get a nice fine dust.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little gadget, it does not take up much room, and most of the time I am very pleased with the way it works, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It absolutely pulverizes a pill very quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I smiled and dropped the old one in the trash.</li>
            <li> It works fast and easy.</li>
            <li> This item works very well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this product and all were positive, well they must&#x27;ve been crushing one pill at a time, I have to crush up all of my husbands</li>
            <li> The top is larger and easy to grasp and turn.</li>
            <li> The shape of the top makes it fairly easy to turn to get the finest powder possible.</li>
            <li> This really crushes pills to a fine powder.  </li>
            <li> It does absolutely pulverize the pills that I crush, into a fine powder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting the pill positioned correctly and crushing in steps is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is fairly large and fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little gadget works great for her.</li>
            <li> The little pill crusher works great.</li>
            <li> It takes several times of loosening and tightening to get it to a fine powder and the powder sticks to the top.  </li>
            <li> It is an ingenious product -- it miraculously crushes any vitamins/pills into fine powder with a simple twist of the cap.  </li>
            <li> The top of the crusher is nicely protected with soft coating, but they should have done the same for the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It made pill crushing so much easier</li>
            <li> It is cheap, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I like how much easier the pill crushing is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes crushing pills much easier,&lt;br /&gt;especially</li>
            <li> I really like the beveled surfaces in the crushing chamber.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had know about this years ago - possibly the best $6 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> Now if only they could make the bottom a wee bit more comfortable on the hands, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Simple effective product.</li>
            <li> This is problematic in that one still has to do more \\&quot;crushing\\&quot; (ie- grinding) after your meds have been through the crusher (the pieces are too big to fit through, say, a feeding tube).</li>
            <li> But if you need your pills crushed, this is good for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li> The grinder does cost $20, but so well worth it.</li>
            <li> I work at a elementary school and must dispense a \\&quot;horse</li>
            <li> I can also see it as useful for pet owners when dogs and cats are troublesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> soft and well made as the crusher top is; the bottom is wicked on the hand</li>
            <li> The grinder does cost $20, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This crusher, by FAR, has been our favorite.</li>
            <li> This lets the pieces scatter more naturally and not pile up to create a stress point.  </li>
            <li> This lets the pieces scatter more naturally and not pile up to create a stress point.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers were right when they said one of the things they liked about this unit was that the threads were on the OUTSIDE of the unit NOT on the inside of the cylinder.</li>
            <li> Crushing larger pills requires holding the sharp edges of the bottom and applying a fair amount of pressure to turn the top.  </li>
            <li> The only way it could be better is to have a compartment for pill storage, making it travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I stood there in utter amazement that a little five dollar piece of plastic works so beautifully and could have spared me the discomfort and unpleasantness I lived with for years (not to mention the dentist&#x27;s bill, which I assure you was MUCH more than five dollars).</li>
            <li> Still hurt when crushed by hand, so gave this a try, now a very fine power and mix with a drink and medicine is taken as needed!</li>
            <li> pulverizer is the right word.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hold it just right in my hand so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> The design exerts a great deal of force on the pill chamber without having to screw it very tightly.  </li>
            <li> The result was a finely and equally ground pill,  easily emptied, and with a small-sized residue which mixes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother takes a couple very large pills that her pill splitter can&#x27;t split.</li>
            <li> and they are smooth enough to turn easily.</li>
            <li> The crushing part is easy if you only have one or two pills in the container.</li>
            <li> The crusher is designed for easy, solid gripping for good torque while grinding (some of the small ones dont work well for this reason).</li>
            <li> Yes the grip on the bottom is different from the rubber-padded grip on the top, but I find that the three-lobe design does not require gripping as tightly as many other designs.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s an exceptionally useful device for crushing vitamin pills (or the non-coated pills of your choice) and beats the hell out of the two spoon crushing method (You don&#x27;t want to deal with that, so</li>
            <li> and it is not hard to crush medicine, when holding the bottom of the crusher you might need to use a towel so the bottom will not hurt your hand if you are crushing a lot of medicine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend easy to use especially for someone like me who has tendinitis, super easy to use &amp; turn.</li>
            <li> The design is great and the large vitamins and calcium pulverize well in just a few turns.</li>
            <li> As someone who has never been able to swallow pills due to whatever strange mental thing my brain does to actively stop me from doing so, even when I try my best to trick it; This pill crusher works great.</li>
            <li> I have one at work and one at home, as I have to take several large pills throughout the day, and this makes it so easy to take these supplements I really need to stay healthy.  </li>
            <li> How hard could it honestly be for them to make a rubber top and bottom to this?</li>
            <li> Had been using a different model that tore up our hands daily and didn&#x27;t come close to achieving the great powdered consistency that this did.</li>
            <li> You simply put the pill(s) inside the crushing chamber and turn the crushing handle until you crush the pills to the desired consistency.</li>
            <li> He said that he was able to use this one without difficulty, and asked me to buy him a few more of them.</li>
            <li> works great especially for those big &amp;#34;horse tabs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I can see what I have crushed and if the pill needs more crushing.</li>
            <li> I have an old injury to my wrist and it makes it so easy to crush pills now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold the crushing chamber in my left hand and turn the crusher top part with my right and the little blue covers on the 3 corners help me hold on to the top and turn it easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As stated earlier, our only concern with this device is when you turn a pill into a powder, some of that powder clings as a film to the sides of the crushing chamber so you will not get the full dose of your medication; we estimate that up to 5% of your pill may cling to the crushing container wall as a fine powder film.</li>
            <li> This was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Considering the reasonable cost, I am very happy with it since many crushers are much more expensive or, if cheaper, much less durable.</li>
            <li> The top half of the unit is rubberized &amp; easy to grip</li>
            <li> You just screw the top down and the pills become a fine powder.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I did the first pill for her</li>
            <li> It is a well designed product that performs exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I think people of many different strengths can use it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for in order to crush pills.</li>
            <li> And thanks to the reviewer who suggested this!</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t exactly</li>
            <li> We have used many Pill Crushers on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Most of these cross thread, and are useless, however, this Pill Crusher is excellent, and pulverizes even the hardest pill.    </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get the same grip on the bottom as you do on the top.</li>
            <li> It did seem to crush the pills pretty well.</li>
            <li> It actually crushes the pills (don&#x27;t do more than about 3 at a time</li>
            <li> This really hurts to turn with pills in it!  </li>
            <li> can be a bit difficult for me sometimes; and this works perfectly for that.</li>
            <li> okay if you just need to crush a pill or two, but I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> I LIKE this pill crusher but wish the bottom was the same as the top.  </li>
            <li> She is able to crush a very tiny pill without any problems!</li>
            <li> I think this product works better on different types of pills.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a Tylenol product, would work better since it&#x27;s a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Soft grips is needed so that this is a comfortable device for all ages to use.  </li>
            <li> the top portion is comfy, where the blue rubber pieces are.  </li>
            <li> Why they did not just make the bottom the same as the top is something that I cannot understand.  </li>
            <li> and it hurts your hands--not the top part with the blue but the bottom part.  </li>
            <li> So I do a first crush, then open the top a bit, shake it up</li>
            <li> If I were to redesign this I&#x27;d put the same rubber moldings on the top section on the bottom section as well.  </li>
            <li> I have alot of problems with my hands and found this to be the best one I&#x27;ve ever used,I bought two thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hold up,was I wrong.</li>
            <li> It works well and is not difficult to use..</li>
            <li> I saw those heavier duty ones first hand in the hospital</li>
            <li> I found this works okay for larger pills</li>
            <li> and you wouldn&#x27;t think so at first....</li>
            <li> My only qualm with this is if you are storing pills inside this unit, it doesn&#x27;t have any sort of child safe lid, so I have to keep this away from my toddler to prevent any accidental ingestion.  </li>
            <li> It really makes the pill DUST !</li>
            <li> I love that the threads are on the outside of the jar so the medication does not get stuck in between the threads.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much easier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this five stars if the bottom was constructed with the same design/materials as the top.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first received it, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Everything gets crushed and flows threw her g-tube nicely.</li>
            <li> The first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first saw it</li>
            <li> The external &amp;#34;twisty part&amp;#34; keeps most of the drug in the cylinder.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has rubberized blue gribs on the top that helps when turning the pill crusher.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it seemed the best out of others shown.</li>
            <li> And this does that, and I am pretty content with the performance.</li>
            <li> I did keep the crush hoping I would be able to use it at a later date.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;m using this type of product.</li>
            <li> It looks well made and is good and heavy, sturdy.  </li>
            <li> hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a marble mortar &amp; pestle at home for my previous crushing jobs, but this works better and is easier to transfer the powder to a syringe to mix with water.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I gave this item five stars because it is durable, easy to use, and priced right.</li>
            <li> I use this to grind bute pills for horses (\\&quot;pills\\&quot; are very large) and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Turn a little more and it starts crushing the pill.</li>
            <li> The bottom section needs to have some kind of rubber or other covering - it digs in to the hand when turning.</li>
            <li> It has no rough bumps which never allow the pills to turn to a fine powder</li>
            <li> It is big enough that you can get a good grip on it and</li>
            <li> I was really hoping the extra diameter of the crusher would allow me to get more power to the crusher itself...</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t bother to write reviews, but was so delighted with this product that I felt compelled to give it a stellar review.</li>
            <li> Clean up is super easy, and the little hidden compartment is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> The crushing chamber is made from the same plastic as the legs and though thicker than the legs, is still far more likely to crack or break if too much force is applied in crushing a tablet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The crushing chamber is made from the same plastic as the legs and though thicker than the legs, is still far more likely to crack or break if too much force is applied in crushing a tablet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pill/tablet will center in the bottom and the pointy top will go right through and crushes nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping</li>
            <li> and she says it&#x27;s the first one her hands can really grip.</li>
            <li> My hands are soft and while it&#x27;s not the most comfortable feeling in the world, it&#x27;s certainly not discouraging to the point that it should make you think twice about getting this.</li>
            <li> If one wants true powder, not little chunks or grains, this is it!</li>
            <li> Crushes pills nicely, but it does not take it down to power..</li>
            <li> This was a simple procedure that is easy to repeat and thoroughly crushes the pills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly as simple and easy as that.</li>
            <li> Any powder left in the crusher comes out easily with a tap.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and has a big compartment to shake up and recrush for finer pieces.</li>
            <li> , it actually turns tablets into powder which I can then easily mix into my cat&#x27;s food.</li>
            <li> it lasted over a good year and a half but the top just snapped in half in my hands while in use.</li>
            <li> I like it because its strong and sturdy and crushes pretty well, sometimes large pieces are left over so you have to moving it around to make sure all is crushed</li>
            <li> The bottom of the crusher should have the same coating as the top - the gripping ridges are sharp and hurt my hands when trying to really pulverize a pill.</li>
            <li> I am certain it was these vitamins that did it.</li>
            <li> I put 3 large dog pills in it at a time with no problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she uses it on large pill and vitamins she has to take.</li>
            <li> I think I have gone through about a dozen different models over the past 2.5 years, and this one works best by far.  </li>
            <li> It cleans nicely and is much bigger than I expected, around 3 inches in diameter, easy to grip and the blue color portion is a soft touch rubberized plastic which is easy on the hands.  </li>
            <li> I use the larger compound pills for thyroid and this crushes them up just fine.</li>
            <li> This thing actually pulverizes the pill into fine powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine enough for my use.</li>
            <li> I use it to crush some medication into a fine powder to be mixed into breastmilk for my baby.</li>
            <li> works fine, optimistic that it&#x27;ll last for years of use.</li>
            <li> you could spend way more for a professional one rated best,but if you&#x27;re crushing less than a dozen pills a day,why?</li>
            <li> The top blue and white portion is soft and easy on your hand.  </li>
            <li> Great little item for anyone who has to try to give animals regular medication.</li>
            <li> Small (easily portable), easy to use, and works very well to crush pills.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend unscrewing once or twice after the initial crushing, tapping the crusher to re-situate the material into the middle, and re-tightening again to get a fine crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best way to use it is to screw down until the tablet breaks, unscrew a little then screw down some more and repeat this until the tablet is powered.  </li>

            <li> Amazing how few drugstores carry a pill crusher.</li>
            <li> I take different medicines every day including a huge antibiotic pill</li>
            <li> We had been crushing the tablets with a wooden kitchen mallet, which was a real chore, but then found this pill crusher.</li>
            <li> This product definitely pulverizes huge Glucosamine caplets.  </li>
            <li> I find it easier to halve larger pills before crushing.</li>
            <li> Crushes pills very well without accumulating residue.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind so much the pills getting stuck as much as the design of the bottom, but that is probably why it is priced so well...</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t try crushing multiple pills at a time as that didn&#x27;t fit the dosing schedule, but seems likely that even that would work.</li>
            <li> And I dont have to walk all the way back to the nurses station to access the crusher -- because this will fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my son&#x27;s allergy pills.</li>
            <li> When crushing several pills I had to loosen the vice, then shake the contents to re-adjust their position and then tighten the vice /crusher again.  </li>
            <li> The picture/description doesn&#x27;t show it, but the bottom is conical, so the dust gathers in the center if you tap it on the table, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven</li>
            <li> No complaints, exept one - it is not enough convinient to bear it in hand when crushing.</li>
            <li> With this pill crusher and the Apex Ultra Pill Splitter it made my morning routine so, so much easier</li>
            <li> I had a sore throat and really couldn&#x27;t swallow my antibiotics.</li>
            <li> I like the way it crushers medicine and that part does really well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone in need of crushing pills.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> I definitely appreciated it.</li>
            <li> This is not only highly effective for crushing (especially with a twisting back and forth motion), but also lends itself well to mixing the powdered meds with water and pulling up into a syringe.</li>
            <li> pill crusher has a simple but rugged design that fits comfortably in your hands during use.</li>
            <li> I was using a spatula in a bowl to crush my dog&#x27;s pills, but this is so much easier.  </li>
            <li> For a plastic pill crusher, I didn&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my dog&#x27;s glucosamine and oral flea meds because he won&#x27;t take them whole.</li>
            <li> is how I have learned to get a very satisfactory powder of supplements.............</li>
            <li> thus only two stars for this unwise, reckless and bizarre manufacturing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to crush pills than using a spoon.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and have to crush medications for patients very often.</li>
            <li> There is 1 vitamen tab that it does not crush very well, that might be because I try to crush 5 at a time.  </li>
            <li> It really does pulverize the pills so I can put them in his food</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really crush up my anavite pills very well - not even if I put them in one at a time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> have to maybe unturn and turn again about 3-4 times to really crash pill</li>
            <li> Can not swallow the pill whole or even in thirds...</li>
            <li> But it seems very sturdy, so</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t tell how much medication we were losing out of the crusher</li>
            <li> Very well designed.</li>
            <li> This thing makes the process so much simpler than trying to crush them in a bowl with a spoon.</li>
            <li> I kick myself for not getting this much sooner.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this pill crusher since we&#x27;d tried others that did not crush very well.  </li>
            <li> We have to crush all of our daughter&#x27;s pills to get them through her G-tube and this really does the job.  </li>
            <li> However, the bottom is very abrasive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonably priced pill crusher.  </li>
            <li> This pill crusher really pulverizes as stated.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this pill crusher.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher really works</li>
            <li> I forgot to use this to crush my multivitamin pill (which wasn&#x27;t even a whole one,</li>
            <li> and I was very scared.</li>
            <li> Still, it works really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Pill Crusher - absolutely..</li>
            <li> Pill Pulverizer - not so much.</li>
            <li> having engaged the item, and therefore having expected the job to have been completed at that point.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, on balance, this is not a horrible gadget.</li>
            <li> This helped me so much.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this does a very exacting job.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble swallowing pills for whatever reason, but this effectively solves that problem for me.</li>
            <li> This is only effective for smaller pills - but not for anything like a multi-vitamin.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good pill crusher because I was always making a mess crushing pills under spoons or other things.  </li>
            <li> ; - I honestly thought it was a waste of money..</li>
            <li> The knob is large and rubberized to make it user friendly, possibly even for arthritic</li>
            <li> It is light and made of strong polypropylene and last a long time.</li>
            <li> overall works much better than crushing with a spoon or other utensil.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, very easy to use and crushes pills with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other models and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The item is better than other brand, however, one design flaw.  </li>
            <li> It makes light work of both tiny and huge pills with little effort, which is great for me since my mom has cancer, and she takes fist fulls of pills that need to be crushed for her peg tube on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> There were so many other pill crushers to choose from..</li>
            <li> I bought one of the crappy plastic ones and used it for a year and it broke and never really crushed the pills to powder, just more tiny chunks.</li>
            <li> Relatively neat and clean process.</li>
            <li> This little device is able to easily, EASILY crush a large pill into mostly powder and a few tiny pieces.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs or wants to crush up their pills.</li>
            <li> I have tried various pill crushers over the years to crush meds for my son and daughter with special needs.  </li>
            <li> But it was perfect, small, exactly the size for a one pill, I didn&#x27;t have to turn the top part so tight, because it was small</li>
            <li> As far as how it crushes... it does pulverize ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice and small to take with us everywhere.  </li>
            <li> You just insert the pills and screw down the top.  </li>
            <li> I like to hold the pulverizer in my hands instead of putting it down on a table top when using it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to shake the dust into my mouth and wash it down with water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the element that pushes down on the pills, so you can&#x27;t grind the pills by screwing the top.  </li>
            <li> The cover squeezes down the more you tighten it.</li>
            <li> Takes a little more time than I&#x27;d like but really does pulverise &#x27;em</li>
            <li> I also think that the bowl coming to a point is a plus compared to the flat bottom container that the other one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to invent one of these for all ages to use and work properly because its really a simple design that manufacturer&#x27;s  seem to struggle with getting it perfect.</li>
            <li> When you put the tablets in the pill crusher, you just turn the knob and the pills are crushed, it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> Both the bottom and top pieces are slightly conical.</li>
            <li> With no strength required my dog&#x27;s pill is crushed so easily, and I can mix it into her food.  </li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE THE SPLITTR FUNCTION, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS ODD BECAUSE MANY PRODUCTS ARE DUAL FUNCTION...</li>
            <li> Giving him that many pills one after another is not viable nor is having each pill compounded individually (you cannot compound multiple medicines - they would not have the correct dosages).  </li>
            <li> It also leaves a powdery residue all over the device, so if you need a precise amount of medication there really is no way to tell how much you are losing.</li>
            <li> I re&#x27;cd this one quickly, and it simply cannot pulverize my mom&#x27;s pills.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have personally is that the powder seems to get stuck to the top, so I have to remove it with my fingers in order to get it into the drink I intend to mix the powder with.</li>
            <li> Maybe with a smaller, more fragile pill it might work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using so many different meds crushers over the last 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This works easily and no extreme force is necessary.</li>
            <li> When these pills are crushed I know my body is getting the full benefit of the supplements since they are so much more digestible taken in crushed form.</li>
            <li> And as an extra bonus, the crusher seems surprisingly sturdy and like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a pill crusher.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that needs to crush something.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend unless you wanna drop close to $100 on a pro metal crusher.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The crushing chamber has smooth walls so the crushed pills are not trapped in any tiny crevices, but</li>
            <li> I would highly, highly recommend this for anyone tube fed.</li>
            <li> The price was a touch high for a pill crusher, but it was delivered to my door, so it&#x27;s a wash on that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> other thing of note....is that it will not crush more than one pill and barely will crush one large vitamin.  </li>
            <li> You have to have strong hands to really crank it down when you have a bunch of pills in.</li>
            <li> It will do whole small pills pretty easily.</li>
            <li> also the lack of fine grind makes it harder to dissolve in liquid of my choice.</li>
            <li> softer more comfortable feel to it (blue in the photos), whereas the bottom is a little less comfortable, but that&#x27;s still just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it to crush rather large glucocimine, chondroitin tabs (that are fairly soft) because my dogs leave them in their bowl .</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky, but I think that is to allow more leverage when turning the handle.</li>
            <li> Want it a little more \\&quot;fine\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li> This little gadget is ok, in that in does crash the pills, but you need to apply a generous amount of twisting pressure to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Solid, thick transparent crushing chamber (not pliable at all).&lt;br /&gt;- Rubberized, &amp;#34;EZ-grip&amp;#34; edges.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy threading (you can spin it down to &amp;#34;crush depth&amp;#34; in one spin if you&#x27;re good).&lt;br /&gt;- Very thorough crushing (It powdered the tablet, which is optimal).&lt;br /&gt;- Very fast to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use even with arthritis and when you&#x27;re in extreme pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice because it won&#x27;t dull or wear out (</li>
            <li> It really crushes pills down to a fine powder.  </li>
            <li> and it smashes slowly into a fine powder and the handles are rubberized to protect my hands and the design gives me great leverage to twist down, I have only used once</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, easy to clean; nothing wrong at all with its design!</li>
            <li> so all my meds have to be crushed to fit through the tubing.  </li>
            <li> The top half is easy to grip but the bottom half hurts my hands to hold.  </li>
            <li> - all in all - this beats crushing a pill between 2 spoons - not much - but some....</li>
            <li> I wish the bottom half was as easy on the hands as the top half.</li>
            <li> I think I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth, so I&#x27;m back to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous pill crushers with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li> good for small pills acouple  not for big ones</li>
            <li> This crusher was well worth the money, and I would definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li> You spin the top down until it comes up against the pill and then a little effort easily breaks the pill.</li>
            <li> It crushes the pill into small pieces which would likely be adequate if it is to be dissolved into liquid, but I need to continually loosen and again tighten the top to repeatedly crush it.  </li>
            <li> The powdered pills are then easily mixed in apple sauce or something similar for easy ingestion.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave any big chunks, the whole pill actually turns into powder which makes it super easy to fill up your empty pill capsules.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about being strong enough to crush larger pills, but this makes it almost effortless.</li>
            <li> It crushes into such a fine powder (I put it through twice) that he didn&#x27;t even bat an eyelash the first time he took his crushed pills today.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend crushing enteric coated tablets with it (or crushing them at all with anything since that coating is there for a really good reason) because the extra pressure needed to crush that kind of tablet may hasten the failure of the base part.  </li>
            <li> x&#x27;s a day even after spliting them and only crushing a few at a time this product did not crush the pills enough for him to safely swallow.</li>
            <li> Crushes to powder and is easy to twist down to crush the pills.</li>
            <li> Easily crushes pills down to powder.</li>
            <li> I like this, it does crush up giant pills into a fine powder, if you twist and untwist enough times.</li>
            <li> It works good, I just wish it crushed them a little finer.</li>
            <li> This product is decent at crushing pills, but i found it leaves too much of the crushed pill residue at the bottom, so we&#x27;d have to frequently wash, and scrub pretty hard to clean this thing.</li>
            <li> I am new to healthcare giving, and my mom is on a lot of medicine that has to be givin by her peg.  </li>
            <li> I used to just put my pills in some aluminum foil and smash the heck out of them, but that&#x27;s much more strenuous than twisting this and sometimes not very effective</li>
            <li> And since the bottom is also conical, any pill crumbs fall towards the center so when you can back off a bit and re-tighten the top, everything is converted to powder.</li>
            <li> It turns one pill to powder or if you try 2 at a time, it&#x27;s more of a crushed aggregate that you can easily add to yogurt or any thick drink like a shake.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much force and the wide blue nodes are easy to grip.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap enough to have several to avoid cross-contamination of meds</li>
            <li> It works ok, but it takes a while to twist it open and closed.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to crush more than 4 regular sized pills at once.</li>
            <li> I did have to shake it a little the first time because some larger pieces were in the cup, but an extra turn took care of them nicely.</li>
            <li> This pulverizes, not just &amp;#34;crushes&amp;#34;. Brings what you need actually down to a fine powder.</li>
            <li> Before I used very old one</li>
            <li> Then I bought a mortar &amp; pestle, because I actually need them ground down to a very fine powder</li>
            <li> This gives the top a bit of a point which immediately breaks the pill with very little effort.</li>
            <li> you are no longer getting a little more twist down; look at the clear bottom of the crusher;&lt;br /&gt;The pill should be evenly spread on bottom;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise twist back and forth some more.............</li>
            <li> also has a small storage place on the top.</li>
            <li> The other one I bought is a smaller rectangle one that has a cutter on top and the crusher in the bottom.</li>
            <li> If this ever breaks, I will purchase the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is able to crush a big supplement for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, this is the easiest to use and especially made to powder your pills.</li>
            <li> I can see it being ok for small pills</li>
            <li> I had considered a small mortar and pestle but am glad I chose this.</li>
            <li> That evening I used it for the first time and actually yipped in delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for those who need exactly that - it&#x27;s a big deal.</li>
            <li> 100%.&lt;br /&gt;It is really strongly constructed and looks like it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> If you are using for multiple patients remember to clean out thoroughly between uses -- you do not want to cross contaminate (with meds) between patients.</li>
            <li> The pill crusher has two parts, a clear plastic crushing chamber that is threaded on the outside and a crushing handle that is made from a high-density (hard) polypropylene.</li>
            <li> I tried crushing 1 large pill, 1/2 of a medium-sized pill, and 2 halves of really small pills at once.</li>
            <li> The plastic of the base that touches the table is more brittle (it&#x27;s harder, but more brittle) than the top.  </li>
            <li> If you just use it for the same pill every time,it shouldn&#x27;t even be a concern after the first pill because the amount of pill that empties out should be equivalent to a complete pill.</li>
            <li> But to get it to crush into fine powder, I have to unscrew it a little and crush it again tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It even ha trouble crushing one kill at a time, requiring me to back off the screw down top shake and try to crush again.</li>
            <li> B000VSXDQY Silent Knight Pill Crusher]] that can crush a lot of pills at once but leaves large bits.</li>
            <li> I wanted to crush several large pills at once -- did not work --</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m assuming a lot of people get them for similar reasons or people can&#x27;t swallow really large pills, but this crusher doesn&#x27;t work for that at all.</li>
            <li> I was worried about how it would do on such a large pill, but it does crush it well.  </li>
            <li> My wife takes some large pills daily.</li>
            <li> I thought this little twist crusher may be the answer to crushing pills every day for our dog.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been crushing my little dog&#x27;s pills in this pill crusher for over 6 months now.  </li>
            <li> but I was only able to crush the pill a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It has lips on the top and bottom, allowing you to get lots of leverage to crush those hard pills.</li>
            <li> Good product, just a little messy trying to get the powder out</li>
            <li> The top part is gentle on the hand to grasp and turn, but the bottom part is sharp-edged and tough on the hands.</li>
            <li> also it is clear</li>
            <li> The clear plastic cuts into your hand otherwise.</li>
            <li> It is clear</li>
            <li> and it is clear they save a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I tried using water to clear it out</li>
            <li> I have to crush my 4 year old son&#x27;s pills.</li>
            <li> The bottom grip has not been a problem for me - a complete non-issue.  </li>
            <li> It completely pulverizes the pills and there isn&#x27;t any residue to scrape off.  </li>
            <li> My old crusher pushed some of the crumbs out to the sides.</li>
            <li> is as complete.</li>
            <li> Then at my last dental exam my dentist noticed I had a chipped molar which required a filling -- the use of the dreaded drill -- the whole nine yards.</li>
            <li> I have a 12 year old, g-tube dependant daughter who requires three doses of anticonvulsant per day.</li>
            <li> I just bought another one of these pill crushers since the one we have now is over three years old</li>
            <li> I find it takes so much effort that I went back to hitting pills with a hammer.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s simple and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> though, completely pulverizes tablets.</li>
            <li> My eighty year old mother has a cat that takes medicine every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several and this one really seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Surprised me.  </li>
            <li> and I always end up cleaning those with an old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Medicine is typically a much softer pill than supplements and smaller.</li>
            <li> I was using two table spoons to crush ball pills which frequently just launched them across the room.</li>
            <li> I use this pill pulverizer for personal use, and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> but it was a considerable amount.</li>
            <li> I can divide my bottle of dye-free ibuprofen among my various duplicates of this and have everything all ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for a quality product and at such a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;via</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than smaller crushers.</li>
            <li> and I nearly choked on the pill.</li>
            <li> This works easier by far and saves my wrist.</li>
            <li> By far the easiest pill crusher that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to crush my five year old medication...</li>
            <li> B004XVJI2S Musselman&#x27;s Natural Unsweetened Apple Sauce 24 oz]]</li>
            <li> I ordered it I was concerned that the 93 year old would not have the strength to use it to crush a pill</li>
            <li> the way, I am not the 93 year old; I gave it to him as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is my replacement for the old mortice and pestal.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a mortar and pestle to crush my cat&#x27;s pills but wanted something smaller and more portable, since the mortar and pestle is heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> An excellent little tool that, with proper care and feeding, will PROBABLY live a long and destructive life crushing to bits the tablets of your choice.  </li>
            <li> the price.or crushing them at all with anything since that coating is there for a really good reason) because the extra pressure needed to crush that kind of tablet may hasten the failure of the base part.  </li>
            <li> She has arthritis and is pretty weak, but she can use this just fine.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the base edges are kind of sharp as most of us hold it in our hands while we are crushing meds.</li>
            <li> I have broken more pills splitters and grinders due to their cheap design and construction.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend it for crushing spices, herbs or other such things.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend it for crushing spices, herbs or other such things.  </li>
            <li> For those who suffer arthritis and it is hard for them to turn the upper top since the pill might be too large, do the following:</li>
            <li> if someone who is a hemophiliac and older had something similar happen, they would have bled to death...</li>
            <li> , make sure this little crusher is absolutely dry before you crush anything in it.</li>
            <li> It works well enough for 1 pill, but it does not have the depth to take two pills high.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend, especially for this price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was such an easy non messy way to crush pills.</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm at first but then after continued use, I found that the powder (from the crushed medications) would somehow get on the outer side of the threads</li>
            <li> This little thing gets the job done and quick.</li>
            <li> With absolutely no strain on my fingers or wrist, my pill was crushed to a fine powder.  </li>
            <li> So I purchased this and it crushed the horse pills to a fine powder with minimal to no effort at all.</li>
            <li> if you have large pills you might need to crush the pills, open the lid, then crush them a second time to get them to a powder consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very solid, the barrel is large enough to accommodate the largest of pills, and the conical shape helps to shake the powder out.  </li>
            <li> I have mild arthritis in my fingers with constant pain, some swelling and decreased ability to grip in some fingers but with full range of mobility in all fingers still.  </li>
            <li> I was able to crush several pills together without twisting hard.  </li>
            <li> This little gem has the potential to become one of my VERY rare five star items.  </li>
            <li> Also, the internal action of the crusher doesn&#x27;t crush the pills completely.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because many of my medications are now difficult to swallow whole, I am undergoing chemo-therapy and one of the side effects is a sore throat and swelling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34, so I have no problem operating this, but I feel older, less capable persons wouldn&#x27;t have a problem using this model.  </li>
            <li> Would be better if the base was made like to top.  </li>
            <li> The best part is the base is one solid piece</li>
            <li> This product crushes tablets down to a very fine powder with little effort.  </li>
            <li> The threads are long enough so you can get them completely started before coming up against a whole pill</li>
            <li> But other than that it does exactly what it says on its description.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have with this product is that the bottom handle is not grippy like the top, and with the hard turns you have to give occasionally in crushing a pill, it will sometimes dig into your hand.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is the bottom of it hurts to holt on to, it has somewhat shart edges that can&#x27;t really get a good grip on so it can be painful for those with sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> This one almost got it half right.</li>
            <li> Hard to really crush large tablets!</li>
            <li> It works great for one and lousy for the other.  </li>
            <li> Although this crusher can handle several pills at once, I would suggest only crushing maybe 2 or 3 pills at a time (depending on size and type) -- you get a finer grind with less effort.</li>
            <li> To get a fine powder with no lumps simply unscrew the cap a turn or two, shake the contents a little for even distribution and then toggle back and forth.</li>
            <li> The mechanism used is smart, you twist it closed to crush the pill opposed to anything that would have springs (that break)</li>
            <li> Yes, the process results in a significant amount of powder, but there is also a considerable amount of small solid chips and pieces.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher it easy to use, just a slight turn and pills are crushed.  </li>
            <li> The bottom half should is silicon or rubber like the top half.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on large pills but not so well on small pills.  </li>
            <li> If used in this way, the design of the base makes it very easy to hold stationary while crushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crushing a REALLY hard pill - cat medicine - vitamin-ish - no coating.  </li>
            <li> I continue to try to find a satisfactory solution to crushing the hard tablets..</li>
            <li> If you shake it while the crushed pill is inside, the pill powder will actually come out of the top a little bit.</li>
            <li> The Duramed red and clear pill crusher does not compare to this one in quality</li>
            <li> The several times I have tried I have ended up pouring the pieces into my old worn out crusher to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old pill crusher.</li>
            <li> Our 16 year old cat takes five pills a day, and this finally allows me to give him pills without stress.</li>
            <li> The bottom lips are a bit \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; to say, so you could scrape yourself if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> Does crush pills well, even hard ones, but the design for the bottom, which looks great for griping, is really hard on your bottom hand!</li>
            <li> I had one of the other pill crushers and, as another reviewer pointed it out, the threads would jam unless I split the pills into smaller pieces first.</li>
            <li> It crushes pills but some of it stays on the plastic and there are lots of large pieces left that do not get crushed by this contraption.</li>
            <li> The sharp edges/ridges on the bottom really cut into my hand.  </li>
            <li> I found it much easier to screw and grind the pills with this one because of the 3 leaf handle as opposed to the two twist knobs of the other brand.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to twist than other crushers I have used.</li>
            <li> However, what is the point of the rubberized top when the rough, hard plastic bottom will give you blisters?</li>
            <li> It can also be used to cut any pill in half by slowly turning the top down until it hits the pill and then turn just a tad more and your pill will break in half.</li>
            <li> Everything inside gets crushed without a lot of elbow grease, and it is easy to empty the crushed pills into a cup, your hand, etc.  </li>
            <li> down until it no longer turns (there is an initial resistance until the pill fractures the first time).&lt;br /&gt;Twist</li>
            <li> I generally rate things based on several factors, one of which is durability (or how long it will last under normal use).  </li>
            <li> Breaking big pills in half first is helpful.</li>
            <li> I put his pills into the crusher (some are small, others are tiny), screw it down and am left with a very fine powder.  </li>
            <li> It may not be obvious from the photo, but the white &amp; blue knob screws into the lower clear cup.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast - as it in arrived the same day as the other items that shipped 2 day with my prime membership.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because I found that the clear bottom half felt a little less comfortable without the rubberized gribs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grinding up large pills for my dog and one of the previous reviewers</li>
            <li> I wanted to break large calcium tablet in half.</li>
            <li> Only complaint--they put nice rubber cushions on one part of the grinder but not on both parts so it can be uncomfortable tp grind up big tabs or multiple tabs.</li>
            <li> The most common complaint about this pill crusher, which does an *excellent* job, is that the base hurts people&#x27;s hands during use.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to break the pill and hoped that it would live up to the claim.  </li>
            <li> It does the job right - making a powder instead of just small chunks (or a mix of the 2).</li>
            <li> I received it in a small, clear bag with a barcoded label, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> Much simpler and less work than all the scewing and unscrewing.</li>
            <li> I use hand tools all day long at my profession,  and am here to tell you that if you have to use this more than once per day, it&#x27;s going to get irritating.</li>
            <li> it finally broke, so I went on amazon and saw this one get fairly good reviews, so I ordered one, but it was very uncomfortable to use and it hurt my hands.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a screw-on cap, so if the pill didn&#x27;t fully crush the first time, you have to screw, then unscrew, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this one for crushing those hard to swallow pills!</li>
            <li> As a result crushing even one whole pill usually creates so much powder as it is twisted, parts of the pill are cushioned and do not powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only slight issue is that the screw section is too tall since I am only crushing one little pill.  </li>
            <li> Prior to buying, I was not sure if the product will be good for grinding half of an already small pill.</li>
            <li> It works very well and requires little effort.</li>
            <li> This little gem really does work, and works well.</li>
            <li> This little gadget really works well.  </li>
            <li> This little guy gets the job done really well.</li>
            <li> This little crusher works very well</li>
            <li> this is really effective takes 3 seconds to crush a large pill, its idiot proof, plus it has a storage under that blue cap!</li>
            <li> For anyone who uses tea pills for their animals, you know that they are the most spit out because they are so round and hard</li>
            <li> It even has a very small hidden top pill compartment for storing your daily dosage, or pills on the go.      </li>
            <li> This little pill crusher works GREAT, even on a very hard little pill the vet prescribed for my puppy!  </li>
            <li> Ive used several crushers and/or techniques including the heavy, bolt down, bench mount crushers at the hospital -- but I like these little crushers much better.</li>
            <li> (a taste I get to enjoy for an extra long time as I struggle to break down the pill into small enough bits to swallow).</li>
            <li> The clear bottom allow me to see that the pills have turned into powder without need to unscrew to examine like other models.  </li>
            <li> I used the pill splitter first to cut it and then crushed it into little pieces to swallow.</li>
            <li> I have tried several versions of this style of crusher with exception to a similar model that has small \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in the \\&quot;grinding chamber\\&quot; (which I think would cause trouble in that you would have to clean</li>
            <li> If it lasts at least that long, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> If it lasts at least that long, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But to be clear, the crushing chamber in the base appears to be as thick and sturdy as everything else in the top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But to be clear, the crushing chamber in the base appears to be as thick and sturdy as everything else in the top.  </li>
            <li> The only caution I have is don&#x27;t put a lot of pills in at once, maybe 3-4 very small pills or 2 larger pills, or else you will have trouble crushing them thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple and I&#x27;m trying to figure out why I chose to struggle with a hammer for so long.</li>
            <li> It should last a long time.</li>
            <li> For a little item, it is vitally important when you take pills that are hard like rocks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go down completely.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using this for different people, using different medications though, you might want to purchase several different ones as the crusher part might be difficult to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> I crushed that pill like it didn&#x27;t exist in this little gem and am absolutely thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A few loosenings along with a quick small shake, another screw-down and the pills can actually be turned in to dust.  </li>
            <li> The one I previously owned was hard to clean and some of the pills got stuck inside.  </li>
            <li> The bottom clear plastic is sharp and formed to fit so uncomfortably.  </li>
            <li> As one other person recommended, you will need a hot pad or washrag to help hold the bottom of the crusher as they have not rounded off the edges quite enough and you will need a small cushion to pad your hand --- this is no problem.</li>
            <li> I have some difficulty crushing my hard-shelled Metformin tablets with the APEX crusher, Due to weak wrists.</li>
            <li> The middle of this is empty and allows storage of several of my pills on the desk.</li>
            <li> PLEASE comment on my reviews, positive or negative, so I can improve.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago, and I use it twice a day for my daughter who takes 3 large and hard pills day and night.  </li>
            <li> tend to be large and hard.</li>
            <li> One can stay at home and one can travel, since they are rather small and compact -- and there is a small chamber to store a few pills for later ahead of time in the top.</li>
            <li> and it is too big for pill pockets or other such subterfuge.  </li>
            <li> Crushes even large pills with very little effort!</li>
            <li> The bottom is a little uncomfortable and could have used a similar rubberized edge as the top, but if it comes to bother me</li>
            <li> Also, you can only do 1 pill at a time or it does not really crush much at all regardless of how hard you turn.</li>
            <li> I think the problem with the one is that it has a coating that makes crushing difficult.  </li>
            <li> I used a file to smooth it out some, but it is still quite uncomfortable and digs into your hand.</li>
            <li> The pill must be crushed to a powder so it can be mixed in with applesauce and fed to her.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d ordered this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> This pill crusher works well, is made well, and is larger than expected.  </li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have waited as long to purchase this aptly-named item.  </li>
            <li> Some pills are harder than others and require an extra turn or two to pulverize the pill.  </li>
            <li> I find if I hold it the container at an angle while twisting, the pills are crushed to a finer powder, and the central &amp;#34;dimple&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t clog with medicine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who has trouble swallowing pills, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> when I opened it all there was, was a thin white powder that looked exactly like baby powder in consistency...</li>
            <li> Easily crushes my dog&#x27;s big glucosamine pills,  I was afraid he was going to break a tooth.  </li>
            <li> but I can see how the bottom half causes pain for people who may be suffering from arthritis or prove difficult for more elderly users so it would be great,even for me, if the manufacturer can improve on this.  </li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t need to powder their pills but rather to only slip they pills in half, I recommend a standard pill cutter instead of a crusher.</li>
            <li> The pill crusher really tries to crush rather than grind and large pills are hard to crush.</li>
            <li> It has a beveled crusher point which won&#x27;t jam with crushed pill crumbs, unlike the flat ones from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It seems the chamber allows too much room for the device to crush very small pills.</li>
            <li> I bought this some time ago and we keep it because it is larger than our other one</li>
            <li> While the total quality of the product could have been better so the legs of the base don&#x27;t feel quite so uncertain (at least to me), it certainly gets the job done and isn&#x27;t shattering in my hands the second</li>
            <li> For years I have been crushing his meds with the back of a spoon, adding chicken broth, sucking the mix all into a syringe and then squirting it in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have been stuck with several medical problems over time, and find myself taking quite a few medications.</li>
            <li> All the finely crushed bits prevented the two halves of the tiny pills from being touched at all, and I had to dig them out and twist them separately for them to be crushed.</li>
            <li> Usually doing this no more than a few times is all that&#x27;s needed to get a fairly fine powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually doing this no more than a few times is all that&#x27;s needed to get a fairly fine powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All plastic simple object (which alone should not be dispositive), but this product does not (even) crush an average size vitamin.</li>
            <li> I was using the back of a spoon to crush a half of Zyrtec  for my cats allergies.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I miss is this doesn&#x27;t have the ability to cut a pill in half which another one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a thick and apparently durable plastic and the actual effort required to twist the device and crush the pills inside</li>
            <li> so it goes down slowly and very controlled.</li>
            <li> have wrist tendonitis and am comfortable using this product, although like other reviewers, I wish the base was made out of similar material as the top since the thin plastic edges can dig into my hand a little.  </li>
            <li> I bought this pill crusher for my father who just turned 85 and has a very hard time swallowing pills and this really crushes up the pills and makes it a lot easier for him to take his medication.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to twist, but still works very well.</li>
            <li> I can powder 4 pills including a low dose aspirin with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements</li>
            <li> I crush them, pour a little water, and draw them up all in the same container.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Place the pill (one half of a cut pill) flat on the bottom pushed to one side (not in the middle).&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> I have crushed ginormous vitamin pills with this and little medical pills with this, it works like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> back the thickness of one finger and turn back hard again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This crusher works ok however, if your hands or wrists are week or painful, you need to get something that does not stress your anatomy.</li>
            <li> i put a huge msm pull inside, twisted the cap..heard no sound, so I thought nothing happened..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pills may be bitter when crushed so</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Leaves chunks of pills that aren&#x27;t crushed.</li>
            <li> Now she can sprinkle the crushed pill on her applesauce and take it without choking.</li>
            <li> Just a few spins and all the big antibiotic tablets turned into powder.</li>
            <li> It quickly crushed these two pills into pixie dust.</li>
            <li> When you turn - the pills get crushed.</li>
            <li> Harder pills made to dissolve, might cause issues as others have noted.</li>
            <li> Delivered before I would have expected it and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> With each screwing movement, the tablet is crushed.  </li>
            <li> With the mortar &amp; pestle, I sometimes ended up with tablet coating that was not well crushed, but that has not been an issue here.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another to have as backup as I have dropped the current one I have a few times.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a feeding tube that requires his pills to be totally crushed, and the Ultra Pill Crusher does the job.  </li>
            <li> So far, this has been my favourite manual pill grinder, and often I do not need to chop it any further, although sometimes the filler gets caked all over the inside of the grinder, and tedious scraping is the only way to get it out,</li>
            <li> Heavy duty construction but simple to operate.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> If you need your pills crushed, this is the crusher for you.</li>
            <li> It crushes pills effortlessly and works easier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I only have a few complaints though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just have to be a bit careful with it.</li>
            <li> That will make it harder to use, but it can still be used if one has a channel lock and some patience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That will make it harder to use, but it can still be used if one has a channel lock and some patience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dog acts like a mental patient eating all her food around her pills or spitting the pills about on the carpet.</li>
            <li> NO build up, and all well crushed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has trouble swallowing pills or even to those who have to take a larger sized pill.</li>
            <li> Everybody who takes pills that  needs to be crushed this the solution.</li>
            <li> that include shaking from thunderstorms, helicopters or even construction noise that sounds like it could remotely be thunder.</li>
            <li> I had to use an oven mitt to hold it and get 3 pills crushed for my son.</li>
            <li> That way I get to control the remote</li>
            <li> That was annoying enough that I went looking for something better.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, the problem would be solved if the manufacturer would put the same padding material on the base as they put on the top.    </li>
            <li> The medium sort of got crushed, but required me to ease up then shake it around until it was in the center for it to be crushed.</li>
            <li> I have to screw down, back up, give it a tap/shake, screw down again, repeat.</li>
            <li> The simple solution is to set the crusher on a table, book, or some other firm surface rather than holding it in your hand during use.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t even know why I forgot to look up \\&quot;pill crusher\\&quot; on Amazon for so long, but I did about a week ago, and it&#x27;s made my life a lot less stressful when it comes to taking the pills.</li>
            <li> I have to crush a pretty large pill (quarter diameter and 1/4&amp;#34; thick) for my dog and mix it with chicken broth since he refuses to eat it himself</li>
            <li> but I am not able to crush the smaller pills that I need crushed also.</li>
            <li> Take the pill and put it in a small pot and with the handle of a knife hit the pill softly which will split in a few pieces.</li>
            <li> dog has serious nervous issues (he&#x27;s old and I adopted him that way)</li>
            <li> Seems like there is no pill too big for this little monster!</li>
            <li> it is it leaves a tiny bit of the crushed pill residue in the chamber which is very hard to remove,but I think I&#x27;ll try a sterile paint brush next time.</li>
            <li> I have to use a towel or something like that to get a better, less painful grip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any pain that other reviewers wrote about, but I don&#x27;t have arthritis either.</li>
            <li> when combining the big &amp; small pills together.</li>
            <li> I have had other pill crushers, but they have all gummed up.  </li>
            <li> One broke within two weeks, and the other got crossed threads after three months&#x27; use.      </li>
            <li> Prefer this pill crusher over the other (Lgs.</li>
            <li> I need to crush some shrimp and other fish foods for my baby fish.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps one should use a grinder that has sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Had to go through the hassle of getting ahold of the company to try to get the other one that I paid for already.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do it any other way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small enough to take along during trips so that taking pills will never be a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these when my other crusher broke.</li>
            <li> I dont need a knnife to scrap off the bottom like other kinds I got at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rprompt delivery-easy to use, small enough to bring with me if I hae to.</li>
            <li> But, it does not crush the pills all the way, there are some small chunks left.  </li>
            <li> I usually crush 1 pill then the next.  </li>
            <li> Due to my husbands stroke and peg tube the medication must be pulverized.  </li>
            <li> The last complaint is that the dust from the pill has to be knocked loose.  </li>
            <li> You may still want to chop the byproduct with a razor depending on the pill or how you would like it ground up, sometimes you have really got to crank hard, so not recommended for hard type pills when mixed with  the elderly or weak armed individual.  </li>
            <li> is very minimal.</li>
            <li> VERY rough on your hands to hold it.  </li>
            <li> This is a challenger since on one side many people like it and others are unhappy and their reasons is because they suffer arthritis and it is hard to turn the pill</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mildly uncomfortable, hardly painful, but it would be a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually hurts my hand worse than the regular plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Such a small gadget, and a simple idea, and this one is made of hard plastic</li>
            <li> Hard to swallow currently due to medical issues.</li>
            <li> However, the bottom piece that you have to grip with the other hand, has very sharp edges and hurts my hand.  </li>
            <li> but a little rough on the hands</li>
            <li> I previously tried two other pill crushers.</li>
            <li> The only issue is scraping out the tablet, sometimes it stuck to the sides making it hard to eat all of it.</li>
            <li> The plastic feels flimsy and feels like it will break when pressed hard enough to crush the pills.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if the chunks don&#x27;t seem small enough, I will mix it up a little and crush</li>
            <li> This little item seems too small and simple to work well, but it gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> I had to try to turn it all the way as hard as I could to crush it all the way...and some residue was left inside.  </li>
            <li> OMG, it hurts your hand so bad when crushing pills for 30 ppl each shift.  </li>
            <li> Even with the one, I have to re-do it about 4-5 times, shaking the crushed pill around between crushings in order to get it all crushed up to even-sized small particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Threw it away before it broke in my hands, not worth trying to refund.</li>
            <li> he is unable to swallow whole pills.</li>
            <li> (As recommended by at least one other reviewer, if the bottom grip is uncomfortable to you just spend a few minutes with some fine sandpaper or an emery board and round off the sharpest ridges.)  </li>
            <li> The base legs, however, are about half as thick as the top, which makes me wonder about the potential for splitting/cracking/failing under repeated use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very solid, slightly pliable, thick top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tighten the unit down till the pill starts to break up</li>
            <li> Put it barely down</li>
            <li> Put it all the way down and it makes a powder to mix in my cat&#x27;s food.  </li>
            <li> I have to grind down some pills</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> it is that the edges are quite sharp!  </li>
            <li> my grandma at 97 used mine to crush a pill with her very extreme arthritis</li>
            <li> I corrected this by using an emery board to round off the sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Took less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Besides, their price was $4.99,a $1.46 less than Apex was charging, and I had no delivery charge.</li>
            <li> I did six pills at a time w/ no splitting and in less then 15 seconds...</li>
            <li> B00004SPEU Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black]]</li>
            <li> They probably could have added this feature on the bottom half, but they didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I always get a towel to grab the bottom half and use it that way.</li>
            <li> Previously we were using a D-Size battery to crush the pills.</li>
            <li> The design is a slight improvement to the one I trashed because of the thread location.  </li>
            <li> the crusher tilted slightly to the side.&lt;br /&gt;Twist</li>
            <li> I did six pills at a time with no splitting and in less then 15 seconds you have pulverized pills.</li>
            <li> it was a half)</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I assumed that it would be the type where u push down and it crushes the pill instead of screwing it tight so it crushes the medicine</li>
            <li> Sometimes a bit of the pill would be crushed against the bottom of the container and be a wee bit difficult to get loose but not that big a deal...</li>
            <li> I glued a large rubber band around the bottom section to keep the sharp edges from cutting into my hand.  </li>
            <li> It is very unfortunate but the way this is constructed, if you have tough pills the bottom piece is constructed very cheap and when I used it....</li>
            <li> Just turn slightly counter-clockwise, shake up and down a few times and turn clockwise again.</li>
            <li> I crush a lot of pills as my small dog has to take pills every day and they have to be crushed so that I can hide them in his food.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a coffee grinder which did not work well and was a mess.</li>
            <li> This way, I just mix the pill dust in a spoon with a few drops of water and down they go.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money on a $20-30 crusher that is steel and does the job half as well.</li>
            <li> Now the base of the pill crusher fits into the cutout and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to use a round rubbery can opener to hold the bottom half.</li>
            <li> I do think the company could have put the rubber comfort grips on the plastic base edges to increase the comfort when turning, but I knew this was an issue before ordering based on other reviews; therefore I was not disappointed when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> After years of smashing pills myself or splitting them into little pieces, I found this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just wish it came with a little brush so you can get it all out.</li>
            <li> It crushes pills evenly and thoroughly and with little effort.</li>
            <li> She has to crush a little pill and mix it in the cat food.</li>
            <li> I tape the lid shut just as a little piece of mind</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Bought this doohickey and now her pills can be concealed in her food with a little gravy.</li>
            <li> I have carpal tunnel and the little pill crushers I have been using cause me sleepless nights.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little too labour-intensive,</li>
            <li> .. reduces the size of a pill into little pieces.</li>
            <li> but I can not help but notice the hard rough plastic as I am using the device.  </li>
            <li> I then just add the chicken broth into the crusher receptacle, suck it into a syringe, and I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;First, at least 1/4 of the pill stays STUCK to the point after it is crushed</li>
            <li> : I noticed that a few people didn&#x27;t find this review helpful.</li>
            <li> You can save a lot of money using this product and all of the medication is saved, nothing wasted.</li>
            <li> We were having trouble getting our grandma to take her pills.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the \\&quot;crushing\\&quot; action that difficult for my arthritic hands, although it may be for some.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li> These skins just are not made to powder.&lt;br /&gt;In applesauce for a few minutes pill skins are softened and not an issue for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>
            <li> and you have to do it a few times to get it crush it into a power.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s nowhere for moisture to get trapped.</li>
            <li> I bought this to crush meds for my grandmother, as she has trouble swallowing pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may take a few twists</li>
            <li> I would recomend this for anyone who has trouble swallowing pills</li>
            <li> /&gt;With just a few twists (tightening and loosening), the &amp;#34;mortar and pestle&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted my multivitamin pill crushed along with a thick magnesium pill.</li>
            <li> I bought a few</li>
            <li> You do have to loosen and retighten it a few times until you get the desired consistency.</li>
            <li> Now my mom uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It crushes the pills into powder and it doesn&#x27;t leave big bits behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given 3 of these as gifts to friends and family that have trouble swallowing pills.  </li>
            <li> but my puppy&#x27;s vitamins did not fit.  </li>
            <li> It took both my multivitamin and my thick magnesium pills and crushed them into small pieces that I then dump into my bland oatmeal.</li>
            <li> Bottom plastic is kinda sharp, and is hard to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend who has severe arthritis and was unable to use several other pill crushers.</li>
            <li> It is hard plastic and quite sharp.</li>
            <li> I use it to grind Pepcid tablets for my cat and with very little effort, it does indeed pulverize the tablets to a fine powder, which I then mix with a liquid base to administer to the kitty with a dropper.  </li>
            <li> when you washed it, it was near impossible to dry...</li>
            <li> other reviewers were right, the base hurts my hand even when held in a towel.  </li>
            <li> especially not large vitamins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not easy to use</li>
            <li> I often worried that I would break a tooth trying to chomp down on these pills because they were so hard.</li>
            <li> It can be hard on the hands to tighten it down to crush the pills, it does the job.</li>
            <li> The comments by others about the base hurting the hand is true.</li>
            <li> The bottom piece left red indentations for hours on the palm of my left hand, very painful.</li>
            <li> A mortar and pestle will crush pills finer in less time, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Since my mother has only gotten worse since her strokes, she has a hard time understanding the concept of swallowing pills.  </li>
            <li> This is the most painful and difficult pill crusher I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> little crusher works wonders!</li>
            <li> It no longer crushes pills to a powder, but rather to small pieces.</li>
            <li> I literally just got this in the mail no more than 15 minutes ago</li>
            <li> This item works well for small pills</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to grind larger pills  </li>
            <li> there is not really very much more you can say about a product like this.</li>
            <li> This leaves the pills in small chunks.</li>
            <li> Only sad part is there is not a compartment to hold pills</li>
            <li> No more choking on pills.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure why, but it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the bottom portion is somewhat uncomfortable on the hand when turning.</li>
            <li> I was never able to pulverize the pills.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this based on positive reviews on Amazon, but I was disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> This is probably due to poor design around the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ones from our local stores were worthless because he would eat around the tiny pieces!</li>
            <li> The non-rubberized tips are too small and hard to grip.</li>
            <li> It took a lot of time to make its way down, despite drinking water, which at times seemed to make matters worse.</li>
            <li> Hard to turn.  </li>
            <li> and I gave up my search too soon accepting my \\&quot;hard pill to swallow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bulky or hard to use.  </li>
            <li> And maybe my pills are hard, but it takes a lot of force in turning the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You cannot escape grabbing it so hard and twisting that it hurts your hand.</li>
            <li> Does not crush hard pills.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want the worry of having to swallow pills that are hard as rocks, consider this ultra pill crusher.  </li>
            <li> I had to twist it really hard to crush the pills.  </li>
            <li> I find each one lasts at least a year, if not longer.</li>
            <li> &quot; I think they mean it.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of cutting it with scissors until it was small enough to swallow with pudding.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Split pills larger than a Tic-Tac in half with a pill cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Place glove or two socks on the hand holding the base to prevent sore hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can crush the pill to very small pieces or just break it up some.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to get pieces VERY small forget it.</li>
            <li> I was confused :/..</li>
            <li> (calcium, vitamin D (I&#x27;m anemic &amp; vitamin D deficient :/)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this little thing would crush pills every well, and I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> , the complaints about people&#x27;s hands hurting from holding it at the bottom are a little too exaggerated.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to someone with weak hands though.</li>
            <li> I needed to crush a very hard pill.</li>
            <li> Very hard to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Made of tough durable material, could not fore-see this ever breaking.</li>
            <li> My elderly mom needs to have her pills broken up</li>
            <li> The plastic on the bottom is a bit thin, otherwise I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> My Mom is 84 and is confused swallowing pills.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the base, I use a face cloth so it doesn&#x27;t cut up my hands.</li>
            <li> Works but not great.</li>
            <li> Tired of hearing my sister using a hammer to crush her pills.</li>
            <li> You still have to &amp;#34;mortar and pestle&amp;#34; the last bits yourself, in the base, to truly make a powder (or to Pulverize).</li>
            <li> One small drawback is that the base of this crusher has some sharp plastic edges that are uncomfortable to your hand.</li>
            <li> I purchased the &#x27;other&#x27; pill crusher because it was cheaper and was highly disappointed (the internals weren&#x27;t sealed so</li>
            <li> I found this crusher to be awkward and hard to turn.  </li>
            <li> The base feels a little thin, and I am concerned that someone might break it in their hand if they over tighten the cap, albeit beyond what is needed to crush a pill.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have found is durability -- they arent bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have yet to find another multivitamin I tolerate as well as these rocks or that</li>
            <li> and I have not found it to be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> As it is, it is uncomfortable on your hand.</li>
            <li> It is well constructed and hasn&#x27;t broken yet!  </li>
            <li> the bottom has no rubber grip which makes it uncomfortable to hold and crush.</li>
            <li> and maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but I replaced another version of pill crusher because it was worn out</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable on the hands</li>
            <li> It was expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is a pain</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars instead of five because the contents still stick at the bottom, which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> This was a failed experiment for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about swallowing your pill and nobody is there in case things take an unfortunate turn for the worse, then pray to God, nothing bad happens, like I did.</li>
            <li> Transparent base legs aren&#x27;t as thick as the rest.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried cutting the pills in fractions to prevent me from choking on them, but the jagged edges that result from cutting them up via a knife were uncomfortable for my throat.</li>
            <li> I solved the problem by tracing the base on a 1/4 thick piece of wood and cutting out the shape.</li>
            <li> so it is durable and can crush some hard pills!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This really works!  After years of smashing pills myself or splitting them into little pieces, I found this.&lt;br /&gt;I recently had surgery and am having to take pain meds that are too big for me to swallow.  Put the pill in this and voila! powedered pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pills may be bitter when crushed so be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works easily and no extreme force is necessary.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money. After 5 min the pill wasn&#x27;t even powder yet. I just went back to putting the pills in a bowl and smashing with the bottom of a metal cup. Took less than 30 seconds. Definitely do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this to crush tablets that I give to my dog, its light, yet strong and very easy to use. Its also designed to make the crushing efficient and also shaped to make it easy to use by those with mobility/joint issues.</li>
            <li> Works well for me!  I have to crush 3 pills a day for cats.  I use the larger compound pills for thyroid and this crushes them up just fine.</li>
            <li> You have to twist quite a bit to crush the pills, but it does work.  It is easier to hold while twisting.</li>
            <li> Works great! Can crush even the hardest tablets.Amazing how few drugstores carry a pill crusher. Even Walmart Pharmacy didn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> While this thing feels a bit flimsy when you first pick it up, it sure works well.  It absolutely pulverizes a pill very quickly.</li>
            <li> One of my rescue cats gets 5-7 medicines per day including 4-5 in pill form.  Giving him that many pills one after another is not viable nor is having each pill compounded individually (you cannot compound multiple medicines - they would not have the correct dosages).  For years I have been crushing his meds with the back of a spoon, adding chicken broth, sucking the mix all into a syringe and then squirting it in his mouth.  The problem was that the pills did not crush equally and bigger pieces would get stuck in the syringe - basically it was a pain and he would not get all the meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Pill Crusher to see if it would work better and it is absolutely fantastic.  I put his pills into the crusher (some are small, others are tiny), screw it down and am left with a very fine powder.  I then just add the chicken broth into the crusher receptacle, suck it into a syringe, and I am ready to go.  It is easier, faster and more effective.  I wish I had know about this years ago - possibly the best $6 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these crushers over the years and they work the best IMO. If one wants true powder, not little chunks or grains, this is it!</li>
            <li> I bought this 6 months ago based on reviews here. I have used it several times a day since then. It no longer crushes pills to a powder, but rather to small pieces. I think I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth, so I&#x27;m back to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I have to crush my 4 year old son&#x27;s pills. It used to be such a headache. This tool is AMAZING and works beautifully. It crushes into such a fine powder (I put it through twice) that he didn&#x27;t even bat an eyelash the first time he took his crushed pills today. I&#x27;m ordering extras just to have. Makes life SO easy.</li>
            <li> No instructions.  Hard to turn.  Leaves chunks of pills that aren&#x27;t crushed.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter has difficulty swallowing tablets so now she can crush her own, add some apple sauce and she&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for. When you put the tablets in the pill crusher, you just turn the knob and the pills are crushed, it&#x27;s that easy. You just unscrew the top to get the content. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve never used a pill crusher before, and this one works great! It&#x27;s just what I needed! It pulverizes my vitamins into a fine powder that I mix into protein shakes.</li>
            <li> I have a g-tube so all my meds have to be crushed to fit through the tubing.  I have literally worn out pill crushers.  I got this one thinking it would be easier on my hands to use since I take 40 pills a day.  The top half is easy to grip but the bottom half hurts my hands to hold.  The sharp edges/ridges on the bottom really cut into my hand.  Why didn&#x27;t the top design and materials get repeated on the bottom?  Also, the internal action of the crusher doesn&#x27;t crush the pills completely.  The several times I have tried I have ended up pouring the pieces into my old worn out crusher to finish the job.  I can&#x27;t believe there isn&#x27;t a crusher out there that works, is durable and is easy to grip.  This one almost got it half right.</li>
            <li> Finally a pull crusher that actually crushes -- and sometimes pulverizes -- a pill.  I have tried various pill crushers over the years to crush meds for my son and daughter with special needs.  This one is hands-down the best.  I wish I had found it sooner.  Now if only they could make the bottom a wee bit more comfortable on the hands, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t swallow pills, so I&#x27;m really happy I got this. I crush my vitamins and supplements to add them to protein shakes or pudding. This thing is so easy. Just a couple twists and it pulverizes any pill. I didn&#x27;t notice any pain that other reviewers wrote about, but I don&#x27;t have arthritis either. I use it to crush pills for my dogs, too, and add the powder to their food. Easily washable. Great value, love it!</li>
            <li> My mother takes a couple very large pills that her pill splitter can&#x27;t split. For a little plastic gadget, this is wonderful. I did the first pill for her and she&#x27;s done them ever since and she&#x27;s 90 with some arthritis. I did have to shake it a little the first time because some larger pieces were in the cup, but an extra turn took care of them nicely. Now she can sprinkle the crushed pill on her applesauce and take it without choking. For a tiny, inexpensive gadget, it works perfectly. Set it on a table rather than trying to hold it in your hand.</li>
            <li> Worked okay for one pill. But, neded to twist the top on &amp;.off when combining the big &amp; small pills together.</li>
            <li> The Ultra Pill Crusher by Apex Medical is the BEST pill crusher I have ever used.  I think I have gone through about a dozen different models over the past 2.5 years, and this one works best by far.  It is a well designed product that performs exactly as it should.  Yes the grip on the bottom is different from the rubber-padded grip on the top, but I find that the three-lobe design does not require gripping as tightly as many other designs.  The bottom grip has not been a problem for me - a complete non-issue.  (As recommended by at least one other reviewer, if the bottom grip is uncomfortable to you just spend a few minutes with some fine sandpaper or an emery board and round off the sharpest ridges.)  I have given these to friends who also need to crush pills, and they agree it is the best pill crusher they have ever used.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Knob-style which fits very nicely in hand and has blue no-slip grips. Easy to turn (even with arthritis and carpel tunnel) and crushes to a very fine powder.  My opinion is that it couldn&#x27;t be any better than it is and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It completely pulverizes the pills and there isn&#x27;t any residue to scrape off.  Beats the heck out of the mortar and pestle I bought for over $20.00.  You just insert the pills and screw down the top.  A few loosenings along with a quick small shake, another screw-down and the pills can actually be turned in to dust.  Since my mother has only gotten worse since her strokes, she has a hard time understanding the concept of swallowing pills.  This way, I just mix the pill dust in a spoon with a few drops of water and down they go.  If you&#x27;re looking for a really good pill crusher, this one is the only one to get in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this is really effective takes 3 seconds to crush a large pill, its idiot proof, plus it has a storage under that blue cap!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Crushes meds up easy and clean. Excellent product for a ridiculously low price.</li>
            <li> Simple effective product. Good price. Great value. My cat kept eating around his Pepcid pill. Pill pockets didn&#x27;t work. Manual crusher was the solution.</li>
            <li> Prior to buying, I was not sure if the product will be good for grinding half of an already small pill. However, It worked great. Grind easily with almost no effort needed. That&#x27;s the only pill that I ever use in this grinder though.</li>
            <li> I had one of the other pill crushers and, as another reviewer pointed it out, the threads would jam unless I split the pills into smaller pieces first. That was annoying enough that I went looking for something better. The Ultra Pill Crusher is it. This one works so well I have no need to pre-split anything. It is well thought out and well manufactured. The threads are long enough so you can get them completely started before coming up against a whole pill and they are smooth enough to turn easily. You spin the top down until it comes up against the pill and then a little effort easily breaks the pill. What is especially clever is the shape of the pill cavity. Both the bottom and top pieces are slightly conical. This gives the top a bit of a point which immediately breaks the pill with very little effort. And since the bottom is also conical, any pill crumbs fall towards the center so when you can back off a bit and re-tighten the top, everything is converted to powder. My old crusher pushed some of the crumbs out to the sides. The first time I used it, I smiled and dropped the old one in the trash.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have no issue pulverizing the pills I use.  The only change I would make is to flatten the bottom portion of the crusher.  I like to hold the pulverizer in my hands instead of putting it down on a table top when using it.  This can cause some discomfort when using it like this.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Ultra Pill crusher along with another item.  When the package arrived,  the Apex Pill Crusher was unpackaged, without instructions and looked like it might have   been returned.  I contacted Amazon and they were great.  They refunded my money without my having to return the item.  The best part is that I went to Rite-Aid to see if they had it because I wanted to read the instructions, they did and it was in a sealed see-thru package with instructions. Besides, their price was $4.99,a $1.46 less than Apex was charging, and I had no delivery charge. Had I known Rite-Aid carried it, I never would have ordered it online.  This company deals in health related products and I think they should have a standard as to pacaging and shipping.  Stan Pickus</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous pill crushers with varying degrees of success.  This is the best I have found.  I take a lot of pills every day.  It crushes pills without a lot of effort and works well for people who have diminished hand strength.  The only caution I have is don&#x27;t put a lot of pills in at once, maybe 3-4 very small pills or 2 larger pills, or else you will have trouble crushing them thoroughly.  I find it easier to halve larger pills before crushing.</li>
            <li> I have had other pill crushers, but they have all gummed up.  When I needed a new one, I read the reviews on Amazon and purchased this one and its been great. Crushes pills very well without accumulating residue.  I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a pill crusher.</li>
            <li> the pill crusher does the job just as simple and without using all your strength.  My elderly mom needs to have her pills broken up and we put them in her nutra bullet drinks.  Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> crushes even the biggest horse pill.   very easy to turn.  my grandma at 97 used mine to crush a pill with her very extreme arthritis</li>
            <li> Worked much better than the one we had.  Would be better if the base was made like to top.  It was all settled with a pepper grinder.&lt;br /&gt;J. Tuffy Parish&lt;br /&gt;(  I Served  )</li>
            <li> This is the best pill crusher-the handle is easly to grab and turn, and it crushes even the largest pills...also it is clear so you can see if there are any lumps</li>
            <li> Best pill crusher available.  Comfortable &amp; easy twist top.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of this product for my work place. The grip top makes it so much easier to use. It is helpful to those who have arthritis or diminished strength from stroke.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of many pill crushers before purchasing this one.  It gets 3 stars because it is priced well and the top design with the rubber cushions is good.  After this - it goes downhill for me...&lt;br /&gt;First, at least 1/4 of the pill stays STUCK to the point after it is crushed - I&#x27;ve tried it many ways, it still sticks. The bottom of it KILLS my hands.  I read another review that stated this and it is the same for me.  The rubber on the top is a great idea - why not make the bottom the same?  The plastic is such that it cuts into my hands.  To solve this - just use a cloth, towel, shirt tail...whatever is handy.  The last complaint is that the dust from the pill has to be knocked loose.  Clumps stick to the bottom and it has to be knocked on the side to loosen it.&lt;br /&gt;Still - all in all - this beats crushing a pill between 2 spoons - not much - but some.... I don&#x27;t mind so much the pills getting stuck as much as the design of the bottom, but that is probably why it is priced so well... As far as how it crushes... it does pulverize ;-)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet but had to come on and review.  It seems so sturdy, as if it couldn&#x27;t break even if you tried.  The mechanism used is smart, you twist it closed to crush the pill opposed to anything that would have springs (that break) etc.  I am very happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to put it to use. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes crushing the cats&#x27; pill medications a snap. It has a beveled crusher point which won&#x27;t jam with crushed pill crumbs, unlike the flat ones from the drugstore. Easy to hold, easy to clean; nothing wrong at all with its design!</li>
            <li> Pill crushing for administration through PEG tube became a quick and easy task with this device. Just a few spins and all the big antibiotic tablets turned into powder. Had been using a different model that tore up our hands daily and didn&#x27;t come close to achieving the great powdered consistency that this did. We didn&#x27;t try crushing multiple pills at a time as that didn&#x27;t fit the dosing schedule, but seems likely that even that would work. Great item!! A bargain, too!</li>
            <li> I am a nurse on a 29 bed general-surgical unit. Ive used several crushers and/or techniques including the heavy, bolt down, bench mount crushers at the hospital -- but I like these little crushers much better. The metal bench mount ones actually crush (as opposed to grind). This is problematic in that one still has to do more \\&quot;crushing\\&quot; (ie- grinding) after your meds have been through the crusher (the pieces are too big to fit through, say, a feeding tube). And I dont have to walk all the way back to the nurses station to access the crusher -- because this will fit in my pocket. I have tried several versions of this style of crusher with exception to a similar model that has small \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in the \\&quot;grinding chamber\\&quot; (which I think would cause trouble in that you would have to clean/scrape/tap/pick/etc the teeth to get all your med particles out) -- I have found these to be the best -- they are quick and easy to clean. Although this crusher can handle several pills at once, I would suggest only crushing maybe 2 or 3 pills at a time (depending on size and type) -- you get a finer grind with less effort. The crusher is designed for easy, solid gripping for good torque while grinding (some of the small ones dont work well for this reason). The only bad thing I have found is durability -- they arent bad but they arent good -- but theyre cheap (and are what I would consider durable for the price). If you are using for multiple patients remember to clean out thoroughly between uses -- you do not want to cross contaminate (with meds) between patients.</li>
            <li> Not arthritis friendly and still leaves chunks while wasting a lot of med on the screw mechanism. The bottom piece left red indentations for hours on the palm of my left hand, very painful.</li>
            <li> The pill crusher is easy to use and clean.  It turns one pill to powder or if you try 2 at a time, it&#x27;s more of a crushed aggregate that you can easily add to yogurt or any thick drink like a shake.</li>
            <li> These crushers work really good for our use in residential care homes .  The shape of the top allows the crushing of pills easier on hands and wrist</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble swallowing pills for whatever reason, but this effectively solves that problem for me. Very easy to use and very easy to clean. Twist the top until it crushes the pill(s) easily.</li>
            <li> Got this for my elderly mother.  She has arthritis and is pretty weak, but she can use this just fine.  She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite some time. It is easy to use, I have arthritus, and does a good job crushing.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Takes a strong grip to twist the cap to crush the pills. I use it to crush my multivitamin. It works well when crushing one at a time, but takes a while to get a fine powder when crushing more than one. It also leaves a powdery residue all over the device, so if you need a precise amount of medication there really is no way to tell how much you are losing. If you are able to swallow pills, this is to much work. But if you need your pills crushed, this is good for the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pill crusher almost daily for nine months.  It works very well and requires little effort. I previously tried two other pill crushers. One broke within two weeks, and the other got crossed threads after three months&#x27; use.      One small drawback is that the base of this crusher has some sharp plastic edges that are uncomfortable to your hand. I corrected this by using an emery board to round off the sharp edges. (Medium/fine sandpaper would also work.) As another reviewer mentioned, the problem would be solved if the manufacturer would put the same padding material on the base as they put on the top.    Overall, I gave this item five stars because it is durable, easy to use, and priced right.</li>
            <li> I take two chewable multivitamins a day and have for years now. I HATE taking them  because they&#x27;re rock-hard and the taste is awful (a taste I get to enjoy for an extra long time as I struggle to break down the pill into small enough bits to swallow). Unfortunately I have yet to find another multivitamin I tolerate as well as these rocks or that is as complete. I often worried that I would break a tooth trying to chomp down on these pills because they were so hard. I bought a pill crusher a while ago at Walgreens but it was a total piece of junk and I gave up my search too soon accepting my \\&quot;hard pill to swallow\\&quot;. Then at my last dental exam my dentist noticed I had a chipped molar which required a filling -- the use of the dreaded drill -- the whole nine yards. I am certain it was these vitamins that did it. After that I decided to renew my search for a good pill crusher and turned to Amazon to find one highly recommended. The reviews of this pill crusher by nurses sold me. I tried it tonight for the first time and was blown away by how easy this was to operate and how finely it pulverized TWO pills at once with virtually no strength required. It quickly crushed these two pills into pixie dust. I was able to shake the dust into my mouth and wash it down with water. I stood there in utter amazement that a little five dollar piece of plastic works so beautifully and could have spared me the discomfort and unpleasantness I lived with for years (not to mention the dentist&#x27;s bill, which I assure you was MUCH more than five dollars). I&#x27;m happy as a clam about this pill crusher and you will be too. This little gem really does work, and works well. I have a two year-old daughter and I&#x27;m excited about being able to use this gadget to crush up a Tylenol or antibiotic pill for her and make taking medications easier in the years ahead when she outgrows the liquid medications.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Works just as advertised.  Very easy to clean after use.  All Pros, no Cons.</li>
            <li> This is a pill crusher. It crushes pills. When you put pills in it, it crushes them. When you turn - the pills get crushed. Its crush-a-licious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I noticed that a few people didn&#x27;t find this review helpful. I apologize, I forgot to mention that it is also crush-tastic. Hopefully, this helps.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread. We use it for our pet meds</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the pill popping when crushing it! Works very well for my son&#x27;s allergy pills. But to get it to crush into fine powder, I have to unscrew it a little and crush it again tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I was trying this with a knife before... so thank God for pill crushers!</li>
            <li> Prefer this pill crusher over the other (Lgs. Pill Crusher Ea (1 Ea) by Pill Crusher) because of the design. They function identically, I bought both.  I found it much easier to screw and grind the pills with this one because of the 3 leaf handle as opposed to the two twist knobs of the other brand.  When crushing several pills I had to loosen the vice, then shake the contents to re-adjust their position and then tighten the vice /crusher again.  This was a simple procedure that is easy to repeat and thoroughly crushes the pills. Once again, the style of handle on this one makes it easy to tighten and loosen. The powdered pills are then easily mixed in apple sauce or something similar for easy ingestion. LOL! This is to be used for good...not evil!  5 stars!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to use two spoons.</li>
            <li> This little pill crusher is GREAT!  It does the job it&#x27;s advertise to do compared to others on the market. The design for grip &amp; turning is well thought out and makes the crushing very easy.  I bought 2... and gave one to another family member who also loves this product.</li>
            <li> I bought one of the crappy plastic ones and used it for a year and it broke and never really crushed the pills to powder, just more tiny chunks. This thing actually pulverizes the pill into fine powder. Simply great and the screws on the outside, so you don&#x27;t get powder cakes into the part of the device that has threads where it crushes.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher does a good job.  The bottom section needs to have some kind of rubber or other covering - it digs in to the hand when turning. I just use a towel which works fine.</li>
            <li> Annihilate those pills with just one compression; this crusher means business and yields a very fine powder. The picture/description doesn&#x27;t show it, but the bottom is conical, so the dust gathers in the center if you tap it on the table, which I absolutely love. If only it had a cutter as well, it would truly be a marvel.</li>
            <li> Within two days of ordering, it arrived.  I was impressed by this but even more impressed when I used it to crush some food for my tropical fish.  I need to crush some shrimp and other fish foods for my baby fish. It worked perfectly. I can adjust how fine I wish to crush the foods.  It is big enough that you can get a good grip on it and the threads work quickly when opening and closing.  I highly recommend this to anyone that needs to crush something.</li>
            <li> I literally just got this in the mail no more than 15 minutes ago and I already love it. This product absolutely gets the job done. It&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s effective and I think people of many different strengths can use it. You unscrew it, pop the pill(s) in and rescrew it back on. It&#x27;s honestly as simple and easy as that. I&#x27;ve been attempting to swallow pills since I was diagnosed with ARD and, honey, you&#x27;d think I had a straw of a throat. I just can&#x27;t do it. So by crushing pills, I am better able to control my ailments. Truly a blessing. 5 star product!</li>
            <li> Works GREAT for pulverizing the famotadine that I have to mix in my cats&#x27; food.  The only negative I have with this product is that the bottom handle is not grippy like the top, and with the hard turns you have to give occasionally in crushing a pill, it will sometimes dig into your hand.  However, it&#x27;s definitely a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> good. It is exactly what I was looking for in order to crush pills. Crushes to powder and is easy to twist down to crush the pills.</li>
            <li> this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of pill crushers-including a hammer...always hoping that the next one would be the best. I re&#x27;cd this one quickly, and it simply cannot pulverize my mom&#x27;s pills. I was so bummed...but, I did read a review (and I so wish I could find it) about a man who used a coffee grinder to crush all his mom&#x27;s pills. So-I thought I would try it too. I ordered the \\&quot;[[ASIN:B00004SPEU Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black]]\\&quot; from Amazon, and just recieved it. AMAZING! I did six pills at a time w/ no splitting and in less then 15 seconds...have pulverized pills. The grinder does cost $20, but so well worth it. If you do order it---after you have pulverized your pills, let it rest for a minute so all the \\&quot;pill-dust\\&quot; will settle. Truly, worth the $20!!!! And thanks to the reviewer who suggested this! :)  [[ASIN:B00004SPEU Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black]]</li>
            <li> I bought one locally and works GREAT!!! Now I am trying remember where I got it and can&#x27;t find it locally. I am wanting to buy a second one as a backup and to take while traveling. I had tried others and most don&#x27;t even work. Buy this one and forget about the rest! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Pulverizes pills easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to pulverize my Dog&#x27;s chewable tablets which is then sprinkled on her food.  Works excellent and because there is no blades or metal grater, their is little concern of losing a large % of the pill volume.  It cleans nicely and is much bigger than I expected, around 3 inches in diameter, easy to grip and the blue color portion is a soft touch rubberized plastic which is easy on the hands.  They probably could have added this feature on the bottom half, but they didn&#x27;t and I have not found it to be uncomfortable.  Harder pills made to dissolve, might cause issues as others have noted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma to help her take her pills easier. She LOVED it. Great product. Shipped quickly and got here as described.</li>
            <li> This little device is able to easily, EASILY crush a large pill into mostly powder and a few tiny pieces. Good enough for me. The price is super-cheap too, considering how effective it is.    You&#x27;ve probably been warned about this before, but make sure your pill is safe to take after crushing. Some will say on the bottle, \\&quot;Do not crush or chew.\\&quot; I think they mean it.</li>
            <li> I have to give my cat medication and have found it easiest to crush the pills and put in his food. I was crushing the pills in a spoon and it wasn&#x27;t exactly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little crusher works wonders! It&#x27;s so easy to use, just twist and you&#x27;re done. I am able to crush all four pills at once. Any powder left in the crusher comes out easily with a tap. It&#x27;s also nice because it won&#x27;t dull or wear out (I think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
            <li> This item works well for small pills but it is difficult to grind larger pills  Crushing larger pills requires holding the sharp edges of the bottom and applying a fair amount of pressure to turn the top.  I regret purchasing this because it kills my hands.</li>
            <li> Good thing to crush Tibet pills. I use it every day. No complaints, exept one - it is not enough convinient to bear it in hand when crushing.</li>
            <li> It works but you must work at it. It&#x27;s good for travel and cleans easilly. Yes I would recommend it because it is helpful in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I work at a elementary school and must dispense a \\&quot;horse pill\\&quot;  2 or 3 times daily to a kindergartner who cannot swallow pills.  The pill must be crushed to a powder so it can be mixed in with applesauce and fed to her.  This crusher does a fairly good job.  It crushes the pill into small pieces which would likely be adequate if it is to be dissolved into liquid, but I need to continually loosen and again tighten the top to repeatedly crush it.  Considering the reasonable cost, I am very happy with it since many crushers are much more expensive or, if cheaper, much less durable. I find that if I continually tighten, loosen, shake the contents, tighten again and repeat it works well.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen:    We have used many Pill Crushers on a daily basis.  Most of these cross thread, and are useless, however, this Pill Crusher is excellent, and pulverizes even the hardest pill.    Just as a mater of caution in order for a life time of any crusher, it is best to cut up the hard pills in a Pill Splitter, but if need be this Crusher will crush the hardest pill.    Always follow the directions as supplied with the Crusher!    Best regards,    John Younger</li>
            <li> Works really good, easy to use too.</li>
            <li> I think the bottom should be made more like the top. As it is, it is uncomfortable on your hand. You can&#x27;t get the same grip on the bottom as you do on the top. I have to use a towel or something like that to get a better, less painful grip. The clear plastic cuts into your hand otherwise. Besides that, it&#x27;s a really great crusher. Like it better than the one from Walmart.</li>
            <li> Just as I hoped!  I take different medicines every day including a huge antibiotic pill and I was tired of cutting it with scissors until it was small enough to swallow with pudding.  With this pill crusher and the Apex Ultra Pill Splitter it made my morning routine so, so much easier I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product or the splitter!  I used the pill splitter first to cut it and then crushed it into little pieces to swallow. So happy and satisfied with my purchase!!  The great thing about this pill crusher is that the grooves are on the outside so the pill dust doesn&#x27;t accumulate in them.</li>
            <li> It did seem to crush the pills pretty well. The only issue I have personally is that the powder seems to get stuck to the top, so I have to remove it with my fingers in order to get it into the drink I intend to mix the powder with. But other than that, it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Had jaw surgery a year ago and had to crush all my vitamins and medicines.  This was a life saver.  Works as advertised and you don&#x27;t even need a lot of strength to use it.</li>
            <li> I had been using a mortar and pestle to crush my cat&#x27;s pills but wanted something smaller and more portable, since the mortar and pestle is heavy and bulky. This pill crusher turned out to be a very pleasant surprise and works perfectly. It&#x27;s made of a thick and apparently durable plastic and the actual effort required to twist the device and crush the pills inside is very minimal. Crushing a pill into a fine powder is quick and almost effortless compared to using the mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Makes powder out of the hardest tablet.  Designed so that even those with arthritis can use.</li>
            <li> I had a sore throat and really couldn&#x27;t swallow my antibiotics. This thing allowed me to take them! I&#x27;ve had a couple of threaded pill crushers and they just didn&#x27;t work. I have NO upper body strength at all, and I was able to use this pill crusher easily! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Delivered before I would have expected it and works like a charm.  You can save a lot of money using this product and all of the medication is saved, nothing wasted.</li>
            <li> I crush a lot of pills as my small dog has to take pills every day and they have to be crushed so that I can hide them in his food.  This pill crusher is excellent.  It actually crushes the pills (don&#x27;t do more than about 3 at a time, I do 3 aspirin at a time) and you can \\&quot;unscrew\\&quot; the crusher and shake around the pills and re-crush if they need it. As one other person recommended, you will need a hot pad or washrag to help hold the bottom of the crusher as they have not rounded off the edges quite enough and you will need a small cushion to pad your hand --- this is no problem. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We use this to crush supplement tablets for our dogs. Easy to use and does a great job. You don;t have to be strong at all to use this.</li>
            <li> Best pill crusher I have ever used.  Bought it to crush pills for a senior dog and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Fits my huge multivitamin!</li>
            <li> This pill crusher works great. It really does \\&quot;pulverize\\&quot; the pill so that the result is fine granules that are easy to swallow or add to liquid.  I have had no problems with the base injuring my hand.  Very satisfied especially after considering the price.</li>
            <li> I like the way it crushers medicine and that part does really well and it is not hard to crush medicine, when holding the bottom of the crusher you might need to use a towel so the bottom will not hurt your hand if you are crushing a lot of medicine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this little thing would crush pills every well, and I was WRONG.  I am new to healthcare giving, and my mom is on a lot of medicine that has to be givin by her peg.  This is the best pill crusher that we have used.  I would definately purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product.  This product crushes tablets down to a very fine powder with little effort.  It may not be obvious from the photo, but the white &amp; blue knob screws into the lower clear cup.  With each screwing movement, the tablet is crushed.  The knob is large and rubberized to make it user friendly, possibly even for arthritic hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a marble mortar &amp; pestle at home for my previous crushing jobs, but this works better and is easier to transfer the powder to a syringe to mix with water.  With the mortar &amp; pestle, I sometimes ended up with tablet coating that was not well crushed, but that has not been an issue here.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought htis since we have two dogs that need medicine mixed into their food at meals.  It works good, I just wish it crushed them a little finer.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, very easy to use and crushes pills with very little effort. It is a little bulky, but I think that is to allow more leverage when turning the handle.</li>
            <li> Great Product/Wonderful Seller</li>
            <li> I have mild arthritis in my fingers with constant pain, some swelling and decreased ability to grip in some fingers but with full range of mobility in all fingers still.  The CM pill crusher has been the best crusher I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s easy to hold the crushing chamber in my left hand and turn the crusher top part with my right and the little blue covers on the 3 corners help me hold on to the top and turn it easily.  The 3 bottom feet help too, though I do wish they were covered with the blue covers also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another to have as backup as I have dropped the current one I have a few times.  It is well constructed and hasn&#x27;t broken yet!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This little thing gets the job done and quick. Clean up is super easy, and the little hidden compartment is a nice feature. Would definitely recommend to anyone in need of crushing pills.</li>
            <li> Great product!  With literally a \\&quot;turn of the screw\\&quot;, this pulverizer is highly effective.  Crushes pills well and plastic cup catches all the powder.  Very inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> I always think that metal versions would work better but this thing is perfect. Just wish it came with a little brush so you can get it all out. Otherwise it crushes every type of pill I have, vitamins, prescription, and for my doggie. Highly recommend unless you wanna drop close to $100 on a pro metal crusher. Otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money on a $20-30 crusher that is steel and does the job half as well.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent Pill crusher or pulverizer.  My husband has a feeding tube that requires his pills to be totally crushed, and the Ultra Pill Crusher does the job.  My only complant is that my hands get sore because of the shape of the bottom of the crusher.  However, I have a large number of pills to pulverize, so most individuals may not have this problem.</li>
            <li> This is one of the manual best pill grinders I&#x27;ve used.  It does a great job of turning most pills of brittle to medium/hard self-consistency into a semi-fine powder.  This will likely meet your needs.  You may still want to chop the byproduct with a razor depending on the pill or how you would like it ground up, sometimes you have really got to crank hard, so not recommended for hard type pills when mixed with  the elderly or weak armed individual.  It even has a very small hidden top pill compartment for storing your daily dosage, or pills on the go.      So far, this has been my favourite manual pill grinder, and often I do not need to chop it any further, although sometimes the filler gets caked all over the inside of the grinder, and tedious scraping is the only way to get it out, thus the reason for the 4/5.       ****Bottom Line****:    If mine were to break today by my own doing, I would repurchase the same one, or consider buying an electric pill grinder, but this is just so much more portable..</li>
            <li> works great, dust any pill</li>
            <li> Love this pill crusher but the rubber edges eventually come off requiring you to purchase another if you&#x27;re hand strength isn&#x27;t great or you have tender skin.</li>
            <li> good for small pills acouple  not for big ones</li>
            <li> This really hurts to turn with pills in it!  My husband even thinks so, so it isn&#x27;t just me!</li>
            <li> I bought this to crush up pills for my dog an it works wonders, was impressed with this for real</li>
            <li> actually crushes pills, which many of the ones you buy at drug stores don&#x27;t seem to be able to do.</li>
            <li> Ok for partially crushing overly large supplements</li>
            <li> My co-workers and I in my hospital unit all think the crusher works just fine and we like the grip you can get on the top because it isn&#x27;t just  &lt;br /&gt;round. Only drawback is that the base edges are kind of sharp as most of us hold it in our hands while we are crushing meds.</li>
            <li> Excellent crusher. Crushes the hardest pills.</li>
            <li> best inexpensive pill crusher I  have ever used.  Easyer to grip, sturdy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> A very good and decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does its job well and is a nice buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to people to buy.</li>
            <li> You place your pill in and turn. Want it a little more \\&quot;fine\\&quot;?  Just turn slightly counter-clockwise, shake up and down a few times and turn clockwise again. It&#x27;s very simple and I&#x27;m trying to figure out why I chose to struggle with a hammer for so long. I take a lot of Nootropics for study, and wanted to negate the time-release of some of them (which requires a simple break of the pill), but also wanted to make them easier to ingest since taking pills orally can be a bit difficult for me sometimes; and this works perfectly for that. I received it in a small, clear bag with a barcoded label, which I appreciated. Not a fan of paying for packaging. The reviewing community came through for me again. Great purchase. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and had no problem crushing my tablets with this. The only issue is scraping out the tablet, sometimes it stuck to the sides making it hard to eat all of it.</li>
            <li> I had to crush everything after some surgery I had last year.  It was very easy to use and had no problems crushing the heck out of whatever pill I put in there...</li>
            <li> Crushes and powders pills well.  very easy to clean and decontaminate with rubbing alcohol.  Very good price, very good price.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job of crushing. It will do whole small pills pretty easily. The top part is gentle on the hand to grasp and turn, but the bottom part is sharp-edged and tough on the hands. I always get a towel to grab the bottom half and use it that way.</li>
            <li> After surgery I had to crush my medicines so I could swallow them for several months... This little gadget really works well.  Sometimes a bit of the pill would be crushed against the bottom of the container and be a wee bit difficult to get loose but not that big a deal... I definitely appreciated it.</li>
            <li> So easy to use no muscle strength required. Easy clean up also</li>
            <li> Finally, a pill crusher that works amazingly well, and comes at a great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product all around easy to use and includes a little storage area underneath blue cap on the top of the item.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very simple to use, just place the pills inside and twist the cap on. I use it to crush 2 medium sized pills.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a small storage place on the top.</li>
            <li> I have a 12 year old, g-tube dependant daughter who requires three doses of anticonvulsant per day. I just bought another one of these pill crushers since the one we have now is over three years old &amp; I wanted to have a spare for when it finally bites the dust. The bottom of this crusher has a cone type shape that is mirrored on the oposite side. This is not only highly effective for crushing (especially with a twisting back and forth motion), but also lends itself well to mixing the powdered meds with water and pulling up into a syringe. If you stir and keep the tip of the syringe at the point of the cone, you can pull up almost every last bit of the powder! Best pill crusher I&#x27;ve found in 12 YEARS!</li>
            <li> Easy to operate. It crushes pills evenly and thoroughly and with little effort. I do not have problems with the threads on this pill crusher. It stays on track.</li>
            <li> If I just wanted to break a pill apart, this kind of works.  I find it takes so much effort that I went back to hitting pills with a hammer.  Then I bought a mortar &amp; pestle, because I actually need them ground down to a very fine powder so I can hide them in the cat&#x27;s food.  It does depend on what you want.</li>
            <li> We were having trouble getting our grandma to take her pills. After having to put them in her mouth for her and watch her struggle to swallow I wanted a better way for her to get the medicine she needed. Put the pill in and turn and pills turn into a granular dust which is easily added to food or drink. It is quick, easy, and gives us peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Best Pill Crusher I have</li>
            <li> Good product, just a little messy trying to get the powder out</li>
            <li> I have trouble with pills and this handy pill crusher works great.  I do wish the plastic bottom was made of a smoother material, but maybe it has to be that way in order to grasp it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on positive reviews on Amazon, but I was disappointed in the product.  The design of the pill crusher has some pluses, with the top being easy to grip and turn, and it may work okay to crush two or three pills, but it doesn&#x27;t work well to crush a number of pills and especially not large vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the element that pushes down on the pills, so you can&#x27;t grind the pills by screwing the top.  You have to depend on the brute force to smash the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it did not work as well as my old crusher, which both crushed and ground (if necessary). This item didn&#x27;t fully crush the pills, so they did not dissolve in orange juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an inexpensive item, and may work okay if you just need to crush a pill or two, but I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> The top of the crusher is nicely protected with soft coating, but they should have done the same for the bottom.  I always have to use a towel on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t tear my hand apart.</li>
            <li> My daughter cannot swallow pills. I bought this and it crushes them well, enough for her to swallow. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This little guy gets the job done really well. I like that it&#x27;s simple and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because many of my medications are now difficult to swallow whole, I am undergoing chemo-therapy and one of the side effects is a sore throat and swelling.  I can now \\&quot;crush\\&quot; my larger items, mix them in with an oatmeal breakfast, and stay on my plan.  I didn&#x27;t find the \\&quot;crushing\\&quot; action that difficult for my arthritic hands, although it may be for some.  By gripping both top and bottom I have no problems crushing the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would also be advantageous for parents who need to get pills into balky kids, mix &#x27;em in with a favorite \\&quot;treat\\&quot;.  I can also see it as useful for pet owners when dogs and cats are troublesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CCW.</li>
            <li> One needs a proper grinder like a salt grinder for such pills. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  Perhaps one should use a grinder that has sharp edges.</li>
            <li> We have a lovable dog who has been part of our family for 14 years. She takes daily medication for joint pain (½ aspirin 2X/day, ½ glucosamine tablet) and a nervous condition (1 meclizine tablet). To avoid stomach problems, our vet advised to grind the medication and mix it with her food. We had been crushing the tablets with a wooden kitchen mallet, which was a real chore, but then found this pill crusher. It made pill crushing so much easier and convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pill crusher has a simple but rugged design that fits comfortably in your hands during use. The pill crusher has two parts, a clear plastic crushing chamber that is threaded on the outside and a crushing handle that is made from a high-density (hard) polypropylene. You simply put the pill(s) inside the crushing chamber and turn the crushing handle until you crush the pills to the desired consistency. The crushing chamber has smooth walls so the crushed pills are not trapped in any tiny crevices, but sometimes a film of fine powder will cling to the sides of the crushing chamber; we found this powder film to be the case when crushing the aspirin tablets to a powder. We crush our dog&#x27;s pills to a more granular texture, but you can turn the crushing handle to turn the pills into a fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated earlier, our only concern with this device is when you turn a pill into a powder, some of that powder clings as a film to the sides of the crushing chamber so you will not get the full dose of your medication; we estimate that up to 5% of your pill may cling to the crushing container wall as a fine powder film. Other than this concern, we found this to be an excellent product that should give you long-term use. We have added some photos to illustrate the points of our review.</li>
            <li> VERY rough on your hands to hold it.  Bottom plastic is kinda sharp, and is hard to hold on to.  Great pill crusher though, completely pulverizes tablets.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d ordered this a long time ago.  I was using a spatula in a bowl to crush my dog&#x27;s pills, but this is so much easier.  It takes no time or effort to crush pills (one or many) to smithereens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This item sounded good but have fallen short for my purpose.  I got it to crush rather large glucocimine, chondroitin tabs (that are fairly soft) because my dogs leave them in their bowl . I tried to crush 2 pills at once but the &amp;#34;crusher only broke them where the pills were scored.  It even ha trouble crushing one kill at a time, requiring me to back off the screw down top shake and try to crush again. It never truly pulverized the kill. Frankly, i found that a good size pair of lineman&#x27;s pliers made short work of the 4 pills, turning each into powder with one squeeze. Much simpler and less work than all the scewing and unscrewing.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the product.  I would recommend it to others.  It&#x27;s not bulky or hard to use.  It also cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> I take care of my invalid mother-in-law and go through pill crushers like crazy.  I LIKE this pill crusher but wish the bottom was the same as the top.  It cuts into my hand and with arthritis, it is painful to use.  I went back to my old pill crusher.</li>
            <li> Nice product but it didn&#x27;t work well with the pills I was attempting to crush.  Maybe with a smaller, more fragile pill it might work.  I gave mine away.</li>
            <li> Works well,not for me but all is good.Go Amazon JEFF</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pleased with results.</li>
            <li> Bought it to grind pills for finicky dogs. Works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago, and I use it twice a day for my daughter who takes 3 large and hard pills day and night.  It is made with quality material and it makes pill crushing so easy and effortless!  The crusher works just as beautifully as when it was brand new.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This works well but it rips your hand up as you hold it and the bottom has no rubber grip which makes it uncomfortable to hold and crush.</li>
            <li> My eighty year old mother has a cat that takes medicine every day. She has to crush a little pill and mix it in the cat food. This little gadget works great for her. She is able to crush a very tiny pill without any problems!</li>
            <li> BEST ONE I&#x27;VE USED!  ALSO ERGONAMIC.  BOUGHT ANOTHER FOR A GIFT.</li>
            <li> This is a great pill crusher.  I&#x27;ve used several and this one really seems to do the trick.  Surprised me.  The pointed tip at the end of the top part of the pill crusher is the trick.  It crushes the pill into a powder usually on the first try.  I&#x27;m crushing a REALLY hard pill - cat medicine - vitamin-ish - no coating.  Softer pills will be a piece of cake.  I recommend this one, definitely.</li>
            <li> For a plastic pill crusher, I didn&#x27;t expect too much.  We had a sick dog that we needed to crush pills for.  She didn&#x27;t like to take pills, in any form, so we got this in the hopes that we could crush her medication and put it in peanut butter, or something similar, to trick her into taking the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works....if you have large pills you might need to crush the pills, open the lid, then crush them a second time to get them to a powder consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend...it&#x27;s paid for itself over and over several times.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher works well, is made well, and is larger than expected.  With both pieces put together it is about the size of a child&#x27;s fist. I would definitely buy this again. I have one at work and one at home, as I have to take several large pills throughout the day, and this makes it so easy to take these supplements I really need to stay healthy.  When these pills are crushed I know my body is getting the full benefit of the supplements since they are so much more digestible taken in crushed form.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. Depending on how far you turn the top, you can get various sizes of crumbs or if you turn it all the way, you get a nice fine dust. I use this for my dog&#x27;s glucosamine and oral flea meds because he won&#x27;t take them whole. I&#x27;ve since told anyone I know who has the same issue about this. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Small (easily portable), easy to use, and works very well to crush pills. Perfect for what I was needing it for.</li>
            <li> I am about to have bariatric surgery and won&#x27;t be able to swallow my fairly large metformin medication -- a diabetes drug. This pill crusher pulverizes the pill, I add it to a protein shake and don&#x27;t evennotice it.</li>
            <li> This crusher works ok however, if your hands or wrists are week or painful, you need to get something that does not stress your anatomy.</li>
            <li> I think this product works better on different types of pills. I wanted to use it on an Excedrin. Despite&lt;br /&gt;several turns and repositioning, it only resulted in mini jagged boulders. I make multiple attempts but just didn&#x27;t get what I had hoped. Perhaps a Tylenol product, would work better since it&#x27;s a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  As described!!</li>
            <li> Handle broke off after three times of routine use.</li>
            <li> Does crush pills well, even hard ones, but the design for the bottom, which looks great for griping, is really hard on your bottom hand!</li>
            <li> Short and sweet,,,,,this device works and works well.  Heavy duty construction but simple to operate.  Light weight and well designed.</li>
            <li> We have a dog that needs to have pills for allergies. I thought this little twist crusher may be the answer to crushing pills every day for our dog. Previously we were using a D-Size battery to crush the pills. This little gadget is ok, in that in does crash the pills, but you need to apply a generous amount of twisting pressure to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, I&#x27;m still looking for an easier pill-crusher</li>
            <li> pulverizer is the right word.&lt;br /&gt;the bottom should be as easy to grip as the top&lt;br /&gt;but works well&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend who has severe arthritis and was unable to use several other pill crushers. He said that he was able to use this one without difficulty, and asked me to buy him a few more of them.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher works amazing turns the pills into dust.</li>
            <li> Kinda always thought all pill crushers were the same. NOT! A friend recommended this and it is absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> This pill crusher makes an everyday chore so much quicker and easier. I was using the back of a spoon to crush a half of Zyrtec  for my cats allergies.  This make it more uniform sizes of powder, which I sprinkle in his food.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible! It didn&#x27;t work from the start! I wish I never bought it. Not even worth returning! Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Our aging Saint Bernard requires medication with every meal, and we found chopping up the pill time consuming. This pill crusher is a dream and makes the process so easy. It doesn&#x27;t require much force and the wide blue nodes are easy to grip. Sometimes the pill gets caught sideways but a quick shake and it flattens out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would note is that the product did not come in a box, rather a plastic bag with an amazon bar code on it. Not a big concern for us but would have been if a gift.</li>
            <li> Works fine - even on some of the hardest pills.  Also use the mortar and pestle to get the remaining pieces that need to be made into powder to incorporate into a protein drink.  GOOD PRODUCT !</li>
            <li> This crusher is okay and just okay....  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;Pulverizer&#x27; by no means because this is misleading.  A true &amp;#34;pulverizer&amp;#34; is one that in one good turn will crush the pill into fine powder.  This one functions just like the one I just trashed.  It takes several times of loosening and tightening to get it to a fine powder and the powder sticks to the top.  I can also see a real problem if used by a senior because the part that you hold in your hand which holds the pill is not comfortable at all on your hand.  Soft grips is needed so that this is a comfortable device for all ages to use.  Granted I am not a senior but I can not help but notice the hard rough plastic as I am using the device.  The design is a slight improvement to the one I trashed because of the thread location.  I also think that the bowl coming to a point is a plus compared to the flat bottom container that the other one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to invent one of these for all ages to use and work properly because its really a simple design that manufacturer&#x27;s  seem to struggle with getting it perfect.</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these products and only received one in the mail. Had to go through the hassle of getting ahold of the company to try to get the other one that I paid for already.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to crush pills for my dog. It works great and even has room in the handle to hold whole pills. The top and bottom handle areas are easy to grip. The plastic on the bottom is a bit thin, otherwise I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher works great for crushing glucosamine pills for my Golden Retriever which I mix in her food daily.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I read all the good reviews and bought.  Some had remarked on how comfortable it is to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...the top portion is comfy, where the blue rubber pieces are.  However, the bottom piece that you have to grip with the other hand, has very sharp edges and hurts my hand.  I do not have problems with my hands...no arthritis of any kind...it is that the edges are quite sharp!  Why they did not just make the bottom the same as the top is something that I cannot understand.  That would have made it ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing of note....is that it will not crush more than one pill and barely will crush one large vitamin.  Even with the one, I have to re-do it about 4-5 times, shaking the crushed pill around between crushings in order to get it all crushed up to even-sized small particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that there must be a better pill crusher out there.  I cannot recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This grinder goes all the way to touch the bottom. It also has many threads so it goes down slowly and very controlled. It has no rough bumps which never allow the pills to turn to a fine powder and I always end up cleaning those with an old tooth brush. That costs me medication that is very expensive and also the lack of fine grind makes it harder to dissolve in liquid of my choice. Over 18 years of disability I have broken more pills splitters and grinders due to their cheap design and construction. I have only used this once but it has everything going for it. It is clear so I can see what is happening and it smashes slowly into a fine powder and the handles are rubberized to protect my hands and the design gives me great leverage to twist down, I have only used once and it worked well. I will update if something changes. For now it is a clean recommend. Great design, good job, Carex.  PLEASE comment on my reviews, positive or negative, so I can improve.THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to swallow currently due to medical issues. Still hurt when crushed by hand, so gave this a try, now a very fine power and mix with a drink and medicine is taken as needed!</li>
            <li> there is not really very much more you can say about a product like this. design works and it&#x27;s cheap enough to have several to avoid cross-contamination of meds</li>
            <li> I use mine to crush supplements for my pets to add to their food.  I&#x27;m very happy with the item.</li>
            <li> My Mom is 84 and is confused swallowing pills. I crush her medicine and supplements and stir into cinnamon applesauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medicine is typically a much softer pill than supplements and smaller. I can powder 4 pills including a low dose aspirin with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements tend to be large and hard. As a result crushing even one whole pill usually creates so much powder as it is twisted, parts of the pill are cushioned and do not powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I have learned to get a very satisfactory powder of supplements.............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Split pills larger than a Tic-Tac in half with a pill cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Place glove or two socks on the hand holding the base to prevent sore hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place the pill (one half of a cut pill) flat on the bottom pushed to one side (not in the middle).&lt;br /&gt;Keep the crusher tilted slightly to the side.&lt;br /&gt;Twist down until it no longer turns (there is an initial resistance until the pill fractures the first time).&lt;br /&gt;Twist back the thickness of one finger and turn back hard again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are no longer getting a little more twist down; look at the clear bottom of the crusher;&lt;br /&gt;The pill should be evenly spread on bottom;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise twist back and forth some more.............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives a good powder except for some pill skins. These skins just are not made to powder.&lt;br /&gt;In applesauce for a few minutes pill skins are softened and not an issue for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soft and well made as the crusher top is; the bottom is wicked on the hand thus only two stars for this unwise, reckless and bizarre manufacturing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all takes more time but I have a [[ASIN:B000VSXDQY Silent Knight Pill Crusher]] that can crush a lot of pills at once but leaves large bits. I&#x27;ll keep it for backup (it also does a humane but wicked job on those ticks - insert squashed tick emoticon here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** edit - I have reduced to one star. After a month using it twice a dayit is causing callouses even with gloves.</li>
            <li> I wanted to crush several large pills at once -- did not work -- only one at a time.  And maybe my pills are hard, but it takes a lot of force in turning the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting a mortar and pestle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because it works for what it does, but not for what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li> I wish the bottom half was as easy on the hands as the top half. Otherwise it&#x27;s a very useful product when I need to take very large pills.</li>
            <li> Greatest gadget I ever bought. Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner. It is so much easier to crush pills than using a spoon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s grandmother and it works great. She has rheumatoid arthritis and is still able to use it to crush her pills.</li>
            <li> I use this to crush pills for my pets. It works great for one and lousy for the other.  I think the problem with the one is that it has a coating that makes crushing difficult.  I end up having to mortar and pestle the remaining chunks.  Otherwise this crusher is great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the best job, I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li> Not easy to use and it hurts your hands--not the top part with the blue but the bottom part.  It didn&#x27;t come with instructions and maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but I replaced another version of pill crusher because it was worn out and it&#x27;s still easier to use than this one.</li>
            <li> My husband has a time crushing worm pill for our finicky dogs with spoon or fork.  So I looked on Amazon for a solution and found this.  This works great except we have to use our fingers to scrape out every particle.  I see no solution to that.  I have a time swallowing pills myself so I will be using it too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would grind pills into a dust.  This leaves the pills in small chunks.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and has lasted over a year.  Much easier to twist than other crushers I have used.</li>
            <li> Easiest way to crush pills besides a pestle and mortar. I wish they had rubber on both sides, though, gripping the plastic kind of hurts after a while. It is cheap, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Everything ordered was shipped on-time, as well as delivered on time. This pulverizes, not just &amp;#34;crushes&amp;#34;. Brings what you need actually down to a fine powder. Would not recommend to someone with weak hands though. Made of tough durable material, could not fore-see this ever breaking.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I&#x27;m grinding up large pills for my dog and one of the previous reviewers was right in saying you won&#x27;t get a fine powder. So I do a first crush, then open the top a bit, shake it up so it settles at the bottom of the well, retighten and crush. It&#x27;s fine enough for my use.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and have to crush medications for patients very often. This worked like a charm at first but then after continued use, I found that the powder (from the crushed medications) would somehow get on the outer side of the threads so I would lose a lot of the medications when I poured the them into a medicine cup. Now I&#x27;m using a different pill crusher. This is pricey too.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little gadget, it does not take up much room, and most of the time I am very pleased with the way it works, easy to use. There is 1 vitamen tab that it does not crush very well, that might be because I try to crush 5 at a time.  This was very reasonably priced. Here is a tip, make sure this little crusher is absolutely dry before you crush anything in it.</li>
            <li> This is only effective for smaller pills - but not for anything like a multi-vitamin.  I took thje advice of another reviewer and bought the \\&quot;Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black\\&quot; from Amazon. Great device! I did six pills at a time with no splitting and in less then 15 seconds you have pulverized pills. The grinder does cost $20, but is well worth it. [Note that after you have pulverized your pills, let it rest for a minute so all the \\&quot;pill-dust\\&quot; will settle].</li>
            <li> Buy this and you&#x27;ll never need another.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever found. It&#x27;s easy to use even with arthritis and when you&#x27;re in extreme pain.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable on the hands</li>
            <li> Our 16 year old cat takes five pills a day, and this finally allows me to give him pills without stress. It really does pulverize the pills so I can put them in his food and he eats them unknowingly. The ones from our local stores were worthless because he would eat around the tiny pieces!</li>
            <li> If you need your pills crushed, this is the crusher for you. Easily crushes pills down to powder. To get a fine powder with no lumps simply unscrew the cap a turn or two, shake the contents a little for even distribution and then toggle back and forth.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Couldn&#x27;t do it any other way. Well made, easy to clean, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really crush up my anavite pills very well - not even if I put them in one at a time.</li>
            <li> This product came as described and worked perfectly. I consider all factors when ordering including quality, price and company reputation. This product passed all. I can recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it is still going strong! It crushes pills effortlessly and works easier than I expected. Love it.</li>
            <li> I need to crush over a dozen pills a day to put into a peg tube for my wife.  This does the job thoroughly and easily.  I glued a large rubber band around the bottom section to keep the sharp edges from cutting into my hand.  If I were to redesign this I&#x27;d put the same rubber moldings on the top section on the bottom section as well.  But it works so well, I give it 5 stars anyway.</li>
            <li> I was using two table spoons to crush ball pills which frequently just launched them across the room. Whoever designed this used the minimum material and perfect design to accomplish the purpose.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest thing to use. Beats chopping pills up with a knife. You just screw the top down and the pills become a fine powder.</li>
            <li> I have alot of problems with my hands and found this to be the best one I&#x27;ve ever used,I bought two thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hold up,was I wrong. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the base, I use a face cloth so it doesn&#x27;t cut up my hands. A great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Carex Pill Crusher to crush big calcium pills.  It does a really nice job but you do have to work at it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the routine;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Tighten the unit down till the pill starts to break up (You can see it via the transparent bottom).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Loosen it up a bit&lt;br /&gt;3.  Shake the unit a bit to re-position the pill&lt;br /&gt;4.  Re-tighten and crush again.&lt;br /&gt;Repeat steps 2,3 &amp; 4 a couple of times until you have a powered pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the pill positioned correctly and crushing in steps is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is fairly large and fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Downside;  The transparent part of the unit is shaped in a way that hurts your hand a bit when you tighten it - hence the &amp;#34;repeat steps 2,3 &amp;4&amp;#34; routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the unit.  It works well and is not difficult to use..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product for long, but so far it has been great! It works fast and easy. It does a great job. You can crush the pill to very small pieces or just break it up some. Anyway you want.  I hold it just right in my hand so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt. But as others here have said you can use a cloth or something to hold it in your hand if needed.    I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs or wants to crush up their pills. It&#x27;s inexpensive and it works great!      UPDATE: I have had this for almost a year now. I still use it often and it doesn&#x27;t show any signs of wear. It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have bought and reviewed many a pill crusher as my son has a multiple-pill-a-day regimine and is tube fed. This crusher, by FAR, has been our favorite. it pulverizes even the toughest, hardest pills into fine granules than can be flushed easily through an Ng tube. I would highly, highly recommend this for anyone tube fed. works great. The only way it could be better is to have a compartment for pill storage, making it travel friendly.</li>
            <li> For me this is the best of the three I have tried. The design is great and the large vitamins and calcium pulverize well in just a few turns. It is easy to hold and has a big compartment to shake up and recrush for finer pieces. Only sad part is there is not a compartment to hold pills but I will work around that. This one is by far the best. The Duramed red and clear pill crusher does not compare to this one in quality but it has a storage. The other one I bought is a smaller rectangle one that has a cutter on top and the crusher in the bottom. I like the cutter but the crusher is not that great either.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher it easy to use, just a slight turn and pills are crushed.  It&#x27;s also small enough to take along during trips so that taking pills will never be a problem. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Can&#x27;t swallow pills and have to crush them and put in food.  The little pill crusher works great.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher is easy to clean.  The one I previously owned was hard to clean and some of the pills got stuck inside.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.</li>
            <li> You have to have strong hands to really crank it down when you have a bunch of pills in. Breaking big pills in half first is helpful. I have to screw down, back up, give it a tap/shake, screw down again, repeat. I saw those heavier duty ones first hand in the hospital and it is clear they save a lot of time.</li>
            <li> It hurt my hands to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought Fit &amp; Healthy Tablet Splitter and Crusher from CVS store before and it was great, but after years of use. it finally broke, so I went on amazon and saw this one get fairly good reviews, so I ordered one, but it was very uncomfortable to use and it hurt my hands. i had to use a tower or something in order to use it. It was waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Just saw Fit &amp; Healthy Tablet Splitter and Crusher on Amazon. I&#x27;m gonna order one. Hope it&#x27;s the same quality as I ordered from CVS</li>
            <li> easy to use. just drop the pill in and turn. have to maybe unturn and turn again about 3-4 times to really crash pill</li>
            <li> This is easier to use with my arthritic thumbs.  It would be better though if the bottom had ribber coating like the top because you have to grip the bottom while turning the top.  It crushes the pills really good and can crush more than one t a time.</li>
            <li> Works but not great. Can&#x27;t crush too many an once, gets stuck if you put too many in. Messy. If you are trying to get pieces VERY small forget it. Doesn&#x27;t go down completely.</li>
            <li> does the job we needed</li>
            <li> This is a good device if you just want to break the pill up into smaller fragments, it is not a crusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Ergonomic design, easy to turn&lt;br /&gt;  Good material&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Breaks pills, does not crush</li>
            <li> It is very unfortunate but the way this is constructed, if you have tough pills the bottom piece is constructed very cheap and when I used it.... the pressure split the plastic and it sliced my hand open... I would NOT recommend this product... if someone who is a hemophiliac and older had something similar happen, they would have bled to death... talk about a lawsuit.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the money. It does the job for me  but a little rough on the hands and you have to do it a few times to get it crush it into a power.</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for my wrists! Carpel tunnel surgery several months ago. This crusher is sturdy and holding up well. It works great - plenty of space for crushing large tablets as well.</li>
            <li> Crushes pills nicely, but it does not take it down to power.. Needed a crusher to powderize to mix with liquid. Can not swallow the pill whole or even in thirds...</li>
            <li> This pill crusher has a very good design. It has lips on the top and bottom, allowing you to get lots of leverage to crush those hard pills. I only have a few complaints though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The bottom lips are a bit \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; to say, so you could scrape yourself if you&#x27;re not careful&lt;br /&gt;2) This crusher doesn&#x27;t actually \\&quot;pulverize\\&quot; pills as advertised. It crushes them effectively, but not into a powder.&lt;br /&gt;3) If you shake it while the crushed pill is inside, the pill powder will actually come out of the top a little bit. This is probably due to poor design around the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. It does it&#x27;s job. You just have to be a bit careful with it.</li>
            <li> Best crusher on the market without a doubt.  I tried some others and they did not work as well as this one. Very durable, good price too...</li>
            <li> This little crusher works very well, I crush my senior mothers pills to make it more easy for her to digest her medication,&lt;br /&gt;thanks Amizon for this very good item!!!</li>
            <li> This item works very well and is easy to use.  If you have problems with your hands, the shape of the top makes it easier to use than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Does everything needed to crush pills in every size and density.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but KILLS my hand holding the bottom part. It digs in and I feel like it&#x27;ll slice it open. I have to use a towel to hold the bottom with so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. Advertising that it&#x27;s ideal for people with limited strength is a joke.</li>
            <li> Does okay for a couple of pills at a time but it easily jams with more than two.</li>
            <li> The comments by others about the base hurting the hand is true. I solved the problem by tracing the base on a 1/4 thick piece of wood and cutting out the shape. Now the base of the pill crusher fits into the cutout and is easy to hold.  I will buy another when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve had several different models of pill crushers, this is the best.  The only thing I miss is this doesn&#x27;t have the ability to cut a pill in half which another one I used did, but this does an excellent job of pulverizing a pill; you don&#x27;t have to struggle with it.</li>
            <li> I have been stuck with several medical problems over time, and find myself taking quite a few medications. I use this pill pulverizer for personal use, and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. One thing I never saw anywhere in the description though, is that the blue on the cap, is actually a cover. The middle of this is empty and allows storage of several of my pills on the desk. I guess you could also stick a cleaning cloth in there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really crushes the pills almost immediately into a very fine powder, with no chunks at all. If this ever breaks, I will purchase the same exact thing. But it seems very sturdy, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this for different people, using different medications though, you might want to purchase several different ones as the crusher part might be difficult to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Tired of hearing my sister using a hammer to crush her pills.</li>
            <li> I found this works okay for larger pills but I am not able to crush the smaller pills that I need crushed also.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this product and all were positive, well they must&#x27;ve been crushing one pill at a time, I have to crush up all of my husbands meds 3 x&#x27;s a day even after spliting them and only crushing a few at a time this product did not crush the pills enough for him to safely swallow. Good thing I have one with teeth that actually works or I&#x27;d be using a hammer and pliers, I do not recomend this for safely crushing pills it just looks cool and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Great idea!!!  Such a small gadget, and a simple idea, and this one is made of hard plastic so it is durable and can crush some hard pills!!!  So easy and you wouldn&#x27;t think so at first.... love this gadget.  I bought 2!!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000KL1N3C Ultra Pill Crusher (Pulverizer) By Apex Medical]]  This is an excellent pill crusher.</li>
            <li> This crusher does the trick. I use it to crush some medication into a fine powder to be mixed into breastmilk for my baby. This crusher makes the medicine a fine powder which is easy to mix and administer through a 1.0 ml oral syringe without issue.</li>
            <li> This little pill crusher works GREAT, even on a very hard little pill the vet prescribed for my puppy!  I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> easy to use, crushes a pill well.</li>
            <li> Hard to really crush large tablets!</li>
            <li> It crushes pills but some of it stays on the plastic and there are lots of large pieces left that do not get crushed by this contraption.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but it takes a while to twist it open and closed.  Other than that it is able to crush a big supplement for me.</li>
            <li> This crushes my pills up nicely.  My only slight issue is that the screw section is too tall since I am only crushing one little pill.  But it works!</li>
            <li> My son has a G-Tube. I bought one of these when my other crusher broke. The top is comfortable to use but the bottom hurts my hands. They should have used the same material on the bottom. We had problems with the powdered medication getting stuck up inside the crusher and then in the plastic grooves that the top spins on. We couldn&#x27;t tell how much medication we were losing out of the crusher but it was a considerable amount. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.  K,loi Jim Kim, Kim kkj</li>
            <li> It works, what more can be said for an inexpensive crusher.  You do have to have patience screwing the top on and off, but no doubt that it works.</li>
            <li> I purchased the &#x27;other&#x27; pill crusher because it was cheaper and was highly disappointed (the internals weren&#x27;t sealed so when you washed it, it was near impossible to dry... pill powder + moisture is a bad thing). Anyhow, this pill crusher is much better. It doesn&#x27;t require much effort at all, and with a few twist crushes things. I put 3 large dog pills in it at a time with no problems. The best part is the base is one solid piece so there&#x27;s nowhere for moisture to get trapped. The shipping was fast - as it in arrived the same day as the other items that shipped 2 day with my prime membership.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t swallow pills.  Never have, still can&#x27;t.  I was looking for a good pill crusher because I was always making a mess crushing pills under spoons or other things.  I bought a couple of these for various places -- in my bathroom cabinet, in my car, at work.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple other models and this is my favorite.  It&#x27;s well designed, works perfectly, and the pill storage in the top is a nice feature.  I can divide my bottle of dye-free ibuprofen among my various duplicates of this and have everything all ready to go.  I&#x27;m 34, so I have no problem operating this, but I feel older, less capable persons wouldn&#x27;t have a problem using this model.  The design exerts a great deal of force on the pill chamber without having to screw it very tightly.  My only qualm with this is if you are storing pills inside this unit, it doesn&#x27;t have any sort of child safe lid, so I have to keep this away from my toddler to prevent any accidental ingestion.  I tape the lid shut just as a little piece of mind but it&#x27;s not a guaranteed preventative measure.  Overall, very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I was crushing up glucosamine pills for my dog to put in his food, this thing could do a couple at a time and did exactly what I wanted. good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s portable, but I stopped using it quite quickly.</li>
            <li> This worked better than the cup idea. My granddaughter did use this successfully and is planning on trying to take medication without help, when next she needs it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping</li>
            <li> All plastic simple object (which alone should not be dispositive), but this product does not (even) crush an average size vitamin. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was able to crush several pills together without twisting hard.  The clear bottom allow me to see that the pills have turned into powder without need to unscrew to examine like other models.  Always twist from the rubber top or place a tower over the bottom to make the work easy.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have waited as long to purchase this aptly-named item.  I use it to grind Pepcid tablets for my cat and with very little effort, it does indeed pulverize the tablets to a fine powder, which I then mix with a liquid base to administer to the kitty with a dropper.  And as an extra bonus, the crusher seems surprisingly sturdy and like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best pill crusher I&#x27;ve owned (that makes it #1 out of 2). It does the job right - making a powder instead of just small chunks (or a mix of the 2). Easy to operate, keeps powder inside and not on the grooves. Very well designed.</li>
            <li> great price and completely crushes the vitamins for my young daughter (I can then mix them in her yogurt or something and she has no idea!)</li>
            <li> Product is great to use at the hospital setting. Packing was great and it fits everywhere. Will buy another for home!</li>
            <li> I bought this to crush meds for my grandmother, as she has trouble swallowing pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little device works well as it allows you to get a good grip when turning the top to crush the meds.</li>
            <li> I like how much easier the pill crushing is. Plus, for some reason, I find it to be just kind of fun. ^_^; I think I&#x27;m working some aggro out while crushing these pills.</li>
            <li> This worked great to pulverize the pills I had to crush for my dogs medicine. I was better able to mix into her food.</li>
            <li> Best pill crusher I have found, it actually turns tablets into powder which I can then easily mix into my cat&#x27;s food.</li>
            <li> I had to crush pills after surgery so I purchased this.  It works very well on large pills but not so well on small pills.  It seems the chamber allows too much room for the device to crush very small pills.</li>
            <li> other reviewers were right, the base hurts my hand even when held in a towel.  The pill crusher really tries to crush rather than grind and large pills are hard to crush.</li>
            <li> We put probiotic tablets in our kids&#x27; yogurt every morning.  This thing makes the process so much simpler than trying to crush them in a bowl with a spoon.</li>
            <li> This is the most painful and difficult pill crusher I have ever used.  My skin came off from trying to turn the top.  A hazard for carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li> This little gem has the potential to become one of my VERY rare five star items.  I generally rate things based on several factors, one of which is durability (or how long it will last under normal use).  Overall, it&#x27;s an exceptionally useful device for crushing vitamin pills (or the non-coated pills of your choice) and beats the hell out of the two spoon crushing method (You don&#x27;t want to deal with that, so if you don&#x27;t know what it is, don&#x27;t ask.  You&#x27;ll thank me later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very solid, slightly pliable, thick top.&lt;br /&gt;- Solid, thick transparent crushing chamber (not pliable at all).&lt;br /&gt;- Rubberized, &amp;#34;EZ-grip&amp;#34; edges.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy threading (you can spin it down to &amp;#34;crush depth&amp;#34; in one spin if you&#x27;re good).&lt;br /&gt;- Very thorough crushing (It powdered the tablet, which is optimal).&lt;br /&gt;- Very fast to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively simple clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OK:&lt;br /&gt;- The price was a touch high for a pill crusher, but it was delivered to my door, so it&#x27;s a wash on that.&lt;br /&gt;- While the total quality of the product could have been better so the legs of the base don&#x27;t feel quite so uncertain (at least to me), it certainly gets the job done and isn&#x27;t shattering in my hands the second I use it (that&#x27;s happened to me before with things - I have really strong hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Transparent base legs aren&#x27;t as thick as the rest.&lt;br /&gt;- Durability MAY be an issue with the legs of the base (No conclusions so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: An excellent little tool that, with proper care and feeding, will PROBABLY live a long and destructive life crushing to bits the tablets of your choice.  The base legs, however, are about half as thick as the top, which makes me wonder about the potential for splitting/cracking/failing under repeated use.  The plastic of the base that touches the table is more brittle (it&#x27;s harder, but more brittle) than the top.  I would not recommend crushing enteric coated tablets with it (or crushing them at all with anything since that coating is there for a really good reason) because the extra pressure needed to crush that kind of tablet may hasten the failure of the base part.  The crushing chamber is made from the same plastic as the legs and though thicker than the legs, is still far more likely to crack or break if too much force is applied in crushing a tablet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to be clear, the crushing chamber in the base appears to be as thick and sturdy as everything else in the top.  What will break will likely be the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; of the thing.  That will make it harder to use, but it can still be used if one has a channel lock and some patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use it is to screw down until the tablet breaks, unscrew a little then screw down some more and repeat this until the tablet is powered.  This lets the pieces scatter more naturally and not pile up to create a stress point.  Usually doing this no more than a few times is all that&#x27;s needed to get a fairly fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it for crushing spices, herbs or other such things.  This is strictly for tablets only.  I also recommend cleaning it after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one treats the tool properly, and doesn&#x27;t abuse it, it should last quite some time.  If those cons disappear, it will be a five star.  If the legs do break, but the crushing chamber never does, it will remain at four (I have a channel lock and patience and, yes, going through that hassle is still better than the two-spoon method.).  I&#x27;ll revisit this in a year (that&#x27;s a lot of uses) and update it then.  If it lasts at least that long, it&#x27;s well worth the price.or crushing them at all with anything since that coating is there for a really good reason) because the extra pressure needed to crush that kind of tablet may hasten the failure of the base part.  The crushing chamber is made from the same plastic as the legs and though thicker than the legs, is still far more likely to crack or break if too much force is applied in crushing a tablet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to be clear, the crushing chamber in the base appears to be as thick and sturdy as everything else in the top.

            <li> Absolutely perfect.  Easily crushes my dog&#x27;s big glucosamine pills,  I was afraid he was going to break a tooth.  The bottom is a little uncomfortable and could have used a similar rubberized edge as the top, but if it comes to bother me I will just pad my hand with a dishtowel or washrag to use it.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It really crushes pills down to a fine powder.  I am glad that I bought it and will use it often.</li>
            <li> My tittle says it all. I kick myself for not getting this much sooner. It really makes the pill DUST !</li>
            <li> works fine, optimistic that it&#x27;ll last for years of use.</li>
            <li> Crushes and pulverizes medicines. Working as it should.&lt;br /&gt;Just that the base hurts people&#x27;s hands during use. The simple solution is to set the crusher on a table, book, or some other firm surface rather than holding it in your hand during use. Solved.</li>
            <li> If your pill has a coating on it, this is not for you.  It does mash the pill into a power, but it can&#x27;t do anything with the \\&quot;skin\\&quot; or coating.  If you swallow the skin like this...it sticks to your throat.  You need something that grinds up the pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also...the plastic bottom hurts your hand.  Comfort grip on the top but not on the  bottom.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this pill crusher since we&#x27;d tried others that did not crush very well.  Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised! We have to crush all of our daughter&#x27;s pills to get them through her G-tube and this really does the job.  I crush them, pour a little water, and draw them up all in the same container.  It&#x27;s also nice and small to take with us everywhere.  Life saver!</li>
            <li> We have to sneak pills into dog food. The crushing part is easy if you only have one or two pills in the container. However, the bottom is very abrasive. You cannot escape grabbing it so hard and twisting that it hurts your hand. If you have too many pills, you can rip some skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, we keep it and use it. I just grab a washcloth and place it between the container and my hand.</li>
            <li> My dog acts like a mental patient eating all her food around her pills or spitting the pills about on the carpet. Bought this doohickey and now her pills can be concealed in her food with a little gravy. I know she is still winning but I don&#x27;t care. It works. Also, got my mom the same pill crusher and she says it&#x27;s the first one her hands can really grip. Bonus!</li>
            <li> I have tried about seven different pill crushers, and this one is the BEST!!!!  Crushes even large pills with very little effort!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonably priced pill crusher.  It works well for my son who has autism and has difficulty swallowing pills.  Some pills are harder than others and require an extra turn or two to pulverize the pill.  Overall works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using so many different meds crushers over the last 20 yrs. I found this at walgreen.  It was expensive. The item is better than other brand, however, one design flaw.  The bottom half should is silicon or rubber like the top half.  OMG, it hurts your hand so bad when crushing pills for 30 ppl each shift.  I have to use the ez grap/kitchen/can opener rubber thing to hold the bottom so your hand/palm wont hurt.  I&#x27;ll email with my suggestion to their R&amp;D department and hoping they will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crusher functions excelently. NO build up, and all well crushed.  I dont need a knnife to scrap off the bottom like other kinds I got at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need one and w/i your budget then get this. Just remember to use a round rubbery can opener to hold the bottom half.</li>
            <li> Bought this to crush yeast pills for my dog and cat.  Put it barely down and it makes perfect pieces for my dog.  Put it all the way down and it makes a powder to mix in my cat&#x27;s food.  Am going to order the pack of 2 in case something happens to this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this some time ago and we keep it because it is larger than our other one and so it&#x27;s easier to crush larger pills. However, what is the point of the rubberized top when the rough, hard plastic bottom will give you blisters? How hard could it honestly be for them to make a rubber top and bottom to this? I was hoping to give my hands a break since I crush pills at my job every day. It actually hurts my hand worse than the regular plastic ones.</li>
            <li> This really crushes pills to a fine powder.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, this is the easiest to use and especially made to powder your pills. It can also be used to cut any pill in half by slowly turning the top down until it hits the pill and then turn just a tad more and your pill will break in half. Turn a little more and it starts crushing the pill. I think this thing will last forever. Well made. For those who don&#x27;t need to powder their pills but rather to only slip they pills in half, I recommend a standard pill cutter instead of a crusher.</li>
            <li> This product definitely pulverizes huge Glucosamine caplets.  It may take a few twists but it does the job close to perfection.  The top half of the unit is rubberized &amp; easy to grip but I can see how the bottom half causes pain for people who may be suffering from arthritis or prove difficult for more elderly users so it would be great,even for me, if the manufacturer can improve on this.  But other than that it does exactly what it says on its description. And product arrived within 3 days of order which was great!!!</li>
            <li> It works very well but only a few pills at a time. If you need to crush all your pills, it wont handle volume. Takes a little more time than I&#x27;d like but really does pulverise &#x27;em</li>
            <li> Does not crush hard pills. Does not do a good job if there are several pills at once. The plastic feels flimsy and feels like it will break when pressed hard enough to crush the pills.</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of s***.</li>
            <li> We use this every morning to crush our toddler&#x27;s Flinstone&#x27;s vitamin and add it to juice since he refuses to chew them. It literally pulverizes them! It&#x27;s very easy to wash and has held up nicely thus far.</li>
            <li> If you need a heavy-duty pill crusher, this one fits the bill. My dog takes several medications and I can crush his one dose of 8 pills at one time with ease. I wish it also had a pill cutter too but as great as the pill crusher is, I don&#x27;t mind using a separate pill cutter.</li>
            <li> rprompt delivery-easy to use, small enough to bring with me if I hae to. It is just what I wanted.I would recomend this for anyone who has trouble swallowing pills</li>
            <li> This pill crusher really pulverizes as stated.  I expected it to break the pill and hoped that it would live up to the claim.  It does - 100%.&lt;br /&gt;It is really strongly constructed and looks like it will last a very long time.  Thank you for a quality product and at such a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she uses it on large pill and vitamins she has to take. I like it because its strong and sturdy and crushes pretty well, sometimes large pieces are left over so you have to moving it around to make sure all is crushed</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son&#x27;s medications. Is amazing breaks the medicine perfectly. I have been using it non stop 2x a day since January and still in perfect condition. Highly recommend easy to use especially for someone like me who has tendinitis, super easy to use &amp; turn.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this pill crusher. It hurts my hands a lot and takes quite a bit of strength to use, which makes your hands get all ripped up by the bottom part of the crusher. And it doesn&#x27;t even work well... I can see it being ok for small pills but I got them to crush larger pills (for my dog- the smaller ones I just put in his food and he eats it but can&#x27;t do that with the bigger ones), I&#x27;m assuming a lot of people get them for similar reasons or people can&#x27;t swallow really large pills, but this crusher doesn&#x27;t work for that at all. And the dust from the pills gets all over the screwing part.</li>
            <li> My mom has a peg tube (feeding tube), and I read the reviews on this before ordering to make sure that it crushes pills sufficiently to fit through the tube.  I love that the threads are on the outside of the jar so the medication does not get stuck in between the threads.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase.  It makes light work of both tiny and huge pills with little effort, which is great for me since my mom has cancer, and she takes fist fulls of pills that need to be crushed for her peg tube on a daily basis.  This crusher was well worth the money, and I would definitely buy it again.  It is very solid, the barrel is large enough to accommodate the largest of pills, and the conical shape helps to shake the powder out.  I do think the company could have put the rubber comfort grips on the plastic base edges to increase the comfort when turning, but I knew this was an issue before ordering based on other reviews; therefore I was not disappointed when it arrived.  I use a silicone jar opener to hold the base, which works great.  This pill crusher pulverizes as advertised.</li>
            <li> I Used this for my cats medicine and is very easy to use. it crushes very finely which is important.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher really works great.&lt;br /&gt;It makes crushing pills much easier,&lt;br /&gt;especially on those days when fingers are sore&lt;br /&gt;from arthritis. It is easy to use and&lt;br /&gt;is of very good quality. It should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to crush more than 4 regular sized pills at once. I tried crushing 1 large pill, 1/2 of a medium-sized pill, and 2 halves of really small pills at once. The medium sort of got crushed, but required me to ease up then shake it around until it was in the center for it to be crushed. All the finely crushed bits prevented the two halves of the tiny pills from being touched at all, and I had to dig them out and twist them separately for them to be crushed.</li>
            <li> I have to crush a pretty large pill (quarter diameter and 1/4&amp;#34; thick) for my dog and mix it with chicken broth since he refuses to eat it himself and it is too big for pill pockets or other such subterfuge.  Using this pill crusher is much better than my &amp;#34;hit it inside a plastic bag&amp;#34; method.  I was worried about how it would do on such a large pill, but it does crush it well.  Sometimes if the chunks don&#x27;t seem small enough, I will mix it up a little and crush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wrist tendonitis and am comfortable using this product, although like other reviewers, I wish the base was made out of similar material as the top since the thin plastic edges can dig into my hand a little.  I don&#x27;t know that I would use the word &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;, however, since I have never felt like it was going to cut me, just discomfort from the edges not distributing the pressure evenly.  That is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> it lasted over a good year and a half but the top just snapped in half in my hands while in use.</li>
            <li> I like the Pill Crusher because I can swallow the pill!&lt;br /&gt;I would just would like if it would crush a bit finer.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help administer pills to my pets. Grinds fairly easily but the bottom portion lacks any rubbery portions, which would keep the plastic from biting in to your hand. It&#x27;s mildly uncomfortable, hardly painful, but it would be a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the device crushes pills to satisfaction and makes them easy to administer to your pets&#x27; food. The end.</li>
            <li> I like this, it does crush up giant pills into a fine powder, if you twist and untwist enough times. The only problem is the bottom of it hurts to holt on to, it has somewhat shart edges that can&#x27;t really get a good grip on so it can be painful for those with sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> This is a great crusher for people with arthritis. The top is larger and easy to grasp and turn.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but I knew that when I bought it. The bottom of the crusher should have the same coating as the top - the gripping ridges are sharp and hurt my hands when trying to really pulverize a pill. I was really hoping the extra diameter of the crusher would allow me to get more power to the crusher itself... but I can feel the entire thing warp and flex as I&#x27;m using it. Even so, after using it for a week, I was getting larger chunks than I did out of my $5 CVS crusher. Threw it away before it broke in my hands, not worth trying to refund.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to swallow my pills if taking them after supper and sometimes during the day.  This has really helped me and it&#x27;s very handy to take when traveling.  I used to take two spoons and crush my pills, but this does a much better job and it&#x27;s so much easier!</li>
            <li> This crusher works for large tablets and is easy to turn. Much easier to use than smaller crushers. The blue tips can come off but doesn&#x27;t affect how it works.</li>
            <li> works great especially for those big &amp;#34;horse tabs&amp;#34;. We use it to grind up medication for our dog so she&#x27;ll eat it in her food. Only complaint--they put nice rubber cushions on one part of the grinder but not on both parts so it can be uncomfortable tp grind up big tabs or multiple tabs.</li>
            <li> It works well enough for 1 pill, but it does not have the depth to take two pills high.  The base feels a little thin, and I am concerned that someone might break it in their hand if they over tighten the cap, albeit beyond what is needed to crush a pill.</li>
            <li> overall works much better than crushing with a spoon or other utensil.  It is a little hard to twist, but still works very well.</li>
            <li> This works great. As someone who has never been able to swallow pills due to whatever strange mental thing my brain does to actively stop me from doing so, even when I try my best to trick it; This pill crusher works great. I used to just put my pills in some aluminum foil and smash the heck out of them, but that&#x27;s much more strenuous than twisting this and sometimes not very effective if I wanted to take a full does when the force of smashing the pills would split the foil. It&#x27;s also cheap, which makes it worth it. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has trouble swallowing pills or even to those who have to take a larger sized pill.</li>
            <li> Works very very well! Easy to use</li>
            <li> I needed to crush a very hard pill. With absolutely no strain on my fingers or wrist, my pill was crushed to a fine powder.  I have a weak grip (due to injury), but this crusher required only a light grip and was painless to use!</li>
            <li> The most common complaint about this pill crusher, which does an *excellent* job, is that the base hurts people&#x27;s hands during use.  The simple solution is to set the crusher on a table, book, or some other firm surface rather than holding it in your hand during use.  If used in this way, the design of the base makes it very easy to hold stationary while crushing.</li>
            <li> I use this to grind bute pills for horses (\\&quot;pills\\&quot; are very large) and it works very well. I had been using a coffee grinder which did not work well and was a mess.</li>
            <li> Giving pills to the dog is traumatic, for the dog and me.  I bought this to finely grind pills into &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;, then combine with peanut butter and stick to the roof of her mouth.  No muss, no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just a few twists (tightening and loosening), the &amp;#34;mortar and pestle&amp;#34; effect was very good!  The result was a finely and equally ground pill,  easily emptied, and with a small-sized residue which mixes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend, especially for this price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this five stars if the bottom was constructed with the same design/materials as the top.  The top has&lt;br /&gt;a softer more comfortable feel to it (blue in the photos), whereas the bottom is a little less comfortable, but that&#x27;s still just fine.&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use and does a nice job.  The top is pointed and the bottom has the matching contour.&lt;br /&gt;The pill/tablet will center in the bottom and the pointy top will go right through and crushes nicely.&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to clean by wiping or rinsing.</li>
            <li> This product is decent at crushing pills, but i found it leaves too much of the crushed pill residue at the bottom, so we&#x27;d have to frequently wash, and scrub pretty hard to clean this thing. Also, it&#x27;s a screw-on cap, so if the pill didn&#x27;t fully crush the first time, you have to screw, then unscrew, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Good quality made.Crushing pills is not always easy as it is but the pill pulverizer does make the job easer. It can be hard on the hands to tighten it down to crush the pills, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have some difficulty crushing my hard-shelled Metformin tablets with the APEX crusher, Due to weak wrists. I had hoped that the crushing surfaces would be dimpled, instead of smooth. I continue to try to find a satisfactory solution to crushing the hard tablets..</li>
            <li> I have a special needs child who has a feeding tube, and she receives many medications that she can&#x27;t take by mouth. I was skeptical when I first received it, but it works great! Everything gets crushed and flows threw her g-tube nicely.</li>
            <li> I needed to grind pills to a very fine powder and this did the trick very well. The shape of the top makes it fairly easy to turn to get the finest powder possible. I had considered a small mortar and pestle but am glad I chose this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pill crusher because I was having extensive dental work done.  I found this crusher to be awkward and hard to turn.  I&#x27;ve found cheaper crushers that I like much better.</li>
            <li> This is a challenger since on one side many people like it and others are unhappy and their reasons is because they suffer arthritis and it is hard to turn the pill crusher.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line the product is very cheap and it does its job very efficiently for any kind/size of pill or caplet. Everybody who takes pills that  needs to be crushed this the solution. For those who suffer arthritis and it is hard for them to turn the upper top since the pill might be too large, do the following: Take the pill and put it in a small pot and with the handle of a knife hit the pill softly which will split in a few pieces. Now place those pill pieces in the pill-crusher and turn the upper part: Voila! you will get a fine powder with minimum  effort and no arthritis pain</li>
            <li> Call me ignorant, but I had no idea such a thing existed until it popped up as a recommended add on item when I was making a purchase. I immediately added it in. It arrived quickly, as always. That evening I used it for the first time and actually yipped in delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog has serious nervous issues (he&#x27;s old and I adopted him that way) that include shaking from thunderstorms, helicopters or even construction noise that sounds like it could remotely be thunder. He takes a pill for it in his meals but up to now I&#x27;ve been chopping it into powder with a knife on a cutting board. Needless to say it is a pain and I lose some of the pill. I crushed that pill like it didn&#x27;t exist in this little gem and am absolutely thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out on the Tea Pills my dog takes for immune support. The Wei Qi Booster pills didn&#x27;t crush into powder, but they broke apart and crumbled up wonderfully. For anyone who uses tea pills for their animals, you know that they are the most spit out because they are so round and hard they aren&#x27;t like food. All of the pill powders and bits went into the dog during his meal without fuss. The first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I would have had it when he was taking all those pills for an infection in his mouth! Great little item for anyone who has to try to give animals regular medication.</li>
            <li> great for grinding meds</li>
            <li> I was able to crush a large adult vitamin with this little gadget......works beautifully !!!  The best I have found yet!</li>
            <li> I seem to be a rarity, but I find swallowing pills very difficult. I don&#x27;t know how others do it. I purchased this because I wanted my multivitamin pill crushed along with a thick magnesium pill. I&#x27;d tried cutting the pills in fractions to prevent me from choking on them, but the jagged edges that result from cutting them up via a knife were uncomfortable for my throat. I don&#x27;t even know why I forgot to look up \\&quot;pill crusher\\&quot; on Amazon for so long, but I did about a week ago, and it&#x27;s made my life a lot less stressful when it comes to taking the pills. It took both my multivitamin and my thick magnesium pills and crushed them into small pieces that I then dump into my bland oatmeal. I forgot to use this to crush my multivitamin pill (which wasn&#x27;t even a whole one, it was a half) some days ago and I nearly choked on the pill. My body was in panic mode and I was very scared. It took a lot of time to make its way down, despite drinking water, which at times seemed to make matters worse. I have to Thank God for helping me out. I gave this four stars instead of five because the contents still stick at the bottom, which is unfortunate. I tried using water to clear it out but it&#x27;s difficult. Looking toward the future, my only fear is being preoccupied with something else (like I was before) and forgetting to use this to crush my pills. For those who have a severe difficulty swallowing pills, buy this. It&#x27;s only $6. If you&#x27;re thinking about swallowing your pill and nobody is there in case things take an unfortunate turn for the worse, then pray to God, nothing bad happens, like I did. But to prevent dangerous occurrences like that from happening, use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the complaints about people&#x27;s hands hurting from holding it at the bottom are a little too exaggerated. My hands are soft and while it&#x27;s not the most comfortable feeling in the world, it&#x27;s certainly not discouraging to the point that it should make you think twice about getting this. Also, if it hurts your hand, why not set it on the table while you&#x27;re crushing the pill or do what I do and hold the product on its sides in the air and twist both sides simultaneously, the pressure of the bottom of the pill crusher against the hand isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do well. Sometimes the powder does stick to the bottom. Also, it would have been nice if the maker had made the bottom with rubber grips like the top. Still, it works really well.</li>
            <li> The crusher was ordered for my mom with arthritis and is doing an excellent job. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> After my surgery, my doctor prescribed me horse pills for pain meds and I can&#x27;t swallow horse pills. So I purchased this and it crushed the horse pills to a fine powder with minimal to no effort at all. So easy! It made my recovery a lot easier. It works every time and I like that it works just by tightening the handle/knob but it doesn&#x27;t leave any big chunks, the whole pill actually turns into powder which makes it super easy to fill up your empty pill capsules. Seems like there is no pill too big for this little monster!</li>
            <li> I bought this pill crusher for my father who just turned 85 and has a very hard time swallowing pills and this really crushes up the pills and makes it a lot easier for him to take his medication.</li>
            <li> Made grinding pills for my wife easy.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> The grip helps to turn (after this I would never consider one without it).  But, it does not crush the pills all the way, there are some small chunks left.  Also, you can only do 1 pill at a time or it does not really crush much at all regardless of how hard you turn.</li>
            <li> This is JUNK!!! Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best pill crusher out there, used it to grind up my multivitamins... work really well... just mix those vitamins afterward with some apple sauce and you&#x27;ll be good to go...</li>
            <li> I have carpal tunnel and the little pill crushers I have been using cause me sleepless nights.  This works easier by far and saves my wrist.</li>
            <li> Eighty something parents are able to crush their multitude of pills easily to take in pudding or apple sauce. No more choking on pills.</li>
            <li> This crushes the pills to powder. Works perfect. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I&#x27;m buying more of these!</li>
            <li> If you need a pill crusher that works good this one does the job. It is light and made of strong polypropylene and last a long time. If you have pills to crush and take sublingually it does a good job. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always write reviews but this is a great product. With no strength required my dog&#x27;s pill is crushed so easily, and I can mix it into her food.  This is exactly what I needed at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing. The cheap pill crusher from Wal-Mart works much better. Very hard to hold and use.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it I said : &amp;#34;There&#x27;s no way this will crush anything&amp;#34; - I honestly thought it was a waste of money..So I decided to test it..i put a huge msm pull inside, twisted the cap..heard no sound, so I thought nothing happened..when I opened it all there was, was a thin white powder that looked exactly like baby powder in consistency...I must confess I underestimated it&#x27;s ability..plus everything stays in the container. .no spill...real clean..There were so many other pill crushers to choose from..I was confused :/..but I&#x27;m so glad I made the right choice..i will be taking a lot of different vitamins for hair growth and for skin and nails..so I want to crush them and put in orange juice (vitamin c) every morning..and a cup of milk before bed (calcium, vitamin D (I&#x27;m anemic &amp; vitamin D deficient :/)</li>
            <li> Crushes pills ok, but not without a lot of pain.  The top blue and white portion is soft and easy on your hand.  The bottom clear plastic is sharp and formed to fit so uncomfortably.  There is no way you can leverage enough twist without hurting/cutting your hand...  I had to use an oven mitt to hold it and get 3 pills crushed for my son. Unless you have callouses on your hands, find something else!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to crush my son&#x27;s medication, a tiny 5mg pill. The crusher works perfectly, it turns the pill to dust so it easily dissovles in his drink or food. Even bought an extra one for school, excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is a simple device. Easy to use. Effective... up to a point. Where this becomes &amp;#34;misleading&amp;#34; is - it is claimed this item is a &amp;#34;Pill Crusher/Pill Pulverizer&amp;#34;. Pill Crusher - absolutely.. Pill Pulverizer - not so much. Although this is effective in breaking up the pill to an appreciable degree - it does not pulverize, or make into fine powder (the kind you can mix into fruit juice or water).&lt;br /&gt;Might not seem important to most... but for those who need exactly that - it&#x27;s a big deal. Yes, the process results in a significant amount of powder, but there is also a considerable amount of small solid chips and pieces. This is still the case after re-adjusting the contents and re-tightening the cap to the maximum several times. You still have to &amp;#34;mortar and pestle&amp;#34; the last bits yourself, in the base, to truly make a powder (or to Pulverize). It&#x27;s just a little too labour-intensive, a f t e r  having engaged the item, and therefore having expected the job to have been completed at that point.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, on balance, this is not a horrible gadget. Relatively neat and clean process. Our lower rating comes simply as a result of it not truly fulfilling it&#x27;s description. Truth in advertising/representation...&lt;br /&gt;This is a Pill Crusher.. reduces the size of a pill into little pieces. This is not a Pill Pulverizer. If it were presented as such - we would give it a 4-5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Works perfect. I find if I hold it the container at an angle while twisting, the pills are crushed to a finer powder, and the central &amp;#34;dimple&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t clog with medicine.</li>
            <li> This little item seems too small and simple to work well, but it gets the job done!  Pills crush easily.  I really like the beveled surfaces in the crushing chamber.  Everything inside gets crushed without a lot of elbow grease, and it is easy to empty the crushed pills into a cup, your hand, etc.  It is also easy to clean and store.  I bought a few so I&#x27;d have back-up if needed, and I am glad I did.  One can stay at home and one can travel, since they are rather small and compact -- and there is a small chamber to store a few pills for later ahead of time in the top.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was such an easy non messy way to crush pills. Thought you had to take a rolling pin and towel. This works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have a daughter who eats via a g-tube so we need to crush all of her medication.  We&#x27;ve tried many pill crushers and with the exception of a mortar and pestle, this one beats them all.  A mortar and pestle will crush pills finer in less time, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to travel with.  For compactness and portability, nothing beats this pill crusher.  With time, it will start to not work as well, I&#x27;m not sure why, but it&#x27;s inexpensive so I don&#x27;t mind buying another one.  I find each one lasts at least a year, if not longer.</li>
            <li> This was a failed experiment for me. I will withhold my review. Still, it crushes the pills like it says it does, but it will take two or three times to get it pulverized.</li>
            <li> This is very effective -- and a real lifesaver</li>
            <li> Good for turning your pills into powder. Whether for people or dogs.</li>
            <li> It hurt my hands using it.  I through it out after two uses.</li>
            <li> After reading various reviews about pill crushers, I came upon this one.  I am so glad I purchased it as it does the job quickly and easily.  Just put that pill in, or tablet or caplet and start turning.  And the powder was very fine from the crushing.  I would definitely recommend this one for crushing those hard to swallow pills!</li>
            <li> This is a really great device for crushing pills. It does absolutely pulverize the pills that I crush, into a fine powder. You do have to loosen and retighten it a few times until you get the desired consistency. I would really love to give this product the 5 stars it deserves, but I won&#x27;t. The problem is with the hand grip on the bottom of the crusher. It is hard plastic and quite sharp. I used a file to smooth it out some, but it is still quite uncomfortable and digs into your hand. I use hand tools all day long at my profession,  and am here to tell you that if you have to use this more than once per day, it&#x27;s going to get irritating. If they manufactured the top and bottom using the same soft grip as the top, then this would be the perfect tool for crushing pills.</li>
            <li> By far the easiest pill crusher that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but both halves should have rubber tips.  The non-rubberized tips are too small and hard to grip.</li>
            <li> I bought this to crush my five year old medication...he is unable to swallow whole pills. The only problem I had was when I initually used it...it didn&#x27;t crush the pill complety.  I had to try to turn it all the way as hard as I could to crush it all the way...and some residue was left inside.  Which i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s normal.  Over all it did the job...I think it could have been easier..but hey..It did the job :-)</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job</li>
            <li> Works as described.  The external &amp;#34;twisty part&amp;#34; keeps most of the drug in the cylinder.  The grip makes it easy to smash those pills.</li>
            <li> It crushes pills into powder, as advertised.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the bottom portion is somewhat uncomfortable on the hand when turning.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want the worry of having to swallow pills that are hard as rocks, consider this ultra pill crusher.  For a little item, it is vitally important when you take pills that are hard like rocks. I bought this on the strength of the reviews. This lives up to the 5 stars for me.  I  lift the crusher and I can see what I have crushed and if the pill needs more crushing. The unit fits so easily into the grooves.  Best I have found.  I usually crush 1 pill then the next.  Easier for the crushing. The pill crusher stands up.  Nice touch.  It is sturdy, and better made than others I have used. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who has trouble swallowing pills, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  Now my mom uses it everyday.  It is an ingenious product -- it miraculously crushes any vitamins/pills into fine powder with a simple twist of the cap.  It requires no strength at all to turn the cap so it is great for the elderly.  Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean. At this price, it is a great bargain too. I usually don&#x27;t bother to write reviews, but was so delighted with this product that I felt compelled to give it a stellar review.</li>
            <li> I had to twist it really hard to crush the pills.  I gave up on it and used my Magic Bullet.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have crushed ginormous vitamin pills with this and little medical pills with this, it works like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend unscrewing once or twice after the initial crushing, tapping the crusher to re-situate the material into the middle, and re-tightening again to get a fine crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common sense dictates that you wash this after every use to ensure you are not mixing medications.</li>
            <li> Very Good product, crushes pills very fine with a couple twists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been crushing my little dog&#x27;s pills in this pill crusher for over 6 months now.  Twice a day every day for 2 pills and sometimes 3 pills morning and night.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Spot on performance. Great price for a quality. Some reviewers were right when they said one of the things they liked about this unit was that the threads were on the OUTSIDE of the unit NOT on the inside of the cylinder. This is important because of the fine power will NOT get caught up in the threads and therefore wasting some of the pill.</li>
            <li> I use this to give my daughter her pills and this crusher is amazing. It crushes the pills into powder and it doesn&#x27;t leave big bits behind. I have used others before, and this is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> This helped me so much.  I have an old injury to my wrist and it makes it so easy to crush pills now.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I assumed that it would be the type where u push down and it crushes the pill instead of screwing it tight so it crushes the medicine</li>
            <li> This works great and is easy to use. It pulverizes the pills you put into it and then tighten the cover. The cover squeezes down the more you tighten it. The handle design makes it easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This pill crusher did a good job of crushing the pills.  I like the fact that it has rubberized blue gribs on the top that helps when turning the pill crusher.  I also like the pill storage compartment too.  I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because I found that the clear bottom half felt a little less comfortable without the rubberized gribs.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was buying. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it seemed the best out of others shown. Before I used very old one and it broke. But it was perfect, small, exactly the size for a one pill, I didn&#x27;t have to turn the top part so tight, because it was small and then I didn&#x27;t have to turn it in the opposite direction to open. But I guess the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make it any more.</li>
            <li> Works great for crushing pills into a powder so I can slip pills into my husbands drink to knock him out and then tell him how great he was last night.  That way I get to control the remote</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given 3 of these as gifts to friends and family that have trouble swallowing pills.  All 3 people didn&#x27;t know such a fine device exists and were thrilled.  This model is very top of the line.</li>
            <li> Works okay, won&#x27;t grind some pills if you put them all in at once.</li>
            <li> For people or pets who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t swallow pills,this is the answer.I searched for the best buy in pill pulverizers and found it in this...you could spend way more for a professional one rated best,but if you&#x27;re crushing less than a dozen pills a day,why? The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it leaves a tiny bit of the crushed pill residue in the chamber which is very hard to remove,but I think I&#x27;ll try a sterile paint brush next time. If you just use it for the same pill every time,it shouldn&#x27;t even be a concern after the first pill because the amount of pill that empties out should be equivalent to a complete pill. Oh,a suggestion on what to mix the pulverized pill with:applesauce,and this is our favorite![[ASIN:B004XVJI2S Musselman&#x27;s Natural Unsweetened Apple Sauce 24 oz]]</li>
            <li> Not the best I had to buy a different one  the ulrais not that</li>
            <li> This pill crusher worked great.&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered it I was concerned that the 93 year old would not have the strength to use it to crush a pill but it worked as needed. I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I am not the 93 year old; I gave it to him as a gift.</li>
            <li> I PICKED THE WORNG PRODUCT :( IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE THE SPLITTR FUNCTION, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS ODD BECAUSE MANY PRODUCTS ARE DUAL FUNCTION...</li>
            <li> It looks well made and is good and heavy, sturdy.  I think it will work nicely when I need it.</li>
            <li> great product, worked great.</li>
            <li> My wife takes some large pills daily. The pill crusher is simple, works great, and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This is my replacement for the old mortice and pestal.  I have to grind down some pills and this does a very exacting job.</li>
            <li> great pill crusher works nicely</li>
            <li> I ordered the smaller pill crusher but my puppy&#x27;s vitamins did not fit.  This crusher is larger and crushes the largest pill.  My puppy&#x27;s supplements are the size of sweet tarts and this one can handle it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to break large calcium tablet in half. And this does that, and I am pretty content with the performance.</li>
            <li> Easy to use easy to grip works like a charm and makes any pill powder. Very happy with it and I have some monster pills to crush up hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> This is a super easy way to crush pills. I was concerned about being strong enough to crush larger pills, but this makes it almost effortless. Recommended even for the elderly.</li>
            <li> The design was really great but I was only able to crush the pill a little bit.  I was never able to pulverize the pills.  Due to my husbands stroke and peg tube the medication must be pulverized.  He also requires 4-5 medications at medication time, this would be to time consuming.  I did keep the crush hoping I would be able to use it at a later date.  Like I said earlier the design was really nice and easy to use with my arthritis.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;m using this type of product. I didn&#x27;t even expect it to be thAt good! Crushes everything into a fine powder.</li>
