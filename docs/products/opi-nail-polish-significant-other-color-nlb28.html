            <li>I love OPI quality and their shades...and this did not disappoint!  </li>
            <li>Mysterious-looking, but quite lovely!</li>
            <li>This polish goes on smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li>Nice iridescent hue.  </li>
            <li>Love the color &amp; looks amazing over or under a coat of&lt;br /&gt;NLS63--Chicago Champagne Toast.</li>
            <li>Also packaged well for safe travel.  </li>
            <li>I prefer these pearlized types better than the ones that have chunks of sparkle in them.</li>
            <li>I love OPI</li>
            <li>,This reminds me of a pearly color ,would be great for spring or really any time .If</li>
            <li>you like all shades of purple than you would probably love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>However I wear it to work but with a matte top coat</li>
            <li>I love the color hues that are in this nail polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;OPI is still my favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li>I really love this color but on my skin color (NC42) - I have to put on 4 coats in order for it to give me the color that I see in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love it though.  </li>
            <li>products are always wonderful and glad amazon can save us a little money on them.</li>
            <li>whatever) because the color varies, depending on what light you&#x27;re in.  </li>
            <li>but it will look light shimmery lilac/green or purple, depending upon the viewing angle.</li>
            <li>and it is a light lime...</li>
            <li>and I am never disappointed with any of their colors.</li>
            <li>Would order more of this kind of polish in the future.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and was securely wrapped to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the fast delivery of the product.  </li>
            <li>First, this color doesn&#x27;t apply as strongly as it looks in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love the color as it is more colors than one when seen in different lighting.  </li>
            <li>Item was well packaged and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color and has a lot of shine .To</li>
            <li>I love how it changes in different light.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin tones and this shade has just the right amount of base color to blend perfectly and the iridescent adding hints of mystery...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So pretty on your nails.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll need 3-4 coats to get good coverage (not able to see the whites of your nail through the color).</li>
            <li>me seems like this is a light purple with green and depending on where I am standing in the light it seems to change.</li>
            <li>Much more subtle than it looks in the bottle and so easy to order my OPI products from the comfort of my living room.</li>
            <li>The color number and name of this polish was very deceptive.  </li>
            <li>thanks amamzon  </li>
            <li>read the review and decided to try the color, so pretty, very very neutral in a sort of way, a light lilac, but the other way you turn your nail</li>
            <li>Pretty color, but super sheer.</li>
            <li>You can add on top of other colors and change them.</li>
            <li>Like all OPI polishes it goes on smoothly and lasts a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li>Needed like 5 coats to get a decent color.</li>
            <li>Everything from pink to light purple with a hint of silver and lavender with a hint of gold in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I needed two coats and a top coat and already had a few compliments</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last exceptionally well, even with a base and top coat, but I feel like that&#x27;s true of all but gel/acrylics.</li>
            <li>The color is extremely light and after 3 coats it looks like light purple or an ugly light greenish depending on the angle.</li>
            <li>so glad i can get this online now hard to find colors in stores</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about nail polish, but when I ordered it, it didnt look the one in the advertisement and I like simple nail color.  </li>
            <li>Saw this color in a Sunday ad for Ulta and it looked like it was lavender with green streaks through it, but apparently it changes color depending on the light which hits your nails.  </li>
            <li>There is no pink.  </li>
            <li>Matching nail color to an outfit can sometimes be difficult, but this worked out quite nicely with multiple clothing needs.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have never been disappointed with OPI polish and they have a lot of light colors (which I prefer) to choose from.</li>

            <li> the base shade is a pale mauve with iridescent gold silver pale cool mint greens, lavenders...</li>
            <li> Unless you paint several coats, this is a very subtle thin iridescent color that to me, resembles a bubble (soap suds, bubble from a wand...</li>

            <li> but it takes 3-4 coats to get the depth of color in the bottle&#x27;s picture compared to other OPI colors that are comparable after 2 coats. Nevertheless I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> Ordered for myself.  Love the color as it is more colors than one when seen in different lighting.  Everything from pink to light purple with a hint of silver and lavender with a hint of gold in the sun.  I love how it changes in different light.  Item was as described and arrived on time.  Also packaged well for safe travel.  Would order more of this kind of polish in the future. Very satisfied with this purchase.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Iridescent green yellow purple. Look great on my fair skin. A color a fairy would wear! And what a great name</li>
            <li> My computer made the color image look like a shade of pink.  There is no pink.  The color is extremely light and after 3 coats it looks like light purple or an ugly light greenish depending on the angle.</li>
            <li> This is a great color that adds to any exsisting color. Gave as a gift but now I need some</li>
            <li> Like all OPI polishes it goes on smoothly and lasts a long time without chipping. I prefer these pearlized types better than the ones that have chunks of sparkle in them.</li>

            <li> Pretty color, but super sheer. Needed like 5 coats to get a decent color. Worked best when I applied it over another color.</li>
            <li> I love OPI it is long lasting and I am never disappointed with any of their colors. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love OPI quality and their shades...and this did not disappoint!  I have fair skin tones and this shade has just the right amount of base color to blend perfectly and the iridescent adding hints of mystery...the base shade is a pale mauve with iridescent gold silver pale cool mint greens, lavenders...mysterious chromatically well balanced...love it</li>
            <li> First, this color doesn&#x27;t apply as strongly as it looks in the bottle.  Unless you paint several coats, this is a very subtle thin iridescent color that to me, resembles a bubble (soap suds, bubble from a wand...whatever) because the color varies, depending on what light you&#x27;re in.  Almost like a hologram in intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it over other another color to change it up.  What you&#x27;ll see is a mixture of iridescent pinks, purples, golds and greens.  Mysterious-looking, but quite lovely!</li>
            <li> The name OPI came up with for this polish is ment for this color.This is a very pretty color and has a lot of shine .To me seems like this is a light purple with green and depending on where I am standing in the light it seems to change.I needed two coats and a top coat and already had a few compliments,This reminds me of a pearly color ,would be great for spring or really any time .If you like all shades of purple than you would probably love this color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lavender color with shimmer undertones of a green/gold. It&#x27;s a thinner color so you&#x27;ll need 3-4 coats to get good coverage (not able to see the whites of your nail through the color). Lasts longer than I had expected (usually thinner colors don&#x27;t last a week - I&#x27;m rough on my nails).</li>
            <li> I thought this was a lilac shimmer but it will look light shimmery lilac/green or purple, depending upon the viewing angle. Doesn&#x27;t last exceptionally well, even with a base and top coat, but I feel like that&#x27;s true of all but gel/acrylics. Item was well packaged and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Great color.  Much more subtle than it looks in the bottle and so easy to order my OPI products from the comfort of my living room.</li>
            <li> Perfect color, perfect texture.  I have never been disappointed with OPI polish and they have a lot of light colors (which I prefer) to choose from.</li>
            <li> Pale pink to gold... almost like you blew a bubble and the colors shimmered in the sun. So pretty on your nails. Very dainty and fun. You can add on top of other colors and change them. It is a color that you can use one coat or three or four to intensify.</li>
            <li> I received this item and it&#x27;s simply awesome, met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;OPI products are always wonderful and glad amazon can save us a little money on them.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  In different lights it looks different colors.  Sometimes its a purplish color then it can look pink and even green in some lighting.  I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> Saw this color in a Sunday ad for Ulta and it looked like it was lavender with green streaks through it, but apparently it changes color depending on the light which hits your nails.  I don&#x27;t know much about nail polish, but when I ordered it, it didnt look the one in the advertisement and I like simple nail color.  Not my taste so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I use it for nights out. However I wear it to work but with a matte top coat and it totally changes how it looks</li>
            <li> The color number and name of this polish was very deceptive.  I used this nail polish with this same color number and name and it was not purple.  I was told, after I received the polish that OPI, sometime use the same color  number and name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should not be done.  How are we , the consumer know that OPI use the color number and name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably never order OPI off online again!!</li>
            <li> I love the color hues that are in this nail polish.  The florescent pink and purple give it an illusion of three colors.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> great color and great price thanks amamzon  so glad i can get this online now hard to find colors in stores</li>
            <li> This is a pale shade of purple/pink.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is a different color combination.&lt;br /&gt;OPI is still my favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li> I really love this color but on my skin color (NC42) - I have to put on 4 coats in order for it to give me the color that I see in the bottle.  I love it though.  4 coats it shall be.</li>
            <li> read the review and decided to try the color, so pretty, very very neutral in a sort of way, a light lilac, but the other way you turn your nail and it is a light lime...love it!!!</li>
            <li> The color is BEAUTIFUL, I get a lot of complaints.</li>
            <li> Love the color &amp; looks amazing over or under a coat of&lt;br /&gt;NLS63--Chicago Champagne Toast. Color is purple w/green irridescence.</li>
