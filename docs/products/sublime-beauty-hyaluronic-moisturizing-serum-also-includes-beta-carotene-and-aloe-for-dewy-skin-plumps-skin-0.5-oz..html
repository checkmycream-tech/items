            <li>I was truly amazed by the packaging of the bottle, looks way more pricey.</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t get out any more product after just a couple of squirts, I unscrewed the top of the bottle and could see the bottom  </li>
            <li>I would say the elasticity seem to be slightly better</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after applying this serum, by the way.  </li>

            <li>I appreciate anything in my morning routine that is quick but effective.  </li>

            <li>All the products leave my skin soft, never greasy, and are doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>As I said, my skin looked so hydrated and felt so smooth, that I didn&#x27;t want to put anything on top of the serum, so</li>
            <li>and it absorbs very quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>The serum also absorbs very quickly.  </li>

            <li>I am excited to see what will happen after i continue using for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I have many more fine lines and wrinkles also, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is winter here now and keeping my skin in good condition is a constant battle!</li>
            <li>I really love that it comes in a pump (mine seems to pump out just a bit too much for one use</li>
            <li>they are true to their word and as we all know nothing happens and stay overnight</li>
            <li>It is helpful to me that it absorbs really quickly so I can move on to adding moisturizer.  </li>

            <li>It feels rich and has real substance, but not gooey.  </li>
            <li>so some things just aren&#x27;t the right match for me.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the serum is just right.</li>
            <li>It is loaded with nourishing ingredients that your skin will drink right up.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, but having the shiny cool looking bottle in my bathroom has already improved my love life and makes my &amp;#34;rugged&amp;#34; visage seem intentional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have been using it for a while now, and I think I can see my skin looking younger and more refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>

            <li>Some others seem to leave so much</li>

            <li>A little bit of this goes a long way and it makes my face look great.</li>
            <li>have just started using and have notice that my skin feels smoother and the dark circles under my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this opportunity to try a new product that I really like.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more plump and hydrated and less saggy.</li>
            <li>One pump was more than enough to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>It seems a little is all you need to make a huge difference in one&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li>It came in a cute little gift bag.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and break out easily, so I have be careful what products I use.</li>
            <li>I have two kiddos to get ready for school and have to get ready for work and such myself.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying out new things to help me not to look so old.</li>
            <li>I did notice slight differences in a day or two and they only got better as the days went on.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, pores are smaller, wrinkles and lines are much diminished.  </li>
            <li>Well when I came across this serum, I thought that maybe it would help me keep me looking young.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I purchased this serum for my aging 40 year old skin</li>
            <li>I do not have many wrinkles but my skin as has aged due to sun exposure</li>
            <li>After trying samples from various high end brands (you know the ones at departments stores that drain the blood from your face when you see the price?)</li>
            <li>I at least feel younger :)</li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and have tried numerous products that never gave me these results!</li>
            <li>i am willing to try, however; i do have to be careful because i have very dry sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li>It will take a little while to see how much change I may have in my skin</li>

            <li> I am noticing a great result with the Hyaluronic serum and after a sunburn it re hydrates my skin so nice</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I have been using it for a while now, and I think I can see my skin looking younger and more refreshed. I do not have many wrinkles but my skin as has aged due to sun exposure and I think this has taken a few years off the look of it. My sister even commented and asked what i was using so she noticed. Smooth texture and makes me feel and look great! Love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum as a sample fore review and evaluation and I really like it! It is winter here now and keeping my skin in good condition is a constant battle! I have combination skin and this serum has helped to keep it hydrated! I like the consistency (a little goes a long way!) and it absorbs very quickly into the skin and once it does there is no greasy or oily residue. I really love that it comes in a pump (mine seems to pump out just a bit too much for one use so I try to do a half pump! ) and will last a long time. Overall I am very happy with this and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I apply this serum, let it dry and then apply my face cream. I have been using the serum for about three weeks and see some improvements. My skin feels tighter looks rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice packaging. It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to get all of the product out of the bottle for a change. Some others seem to leave so much inside.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I could use it once a week and still see the effects</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product from Sublime Beauty. All their products work beautifully and that is the important thing. I have used their retinol as well and my face feels tighter and so hydrated. No more dry or combination skin. I love their products and the pretty little bottles they come in. They look so nice sitting on my bathroom counter. You have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Provides a great amount of moisture and helps diminish pores.  It is always the first thing I apply to my face, but lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and it feels so rich, much better than other watery HAs that I bought</li>
            <li> Just like any other cream.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to be able to get this Hyaluronic Acid Serum from a promotional offer for my unbiased and honest review. I have been trying to do for myself as my family has been taken care of for so long. I now am a grandma, but don&#x27;t want to look like one. I have been trying out new things to help me not to look so old. LOL! Well when I came across this serum, I thought that maybe it would help me keep me looking young. I love the pleasant smell of the serum. It is a clear gel that goes on smoothly and dries pretty quickly. I really like how it makes my face not look like it full of pores. My face looks so much smoother. Younger really, and my complexion is looking so much better since I have been using it. Thank you for this opportunity to try a new product that I really like. Looking forward to my morning routine!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, but having the shiny cool looking bottle in my bathroom has already improved my love life and makes my &amp;#34;rugged&amp;#34; visage seem intentional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it works even better if you actually open the bottle, but it&#x27;s already a great bargain for me! I might buy another just to be able to try it but keep my magic bottle intact!</li>
            <li> I was truly amazed by the packaging of the bottle, looks way more pricey. I starting to see wrinkles around my eye crease area over recent years. The product owner offered me this product to help with that, I have seen positive results and I am sure it will get better as I have only been using this product for a couple of months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t get out any more product after just a couple of squirts, I unscrewed the top of the bottle and could see the bottom  I pushed on the visible bottom and it broke through to an empty chamber.  I WONT&amp;#34; BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  Please stop writing me for my opinion.  A RIP-OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES ANYONE test these cosmetic probles///for real?</li>
            <li> I feel like I have finally found the wonderful combination of products that make my skin look great! If you combine this serum with sublime vitamin c serum they are amazing! I also love the collage serum! Too many great serums to choose from, that work so great! I am 42 years old and have tried numerous products that never gave me these results!</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to post the following review in her own words!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seemed dull and \\&quot;old looking\\&quot; recently.  I started researching Hyaluronic Serum products.  After trying samples from various high end brands (you know the ones at departments stores that drain the blood from your face when you see the price?) Sublime Beauty caught my eye after reading their awesome reviews and very detailed product information. (Don&#x27;t you hate it when you have no idea WHAT you are putting on your face??.  Ofcourse the amazing price for the great value was a huge \\&quot;eye catcher\\&quot; also!  While I&#x27;ve only been using it a little while, I noticed an instant glow and \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; look to my skin! I expect my skin will look even better and better!  I also like the packaging..the pump seems much more \\&quot;sterile\\&quot; and easy to get just the right amount!  The texture is smooth and silky, yet not \\&quot;too thin\\&quot;.  It feels rich and has real substance, but not gooey.  It seems a little is all you need to make a huge difference in one&#x27;s skin! I can&#x27;t wait to try Sublime Beauty&#x27;s other products!  They have me as a loyal customer!  Keep the great products coming!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Christine</li>
            <li> I am 63, from San Diego so spent a lot of time in the sun growing up and now have sun damage.  I was hoping for a product that would help the elasticity and deal with the damaged skin.  I finished the product of .5 oz with using faithfully for 2 times a day.  I would say the elasticity seem to be slightly better but there was no noticeable change to the skin itself or the fine wrinkle lines or appearance.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I am off to a wonderful start with this product.  I enjoy trying new products but I&#x27;m always a little nervous.  I have sensitive skin so some things just aren&#x27;t the right match for me.  I keep hearing great things about Hyaluronic acid so I wanted to give this stuff a try.  I was very excited to find that this product causes me no irritation at all.  Feels great!  I started out trying this serum on the back of my hand just in case.  I had no issues whatsoever.  The second day I got brave and tried it on my face.  It feels great on my face too.  It will take a little while to see how much change I may have in my skin so I&#x27;ll have to follow up on that.  I will say that it smells great...very light scent that is almost not noticed at all...I like that.  The serum also absorbs very quickly.  It is supposed to be used prior to a moisturizer. It is helpful to me that it absorbs really quickly so I can move on to adding moisturizer.  I have two kiddos to get ready for school and have to get ready for work and such myself.  I appreciate anything in my morning routine that is quick but effective.  I love how my skin feels after applying this serum, by the way.  Extra smooth.  I&#x27;m looking forward to adding other Sublime Beauty products to my routine if this is an indicator of their quality.</li>
            <li> I use as directed every morning and every night and have not seen any results.  Was hoping for just a little bit of improvement but haven&#x27;t seen any.  Will keep using until empty and write a revision to this if I see changes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It smells good and feels really nice.  I haven&#x27;t been using it that long but think it is working.  I at least feel younger :)</li>
            <li> This is a really nice high end serum for your face. I love the great container it came in and how it was packed. It came in a cute little gift bag. A little bit of this goes a long way and it makes my face look great. It has firmed my face and tightened it while making it look younger and more youthful. My skin has become more softer and smoother after using this. This absorbs nicely into my skin and does not leave it greasy or oily and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film either. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to my skin care regimen.  I alternate this with the retinol and collagen serums.  All the products leave my skin soft, never greasy, and are doing a great job.  My skin is soft, pores are smaller, wrinkles and lines are much diminished.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this line!</li>
            <li> I am getting older so anything that says it can make my skin look better i am willing to try, however; i do have to be careful because i have very dry sensitive skin on my face. This serum did no burn or irritate my skin. I went on  smooth and was not greasy after applying which i hate have anything greasy feeling on me. It soak into my  skin quickly which to me is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I have just started using and have notice that my skin feels smoother and the dark circles under my eyes look better. I am excited to see what will happen after i continue using for a couple weeks. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion and have given that, The review is solely my thoughts on this product and not biased in any way.</li>
            <li> I order Sublime Beauty products regularly and have found both the products and the company to be top notch.  Since I&#x27;ve been using their products my skin texture and appearance have improved quite a bit.  If I have a question about any product, a quick email to them always generates a prompt return email that answers my question fully.  I am very satisfied and plan to be a happy long term customer!</li>
            <li> This is my second Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  It is one of the best favors I have ever done for my skin!  I was quite surprised how quickly I saw results when began using it.  My face feels so much smoother, wonderfully hydrated, and much more fresh looking.  To say I will continue using it is an understatement.  I am very happy to have discovered Sublime Beauty!</li>
            <li> I really love the hyalauronic serum. It makes my face feel much tighter and smoother.  It is a Great product!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I have only been using it for three days and can already see a difference.  I am almost 52 and spent a lot of time in the sun until around 40.  I highly recommend this product and with purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I love using Hyaluronic Acid on my skin, so I was very happy to be able to this serum for my honest review. I have noticed that as I get older (I am now in my late 40s), my face looks old and dry. I have many more fine lines and wrinkles also, especially around my eyes. I have very sensitive skin and break out easily, so I have be careful what products I use. I had no breakouts or irritation with this serum. I really like the consistency of this serum. It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin and it&#x27;s nice that it has a pump instead of an eye dropper. I find that easier to use. One pump was more than enough to cover my entire face. I love how hydrated and youthful my face looks after using this for 2 weeks. It also makes my face feel so smooth. I did not put a moisturizer on after the serum, because I wanted to see how my skin reacted to the serum alone. As I said, my skin looked so hydrated and felt so smooth, that I didn&#x27;t want to put anything on top of the serum, so I know that this is really working.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best product lines I have ever used.  they are true to their word and as we all know nothing happens and stay overnight so dont fret.  I did notice slight differences in a day or two and they only got better as the days went on.  The key to this is to use it like directed.  Dont just use it whenever.  Once you start keep it up.  I have noticed lines disappearing and my skin looking succulent.  I am feeling like a model.  I did not say looking...lol But I feel like a spend hours getting my skin treated at a spa.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Received product extremely quickly! Great product that has a wonderful texture. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Once again Sublime Beauty has impressed me with another wonderful product. I purchased this serum for my aging 40 year old skin and I love it.  The pump is a great way to dispense a serum.  Unlike the dropper style bottles the pump prevents contamination and dispenses the prefect amount of product with no risk of spills.  The consistency of the serum is just right. Not too runny and not too thick.  It absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  It is loaded with nourishing ingredients that your skin will drink right up.  My skin feels more plump and hydrated and less saggy. I have had many compliments on my skin looking healthier since I started using hyaluronic acid serum twice daily.  It is a staple to any beauty routine.  I purchased this product during a promotion to share my experience with amazon shoppers.  I hope you found this review helpful.</li>
