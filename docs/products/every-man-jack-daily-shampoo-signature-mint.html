            <li>Excellent shampoo, but the picture shows two bottles.</li>
            <li>very good product.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job on your hair and the wife loves the smell.  </li>

            <li>Great smell, great product at a fraction of the price you would pay in department stores.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells good, but noticed my scalp itches when I use it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband after he tried the Every Man Jack body wash and loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worry not, this is the good stuff.</li>
            <li>also use Brylcreem in my hair, and it does a good job of removing it without drying my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washes away easily and feels great in my hair.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo that leaves your head feeling tingly clean.</li>
            <li>Smells GREAT and gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Great scent and makes my hair feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>I remember buying this when it came in a transparent bottle with a wood finished top.</li>
            <li>Love the Every Man Jack collection</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both enjoy this shampoo!</li>
            <li>the product is very clean and a not too overly fragrant.</li>
            <li>Nice to have the cool minty tingle during the summer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good at getting the job done.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the hair and feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li>First times were kind of fine, but after using it about a 2 weeks or more,  a lot of dandruff started to show up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very loyal customer now</li>
            <li>The bottle sits nice in a shower rack and the smell is crisp but not over powering.  </li>
            <li>Strong mint smell and rich texture.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and he loves using it, so we&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Overall, this shampoo turned out to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>My first favorite is Herban Cowboy.</li>
            <li>It gives me a really clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great product that I bought more for my two adult sons.</li>
            <li>My new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>The mint feels amazing on my head and keeps my head feeling cool for a short while after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However after reading the ingredients more closely I saw that one of the first items is Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate which is no less toxic and harmful than Sodium Lauryl</li>
            <li>I really liked that shampoo, but this isn&#x27;t really the same thing.</li>
            <li>Smaller than most EMJ bottles</li>
            <li>Love this company&#x27;s deodorant, but going with a different shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does have a kind of tingle to it, due to the mint.</li>
            <li>It can keep my hair clean for more than a whole day, which none of other brands does.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shipping for this was lightning fast.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good shampoo, a little runny consistency like American Crew, wish it were thicker like Redken.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but it might work better for other folks.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple shampoos that don&#x27;t dry my scalp out and this one works amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in finding a more natural shampoo with less chemicals and heard about the Every Man Jack line.  </li>
            <li>It’s a gamble trying new products online.</li>
            <li>Like other Every Man Jack products, it lathers up really good with just a little bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I shower 2 times a day and keep my hair pretty short.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is the mint smell is a little strong but after a while I got used to it.</li>
            <li>A little drop goes a long way so paying more is definitely justifiable.  </li>
            <li>I mainly put up with the short lasting mint scent because I figure that&#x27;s the price you pay for using something that&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>( I live in dry climate, Western Colorado) , so maybe that is why?</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It reminds me of some of the Japanese shampoo that I used before. Really cleans the hair and feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I remember buying this when it came in a transparent bottle with a wood finished top. I really liked that shampoo, but this isn&#x27;t really the same thing. I&#x27;m not a fan of this newer version. The smell is different and it left my hair feeling stringy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again and this bottle has been relegated to the guest bathroom for back up.</li>
            <li> Smaller than most EMJ bottles the product is very clean and a not too overly fragrant. Washes away easily and feels great in my hair.</li>
            <li> very good product.  will re-order</li>
            <li> Was under the impression this came with 2 bottles since the picture shows two. Could have gotten it cheaper elsewhere.  Bought here thinking I got a deal.  Not so!</li>
            <li> Does a great job on your hair and the wife loves the smell.  Everyone happy!</li>
            <li> It can keep my hair clean for more than a whole day, which none of other brands does. I feel very comfortable with it. The problem is it is so hard to buy in store.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thin, so be careful pouring. Great scent and makes my hair feel fresh. Nice to have the cool minty tingle during the summer.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but noticed my scalp itches when I use it. I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but it might work better for other folks. ( I live in dry climate, Western Colorado) , so maybe that is why?</li>
            <li> Strong mint smell and rich texture. It&#x27;s such a great product that I bought more for my two adult sons.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband after he tried the Every Man Jack body wash and loved it. He&#x27;s never been too picky about personal care products, but once he tried this brand he vowed to never go back. This stuff smells great and he loves using it, so we&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year now and it&#x27;s pretty good at getting the job done. I mainly put up with the short lasting mint scent because I figure that&#x27;s the price you pay for using something that&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However after reading the ingredients more closely I saw that one of the first items is Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate which is no less toxic and harmful than Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to finally trust a brand and quit my search of alternative and solid body products. I guess the search continues as I won&#x27;t be purchasing from this sneaky company again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that leaves your head feeling tingly clean.</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT and gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li> I shower 2 times a day and keep my hair pretty short.  I have tried multiple shampoos that don&#x27;t dry my scalp out and this one works amazing.  The mint feels amazing on my head and keeps my head feeling cool for a short while after getting out of the shower.  The bottle sits nice in a shower rack and the smell is crisp but not over powering.  This will be my shampoo for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> First times were kind of fine, but after using it about a 2 weeks or more,  a lot of dandruff started to show up.  Just a simple switch to another shampoo stopped that.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shampoo, a little runny consistency like American Crew, wish it were thicker like Redken.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s free of stuff that we know is bad for us, but this stuff is harder to rinse out of my hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean.  Love this company&#x27;s deodorant, but going with a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the Every Man Jack collection</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo. I&#x27;ve transition to almost all Every Man Jack products now. My first favorite is Herban Cowboy. What I can&#x27;t get from them I get from Every Man Jack. I&#x27;m a very loyal customer now</li>
            <li> The shipping for this was lightning fast.  Overall, this shampoo turned out to be a great product.  I was interested in finding a more natural shampoo with less chemicals and heard about the Every Man Jack line.  A little drop goes a long way so paying more is definitely justifiable.  The only drawback is the mint smell is a little strong but after a while I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; even tingles</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great smell, great product at a fraction of the price you would pay in department stores. My go to shampoo for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to minimize the chemicals my husband uses in his everyday products and stumbled across this line. My husband and I both enjoy this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, but the picture shows two bottles. You only get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon or the seller should fix this so it&#x27;s not visual misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> It’s a gamble trying new products online. Especially those that come in black bottles with minimal design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worry not, this is the good stuff. It’s a mint scent, and if that isn’t your thing, you’re not going to like this. Like other Every Man Jack products, it lathers up really good with just a little bit of shampoo. It does have a kind of tingle to it, due to the mint. It gives me a really clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Brylcreem in my hair, and it does a good job of removing it without drying my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve bought this twice now, and will again soon when I need to.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! It cleans everything out of your hair and leaves you feeling refreshed with a cooling effect.</li>
