            <li>I tried some dedicated frizz control products, but based on a suggestion I read somewhere, I decided to try this as a leave-in conditioner and it works great.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s nothing really great about it.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>Would be good for travel if you can spare the room in your luggage.</li>
            <li>and I can say your hair feels good after you use it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good for about eight hours of no-frizz</li>
            <li>she doesn&#x27;t stop telling me how good this stuff is for her hair.</li>
            <li>This is so good.</li>
            <li>I think good</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good conditioner without spending a ton on salon products! :)</li>
            <li>I used to have perfect hair before I got pregnant, and after giving birth, it was out of control.</li>
            <li>Love Aveeno when I seen they had a s&amp;c I had to try them, they are great</li>
            <li>I fell in love with my hair again after 2 years of hating it!</li>

            <li>This conditioner works amazingly well with my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice to order it and not have to beat the crowd or stand in line.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and is a good conditioner.  </li>

            <li>Thanks for a good product, Aveeno!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel super healthy and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Until I discovered Aveeno as a free sample in the mail!</li>
            <li>I still like it but switched to this Aveeno shampoo because it moisturizes my hair more.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>During shipping the top was open and about a quarter spilled out and Amazon took great care of it for me!</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I need to get more at some point.</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t be able to use this product without getting headaches.  </li>
            <li>My husband is using this instead of Burt&#x27;s Bees because is moisturizes his hair better.</li>
            <li>I started to buy more that I can use it also for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love it&lt;</li>
            <li>My hair got softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>The comparison could not be more misleading.</li>
            <li>Many years ago, an Aveeno product almost literally saved my skin - the oatmeal</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I really love the Aveeno Nourish Spray</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the lovely scent and the way it leaves my hair feeling and smelling.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I  switched to this Aveeno conditioner and love the way it leaves my hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is OK with me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Healthy, shiny, smooth and snarl free hair!</li>
            <li>This product does not make my hair better, more shinny or smooth.</li>
            <li>Love Aveeno products and thought I would give the conditioner a try and so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo and conditioner for the first time, and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to be washed out by water.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft without weighing it down, and it smells great without being too much - very nice!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy as quick!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this conditioner twice now, and I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Does nothing for me, it leaves a white residue, I was anticipating great results</li>
            <li>No matter which shampoo you use, this conditioner makes the hair smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>If you are like me and you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative for conditioner, then I would recommend Aveeno.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair has been good.</li>
            <li>Light and Clean.  </li>
            <li>I tried on sections of clean hair as a rinse out conditioner after letting sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo, but I love the conditioner.</li>
            <li>We are swimming almost daily the 8 warmer months of the year, either in the pool or in the Ocean and so a good shampoo is a must have.</li>
            <li>but I will post a link to the full list of ingredients on a comment to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair is so much more shiny and soft, just after the first use it was more shiny.</li>
            <li>It has the ability to moisturize chlorine or sea water exposed hair and quickly restore it to its optimal condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it, so I kept using it for a week and saw a major change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first wash with Aveeno Nourish &amp; Moisturize shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>its worth the money</li>
            <li>I had hoped it would smell (if at all) like something more natural, like fruit or coconut.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent, too.</li>
            <li>First time ordering from Amazon, but previous purchases of this item have always made me happy.</li>
            <li>So far my hair feels pretty healthy</li>
            <li>This makes my hair soft and pretty :) I have tried EVERYTHING from Sallys.</li>
            <li>&quot; was well-reviewed on Amazon and was very reasonably priced, so I bought a bottle and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found this product at Target, etc., and the price seems very reasonable off Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this really makes my hair smooth and shine!!</li>
            <li>i would swear by this fosho ;D</li>
            <li>I tried so many different products and types of hair care; nothing worked.    </li>
            <li>My advice to you readers who are interested in trying this product is to go to walmart or some retail store and buy it from there.</li>
            <li>Straw feeling never came back either :)</li>
            <li>i Love the content but would  prefer to get a bigger bottle...</li>
            <li>Will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>My hair was so silky, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Tried this as an add on and really like it!  </li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, for my hair is definitely softer with more body.</li>
            <li>I can skip a day showering and my hair still looks and feels super soft and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It smells good and soft on hair, less hair fall, i use the conditioner as leave-on abd they don&#x27;t feel sticky</li>
            <li>You can feel how soft the hair turns while washing off the conditioner on your first use!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and detangles very well.  </li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied about it.</li>
            <li>Very feminine, in an old-school sort of way.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the conditioner much</li>
            <li>and it is much silkier</li>
            <li>Granted, I use more products in my hair than the average person, but it&#x27;s still something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So - back to the drugstore to one of my tried and true brands.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this washes out completely and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy like some other conditioners.</li>
            <li>The product is readily available elsewhere, but if you use it (which anyone with curly hair or dry hair should), then order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>it works better than the Aveda conditioners I have tried, and is a definite step above drug-store grade conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for an older person ,after used once she told me she will never used it again .</li>
            <li>There is a long list of ingredients and, as far as I can tell, most of them appear to be &#x27;natural&#x27;: fruit oils, oat meal, wheat germ oil.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high on this, so I try and catch it on sale.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it when I decided to try getting this</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is a bit high, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Aveeno Nourish Spray.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>, that tends to be frizzy because curly hair is naturally drier than straight hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal softness after leaving this on for about 20min.</li>
            <li>I needed some new shampoo and conditioner, so I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>ok so my hairs really fussy to say the least</li>
            <li>Also made my hair super frizzy when dry.</li>
            <li>I cannot use many brands, usually others leave my hair in tangles</li>
            <li>53 YRS OLD!</li>
            <li>In a pinch I also use it for shaving cream on my legs, and it even leaves my skin silky soft!</li>
            <li>They nourish my fine hair, but don&#x27;t weigh it down, making my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>The product line makes your hair soft and smooth w/o weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It weighs my hair down rather than moke it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I literally cannot say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li>i have curly hair and it tends to dry if i don&#x27;t use the right product.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and was an insta-fix when I trusted my fiance to bleach my hair and he messed up.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes and fragrances, avoid this product.</li>
            <li>i like this conditioner.my hair soft and shiny when i use this.i like aveeno product</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used this product for 4 months.</li>
            <li>The conditioner contains many chemicals that are only present in much more expensive conditioners.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m completely off the hairspray/sulfates merry-go-round of hair damage.  </li>
            <li>If you order from here, you won&#x27;t get a full bottle, maybe half bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner based on the good review on Amazon, especially the comparison with Shiseido as I am an Asian with long thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helpful for dry and damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li>The scent is hardly noticeable, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I have spent six times as much for inferior products.  </li>
            <li>It softens my hair but does not weigh it down, which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing but wouldnt buy it again because she&#x27;s just scraping by on her pay checks, so i decided to try it, im just useing the conditioner right now and holy crap</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s worth, some writing on the bottle claims that the ACTIVE NATURALS formula is scientifically proven to nourish dry, damaged hair back to life in just three washes.</li>

            <li> Light and Clean.  </li>
            <li> I tried on sections of clean hair as a rinse out conditioner after letting sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo, but I love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> We are swimming almost daily the 8 warmer months of the year, either in the pool or in the Ocean and so a good shampoo is a must have.</li>
            <li> but I will post a link to the full list of ingredients on a comment to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair is so much more shiny and soft, just after the first use it was more shiny.</li>
            <li> It has the ability to moisturize chlorine or sea water exposed hair and quickly restore it to its optimal condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked it, so I kept using it for a week and saw a major change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first wash with Aveeno Nourish &amp; Moisturize shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> its worth the money</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would smell (if at all) like something more natural, like fruit or coconut.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh scent, too.</li>
            <li> First time ordering from Amazon, but previous purchases of this item have always made me happy.</li>
            <li> So far my hair feels pretty healthy</li>
            <li> This makes my hair soft and pretty :) I have tried EVERYTHING from Sallys.</li>
            <li> &quot; was well-reviewed on Amazon and was very reasonably priced, so I bought a bottle and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found this product at Target, etc., and the price seems very reasonable off Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this really makes my hair smooth and shine!!</li>
            <li> i would swear by this fosho ;D</li>
            <li> I tried so many different products and types of hair care; nothing worked.    </li>
            <li> My advice to you readers who are interested in trying this product is to go to walmart or some retail store and buy it from there.</li>
            <li> Straw feeling never came back either :)</li>
            <li> i Love the content but would  prefer to get a bigger bottle...</li>
            <li> Will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My hair was so silky, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Tried this as an add on and really like it!  </li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, for my hair is definitely softer with more body.</li>
            <li> I can skip a day showering and my hair still looks and feels super soft and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It smells good and soft on hair, less hair fall, i use the conditioner as leave-on abd they don&#x27;t feel sticky</li>
            <li> You can feel how soft the hair turns while washing off the conditioner on your first use!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and detangles very well.  </li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied about it.</li>
            <li> Very feminine, in an old-school sort of way.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the conditioner much</li>
            <li> and it is much silkier</li>
            <li> Granted, I use more products in my hair than the average person, but it&#x27;s still something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So - back to the drugstore to one of my tried and true brands.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this washes out completely and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy like some other conditioners.</li>
            <li> The product is readily available elsewhere, but if you use it (which anyone with curly hair or dry hair should), then order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it works better than the Aveda conditioners I have tried, and is a definite step above drug-store grade conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for an older person ,after used once she told me she will never used it again .</li>
            <li> There is a long list of ingredients and, as far as I can tell, most of them appear to be &#x27;natural&#x27;: fruit oils, oat meal, wheat germ oil.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high on this, so I try and catch it on sale.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it when I decided to try getting this</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is a bit high, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Aveeno Nourish Spray.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> , that tends to be frizzy because curly hair is naturally drier than straight hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal softness after leaving this on for about 20min.</li>
            <li> I needed some new shampoo and conditioner, so I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> ok so my hairs really fussy to say the least</li>
            <li> Also made my hair super frizzy when dry.</li>
            <li> I cannot use many brands, usually others leave my hair in tangles</li>
            <li> 53 YRS OLD!</li>
            <li> In a pinch I also use it for shaving cream on my legs, and it even leaves my skin silky soft!</li>
            <li> They nourish my fine hair, but don&#x27;t weigh it down, making my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> The product line makes your hair soft and smooth w/o weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It weighs my hair down rather than moke it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I literally cannot say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> i have curly hair and it tends to dry if i don&#x27;t use the right product.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and was an insta-fix when I trusted my fiance to bleach my hair and he messed up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes and fragrances, avoid this product.</li>
            <li> i like this conditioner.my hair soft and shiny when i use this.i like aveeno product</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used this product for 4 months.</li>
            <li> The conditioner contains many chemicals that are only present in much more expensive conditioners.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m completely off the hairspray/sulfates merry-go-round of hair damage.  </li>
            <li> If you order from here, you won&#x27;t get a full bottle, maybe half bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner based on the good review on Amazon, especially the comparison with Shiseido as I am an Asian with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helpful for dry and damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li> The scent is hardly noticeable, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> I have spent six times as much for inferior products.  </li>
            <li> It softens my hair but does not weigh it down, which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing but wouldnt buy it again because she&#x27;s just scraping by on her pay checks, so i decided to try it, im just useing the conditioner right now and holy crap</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s worth, some writing on the bottle claims that the ACTIVE NATURALS formula is scientifically proven to nourish dry, damaged hair back to life in just three washes.</li>
            <li> I use it with the shampoo, and it makes my hair soft and not dry like some other products I have used that promised &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; but still left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, as I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any kind of cosmetic product before!</li>
            <li> and I like it very much for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really damaged by repetitive color and perm.  </li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner line that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why this is so highly rated here.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and straight hair that&#x27;s on the dry side.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is so thick that I have to remove the capsule, turn the bottle upside down, shake it incessantly before a large quantity of solid cream falls off.</li>
            <li> Only problem i have noticed is that my hair is not as sleek as with other conidtioners.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY LONG WAVY HAIR WITH TENDENCY TO FRIZZ</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I FINGER COMB, LET DRY</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> Dry hair is an issue in the Rocky Mountains but this product helps keep frizz and dryness at bay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using [[ASIN:B000FBZLHG Nature&#x27;s Gate Nourishing Shampoo for Dry or Frizzy Hair with Hemp, (18 fl oz) (532 ml)]] followed by this conditioner</li>
            <li> Then, after rinsing, my hair feels greasy, and when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s nothing awful about it; my hair isn&#x27;t worse than usual, but I was expecting a bit more considering all the great reviews</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is soft because I rotate my shampoo/conditioner and do a lot to my hair.</li>
            <li> I returned because my hair did not like it at all; hair became dry and crunchy immediately after use!</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, shinier, and less frizzy since using it for several months.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, and I need a de-tangler, moisturizer and conditioner, this works well with the shampoo, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got curly hair that tends to be dry, Aveeno makes my hair much less dry</li>
            <li> Upon applying it to my wet hair in the shower, my head was engulfed in a cloud of cloying perfume</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than, ever since I gave birth to my son, my hair is uncontrollable.</li>
            <li> A Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also have a LOT of hair, and a little of this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like this product causes a bit of build-up when used with other products.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day and it keeps the frizzy&#x27;s away.</li>
            <li> I have extremely damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair turns very rough if I over wash with shampoo.</li>
            <li> Aveeno keeps my thick hair from being coarse and dry without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again and definitely will not recommend it to anyone with thick hair like myself.</li>
            <li> At least half of the product was leaked and I felt like I only got half the amount of shampoo in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The shampoo keeps your hair less tangled and therefore less damage caused by pulling your hair by brushing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not noticeably softer or less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Did not enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair</li>
            <li> So I had a credit amount on my amazon and decided to get her a few bottles of it.</li>
            <li> It has the least chemicals than other Brands.</li>
            <li> have very thick, long hair that verges on the frizzy side, and this conditioner just does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with naturally thick and slightly curly hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t frizz out when air drying and it softer than usual.  </li>
            <li> For years my conditioner of choice has been Nexxus Humectress, but recently Humectress has gotten annoyingly expensive, so I jumped online and looked at conditioner reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would usually use Herbal Essences or whatever smelled nicest from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then a small dollop of this again as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it does not make my hair worse.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find anything that will help with making it less straw and crispy like.</li>
            <li> but it sucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While fragrant, this conditioner is pleasantly, delicately and discretely so, suggesting &#x27;tropical fruit&#x27;.</li>
            <li> But it smells so bad my eyes watered, and the perfume stink stays with you for way to long.</li>
            <li> and I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Aveeno bath powder contributed a lot to my recovery from some terrible skin disorder that left me with a permanent intolerance to artificial fragrances among other things.</li>
            <li> Seems unfair.</li>
            <li> I think this product is too expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> I did not go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> he looks stupid</li>
            <li> and she was like holy crap</li>
            <li> However, Amazon&#x27;s packaging was very bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Aveeno keeps my thick hair from being coarse and dry without weighing it down. Very creamy and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> ok so my hairs really fussy to say the least and my sister had used aveeno shampoo and conditioner before and she was like holy crap this stuff is amazing but wouldnt buy it again because she&#x27;s just scraping by on her pay checks, so i decided to try it, im just useing the conditioner right now and holy crap my hair is so much more shiny and soft, just after the first use it was more shiny. i would swear by this fosho ;D its worth the money and you can get just about anywhere.      btw who ever posted the pic of that dude from twilight i shun you xP he looks stupid</li>
            <li> The conditioner is actually great. A Little goes a long way. There is no smell... But I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is soft because I rotate my shampoo/conditioner and do a lot to my hair. But I like it. It has the least chemicals than other Brands.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this conditioner twice now, and I really enjoy it.  I have very curly hair, that tends to be frizzy because curly hair is naturally drier than straight hair.  It moisturizes and detangles very well.  I do feel like this product causes a bit of build-up when used with other products.  Granted, I use more products in my hair than the average person, but it&#x27;s still something to be aware of.  The price is a bit high on this, so I try and catch it on sale. Would be good for travel if you can spare the room in your luggage.</li>
            <li> My hair is not in the best of shape.So i decided to try these and let me tell you!!!! This stuff is great!It hydrates your hair and make&#x27;s it soft!Smell&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than, ever since I gave birth to my son, my hair is uncontrollable. I used to have perfect hair before I got pregnant, and after giving birth, it was out of control. I tried so many different products and types of hair care; nothing worked.    Until I discovered Aveeno as a free sample in the mail! I fell in love with my hair again after 2 years of hating it! I purchased some shampoo and conditioner on Amazon and I&#x27;ve been so happy!    Healthy, shiny, smooth and snarl free hair! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Does everything conditioner should and I have nothing bad to say. Great price here on Amazon as it is 10-12 bucks at stores. Subscribe and save a great option for something like this! First time ordering from Amazon, but previous purchases of this item have always made me happy. I use this and Pantene interchangeably.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair has been good. It doesn&#x27;t frizz out when air drying and it softer than usual.  It also has a really good smell!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Aveeno Nourish moisture shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve used this product before and I can say your hair feels good after you use it. Like a tingling feeling after effect. However, Amazon&#x27;s packaging was very bad. The shampoo and conditioner leaked out of the packaging and soaked the cardboard packaging when I received it. At least half of the product was leaked and I felt like I only got half the amount of shampoo in the bottle. Seems unfair. My friend also ordered from Amazon and confirms the same leak from the shampoo/conditioner. My advice to you readers who are interested in trying this product is to go to walmart or some retail store and buy it from there. If you order from here, you won&#x27;t get a full bottle, maybe half bottle. Very unsatisfied about it.</li>
            <li> My hair is really damaged by repetitive color and perm.  Before I tried this shampoo, dove (intensive repair) was my fave.  I still like it but switched to this Aveeno shampoo because it moisturizes my hair more.  Even after just one wash, I felt the difference.  The shampoo keeps your hair less tangled and therefore less damage caused by pulling your hair by brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I cannot use many brands, usually others leave my hair in tangles and I&#x27;ve had no problems with Aveeno. During shipping the top was open and about a quarter spilled out and Amazon took great care of it for me!</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. I need to get more at some point. It made my hair soft and was an insta-fix when I trusted my fiance to bleach my hair and he messed up. Went from straw back to it&#x27;s normal softness after leaving this on for about 20min. Straw feeling never came back either :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner on Amazon after reading the reviews.  It really is a wonderful conditioner. I have spent six times as much for inferior products.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy without weighing it down.  I bought the Nourish Plus Moisturize shampoo after purchasing the conditioner.  I really like the shampoo, but I love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner for the first time, and am very pleased.  Will buy again.  They nourish my fine hair, but don&#x27;t weigh it down, making my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair i Love the content but would  prefer to get a bigger bottle... Since its so good...!!</li>
            <li> For years my conditioner of choice has been Nexxus Humectress, but recently Humectress has gotten annoyingly expensive, so I jumped online and looked at conditioner reviews.  \\&quot;Aveeno Nourish+Moisturize\\&quot; was well-reviewed on Amazon and was very reasonably priced, so I bought a bottle and gave it a try.  Upon applying it to my wet hair in the shower, my head was engulfed in a cloud of cloying perfume, that reminded me of the stuff my grandma used back in the 1960&#x27;s.  Very feminine, in an old-school sort of way.  I had hoped it would smell (if at all) like something more natural, like fruit or coconut.  But I won&#x27;t be able to use this product without getting headaches.  If only Aveeno had an unscented alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 24 ingredients listed for this product, notice that ingredient #19 is \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes and fragrances, avoid this product.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this instead of Burt&#x27;s Bees because is moisturizes his hair better. I started to buy more that I can use it also for my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not like the way it left my hair, also there was a chemical smell with it.  Did not enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I returned because my hair did not like it at all; hair became dry and crunchy immediately after use! I tried on sections of clean hair as a rinse out conditioner after letting sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, and I need a de-tangler, moisturizer and conditioner, this works well with the shampoo, too.</li>
            <li> i like this conditioner.my hair soft and shiny when i use this.i like aveeno product so this is one of them which i like.</li>
            <li> I rate it a five.  It is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner-- it works better than the Aveda conditioners I have tried, and is a definite step above drug-store grade conditioners.  My hair is so soft after I use it.  I also have a LOT of hair, and a little of this product goes a long way.  I haven&#x27;t found this product at Target, etc., and the price seems very reasonable off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner.  Has none of the ingredients that I am avoiding, but detangles perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice to order it and not have to beat the crowd or stand in line. The product is readily available elsewhere, but if you use it (which anyone with curly hair or dry hair should), then order it from Amazon. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Love Aveeno when I seen they had a s&amp;c I had to try them, they are great I love how soft it makes my hair. Doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this product for 4 months. This product does not make my hair better, more shinny or smooth. On the other hand, it does not make my hair worse. I think this product is too expensive for the quality. I will not  purchase it again. But I don&#x27;t regret for trying it either.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and soft on hair, less hair fall, i use the conditioner as leave-on abd they don&#x27;t feel sticky</li>
            <li> Light and Clean.  Rinses well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff..i will buy agian.</li>
            <li> I have used this products for several years and I like it very much for my thick hair.  It softens my hair but does not weigh it down, which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND PRICE,  I HAVE VERY LONG WAVY HAIR WITH TENDENCY TO FRIZZ SO I DON&#x27;T BRUSH. AFTER 1ST USE OF CONDITIONER I FINGER COMB, LET DRY AND MY HAIR WAS MOVEABLE, BRUSHABLE THE DAY AFTER WITH NO FRIZZ.  FOUND MY CONDITIONER.  53 YRS OLD!</li>
            <li> Does nothing for me, it leaves a white residue, I was anticipating great results but it sucks. Won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this really makes my hair smooth and shine!! Love it and will always use it!</li>
            <li> I bought it for an older person ,after used once she told me she will never used it again .</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner line that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too dry. I&#x27;m a guy with naturally thick and slightly curly hair. I thought I would just have to deal with it until I used my sister&#x27;s Aveeno one day. I liked it, so I kept using it for a week and saw a major change. My hair got softer and more manageable. I decided to switch over to Aveeno full-time and haven&#x27;t looked back almost two years later.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this s*** works perfectly</li>
            <li> Love Aveeno products and thought I would give the conditioner a try and so far it&#x27;s great. Will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner, and I&#x27;m 4 washes in. I&#x27;m already in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some history... I have thin blonde hair and I tend to get split-ends. My hair sometimes feels brittle, frizzy and lacking in shine. I would usually use Herbal Essences or whatever smelled nicest from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash with Aveeno Nourish &amp; Moisturize shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a HUGE difference. My hair was so silky, soft and smooth. I kept harassing my boyfriend to touch my hair. Another bonus... my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy as quick! I can skip a day showering and my hair still looks and feels super soft and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this stuff! It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a few washes, I started developing a very itchy rash on my ears, neckline and forehead. As soon as I stopped using these products, the rash disappeared. Very disappointing, as I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any kind of cosmetic product before!</li>
            <li> Tried this as an add on and really like it!  The product line makes your hair soft and smooth w/o weighing it down. Dry hair is an issue in the Rocky Mountains but this product helps keep frizz and dryness at bay.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner based on the good review on Amazon, especially the comparison with Shiseido as I am an Asian with long thick hair. The comparison could not be more misleading. The conditioner is so thick that I have to remove the capsule, turn the bottle upside down, shake it incessantly before a large quantity of solid cream falls off. It weighs my hair down rather than moke it soft and smooth. I won&#x27;t buy it again and definitely will not recommend it to anyone with thick hair like myself.</li>
            <li> I use it with the shampoo, and it makes my hair soft and not dry like some other products I have used that promised &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; but still left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> The conditioner contains many chemicals that are only present in much more expensive conditioners.  They lock in moisture in the scalp and prevent flaking as well as give hair a shine.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, an Aveeno product almost literally saved my skin - the oatmeal Aveeno bath powder contributed a lot to my recovery from some terrible skin disorder that left me with a permanent intolerance to artificial fragrances among other things. But... back to the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot for my scalp to tolerate fragrant shampoos and conditioners but I found that I can use this one without a problem. We are swimming almost daily the 8 warmer months of the year, either in the pool or in the Ocean and so a good shampoo is a must have. We didn&#x27;t settle on any specific product but Aveeno&#x27;s is one that the two girls in our household suggested that we buy again. It has the ability to moisturize chlorine or sea water exposed hair and quickly restore it to its optimal condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what&#x27;s worth, some writing on the bottle claims that the ACTIVE NATURALS formula is scientifically proven to nourish dry, damaged hair back to life in just three washes. There is a long list of ingredients and, as far as I can tell, most of them appear to be &#x27;natural&#x27;: fruit oils, oat meal, wheat germ oil. I can&#x27;t have links here but I will post a link to the full list of ingredients on a comment to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While fragrant, this conditioner is pleasantly, delicately and discretely so, suggesting &#x27;tropical fruit&#x27;. To my surprise, my super-sensitive skin appears to tolerate it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the conditioner much but my wife and my daughter do and they are very happy with both.</li>
            <li> I needed some new shampoo and conditioner, so I decided to give this a try.  I LOVE IT!  I highly recommend this product, for my hair is definitely softer with more body.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel super healthy and it smells so good. I have very fine hair and this washes out completely and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy like some other conditioners. Only problem i have noticed is that my hair is not as sleek as with other conidtioners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helpful for dry and damaged hair like mine. Ever since I&#x27;ve switched to this brand, the condition of my hair has improved a lot</li>
            <li> i have curly hair and it tends to dry if i don&#x27;t use the right product. So far my hair feels pretty healthy so i will continue using the product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair silky soft and smooth. It is not heavy and rinses clean. I like the fresh scent, too. I&#x27;ll order this product again and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It untangled well, so it gets one star. But it smells so bad my eyes watered, and the perfume stink stays with you for way to long. Also made my hair super frizzy when dry. Will not buy this product again. PLEASE AVENO make an unscented product.</li>
            <li> I tried some dedicated frizz control products, but based on a suggestion I read somewhere, I decided to try this as a leave-in conditioner and it works great. I&#x27;m now using [[ASIN:B000FBZLHG Nature&#x27;s Gate Nourishing Shampoo for Dry or Frizzy Hair with Hemp, (18 fl oz) (532 ml)]] followed by this conditioner, some [[ASIN:B007CDSFKU Now Foods Certified Organic Argan Oil, 2 Oz]] after towel-drying, and then a small dollop of this again as a leave-in conditioner.  That&#x27;s good for about eight hours of no-frizz so I&#x27;m completely off the hairspray/sulfates merry-go-round of hair damage.  Thanks for a good product, Aveeno!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why this is so highly rated here. I had high hopes for it when I decided to try getting this but there&#x27;s nothing really great about it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, long hair that verges on the frizzy side, and this conditioner just does not work for me. The scent is hardly noticeable, which is fine with me. However, I feel like I have to use a ton of conditioner to get it to soak into my hair. Then, after rinsing, my hair feels greasy, and when it&#x27;s dry it&#x27;s not noticeably softer or less frizzy. I guess there&#x27;s nothing awful about it; my hair isn&#x27;t worse than usual, but I was expecting a bit more considering all the great reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - back to the drugstore to one of my tried and true brands. The price on Amazon is a bit high, too. (My local grocery store has a lower price.)</li>
            <li> I just love this product. You can feel how soft the hair turns while washing off the conditioner on your first use! Sometimes my hair turns very rough if I over wash with shampoo. No matter which shampoo you use, this conditioner makes the hair smooth as silk. Hairs will be even shiny when I straighten my hair. Great price too. I would definetely recommand this!</li>
            <li> I really love the Aveeno Nourish Spray so I tried the conditioner.  It&#x27;s ok.  I highly recommend the Aveeno Nourish Spray.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works amazingly well with my hair. My hair is soft and it smells amazing too! I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good conditioner without spending a ton on salon products! :)</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and is a good conditioner.  I use it every other day and it keeps the frizzy&#x27;s away.</li>
            <li> Great value for money, great scent, great conditioning... I literally cannot say enough positive things about this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> excellent product and quality.  Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> she doesn&#x27;t stop telling me how good this stuff is for her hair. So I had a credit amount on my amazon and decided to get her a few bottles of it. I did not go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw the comment says it works for Asian hair. I&#x27;m a big fan of Sassoon hair care, I also like the Shiseido line. I have really thick and straight hair that&#x27;s on the dry side. If you are like me and you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative for conditioner, then I would recommend Aveeno. This is the closet product I have found from drugstore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how nice my hair smells since switching to this product. My hair is softer, shinier, and less frizzy since using it for several months. In a pinch I also use it for shaving cream on my legs, and it even leaves my skin silky soft!</li>
            <li> I love the lovely scent and the way it leaves my hair feeling and smelling.  I do have very short hair so I&#x27;m not the best judge, but I will always use this one.</li>
            <li> It is the only product I use; shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve got curly hair that tends to be dry, Aveeno makes my hair much less dry and it is much silkier</li>
            <li> This is so good. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife said that.&lt;br /&gt;So I think good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I was using Matrix Sleek Conditioner which is much more expensive and was not moisturizing enough.  I  switched to this Aveeno conditioner and love the way it leaves my hair.  I will definitely keep using this one.</li>
            <li> The smell is OK with me. I use it together with the shampoo. It is easy to be washed out by water.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. It leaves my hair so soft without weighing it down, and it smells great without being too much - very nice!</li>
            <li> I go this stuff along with the matching shampoo and I am addicted to it. It makes my hair SO silky, people can&#x27;t stop petting it :D</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I have extremely damaged hair. ( Bleached multiple times,dyed multiple times,etc) It is very hard to find anything that will help with making it less straw and crispy like. This makes my hair soft and pretty :) I have tried EVERYTHING from Sallys. I love this stuff and will continue using it.</li>
