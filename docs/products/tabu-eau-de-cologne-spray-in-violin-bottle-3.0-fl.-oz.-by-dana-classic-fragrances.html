            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years and still love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always asked what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and to my amazement, many people have never heard of it.</li>

            <li>WHAT&#x27;S MORE, MY HUSBAND LOVES IT TOO, AND DOESN&#x27;T MIND WHEN I ORDER</li>
            <li>Love Tabu get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>It is currently my favorite of all perfumes I have and have tried.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this bottle of Tabu.</li>
            <li>created in 1932 by the legendary perfumer Jean Carles as the signature fragrance for The House of Dana perfumery founded the same year in Barcelona, Spain by Javier Sierraas.</li>
            <li>She owns more companies (75 of them) than any woman in America and probably the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I Just Love Tabu</li>
            <li>Great product, Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I bought them out, and loved it so much I had to have more .</li>
            <li>However it was the real thing and the price was good.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume and the only one that gets me so many compliments!!</li>
            <li>bottle is beautiful and lightly toned, an the liquid inside is a deep amber color.</li>
            <li>the perfume seemed fine.</li>
            <li>otherwise they were fine.</li>
            <li>It smelled so familiar to me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all sweet and flowery, nor does it make me smell like a birthday cake or a kid.</li>
            <li>The only regret I had was that I am not so good on sizes</li>
            <li>quickly look to see if I am around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this scent and it is the only sent I have worn for so many years.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped out quickly, and packed with care.  </li>
            <li>Apparently a whole new generation of women is discovering, wearing and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve bought up all the old products by now</li>
            <li>Brought back some nice memories.</li>
            <li>I still get compliment how it smell nice  TABU last all day while I am working keep me smelling nice all day long.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel sexy, but not like everybody more than a few feet away from me can smell it and go &amp;#34;oh wow.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful scent, still the same scent I wore during my teenage years.</li>
            <li>When I used Tabu again it brought back so many memories.  </li>
            <li>This smells different, more patchouli than anything.</li>
            <li>It is basically a tamed down, softer version of the original more aggressive formulation.</li>
            <li>It is basically a tamed down, softer version of the original more aggressive formulation.</li>
            <li>, it must have been some type of special eddition, the bottle is in the shape of a cello or violin type instrument and the box was not the standard black and white, but the size and quality of the product was great.</li>
            <li>Not being able to compare this Tabu to what other reviewers claim is the &amp;#34;original,&amp;#34; I have no complains about the smell.</li>
            <li>original Tabu was an oriental Parfum (highly concentrated with 22% essential oils - soap wouldn&#x27;t wash it off!)</li>
            <li>I am not a professional sniffer, so I cannot describe it precisely, but if you like amber, musk or patchouli, you will like Tabu.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the non-spray kind.</li>
            <li>When I get a new girlfriend I tell them to buy Tabu immediately!</li>
            <li>Dana Classic Fragrances, Inc. (a Lynn Tilton Company) has owned the rights to it since 1999 after buying the cologne and perfume brands portfolio from Renaissance Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>fragrance oil is made in the USA by Dana Classic Fragrances, Inc., in Mountaintop, PA., but it is packaged in China.</li>
            <li>fragrance oil is made in the USA by Dana Classic Fragrances, Inc., in Mountaintop, PA., but it is packaged in China.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice fragrance but like other reviewers have stated is not the same fragrance as the bigger bottle of Eau De Cologne</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Tabu since I was in junior high.</li>
            <li>The scent was described as sultry, sensual, and exotic with top notes of bergamot, orange flower, basil, neroli and coriander, middle notes of carnation, jasmine, rose, clover and ylang-ylang, and base notes of patchouli, civet, oak moss, amber, musk, vetiver, sandalwood, cedar, benzoin and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Unlike my other scents (I LOVE Lady Gaga&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fame&amp;#34;), which I&#x27;ll sprits individually on my wrist, and then on my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>During the reformulation, some of Tabu&#x27;s natural ingredients were replaced with synthetic alternatives and their concentrations were lessened to suit modern</li>
            <li>It could be called the perfume of the age as it has had such a long popularity, on a par with Chanel but much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Rather than giving a &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; like most scents do, it gives a very direct spray, making me think of a little kid&#x27;s water pistol.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, have been using it for the past 35 years.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten about Tabu for many years until the local dollar store had little bottles for $2 apiece.</li>
            <li>The scent is completely associated with me and friends who smell Tabu</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what we expected.  </li>
            <li>Dana Classic Fragrances describes the scent as an exotic oriental fragrance that is the essence of sensuality and passion with top notes of bergamot, orange, and coriander, middle notes of clove oil, jasmine, and narcissus, and base notes of amber, musk, and fragrant gum benzoin.</li>

            <li>Tabu is an Eau de Cologne (less concentrated than the original with 4% essential oils) and</li>
            <li>Because of this I generally only use one spritz, directly on the wrist and then immediately rub together.</li>
            <li>I recently rediscovered this fragrance when a young woman I know wore it to an event I attended.</li>
            <li>Long live Tabu.</li>

            <li> It smells the same way as I remembered a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the fragrance I remember from years ago and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Tabu is a fragrance which fits all seasons and also is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> My aunts wore Tabu as young women in the late 1970&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Only problem the bottle leaked a little bit, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> I love Tabu, so this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> knew it had been around a long time, but since I have migraines and I have to be carful with perfumes, decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Just enough low notes on the earthy and amberish side, even a little musky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few scents that does not sour on me.</li>
            <li> lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they aren&#x27;t making the Eau de Cologne, Pure Spray anymore, so I didn&#x27;t receive the product in the picture, I got a different Tabu type, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> but it was getting harder to find until I found this company through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Every other scent hurts my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;HERE&#x27;S SOME TABU HISTORY AND OTHER INFORMATION</li>
            <li> It is still long-lasting and it doesn&#x27;t affect people who have sensitivities to other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is still long-lasting and it doesn&#x27;t affect people who have sensitivities to other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s watered down.</li>
            <li> We ordered the plain bottle.</li>
            <li> All they have to do is put a tiny tiny drop on their neck and it drives me crazy!</li>

            <li> My favorite perfume and the only one that gets me so many compliments!! Terrific price for the size bottle you get. Only problem the bottle leaked a little bit, but nothing major.  Will definitely be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what we expected.  My wife was pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, have been using it for the past 35 years. Just wish Amazon would allow me to purchase more then bottle at a time</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the price.</li>
            <li> Coming from a heterosexual male point of view, nothing compares to Tabu. When I get a new girlfriend I tell them to buy Tabu immediately! No need to spray this stuff all over their bodies. All they have to do is put a tiny tiny drop on their neck and it drives me crazy!</li>
            <li> I have wore TABU over 20 years, an to day I still get compliment how it smell nice  TABU last all day while I am working keep me smelling nice all day long., I purchase three to four a year.</li>
            <li> I have loved the Tabu fragrance for years. But nowhere local could I&#x27;ve bought this bottle for the price it was on Amazon. I am completely happy with my purchase .</li>
            <li> This fragrance reminds me back when I was a girl. Better than I remembered, The formula has not changed at all.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Tabu since I was in junior high. I get compliments by both men and women. Unfortunately, they aren&#x27;t making the Eau de Cologne, Pure Spray anymore, so I didn&#x27;t receive the product in the picture, I got a different Tabu type, which I don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve bought up all the old products by now so now I&#x27;m on an adventure to find a scent that works with my body chemisty the same way.  Boo on Dana for discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> Not being able to compare this Tabu to what other reviewers claim is the &amp;#34;original,&amp;#34; I have no complains about the smell. I think it&#x27;s beautiful, and just the right amount of musky. It makes me feel sexy, but not like everybody more than a few feet away from me can smell it and go &amp;#34;oh wow.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is beautiful and lightly toned, an the liquid inside is a deep amber color. Looks great on a nightstand or on display somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this product is the sprayer (nozzle? Not sure what word to use). Rather than giving a &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; like most scents do, it gives a very direct spray, making me think of a little kid&#x27;s water pistol. Because of this I generally only use one spritz, directly on the wrist and then immediately rub together. Unlike my other scents (I LOVE Lady Gaga&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fame&amp;#34;), which I&#x27;ll sprits individually on my wrist, and then on my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product. Even if you don&#x27;t use it often, you&#x27;ll love it when you do.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice fragrance but like other reviewers have stated is not the same fragrance as the bigger bottle of Eau De Cologne</li>
            <li> I had forgotten about Tabu for many years until the local dollar store had little bottles for $2 apiece. I bought them out, and loved it so much I had to have more . It&#x27;s not all sweet and flowery, nor does it make me smell like a birthday cake or a kid. It&#x27;s sexy, I think. Just enough low notes on the earthy and amberish side, even a little musky. I am not a professional sniffer, so I cannot describe it precisely, but if you like amber, musk or patchouli, you will like Tabu.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent and I could give it away....I tried.  So I&#x27;m using it for a car fragrance when I run out of the others.</li>
            <li> As nice as I remember it and I am still enjoying it when tsunami I smell good. Very nice price too</li>
            <li> Love wearing this perfume smell so good.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful scent, still the same scent I wore during my teenage years. Brought back some nice memories.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tabu since 1945.  Every other scent hurts my sinuses.  The scent is completely associated with me and friends who smell Tabu quickly look to see if I am around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Dana stopped making Tabu, I could no longer use perfume.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the service and promptness of delivery from this company. I have used Tabu from 1967 till now. but it was getting harder to find until I found this company through Amazon. Tabu is a fragrance which fits all seasons and also is very long lasting. It could be called the perfume of the age as it has had such a long popularity, on a par with Chanel but much more affordable. Long live Tabu.</li>
            <li> Have used Tabu for years, since I was 14.  It&#x27;s one of the few scents that does not sour on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years and still love it. I&#x27;m always asked what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and to my amazement, many people have never heard of it. This scent has been around for over 40 years, and is still great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE. WHAT&#x27;S MORE, MY HUSBAND LOVES IT TOO, AND DOESN&#x27;T MIND WHEN I ORDER IT.THIS SCENT IS # 1 IN OUR OPINION !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product but don&#x27;t like the price.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and it is the only sent I have worn for so many years. It is good for any time of day and not too light nor too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love Tabu get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> my mom loves this stuff, so i bought her a couple bottles for christmas from amazon. the perfume seemed fine. the boxes were somewhat worn as though they had been store returns. otherwise they were fine.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is soooooo NICE! It is currently my favorite of all perfumes I have and have tried. The scent also lasts a good while, which is great! One of my Aunts always wear this, which is how I discovered it. So heavenly. Recommended!</li>
            <li> When I used Tabu again it brought back so many memories.  It smells the same way as I remembered a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Tried this at a department store. LOVED IT! knew it had been around a long time, but since I have migraines and I have to be carful with perfumes, decided to try it. NO HEADACHE! WONDERFUL smell! lasted a long time! LOVE IT! will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, it was a gift.  The item was shipped out quickly, and packed with care.  My only warning to anyone is that it looks different than the picture, it must have been some type of special eddition, the bottle is in the shape of a cello or violin type instrument and the box was not the standard black and white, but the size and quality of the product was great.</li>
            <li> I am heartbroken because they have stopped making TABU. I was able to purchase this bottle of Tabu. The only regret I had was that I am not so good on sizes and I though it would be larger than what 3ounce actually is. However it was the real thing and the price was good.</li>
            <li> My friend has used this product for over 50 years. I ordered it for her and she state that \\&quot;it smells awful and is not the same product she has been using\\&quot;.Don&#x27;t know if they have changed the product or if she got a bad one.</li>
            <li> I recently rediscovered this fragrance when a young woman I know wore it to an event I attended. It smelled so familiar to me and when she said it was Tabu I knew why. My aunts wore Tabu as young women in the late 1970&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s and I hadn&#x27;t smelled it in years. Apparently a whole new generation of women is discovering, wearing and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home from the event, I went on Amazon, found Tabu, and ordered two bottles as gifts for my aunts. It was a hit with them - and also their husbands ;o). They didn&#x27;t even know you could get it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE&#x27;S SOME TABU HISTORY AND OTHER INFORMATION YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Tabu was an oriental Parfum (highly concentrated with 22% essential oils - soap wouldn&#x27;t wash it off!) created in 1932 by the legendary perfumer Jean Carles as the signature fragrance for The House of Dana perfumery founded the same year in Barcelona, Spain by Javier Sierraas. The scent was described as sultry, sensual, and exotic with top notes of bergamot, orange flower, basil, neroli and coriander, middle notes of carnation, jasmine, rose, clover and ylang-ylang, and base notes of patchouli, civet, oak moss, amber, musk, vetiver, sandalwood, cedar, benzoin and vanilla. It came to the USA in 1941 and was rumored to be the favorite fragrance of Ava Gardner (1922-1990) who was a top Hollywood actress and one of the most beautiful women of her day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabu was discontinued sometime in the 1970s, brought back in 1977, and reformulated in 2001 by perfumer Sophia Grojsman who is known as the \\&quot;Picasso of Perfumery\\&quot; and has created such fragrances as Lalique, Paris, Eternity and Tresor. During the reformulation, some of Tabu&#x27;s natural ingredients were replaced with synthetic alternatives and their concentrations were lessened to suit modern tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s Tabu is an Eau de Cologne (less concentrated than the original with 4% essential oils) and Dana Classic Fragrances, Inc. (a Lynn Tilton Company) has owned the rights to it since 1999 after buying the cologne and perfume brands portfolio from Renaissance Cosmetics. Dana Classic Fragrances describes the scent as an exotic oriental fragrance that is the essence of sensuality and passion with top notes of bergamot, orange, and coriander, middle notes of clove oil, jasmine, and narcissus, and base notes of amber, musk, and fragrant gum benzoin. It is basically a tamed down, softer version of the original more aggressive formulation. It is still long-lasting and it doesn&#x27;t affect people who have sensitivities to other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabu&#x27;s fragrance oil is made in the USA by Dana Classic Fragrances, Inc., in Mountaintop, PA., but it is packaged in China. Dana Classic Fragrances, Inc. is owned by Lynn Tilton who is one of few self-made female billionaires. She owns more companies (75 of them) than any woman in America and probably the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabu&#x27;s classic violin bottle and print advertisement was inspired by the 1901 painting \\&quot;The Kreutzer Sonata\\&quot; by Rene Francois Xavier Pinet, that depicts a male violinist and a female pianist who cut their performance short to embrace in a moment of passion (see customer image I uploaded). The painting was inspired by the novella of the same title by Tolstoy. Dana Perfumes bought the painting and used it to advertise Tabu along with the slogan \\&quot;The longest kiss in history\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: SD Alcohol 39-C, Water, Fragrance, Yellow 6on Company) has owned the rights to it since 1999 after buying the cologne and perfume brands portfolio from Renaissance Cosmetics.

            <li> Just got here fiance loves it</li>
            <li> This smells different, more patchouli than anything. I won&#x27;t buy it again. I don&#x27;t know why there would be a difference in the smell with it being the same name and maker, but there is. I usually buy the non-spray kind. I love Tabu, so this was a disappointment. I gave it 2 stars because it does not stink. I will probably buy my usual and give this one away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIGHTBULB! I just noticed that this cologne is by Dana For Women! Maybe that is the problem. Maybe it is a different maker with a name so close as to be deceptive. I am going to try to buy Tabu Eau de Cologne by Dana manufactured by Dana. Watch out for the differences in these names and makers.</li>
            <li> loved the reminder smell</li>
            <li> Not what we ordered. We ordered the plain bottle. Wife says it smells different but decided to keep it anyhow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the fragrance I remember from years ago and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> You sent the Tabu in the violin bottle instead of this . I think it&#x27;s watered down. Wanted version pictured.</li>
            <li> What Can I say I Just Love Tabu and Always Have Its The One Perfume that Last all Day With Me</li>
            <li> Great product, Fast shipping</li>
