            <li>Bed Head really makes great products!  </li>
            <li>It was nice while it lasted</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I cannot get this to make my hair look nice, each time I use it, my hair looks &amp;#34;trashy!&amp;#34;  (For lack of a better term)  </li>
            <li>Works great but the barrel is too large for my hair.</li>
            <li>this iron is okay</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Save your money and invest in a better brand.</li>
            <li>Love bed head products</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of this one as easily and it is easier to use on the ends of my hair, giving it a more finished look.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>i have short hair works great for my daughter</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money :)</li>
            <li>I loved the natural looking wave this iron gave my hair.  </li>
            <li>really helps me keep better control</li>
            <li>It never frustrated me during the process.</li>
            <li>It is fairly inexpensive but I was in the middle of waving my hair.</li>
            <li>This waver makes it so easy to get that carefree gentle wave look.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble until I got to the top of my head and got a bit overzealous with trying to get the wave close to the root.</li>
            <li>but it kind of left my hair greasy</li>
            <li>Gets super hot too.</li>
            <li>This is suitable only for hair that is all one length.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m gonna have a good little blister for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it also makes my hair smell funny, like the plates have some sort of chemical film on them.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use a thermal setting spray to help set the waves so they last longer.</li>
            <li>I just finished using this for the first time</li>
            <li>Not everyone needs a really hot temperature.</li>
            <li>then it just quit getting hot.</li>
            <li>I really liked this at first, however after less than 10 uses, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Other than the fact that it no longer works, the overall product was great.</li>
            <li>It creates loose waves and I was wanting more of a &#x27;tighter&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This heats up very quickly, it is easy to use, hair does not fall out the ends while using it (a problem I&#x27;ve had with other irons), and it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>It is built sturdy and warms up fast.</li>
            <li>Works really well ..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The waves are not quite as deep as I&#x27;d imagined or as deep as those shown on the model; however, I did not use any product because I wanted to see how it held on its own.</li>
            <li>not a bad product overall, just not anything to rant and rave about.</li>
            <li>fun for a different style</li>
            <li>One very important caution: Be careful when waving next to your scalp.</li>
            <li>It looks like when I take a big braid out of my hair...only even. ;)</li>
            <li>Well, I replaced the waver with the exact same brand/type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying, but so far, it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>it does the job but its not anything special, ive had other &amp;#34;wavers&amp;#34; before and it does just the same.  </li>
            <li>Waves stay all day long and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally fine, thick, and strait.</li>
            <li>I also did no other treatments prior to using this.</li>
            <li>This barrel is so much easier to use than the other one I bought that is open on one side with the two extensions.</li>
            <li>At least now I won&#x27;t expect it to last more than 6 months of minimal to moderate use.</li>

            <li> she has long hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long to wave all of my hair which is quite long and thick-approximately 30 mins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected and it&#x27;s probably my fault.</li>
            <li> and it was almost as I expected.</li>
            <li> but, when I clamped down, it pulled my hair inside and the edge of the waver touched my scalp, burning me badly enough that small scabs formed.</li>
            <li> I have at least 10 or so different kinds of straighteners , irons and so on</li>
            <li> I positioned the waver a half inch from my scalp</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly long and thick</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair and the waves held without it even being on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 2.</li>
            <li> Too bad it only worked for about a month.  </li>
            <li> I looked pretty awful going to work with half-waved hair.</li>
            <li> Mine is layered, and looked horrible with all the different length ends sticking out ever which way.</li>
            <li> VERY poor quality.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing and now passed the amazon 30 day return.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked this at first, however after less than 10 uses, it stopped working.  It no longer heats up.  Very disappointing and now passed the amazon 30 day return.  Other than the fact that it no longer works, the overall product was great.</li>
            <li> This is suitable only for hair that is all one length. Mine is layered, and looked horrible with all the different length ends sticking out ever which way. I&#x27;m in the process of growing out my layers, so am keeping it. One very important caution: Be careful when waving next to your scalp. I positioned the waver a half inch from my scalp but, when I clamped down, it pulled my hair inside and the edge of the waver touched my scalp, burning me badly enough that small scabs formed.</li>
            <li> buy and did not work want me send me another or your money back</li>
            <li> this iron is okay but i probably wont order it again.  it does the job but its not anything special, ive had other &amp;#34;wavers&amp;#34; before and it does just the same.  it also makes my hair smell funny, like the plates have some sort of chemical film on them.  not a bad product overall, just not anything to rant and rave about.</li>
            <li> fun for a different style</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery. Good product.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTERS FIGHT OVER THIS CURLING IRON.  I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT AT LEAST 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected and it&#x27;s probably my fault. It creates loose waves and I was wanting more of a &#x27;tighter&#x27; look. Again, I think that was my mistake. it had nothing to do with the advertisement or the seller.</li>
            <li> This broke after only two uses, but the company won&#x27;t let me return it.</li>
            <li> It worked great, it was easy and my hair turned out beautiful! This is a great product, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter she loves it. Be sure to use a thermal setting spray to help set the waves so they last longer.</li>
            <li> This barrel is so much easier to use than the other one I bought that is open on one side with the two extensions. The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of this one as easily and it is easier to use on the ends of my hair, giving it a more finished look. The waves hold all day long which is a feat with my hair. It is built sturdy and warms up fast. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Awsome crimper I love it and it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> I bought this and LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> I just finished using this for the first time and it was almost as I expected. The waves are not quite as deep as I&#x27;d imagined or as deep as those shown on the model; however, I did not use any product because I wanted to see how it held on its own. It looks like when I take a big braid out of my hair...only even. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heats up very quickly, it is easy to use, hair does not fall out the ends while using it (a problem I&#x27;ve had with other irons), and it gets very hot. I used it on the highest heat setting and I had no trouble until I got to the top of my head and got a bit overzealous with trying to get the wave close to the root. It was my fault and I&#x27;m not blaming the waver but I&#x27;m gonna have a good little blister for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to reiterate that I had no product in my hair and I used it on the highest heat setting. I also did no other treatments prior to using this. The photo shows a before pic and two after pics. My hair is naturally fine, thick, and strait. It took me less than 20 minutes to complete the look.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it 6 our of 7 days in the week and it makes my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> I cannot get this to make my hair look nice, each time I use it, my hair looks &amp;#34;trashy!&amp;#34;  (For lack of a better term)  I&#x27;ll keep trying, but so far, it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Works really good i use it on myself i have short hair works great for my daughter she has long hair</li>
            <li> I loved the natural looking wave this iron gave my hair.  Too bad it only worked for about a month.  Very disappointed.  Save your money and invest in a better brand.</li>
            <li> Works awesome with the spray gel I also purchased. Waves stay all day long and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well. Is recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Got this for my birthday and love it!</li>
            <li> Works really well .. I have at least 10 or so different kinds of straighteners , irons and so on and this one is def. one of my favorites ! Love bed head products they r the best !</li>
            <li> I love this!! It lasted all day without even needing a setting spray. I even took a nap and still looked good. Definitely worth the money :)</li>
            <li> Bed Head really makes great products!  This waver makes it so easy to get that carefree gentle wave look.  My hair is fairly long and thick so I found by using hair clips and sectioning off my hair really helps me keep better control so I can get waves to start and stop where I like.  Love the heat adjust!  Not everyone needs a really hot temperature. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This wave iron worked great on my daughters hair. She has long thick hair and the waves held without it even being on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 2 weeks and about 6 uses. Dud. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> This was great until it stopped working. My hair looked wonderful. It was simple to use. It never frustrated me during the process. I never got burnt. It didn&#x27;t take too long to wave all of my hair which is quite long and thick-approximately 30 mins. The waves lasted for as long as 5-7 days used with white sands texturizing spray....then it just quit getting hot. I will replace it though maybe with a different brand or with the same brand. At least now I won&#x27;t expect it to last more than 6 months of minimal to moderate use. ....Well, I replaced the waver with the exact same brand/type. I used this one 5 times and it just self destructed (by failing to maintain heat-all of a sudden). It was nice while it lasted but I will not get another one of this brand. It is fairly inexpensive but I was in the middle of waving my hair. I looked pretty awful going to work with half-waved hair. What a disappointment. VERY poor quality.</li>
            <li> Works great but the barrel is too large for my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&amp;#34;t hold in my hair well. Gets super hot too.</li>
            <li> I liked it but it kind of left my hair greasy</li>
            <li> This crimper is da-Bomb.com!! Cheeyeah 😎</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Works great and the waves stay in my hair till I wash it (:</li>
            <li> Makes perfect waves but easy to burn yourself</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter and according to her &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; ......&amp;#34;it&#x27;s the best&amp;#34;!</li>
