            <li>I have oily, acne prone skin and this cleanser works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of this company before and they have a great reputation as a skin care company.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>

            <li>AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>The results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>The best thing i love about the product is that is doesn&#x27;t have an oily wash.</li>
            <li>I have also tried many acne products, this one worked the best for my face.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t flawless by any means, but it looks noticably better.</li>
            <li>So nice to find a good face wash, I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li>have had good luck with breakouts, but this will not help your blackheads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as gold.</li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>Did research online to find a good product, felt hopeful with customer reviews of Murad on here.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good cleanser with the added benefits of salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do a lick of good with clearing up my skin though, either.</li>
            <li>I have loved their products ever since.</li>
            <li>I loved this but don&#x27;t need it any longer.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Worked good.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll look good.</li>
            <li>and this works really good along with the toner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s caused more harm than good!</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE THIS STUFF ANYWAY AND HAS A GREAT COOL FEELING ON THE SKIN!!!</li>
            <li>Great product - love it</li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s great and refreshing.</li>
            <li>If you are going to keep up with it, and based on the good feedback I have read and my own experience, yes.</li>
            <li>Seriously, love love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Murad for years and love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>I have been using Murad product for years and love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Need to buy more!  </li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Will order again for sure!</li>
            <li>Love it and it does the job!</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li>Love it when combined with the toner &amp; moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>so i ordered it,and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also proud to announce j have been pimple free for 6 months now</li>
            <li>Murad has a great reputation as well, and although it&#x27;s not too pricey, it&#x27;s not too cheap either.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>You know the T zone kind.</li>
            <li>Effective product.</li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re looking for something which is effective over time</li>
            <li>This cleanser is perfect for those with combination-oily skin and really clears out pores well.</li>
            <li>However, I worry that I&#x27;m doing more harm than good by loading my body up with these harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Not drying but definitely effective in managing breakouts.</li>
            <li>great smell and nice clean feeling after washing.</li>
            <li>This, along with Murad&#x27;s exfoliating acne treatment gel and skin perfecting lotion are the perfect skin regimen (I would say that I have combination skin), and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The 30 day kit is a great price for the amount of stuff you get (the mask cream is still full in my bottle, the gel is also).  </li>
            <li>My face is amazingly clean and any blemishes from the makeup that I had a week ago are 95% gone!!  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, I am sure you will love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff! :))</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that it was the product since we have had some warm weather</li>
            <li>quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Murad since it was a cruelty-free brand, and have had great success with it</li>
            <li>best cleanser so far for me.</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t thrilled about trying another product but eventually he did begin and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I had been use Murad for years, it is not the best acne face cleanser, but it really does work to prevent and clean up breakout.</li>
            <li>However, I think the exfoliating gel is very important in the routine and will always use it at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>Love this face wash.....</li>
            <li>Love the cleanser</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>When I got out of the shower within a matter of 10 minutes, my face was no longer red and my pimples downed in size by a great amount!</li>
            <li>but I had wonderfully smooth and hydrated skin!</li>
            <li>And by the way, I am 49 years-old and have never been able to find a product that did anything to control the oiliness.</li>
            <li>For some people it&#x27;s better to use products with benzoyl peroxide (which is not in the Murad products, if I am not mistaken).</li>
            <li>Murad saved my face :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF I USE TO USE IT</li>
            <li>BUT THESE TIME I JUST BOUGHT THE CLEANER AND STILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than proactive without sucking all the moisture out of your skin.</li>
            <li>Also, Amazon has the best price especially when you can use their free shipping!</li>
            <li>In a week his acne looked better.</li>
            <li>excellent product for acne prone skin, at an exceptionally low price.</li>
            <li>Use with the exfoliating acne treatment gel, acne spot treatment and the skin perfecting lotion for even better results.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love murad.</li>
            <li>i am glad i found this product.</li>
            <li>My skin started to look better in one week.  </li>
            <li>Better than in store</li>
            <li>I was satisfied at this point as I was resigned to the fact that my skin would never be clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not a terrible product-</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have read the reviews and found a system that actually works.  </li>
            <li>Massage Envy locations use Murad products, so they were able to give me a skin analysis and I went home and ordered the stuff a la carte.  </li>
            <li>I have been through many products trying to get my skin under control.</li>
            <li>I also had a more tight/shiny look to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it and</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, and up until now Neutrogena seemed to be the best brand, but I&#x27;m totally converted</li>
            <li>I still get a spot now and then, of course; no cleanser is made of magic and fairy dust.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser for so many years, I have lost count.  </li>
            <li>I found that I tend to use more cleanser than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 and have the skin of a teenager sometimes-this has helped more than anything.</li>
            <li>I love this wash and wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else.</li>
            <li>I freaking love this.</li>
            <li>for over 10 years and this cleanser still one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit drying, so make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was okay with the idea of this purge process</li>
            <li>but I continued reading reviews and many said it didn&#x27;t get better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my complextion since I&#x27;ve been using this...</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s a cleanser and toner all in one.  </li>
            <li>Worked OK.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much more even.</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash all times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena or ProActiv.</li>
            <li>I love that this product isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love murad products and this one did not disappoint at all.  </li>
            <li>It was almost like a rash more than acne.</li>
            <li>Each day his face broke out more.  </li>
            <li>I love this for my face.</li>
            <li>you buy THIS :).</li>
            <li>It feels awesome and my face looks younger.</li>
            <li>This review is more regarding the seller who sold me a defective product than the product itself.</li>
            <li>used to use proactive, but now have even better skin for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li>Best for clean, clear skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle cleanser, and since I have especially sensitive skin, I find that it works best.</li>
            <li>You will love the way it feels but more important you&#x27;ll love the way you look.</li>
            <li>It does visibly reduce fine lines and makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It can be very drying so make sure you have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin was breaking out more, I was still seeing a huge improvement every day in the texture and quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Face wash to help with my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser which is step 1 to clear skin.</li>
            <li>The Skin Perfecting Lotion is actually the best product of the three, and has given me tremendous results.</li>
            <li>We have tried Pro Active, other drug store acne products but find this one, combined with a healthy lifestyle, good nutrition, good sleep, and exercise, works the best.</li>
            <li>Very effective in maintaining clear skin.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser, this my every day face cleanser, it removes makeup, leaves my fave feeling so fresh!</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off, and works well with acne.</li>
            <li>It smells great, you only need a pea-sized amount, it washes off makeup well, and leaves your skin with a healthy shine, the salicylic acid helps manage breakouts.  </li>
            <li>However, I just started feeling this is too strong</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to people in need of a good acne face wash.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user, it takes a month or so to pull all the yucky stuff out of your pores and then it just makes your skin look amazing (without drying it out).</li>
            <li>Does not over dry your skin, pleasant fragrance!</li>
            <li>the price is a bit high, so if I decide not to try the 30 day starter kit I may be looking for a more cost effective cleanser/system.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I have combination skin probably, my forehead tends to get oily, but the rest of my face is fine.</li>
            <li>I even resorted to Accutane 2 times which cleared my skin for sure, but the acne quickly returned after finishing the treatment.  </li>
            <li>HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH ACNE</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and I can already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>If you buy the cleanser, toner, exfoliating gel, and spot treatment you will see a huge improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li>This product is great, I am currently deployed and have to deal with the elements drying my face out while my T-zone is oily.</li>
            <li>Again, great products that actually work!!</li>
            <li>Get acne free, that stuff is just like proactiv but cheaper.</li>
            <li>Great product and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone looking for an alternative facial wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>has a nice tingling feeling, but didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.  </li>
            <li>works great on my skin and especially with the serums.</li>
            <li>It keeps me blemish free.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was very cleansing</li>
            <li>CLEANS DEEP AND SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, a Great facial.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>Both my daughters love this product and Anazon sells it at such a good price.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m seeing good results from using this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser and now that I have the Olay face scrubber, it&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My diet is pretty good also, I avoid dairy products, don&#x27;t eat a lot of wheat, and avoid fast food like the plague.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleaners over the years, and Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser really works great.  </li>
            <li>It has consistently provided healthy cleansing for my face.  </li>
            <li>I originally got this was with the 3 piece Murad starter kit.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m excited to see the result after extended use.</li>
            <li>: This is the exciting part!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different cleansers from drugstore brands to higher end department store brands and this by far is the best one.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling refreshingly clean after use.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel truly clean and a bit tingly.</li>
            <li>It also causes my skin to have a clean, glow look.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything under the sun to clean up my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like you can never feel clean or get it all off.</li>
            <li>But it never, ever feels clean.</li>
            <li>It looks healthy, not parched or pink, and yet this cleanser does a really good job of taking all my makeup off.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive combination skin, so I am always on the look out for cleansers which are cruelty free, effective and don&#x27;t make my face look all scratched up.&lt;br /&gt;Although this cleanser keeps my break outs at bay and makes the texture of my skin feel smoother and it does leave my face feeling clean...</li>
            <li>Gets my face clean and rinses well, no residue.</li>
            <li>It helps keep pimples away and my pores clean.  </li>
            <li>smell nice, not think, skin feels refreshing and actually works for my acne skin for a close to 30 girl.</li>
            <li>but it cleanly strips the oil from my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li>Feels clean, clears up breakouts and the smell makes all the boys come running.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a very effective cleaner; it made my face tingle slightly and feel very clean without over-drying.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>It clears my oil right up!</li>
            <li>Normally this is a gel that works great and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Tossing my Murad products in the trash, unless someone wants to buy off me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have eaten more kale in two weeks than I have in my whole life.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve got fair, combo skin, prone to deep, cystic acne along my chin and whiteheads on my forehead/temples).</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>It also does not foam up as much as I prefer, and as a result I end up using more product then</li>
            <li>It does leave a refreshingly cool tingle on the face after use.</li>
            <li>This is a true must have.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WHOLE MURAD LINE.</li>
            <li>this has worked for me and i have oily skin the price was not bad used along with toner and correcting cream</li>
            <li>I say clearER because, of course, it is not completely pimple free, but I can honestly say I am acne free.  </li>
            <li>I first used it on a Thursday evening, and Friday was fine.</li>
            <li>After washing my face with this product, it feels so fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Then, I got pregnant and my skin revolted against everything, including this cleanser.</li>
            <li>One lovely college age daughter now has clear, blemish free skin after using this product.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived as described, quickly and sealed.</li>
            <li>You can buy other products at a fraction of the costs that are just as (and even more) effective.</li>
            <li>After washing my face is clean and warm and pores are open and the gel seems to penetrate well</li>
            <li>and this stuff actually makes your skin feel nice and clean after using it</li>
            <li>After lightly rubbing about one minute all over my face, not near my eyes, I then use a facecloth with warm water to rinse it all off.  </li>
            <li>One thing that is really great about it is how little you need to use.</li>
            <li>But really, this cleanser keeps me acne free.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>I have used dozens of face washes and this one is near the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to finally get to write a glowing review for a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It worked wonders for me, so it&#x27;s worth a try,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash so far.</li>
            <li>I think this product is worth trying if you have &#x27;tried everything&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>That said, I will not be purchasing from them again and will make sure to order directly from Murad where an item can be returned for up to 60 days.</li>
            <li>I havve tried eveything from Proactiv to plain old dial soap and this cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>, makes your face feel very tingly, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this cleanser from the infomercial with the whole 3 step system.  </li>
            <li>All of the other good posts are correct.</li>
            <li>*right* for you.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>For cleansing my face, I prefer to use Philosophy purity cleanser, which really removes all make up and keeps my skin clean and without drying out.</li>
            <li>It lathers up really nice and you only need a pea size amount for your WHOLE face!</li>
            <li>I have used Proactiv and many other products in the past, and this has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>It will take a full bottle before you will really begin to notice a decrease in blemishes and the rate in which they occur.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing this cleanser for adult acne twice daily and a good lotion to prevent drying your skin out.</li>
            <li>This cleanser even proved to be the most effective item in the Murad kit, at least for me.</li>
            <li>What really amazes me about this product is how healthy and clear my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Its not drying or harsh and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Amazing acne product that doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin!</li>
            <li>I use this along with the Clarifying Toner and Gentle Acne gel and it has reduced the amount of breakouts within the first week of me using it!  </li>
            <li>For the outrageously high prices being charged by Murad one should be receiving a more naturally composed product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle of this, and as a product junkie, this is a huge deal!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know what this stuff was at first.  </li>
            <li>I would have never considered using a product that had caused such a reaction, but I am so glad I gave it the time that it needed to work.</li>
            <li>and it actually looked and felt better too.</li>
            <li>but a big difference sceen from before i started using it works better than anything else i have tried before.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different cleansers and products.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day pea size amount and it lathers very well!</li>
            <li>and it cleans it very well without drying!</li>
            <li>It also helps offset the higher price of the cleanser.</li>
            <li>After using this cleanser for about a month, my skin has really cleared up!</li>
            <li>The best part is that I only need a tiny amount, like smaller than a pea.</li>
            <li>This is one the best cleanse/tone, I have been using this product for the past ten years and wouldn&#x27;t want to replace it with anything else!</li>
            <li>While I love the product, I find it dries my skin if used daily.  </li>
            <li>but after about the first 2wks.</li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser, I started seeing the results within one week.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using it with the toner and moisturizer :)</li>
            <li>If you want to try this out, be sure to check your face by day two to ensure you are not getting the same reaction as me.</li>
            <li>PRETTY WELL.</li>
            <li>It has really cleared up her skin!</li>
            <li>Whether your teen or in your mature skin years looking for clear beautiful skin I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great for stopping breakouts I use it everyday and my face is always clear.</li>
            <li>keep my face clean and clear with non of those side effects.</li>
            <li>Helps keep the skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my face clear and clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage son because it got such good reviews on here.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seemed that this cleanser was drying on my face, but in reality, it&#x27;s really gentle for me</li>
            <li>Also, be aware that most of their moisturizers contain parabens and many other potentially unsafe chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>was the only reason I had fine lines in the first place.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best wash ever-i&#x27;ll never go back and use anything else.</li>
            <li>this product would dry my skin and cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that mine started to become less effective</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser once a day or it makes my skin too dry now that it&#x27;s winter, but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has cleared up and looks better</li>
            <li>Oh well, maybe this product is just too strong for me, I&#x27;m going to go back to the anti-redness formulation.</li>
            <li>Strong but definitely leave your face feeling</li>
            <li>because they certainly help), however, I had to write one for this product.  </li>
            <li>Large size, works well</li>
            <li>Actually, even the fine lines around my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li>Got it in decent time too!</li>
            <li>I recommend using this with Dr. Murad’s Pure skin vitamin supplements to really kick off clearing your skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice to and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean, not tight or &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; clean if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>I have very senstive skin</li>
            <li>I am very relieved to have found a product that worked so well for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have no Idea why it picks who it wants to work for.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and not at all overpowering, simply smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>i had never had anything like that in my whole life.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle, minty feel and leaves skin refreshed and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>Been using Neutrogena&#x27;s 3 step acne process sold in drugstores and has worked really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li>Well fast forward, I&#x27;ve decided to try it again.  </li>
            <li>Even though this felt great, I think I was severely irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>) Be gentle - if you&#x27;re going to exfoliate, do it infrequently and choose a chemical exfoliant over a mechanical one (meaning a gel over a scrub).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stick wit proactiv or acne free those actually work.</li>
            <li>It foams up really well</li>
            <li>My acne is currently very well controlled, maybe it&#x27;s bc</li>
            <li>This cleanser is much too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li>Works well without too much drying.</li>
            <li>Very drying product.</li>
            <li>I think the gel is what really keeps my skin from breaking out, rather than the wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I think it&#x27;s not really necessary to use an acne cleanser as that dried out my skin even more.</li>
            <li>absolutely re-buy this product.</li>
            <li>It works FAST.</li>
            <li>It is the primary cleanser I use on my face daily.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very well</li>
            <li>This face wash really improves my skin.</li>
            <li>I have never been one to think I needed to spend more on face products, but this cleanser makes a big difference and is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I didnt see much results with this product, when it came to clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>It feels like a ton of dirt done lifted off my face thanks Murad</li>
            <li>I actually finally feel comfortable going about my day without makeup.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to try!</li>
            <li>especially on my adult skin.</li>
            <li>I use the Murad skin perfecting lotion and also the exfoliating acne treatment gel along with this cleanser and the combo works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 10 years and it works really</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>and it has really been helping him.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole handful.</li>
            <li>: one 6.75 oz tube lasts over 12 months with pea-sized portions because it is really foamy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has made my skin look healthier and feel better and clear up my acne.  </li>
            <li>Worked for a few weeks and then didn&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li>I started using this 8-9 months ago right after the philosophy clear days ahead.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use everyday to keep your skin clear and completion beautiful.</li>
            <li>Definitely leaves you with a clean feeling - haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of improvement with my acne.</li>
            <li>were you can see little bubbles and very  very easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>It took months, but I now have pretty clear skin!</li>
            <li>I have also found that this product works better in conjunction with other Murad products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this keeps it under control better than any other product I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better price on amazon than other retailers.</li>
            <li>aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other bottles of this that have lasted 6 months or more without turning into liquid.</li>
            <li>Honestly it make skin dried a little so very important to follow up with moisture.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I use the much more gentle Clinique Comforting Cream Cleaser, a tiny bit of On the Spot on any large pimples, and Dramatically Different to moisturize.</li>
            <li>IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD THE WHOLE KIT</li>
            <li>It made me break out more which is to be expected when trying a new acne product...</li>
            <li>want to be clear that this is my first time ordering this from amazon, but I have used this product for about two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin will never be completely clear (Thanks, Genetics!)</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, bought one less than a year ago</li>
            <li>Really does clear skin fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this product when I had mild acne and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older (29yrs).</li>
            <li>the older it got,</li>
            <li>might try the 30 day starter kit to see if using the rest of the products in the line along with this particular product enhances the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>works very well and keeps my face very clear of all acne and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, and this keeps me from becoming shiny all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have this cleanser in the summer, so I don&#x27;t know how it performs in high humidity).</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>I decided to give in to the relatively high price of this cleanser after hearing all the hype and being fed up with my skin routine to rid of my acne.</li>
            <li>it has work better than the other acne products i have used,although it never cleared up my acne completely</li>
            <li>I was getting some pimples here and there with Neutrogena&#x27;s stuff and just wanted to see if i could find something a little better.</li>
            <li>-- I was breaking out a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t use much, or use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I suggest you purchase the exfoliating acne treatment gel to pair it with, or the gentle treatment gel if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I believe its worth a shot, when i run out of the travel size i will definitely purchase the normal size.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t normal acne either.</li>
            <li>I contacted Murad to see if this was normal and it is not.</li>
            <li>I tired the anti-redness cleanser and loved that</li>
            <li>Not a hard wash</li>
            <li>After changing up my routine, cleansing morning and night, moisturizing after, and only applying the gel at night, my skin literally just gets better after every single use.  </li>
            <li>I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful.</li>
            <li>It also shortens the duration and lowers the severity of new breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Live in CA and received in 2 days.</li>
            <li>Works well with St. Ives blemish and blackhead scrub which I have used forever and cant live without.</li>
            <li>When I do get acne now, it is very mild and heals quickly (usually less than a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With all of these products used in conjunction, my acne was mildly reduced but EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li>but 2 weeks later it wasn&#x27;t getting better and my skin felt so rough.  </li>
            <li>sorry I spent all that good money on those department store products!!!  </li>
            <li>It might be a particular bacterium that lives on your skin that is sensitive to one sort of antibiotic rather than another.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s contains many toxic chemicals such as triclosan and tetrasodium edta which is partially why it seems to work.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin on my face, and have never had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>Not over-drying, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I would highly reccommend you STAY AWAY from this product.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge change in my skin and would highly recommend this and the other products to anyone dealing with acne, young or old.</li>
            <li>I only use it on the areas of my face where I consistently breakout or tend to be oily.</li>
            <li>I have recently finished my first bottle of this cleanser.</li>
            <li>And definitely get your skin evaluated first before making your purchase.  </li>
            <li>and it was the only one that has ever worked for me consistently.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this for even mildly sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Cleaners for the past 10 years and ever time I run out and buy some more use</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has consistently worked to control my acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to using this every other day and do like how clean it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li>So great that I can buy a bigger tube of just the wash without having to waste the other products that come in the kit.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning and night, even right after the gym cause sweat on the face for too long causes breakouts.</li>
            <li>after two uses my face has completely swollen, my eye nearly swollen SHUT!</li>
            <li>Another product that my facialist recommended before I got married and it really worked, it&#x27;s so different from regular face wash.</li>
            <li>I have this product for 2-3 months now and wash day and night and still have more than half left over.</li>
            <li>It may not work as well for everyone, since we are all different, but it certainly has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I live in NYC, so it&#x27;s moderate to low humidity right now</li>
            <li>helps with mild acne, I use it along with a scrub every other day tho as you won&#x27;t get any exfoliation</li>
            <li>After my face is somewhat clean and damp I put about the size of a large pea amount of this cleanser on each cheek and rub rub rub until it starts to slightly foam up and turn white.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry you out the way most other acne products do.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the lack of better results are due to my hair secreting a lot of oils, which means I need to wash my hair every single day, as well as condition it.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Switched to the Murad system and my fave has never been so clear.</li>
            <li>I have clear skin all the time now.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this clear.</li>
            <li>It has helped to clear me up.</li>
            <li>Within a week my skin was completely clear and has stayed that way with continued use.  </li>
            <li>I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth</li>
            <li>I love it and will recommend this product to anyone who suffers from light to severe acne.</li>
            <li>it keeps my face somewhat clear although I still have issues with acne, this product works.</li>
            <li>Within 3 day we started to see her skin clear up.</li>
            <li>after using it my acne began to clear up and after a month it was all gone with NO PICKING.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is not harsh on my face like Benzoyl peroxide products can be.</li>
            <li>so I used Murad because it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After still having some acne breakouts in my early 30s, a friend told me about this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it and the exfoliating cleaner by Murad for nearly 10 years now</li>
            <li>Purchased it for my 16 year old son.</li>
            <li>It completely cleared up my face</li>
            <li>I have had acne issues since puberty and I am now 39 years old.  </li>
            <li>for the last 10 or so years acne has been a real struggle for me.</li>
            <li>longer, long-winded, and overly detailed review</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear and soft since I was using The Pill as an acne solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I would recommend you not to buy it.     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and for some reason Proactiv gave me an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lush coal soap for acne at night, and using the murad clarifying cleanser in the shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have since figured out that the cleanser is really the key for me.  </li>
            <li>I tried this hoping to finally clear up my adult acne and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend using the entire 3-step regime since the wash alone could be very drying.</li>
            <li>so I ad it shipped directly to her.</li>
            <li>(wow sounds like a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late fifties and still have many acne outbreaks.  </li>
            <li>I am a 50ish year old who loves this product.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars simply because it really worked well for</li>
            <li>it seems to be working so far</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this!</li>
            <li>I always joke that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s with the skin of a 16 year old in terms of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my skin so soft, and noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li>My skins was too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>After four days of use, I broke out into an allergic reaction on my face where my eyes were swollen shut in my face was completely swollen.</li>
            <li>If I get any on the sides of my face, near my eyes, then my eyes swell and start closing on</li>
            <li>, I still got the white-head crops during PMS but the swelling problem has stopped completely.</li>
            <li>I am still getting white-heads on my cheeks near my nose, but they don&#x27;t swell and go away</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin too, and it did not hurt me at all.</li>
            <li>I have tried it all -- tea tree oil, lavender oil, Neutrogena natural this, natural that, &amp;#34;Yes</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and clearER.  </li>
            <li>This product really is about improving your overall skin health and texture.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and this has been my go-to cleanser for a decade.</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and get adult acne from time to time.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t quite cleared me up completely</li>
            <li>and it completely destroyed my skin.</li>
            <li>This product completely changed my skin</li>
            <li>I bought this product for 17 year old daughter, she used as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>Was only able to use this product for 3 days before my skin became irritated and dried out.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to write this review because every person&#x27;s skin chemistry is different, but so far I have enjoyed this face wash, the green tea extract has a cooling effect on the skin, which is</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been getting more breakouts while using it, so it works at getting rid of acne (slowly).</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean without being tight, and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>The only gripe I have about this is that it does dry out the skin quite a bit, and my skin type is normally not sensitive, but I just pair this with my favorite moisturizer</li>
            <li>I did choose this product primarily to be pain free, and not so much about vanity, but I am tired of being mistaken for a teenager due to acne in my mid-twenties.</li>
            <li>The original 3 steps definitely worked and I still use the second step occasionally.  </li>
            <li>Not only did the area around my eyes swell, but my skin got so dry that I could rub it off with my fingers even though I was using adequate moisturizer.</li>
            <li>at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face</li>
            <li>I used to get so many compliments on a daily basis about my &#x27;porcelain&#x27; skin, but it has turned into a dry red bumpy nightmare since I stopped taking birth control last</li>
            <li>and I have had a new pimple everyday from tiny to huge.</li>
            <li>Everything i tried broke me out more and it was seriously a losing battle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this is the first one that actually works.  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne at my best, and moderate acne on my worst days.</li>
            <li>This really helped solve that minor problem.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin with moderate acne, this cleanser made my face get oilier through out the day.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy it, this makes my acne much more worse than before, why it&#x27;s allowed sell such poison, i really wonder.</li>
            <li>I tried to keep up with this as the product claim it might explore the hidden blemish and clean up your skin deeply.</li>
            <li>I was so self-conscious it was starting to really affect me on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still get mild breakouts every few weeks and wanted something to help control it.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily but can dry out super easily, and Murad is the only face product that absorbs the extra oil without making my skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used Murad for a couple years now, but i find that using JUST this cleaner helps to keep my face really clear!</li>
            <li>It caused major problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>I initially put off purchasing Murad products due to the price tag, but let me tell you, they are worth it.</li>
            <li>except when I am pregnant, bc unfortunately, some of the ingredients are a bit unsafe for pregnant women.</li>
            <li>any face was clear by the second day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only product that has completely stopped me from having breakouts.    </li>
            <li>This regimen totally cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li>So I can really stretch how much I spent on this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Apparently, for centuries Moroccan and Indian women use the argan oil for their skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I still have hundreds of black-heads on my nose, but next to my nose they are nearly extinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like I do than this is your go to facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>They warned that the skin would look worse before it got better, which it did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got so many new breakouts, I&#x27;m starting to panic because my face looks ten times worse.</li>
            <li>it can dry your skin, so apply very briefly and gently where your skin doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
            <li>One bottle lasted me significantly longer than other products due to this reason.</li>
            <li>I usually heal quick but for some reason some of the pimples leave marks even if you do not touch.</li>
            <li>reason I only gave 4 out of 5 stars is simply because the gel was a tiny bit much for me to apply it twice a day, but that is just my individual experience with it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li>My acne worsened—in new areas of my face, I might add—and my skin was somehow still dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to get products in the same line so that they work well together towards a common goal.  </li>
            <li>On a regular day, my face is shine free for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li>The system requires twice a day use, but if your skin starts to feel tight or dry and more breakouts surface, I recommend using it once a day and use the other products sparingly.  </li>
            <li>It does smell a little funny, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, but smooth and refreshed...has a slight mentholy  tingle to it...plus a little goes a long way for a very reasonable price, especially on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing a dermatologist regularly for almost 6 years to clear my acne and after using topical treatments, pills, including things like Retin-A and different antibacterial oral pills</li>
            <li>: After a week of following the kit directly, I noticed that the exfoliating gel twice a day was making my skin a tiny bit itchy, so I stopped using it in the morning and only used the gel at night.  </li>
            <li>but I was expecting this due to the high content of medicine.  </li>
            <li>It will not dry problems skin, yet you will feel that your skin has been deeply cleansed.</li>
            <li>so you can get away with a using a very small amount to clean your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>I suggest that after first 2 uses only use every other day... my skin got very dry and itchy and flaky.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably gentle, but I suggest moisturizing after use, as it may leave your skin feeling a little tight/dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and have very dry skin, redness around my nose (maybe rosacea?), and pimples everywhere, not cystic, but definitely raised pimples/acne all over my face.  </li>

            <li> have had good luck with breakouts, but this will not help your blackheads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good as gold.</li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> Did research online to find a good product, felt hopeful with customer reviews of Murad on here.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good cleanser with the added benefits of salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a lick of good with clearing up my skin though, either.</li>
            <li> I have loved their products ever since.</li>
            <li> I loved this but don&#x27;t need it any longer.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Worked good.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll look good.</li>
            <li> and this works really good along with the toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s caused more harm than good!</li>
            <li> BUT I LOVE THIS STUFF ANYWAY AND HAS A GREAT COOL FEELING ON THE SKIN!!!</li>
            <li> Great product - love it</li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s great and refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you are going to keep up with it, and based on the good feedback I have read and my own experience, yes.</li>
            <li> Seriously, love love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Murad for years and love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash!</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad product for years and love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Need to buy more!  </li>
            <li> Love!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Will order again for sure!</li>
            <li> Love it and it does the job!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Love it when combined with the toner &amp; moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> so i ordered it,and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also proud to announce j have been pimple free for 6 months now</li>
            <li> Murad has a great reputation as well, and although it&#x27;s not too pricey, it&#x27;s not too cheap either.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> You know the T zone kind.</li>
            <li> Effective product.</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re looking for something which is effective over time</li>
            <li> This cleanser is perfect for those with combination-oily skin and really clears out pores well.</li>
            <li> However, I worry that I&#x27;m doing more harm than good by loading my body up with these harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not drying but definitely effective in managing breakouts.</li>
            <li> great smell and nice clean feeling after washing.</li>
            <li> This, along with Murad&#x27;s exfoliating acne treatment gel and skin perfecting lotion are the perfect skin regimen (I would say that I have combination skin), and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The 30 day kit is a great price for the amount of stuff you get (the mask cream is still full in my bottle, the gel is also).  </li>
            <li> My face is amazingly clean and any blemishes from the makeup that I had a week ago are 95% gone!!  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, I am sure you will love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! :))</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that it was the product since we have had some warm weather</li>
            <li> quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Murad since it was a cruelty-free brand, and have had great success with it</li>
            <li> best cleanser so far for me.</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t thrilled about trying another product but eventually he did begin and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I had been use Murad for years, it is not the best acne face cleanser, but it really does work to prevent and clean up breakout.</li>
            <li> However, I think the exfoliating gel is very important in the routine and will always use it at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.....</li>
            <li> Love the cleanser</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> When I got out of the shower within a matter of 10 minutes, my face was no longer red and my pimples downed in size by a great amount!</li>
            <li> but I had wonderfully smooth and hydrated skin!</li>
            <li> And by the way, I am 49 years-old and have never been able to find a product that did anything to control the oiliness.</li>
            <li> For some people it&#x27;s better to use products with benzoyl peroxide (which is not in the Murad products, if I am not mistaken).</li>
            <li> Murad saved my face :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF I USE TO USE IT</li>
            <li> BUT THESE TIME I JUST BOUGHT THE CLEANER AND STILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than proactive without sucking all the moisture out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon has the best price especially when you can use their free shipping!</li>
            <li> In a week his acne looked better.</li>
            <li> excellent product for acne prone skin, at an exceptionally low price.</li>
            <li> Use with the exfoliating acne treatment gel, acne spot treatment and the skin perfecting lotion for even better results.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love murad.</li>
            <li> i am glad i found this product.</li>
            <li> My skin started to look better in one week.  </li>
            <li> Better than in store</li>
            <li> I was satisfied at this point as I was resigned to the fact that my skin would never be clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not a terrible product-</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have read the reviews and found a system that actually works.  </li>
            <li> Massage Envy locations use Murad products, so they were able to give me a skin analysis and I went home and ordered the stuff a la carte.  </li>
            <li> I have been through many products trying to get my skin under control.</li>
            <li> I also had a more tight/shiny look to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love it and</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, and up until now Neutrogena seemed to be the best brand, but I&#x27;m totally converted</li>
            <li> I still get a spot now and then, of course; no cleanser is made of magic and fairy dust.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser for so many years, I have lost count.  </li>
            <li> I found that I tend to use more cleanser than anything else.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and have the skin of a teenager sometimes-this has helped more than anything.</li>
            <li> I love this wash and wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else.</li>
            <li> I freaking love this.</li>
            <li> for over 10 years and this cleanser still one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit drying, so make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was okay with the idea of this purge process</li>
            <li> but I continued reading reviews and many said it didn&#x27;t get better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my complextion since I&#x27;ve been using this...</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s a cleanser and toner all in one.  </li>
            <li> Worked OK.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much more even.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash all times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena or ProActiv.</li>
            <li> I love that this product isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love murad products and this one did not disappoint at all.  </li>
            <li> It was almost like a rash more than acne.</li>
            <li> Each day his face broke out more.  </li>
            <li> I love this for my face.</li>
            <li> you buy THIS :).</li>
            <li> It feels awesome and my face looks younger.</li>
            <li> This review is more regarding the seller who sold me a defective product than the product itself.</li>
            <li> used to use proactive, but now have even better skin for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Best for clean, clear skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle cleanser, and since I have especially sensitive skin, I find that it works best.</li>
            <li> You will love the way it feels but more important you&#x27;ll love the way you look.</li>
            <li> It does visibly reduce fine lines and makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> It can be very drying so make sure you have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin was breaking out more, I was still seeing a huge improvement every day in the texture and quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great Face wash to help with my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser which is step 1 to clear skin.</li>
            <li> The Skin Perfecting Lotion is actually the best product of the three, and has given me tremendous results.</li>
            <li> We have tried Pro Active, other drug store acne products but find this one, combined with a healthy lifestyle, good nutrition, good sleep, and exercise, works the best.</li>
            <li> Very effective in maintaining clear skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, this my every day face cleanser, it removes makeup, leaves my fave feeling so fresh!</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off, and works well with acne.</li>
            <li> It smells great, you only need a pea-sized amount, it washes off makeup well, and leaves your skin with a healthy shine, the salicylic acid helps manage breakouts.  </li>
            <li> However, I just started feeling this is too strong</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to people in need of a good acne face wash.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user, it takes a month or so to pull all the yucky stuff out of your pores and then it just makes your skin look amazing (without drying it out).</li>
            <li> Does not over dry your skin, pleasant fragrance!</li>
            <li> the price is a bit high, so if I decide not to try the 30 day starter kit I may be looking for a more cost effective cleanser/system.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I have combination skin probably, my forehead tends to get oily, but the rest of my face is fine.</li>
            <li> I even resorted to Accutane 2 times which cleared my skin for sure, but the acne quickly returned after finishing the treatment.  </li>
            <li> HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH ACNE</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> If you buy the cleanser, toner, exfoliating gel, and spot treatment you will see a huge improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I am currently deployed and have to deal with the elements drying my face out while my T-zone is oily.</li>
            <li> Again, great products that actually work!!</li>
            <li> Get acne free, that stuff is just like proactiv but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone looking for an alternative facial wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> has a nice tingling feeling, but didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.  </li>
            <li> works great on my skin and especially with the serums.</li>
            <li> It keeps me blemish free.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was very cleansing</li>
            <li> CLEANS DEEP AND SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, a Great facial.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> Both my daughters love this product and Anazon sells it at such a good price.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing good results from using this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser and now that I have the Olay face scrubber, it&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My diet is pretty good also, I avoid dairy products, don&#x27;t eat a lot of wheat, and avoid fast food like the plague.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleaners over the years, and Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser really works great.  </li>
            <li> It has consistently provided healthy cleansing for my face.  </li>
            <li> I originally got this was with the 3 piece Murad starter kit.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m excited to see the result after extended use.</li>
            <li> : This is the exciting part!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different cleansers from drugstore brands to higher end department store brands and this by far is the best one.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling refreshingly clean after use.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel truly clean and a bit tingly.</li>
            <li> It also causes my skin to have a clean, glow look.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun to clean up my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like you can never feel clean or get it all off.</li>
            <li> But it never, ever feels clean.</li>
            <li> It looks healthy, not parched or pink, and yet this cleanser does a really good job of taking all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive combination skin, so I am always on the look out for cleansers which are cruelty free, effective and don&#x27;t make my face look all scratched up.&lt;br /&gt;Although this cleanser keeps my break outs at bay and makes the texture of my skin feel smoother and it does leave my face feeling clean...</li>
            <li> Gets my face clean and rinses well, no residue.</li>
            <li> It helps keep pimples away and my pores clean.  </li>
            <li> smell nice, not think, skin feels refreshing and actually works for my acne skin for a close to 30 girl.</li>
            <li> but it cleanly strips the oil from my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> Feels clean, clears up breakouts and the smell makes all the boys come running.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a very effective cleaner; it made my face tingle slightly and feel very clean without over-drying.</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> It clears my oil right up!</li>
            <li> Normally this is a gel that works great and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Tossing my Murad products in the trash, unless someone wants to buy off me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have eaten more kale in two weeks than I have in my whole life.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve got fair, combo skin, prone to deep, cystic acne along my chin and whiteheads on my forehead/temples).</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> It also does not foam up as much as I prefer, and as a result I end up using more product then</li>
            <li> It does leave a refreshingly cool tingle on the face after use.</li>
            <li> This is a true must have.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WHOLE MURAD LINE.</li>
            <li> this has worked for me and i have oily skin the price was not bad used along with toner and correcting cream</li>
            <li> I say clearER because, of course, it is not completely pimple free, but I can honestly say I am acne free.  </li>
            <li> I first used it on a Thursday evening, and Friday was fine.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with this product, it feels so fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Then, I got pregnant and my skin revolted against everything, including this cleanser.</li>
            <li> One lovely college age daughter now has clear, blemish free skin after using this product.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived as described, quickly and sealed.</li>
            <li> You can buy other products at a fraction of the costs that are just as (and even more) effective.</li>
            <li> After washing my face is clean and warm and pores are open and the gel seems to penetrate well</li>
            <li> and this stuff actually makes your skin feel nice and clean after using it</li>
            <li> After lightly rubbing about one minute all over my face, not near my eyes, I then use a facecloth with warm water to rinse it all off.  </li>
            <li> One thing that is really great about it is how little you need to use.</li>
            <li> But really, this cleanser keeps me acne free.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of face washes and this one is near the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to finally get to write a glowing review for a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for me, so it&#x27;s worth a try,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash so far.</li>
            <li> I think this product is worth trying if you have &#x27;tried everything&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> That said, I will not be purchasing from them again and will make sure to order directly from Murad where an item can be returned for up to 60 days.</li>
            <li> I havve tried eveything from Proactiv to plain old dial soap and this cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> , makes your face feel very tingly, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this cleanser from the infomercial with the whole 3 step system.  </li>
            <li> All of the other good posts are correct.</li>
            <li> *right* for you.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> For cleansing my face, I prefer to use Philosophy purity cleanser, which really removes all make up and keeps my skin clean and without drying out.</li>
            <li> It lathers up really nice and you only need a pea size amount for your WHOLE face!</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv and many other products in the past, and this has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> It will take a full bottle before you will really begin to notice a decrease in blemishes and the rate in which they occur.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing this cleanser for adult acne twice daily and a good lotion to prevent drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> This cleanser even proved to be the most effective item in the Murad kit, at least for me.</li>
            <li> What really amazes me about this product is how healthy and clear my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Its not drying or harsh and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing acne product that doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin!</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Clarifying Toner and Gentle Acne gel and it has reduced the amount of breakouts within the first week of me using it!  </li>
            <li> For the outrageously high prices being charged by Murad one should be receiving a more naturally composed product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle of this, and as a product junkie, this is a huge deal!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know what this stuff was at first.  </li>
            <li> I would have never considered using a product that had caused such a reaction, but I am so glad I gave it the time that it needed to work.</li>
            <li> and it actually looked and felt better too.</li>
            <li> but a big difference sceen from before i started using it works better than anything else i have tried before.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different cleansers and products.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day pea size amount and it lathers very well!</li>
            <li> and it cleans it very well without drying!</li>
            <li> It also helps offset the higher price of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> After using this cleanser for about a month, my skin has really cleared up!</li>
            <li> The best part is that I only need a tiny amount, like smaller than a pea.</li>
            <li> This is one the best cleanse/tone, I have been using this product for the past ten years and wouldn&#x27;t want to replace it with anything else!</li>
            <li> While I love the product, I find it dries my skin if used daily.  </li>
            <li> but after about the first 2wks.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser, I started seeing the results within one week.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using it with the toner and moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> If you want to try this out, be sure to check your face by day two to ensure you are not getting the same reaction as me.</li>
            <li> PRETTY WELL.</li>
            <li> It has really cleared up her skin!</li>
            <li> Whether your teen or in your mature skin years looking for clear beautiful skin I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for stopping breakouts I use it everyday and my face is always clear.</li>
            <li> keep my face clean and clear with non of those side effects.</li>
            <li> Helps keep the skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my face clear and clean.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son because it got such good reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> At first, it seemed that this cleanser was drying on my face, but in reality, it&#x27;s really gentle for me</li>
            <li> Also, be aware that most of their moisturizers contain parabens and many other potentially unsafe chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> was the only reason I had fine lines in the first place.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best wash ever-i&#x27;ll never go back and use anything else.</li>
            <li> this product would dry my skin and cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that mine started to become less effective</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser once a day or it makes my skin too dry now that it&#x27;s winter, but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has cleared up and looks better</li>
            <li> Oh well, maybe this product is just too strong for me, I&#x27;m going to go back to the anti-redness formulation.</li>
            <li> Strong but definitely leave your face feeling</li>
            <li> because they certainly help), however, I had to write one for this product.  </li>
            <li> Large size, works well</li>
            <li> Actually, even the fine lines around my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li> Got it in decent time too!</li>
            <li> I recommend using this with Dr. Murad’s Pure skin vitamin supplements to really kick off clearing your skin.</li>
            <li> It smells nice to and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean, not tight or &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; clean if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have very senstive skin</li>
            <li> I am very relieved to have found a product that worked so well for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have no Idea why it picks who it wants to work for.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and not at all overpowering, simply smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i had never had anything like that in my whole life.</li>
            <li> It has a gentle, minty feel and leaves skin refreshed and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Been using Neutrogena&#x27;s 3 step acne process sold in drugstores and has worked really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li> Well fast forward, I&#x27;ve decided to try it again.  </li>
            <li> Even though this felt great, I think I was severely irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> ) Be gentle - if you&#x27;re going to exfoliate, do it infrequently and choose a chemical exfoliant over a mechanical one (meaning a gel over a scrub).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stick wit proactiv or acne free those actually work.</li>
            <li> It foams up really well</li>
            <li> My acne is currently very well controlled, maybe it&#x27;s bc</li>
            <li> This cleanser is much too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well without too much drying.</li>
            <li> Very drying product.</li>
            <li> I think the gel is what really keeps my skin from breaking out, rather than the wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I think it&#x27;s not really necessary to use an acne cleanser as that dried out my skin even more.</li>
            <li> absolutely re-buy this product.</li>
            <li> It works FAST.</li>

            <li> I didnt see much results with this product, when it came to clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> It feels like a ton of dirt done lifted off my face thanks Murad</li>
            <li> I actually finally feel comfortable going about my day without makeup.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to try!</li>
            <li> especially on my adult skin.</li>

            <li> were you can see little bubbles and very  very easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> It took months, but I now have pretty clear skin!</li>
            <li> I have also found that this product works better in conjunction with other Murad products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this keeps it under control better than any other product I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better price on amazon than other retailers.</li>
            <li> aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other bottles of this that have lasted 6 months or more without turning into liquid.</li>
            <li> Honestly it make skin dried a little so very important to follow up with moisture.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I use the much more gentle Clinique Comforting Cream Cleaser, a tiny bit of On the Spot on any large pimples, and Dramatically Different to moisturize.</li>
            <li> IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD THE WHOLE KIT</li>
            <li> It made me break out more which is to be expected when trying a new acne product...</li>
            <li> want to be clear that this is my first time ordering this from amazon, but I have used this product for about two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin will never be completely clear (Thanks, Genetics!)</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, bought one less than a year ago</li>
            <li> Really does clear skin fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I had mild acne and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older (29yrs).</li>
            <li> the older it got,</li>
            <li> might try the 30 day starter kit to see if using the rest of the products in the line along with this particular product enhances the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> works very well and keeps my face very clear of all acne and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and this keeps me from becoming shiny all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have this cleanser in the summer, so I don&#x27;t know how it performs in high humidity).</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I decided to give in to the relatively high price of this cleanser after hearing all the hype and being fed up with my skin routine to rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> it has work better than the other acne products i have used,although it never cleared up my acne completely</li>
            <li> I was getting some pimples here and there with Neutrogena&#x27;s stuff and just wanted to see if i could find something a little better.</li>
            <li> -- I was breaking out a little bit more.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t use much, or use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I suggest you purchase the exfoliating acne treatment gel to pair it with, or the gentle treatment gel if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I believe its worth a shot, when i run out of the travel size i will definitely purchase the normal size.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t normal acne either.</li>
            <li> I contacted Murad to see if this was normal and it is not.</li>
            <li> I tired the anti-redness cleanser and loved that</li>
            <li> Not a hard wash</li>
            <li> After changing up my routine, cleansing morning and night, moisturizing after, and only applying the gel at night, my skin literally just gets better after every single use.  </li>
            <li> I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful.</li>
            <li> It also shortens the duration and lowers the severity of new breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Live in CA and received in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Works well with St. Ives blemish and blackhead scrub which I have used forever and cant live without.</li>
            <li> When I do get acne now, it is very mild and heals quickly (usually less than a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With all of these products used in conjunction, my acne was mildly reduced but EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li> but 2 weeks later it wasn&#x27;t getting better and my skin felt so rough.  </li>
            <li> sorry I spent all that good money on those department store products!!!  </li>
            <li> It might be a particular bacterium that lives on your skin that is sensitive to one sort of antibiotic rather than another.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s contains many toxic chemicals such as triclosan and tetrasodium edta which is partially why it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin on my face, and have never had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Not over-drying, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would highly reccommend you STAY AWAY from this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge change in my skin and would highly recommend this and the other products to anyone dealing with acne, young or old.</li>
            <li> I only use it on the areas of my face where I consistently breakout or tend to be oily.</li>
            <li> I have recently finished my first bottle of this cleanser.</li>
            <li> And definitely get your skin evaluated first before making your purchase.  </li>
            <li> and it was the only one that has ever worked for me consistently.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this for even mildly sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Cleaners for the past 10 years and ever time I run out and buy some more use</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has consistently worked to control my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to using this every other day and do like how clean it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li> So great that I can buy a bigger tube of just the wash without having to waste the other products that come in the kit.  </li>
            <li> I use it every morning and night, even right after the gym cause sweat on the face for too long causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> after two uses my face has completely swollen, my eye nearly swollen SHUT!</li>
            <li> Another product that my facialist recommended before I got married and it really worked, it&#x27;s so different from regular face wash.</li>
            <li> I have this product for 2-3 months now and wash day and night and still have more than half left over.</li>
            <li> It may not work as well for everyone, since we are all different, but it certainly has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I live in NYC, so it&#x27;s moderate to low humidity right now</li>
            <li> helps with mild acne, I use it along with a scrub every other day tho as you won&#x27;t get any exfoliation</li>
            <li> After my face is somewhat clean and damp I put about the size of a large pea amount of this cleanser on each cheek and rub rub rub until it starts to slightly foam up and turn white.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry you out the way most other acne products do.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the lack of better results are due to my hair secreting a lot of oils, which means I need to wash my hair every single day, as well as condition it.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Switched to the Murad system and my fave has never been so clear.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin all the time now.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this clear.</li>
            <li> It has helped to clear me up.</li>
            <li> Within a week my skin was completely clear and has stayed that way with continued use.  </li>
            <li> I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth</li>
            <li> I love it and will recommend this product to anyone who suffers from light to severe acne.</li>
            <li> it keeps my face somewhat clear although I still have issues with acne, this product works.</li>
            <li> Within 3 day we started to see her skin clear up.</li>
            <li> after using it my acne began to clear up and after a month it was all gone with NO PICKING.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is not harsh on my face like Benzoyl peroxide products can be.</li>
            <li> so I used Murad because it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After still having some acne breakouts in my early 30s, a friend told me about this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and the exfoliating cleaner by Murad for nearly 10 years now</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my 16 year old son.</li>
            <li> It completely cleared up my face</li>
            <li> I have had acne issues since puberty and I am now 39 years old.  </li>
            <li> for the last 10 or so years acne has been a real struggle for me.</li>
            <li> longer, long-winded, and overly detailed review</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear and soft since I was using The Pill as an acne solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would recommend you not to buy it.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and for some reason Proactiv gave me an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lush coal soap for acne at night, and using the murad clarifying cleanser in the shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have since figured out that the cleanser is really the key for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried this hoping to finally clear up my adult acne and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using the entire 3-step regime since the wash alone could be very drying.</li>
            <li> so I ad it shipped directly to her.</li>
            <li> (wow sounds like a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late fifties and still have many acne outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> I am a 50ish year old who loves this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars simply because it really worked well for</li>
            <li> it seems to be working so far</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this!</li>
            <li> I always joke that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s with the skin of a 16 year old in terms of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my skin so soft, and noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> My skins was too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> After four days of use, I broke out into an allergic reaction on my face where my eyes were swollen shut in my face was completely swollen.</li>
            <li> If I get any on the sides of my face, near my eyes, then my eyes swell and start closing on</li>
            <li> , I still got the white-head crops during PMS but the swelling problem has stopped completely.</li>
            <li> I am still getting white-heads on my cheeks near my nose, but they don&#x27;t swell and go away</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin too, and it did not hurt me at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all -- tea tree oil, lavender oil, Neutrogena natural this, natural that, &amp;#34;Yes</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and clearER.  </li>
            <li> This product really is about improving your overall skin health and texture.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and this has been my go-to cleanser for a decade.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and get adult acne from time to time.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t quite cleared me up completely</li>
            <li> and it completely destroyed my skin.</li>
            <li> This product completely changed my skin</li>
            <li> I bought this product for 17 year old daughter, she used as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> Was only able to use this product for 3 days before my skin became irritated and dried out.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to write this review because every person&#x27;s skin chemistry is different, but so far I have enjoyed this face wash, the green tea extract has a cooling effect on the skin, which is</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been getting more breakouts while using it, so it works at getting rid of acne (slowly).</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean without being tight, and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have about this is that it does dry out the skin quite a bit, and my skin type is normally not sensitive, but I just pair this with my favorite moisturizer</li>
            <li> I did choose this product primarily to be pain free, and not so much about vanity, but I am tired of being mistaken for a teenager due to acne in my mid-twenties.</li>
            <li> The original 3 steps definitely worked and I still use the second step occasionally.  </li>
            <li> Not only did the area around my eyes swell, but my skin got so dry that I could rub it off with my fingers even though I was using adequate moisturizer.</li>
            <li> at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face</li>
            <li> I used to get so many compliments on a daily basis about my &#x27;porcelain&#x27; skin, but it has turned into a dry red bumpy nightmare since I stopped taking birth control last</li>
            <li> and I have had a new pimple everyday from tiny to huge.</li>
            <li> Everything i tried broke me out more and it was seriously a losing battle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this is the first one that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I have mild acne at my best, and moderate acne on my worst days.</li>
            <li> This really helped solve that minor problem.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin with moderate acne, this cleanser made my face get oilier through out the day.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, this makes my acne much more worse than before, why it&#x27;s allowed sell such poison, i really wonder.</li>
            <li> I tried to keep up with this as the product claim it might explore the hidden blemish and clean up your skin deeply.</li>
            <li> I was so self-conscious it was starting to really affect me on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still get mild breakouts every few weeks and wanted something to help control it.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily but can dry out super easily, and Murad is the only face product that absorbs the extra oil without making my skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used Murad for a couple years now, but i find that using JUST this cleaner helps to keep my face really clear!</li>
            <li> It caused major problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> I initially put off purchasing Murad products due to the price tag, but let me tell you, they are worth it.</li>
            <li> except when I am pregnant, bc unfortunately, some of the ingredients are a bit unsafe for pregnant women.</li>
            <li> any face was clear by the second day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only product that has completely stopped me from having breakouts.    </li>
            <li> This regimen totally cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li> So I can really stretch how much I spent on this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Apparently, for centuries Moroccan and Indian women use the argan oil for their skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I still have hundreds of black-heads on my nose, but next to my nose they are nearly extinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like I do than this is your go to facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> They warned that the skin would look worse before it got better, which it did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got so many new breakouts, I&#x27;m starting to panic because my face looks ten times worse.</li>
            <li> it can dry your skin, so apply very briefly and gently where your skin doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me significantly longer than other products due to this reason.</li>
            <li> I usually heal quick but for some reason some of the pimples leave marks even if you do not touch.</li>
            <li> reason I only gave 4 out of 5 stars is simply because the gel was a tiny bit much for me to apply it twice a day, but that is just my individual experience with it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li> My acne worsened—in new areas of my face, I might add—and my skin was somehow still dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to get products in the same line so that they work well together towards a common goal.  </li>
            <li> On a regular day, my face is shine free for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> The system requires twice a day use, but if your skin starts to feel tight or dry and more breakouts surface, I recommend using it once a day and use the other products sparingly.  </li>
            <li> It does smell a little funny, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, but smooth and refreshed...has a slight mentholy  tingle to it...plus a little goes a long way for a very reasonable price, especially on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing a dermatologist regularly for almost 6 years to clear my acne and after using topical treatments, pills, including things like Retin-A and different antibacterial oral pills</li>
            <li> : After a week of following the kit directly, I noticed that the exfoliating gel twice a day was making my skin a tiny bit itchy, so I stopped using it in the morning and only used the gel at night.  </li>
            <li> but I was expecting this due to the high content of medicine.  </li>
            <li> It will not dry problems skin, yet you will feel that your skin has been deeply cleansed.</li>
            <li> so you can get away with a using a very small amount to clean your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I suggest that after first 2 uses only use every other day... my skin got very dry and itchy and flaky.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably gentle, but I suggest moisturizing after use, as it may leave your skin feeling a little tight/dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have very dry skin, redness around my nose (maybe rosacea?), and pimples everywhere, not cystic, but definitely raised pimples/acne all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, i quickly returned back to Neutrogena and already my skin is getting back to normal after just a couple of days on Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I bought is product for my husband due to his adult acne issues.  </li>
            <li> I continued to use the product, and after a few days, not only did I not have an oil problem and my eyes were back to normal,</li>
            <li> and I wake up with new acne much less than I used</li>
            <li> have very sensitive facial skin and all other products leave my face feeling dry and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it only got worse and worse and worse, so I am kind of glad</li>
            <li> Neutrogena only costs about $36 in the drugstore for the 3 step system and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and therefore these reviews can only be minimally helpful toward finding a skincare routine that works for your individual situation.</li>
            <li> I use it with my Clarisonic, so it&#x27;s lasting a really long time.</li>
            <li> I dont expect it to last as long once it gets warmer</li>
            <li> This product is not bad, but not great either.</li>
            <li> My skin gets a little tight right after washing my face with Murad, but that goes away after about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and cleanses it at the same time</li>
            <li> I could only wash my face with this a couple of times per week or my skin would get way too dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> Definitely cleared up acne, but was harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product line for two days and my face has broken out in the worse kind of pimples -- deep, sore, red ones.</li>
            <li> When I get home from work I immediately use an eye makeup remover only on my eyes, I then use a cotton soft disposable pad that I saturate with plain water to take off a lot of my face make up.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to try products with different active ingredients and see what works for your skin.</li>
            <li> and it really does, when I first using it years ago, it make my breakout went crazy for the first3 weeks, but</li>
            <li> At least 90% of my breakout are KEPT gone thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used it 2x a day and so far am not pleased at the no results, especially for the money and claims by the company.</li>
            <li> I changed the rating to 5 stars even though I decided that the minor swelling and puffiness around my eyes was indeed caused by this product.</li>
            <li> While using this product, my skin has ranged from minimal acne to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if it would work on my sudden, stress breakouts as well.</li>
            <li> Every day the pimples shrink and are fading away, but it is expected to have an occasional pimple here or there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw a marked improvement within just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little tight if I don&#x27;t put my lotion on right away, but it never has dried out my skin enough so that it peels.</li>
            <li> I will never switch to any other facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> than it has in a long time!</li>
            <li> yes it still works after that long!</li>
            <li> My face started going through the purge process that some other reviews talk about where a bunch of white heads pop up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look that much different than when I did before using Murad, other than I am not swollen anymore.</li>
            <li> After the brand that i usually ordered from you was not listed any more, I became quite frustrated, so I decided to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; this one that pretty well matched the ingredients of the other.  </li>
            <li> It works well on my combination dry / oily skin.</li>
            <li> But beware that it does dry the skin.</li>
            <li> (make my skin too dry).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get dry from it</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend at least trying it.</li>
            <li> Not everyone sees dramatic results right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with combination skin and little breakouts, but little is enough.</li>
            <li> Since using this on a regular basis (2x/day) along with the Murad toner my level of oil has gone down drastically.</li>
            <li> We typically get this product at our local store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying, so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> Not much care is given to packaging.</li>
            <li> But be careful -</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for quite a while now until the tube is almost empty.  </li>
            <li> Cleans wells and helps my breakouts be minimal.  </li>
            <li> I have heard about this murad cleanser but never really looked into it.</li>
            <li> A tube this size should last a few months with use twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had clearer skin, and minimal breakouts</li>
            <li> My only concern is that I would pair using this with a heavy duty lotion after use because it can be and feel drying after use.</li>
            <li> It was no longer rough and flaky.  </li>
            <li> Every few days I will put 2-3 aspirin in a tiny cup and let them dissove then wash my face and before I rinse off the murad I put the aspirin mixture on my face and let it all site for 2-3 min.</li>
            <li> , I have pale, slightly sensitive, typical combination skin - a little oily and prone to break outs on my T-zone, but prone to dryness everywhere else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating trying to find the right cleanser for combination skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had to travel recently and didn&#x27;t use it, and could tell my skin was worse only a few days later.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to help the rough dry texture, uneven tone, and pimple map on my face.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID</li>
            <li> Since I have adult acne and have never had acne before, this has been the only cleaner to actually put a halt to this crazy outbreak and thoroughly washes off all of my make</li>
            <li> I do not use any other Murad products.  </li>
            <li> I used it on two occasions, and within 30 seconds felt extreme dryness on my face.</li>
            <li> So the sink is getting most of my face soap :( .</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried other, cheaper products.  </li>
            <li> I would not have any other product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll contemplate trying other Murad products based on my satisfaction with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pro-active and other drugstore brand face cleansers that didn&#x27;t improve my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Apparently, these reactions are common.</li>
            <li> This product does work, but it&#x27;s extremely drying</li>
            <li> I put it on after a layer of jojoba oil to prevent extreme dryness</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily</li>
            <li> Disclosure, he also uses the other additional Murad Acne product line to go with this cleanser as well.</li>
            <li> I tried Clinique, Proactive, and other over the counter products and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I keep trying samples of other fancy cleansers, but always return to this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product again for 6 months now in combination with the other acne products in the Murad line.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> It gives a tingly sensation due to the 1.5% salycylic acid ingredient.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical about using this product, as many people are skeptical about using new acne products.  </li>
            <li> Little expensive, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> probably due to some component of it breaking down over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The key is to leave it on your face for at least 60 seconds and let it kill all the surface bacteria.  </li>
            <li> maybe i didn&#x27;t give it long enough, but after a week the skin got a lot worse</li>
            <li> in all, this product is fairly average.</li>
            <li> Fads dark marks and keeps my acne in check</li>
            <li> I use the entire murad acne complex line.</li>
            <li> I recommend this 100% to anyone with acne issues that are keeping you down.  </li>
            <li> is a break down of the changes I saw on a weekly basis:&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li> I also purchased the clarisonic Mia 2 and pimples are finally a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this product, a pea-size amount usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad.</li>
            <li> I think the less</li>
            <li> I use the less</li>
            <li> I think I have less blackheads.  </li>
            <li> product leaves a slight cooling sensation on my skin (which I like).</li>
            <li> It cleared my skin up within two days or less.</li>
            <li> nothing was even making a slight difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My acne was fully gone in less than 2 days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier than your average face wash</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I found Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser a little over a year ago and it has changed my skin.  </li>
            <li> ) Be patient - there is no way to know what&#x27;s working if you don&#x27;t give products a little time&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying</li>
            <li> I still get little break outs on my chin but NOTHING compared to what i used to have.</li>
            <li> , I still get these little white-heads</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and would get lots of acne on my chin regularly and occasionally in random places on my face.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena On the Spot treatment (with a thin layer all over my face, and a little thicker on my problem areas), and Dramatically Different to moisturize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About two weeks ago, I started a new diet, which has me eating a ridiculous amount of vegetables (compared to my horrendously unhealthy preferences before).</li>
            <li> Spent way too much money on Murad products, bought the cleanser, the spot treatment and the moisturizer and after 2 weeks my skin exploded into a field of acne so bad that my face hurt just to touch it.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product will destroy your face.</li>
            <li> I was not comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> I still get a few bumps around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; but nothing like before.</li>
            <li> I think it was too harsh.  </li>
            <li> So I wear tinted moisturizer, foundation, translucent powder, bronzing powder and a powder blush everyday</li>
            <li> either where your skin feels dried out, however i should add that i have brown skin.</li>
            <li> it goes away a few days faster when i use this product.</li>
            <li> (I pair it with my Clarisonic a few times a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whenever I stop using it for a few days I immediately break out.</li>
            <li> The face wash really dried out my face</li>
            <li> Let me provide a run-down of my acne trouble BEFORE using Murad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once in the morning and again at night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I smells a little like eucalyptus, but it&#x27;s not a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> But they all pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> There is no worse feeling then paying an arm and a leg for a bunch of expensive products that don&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> At first it cleared my skin but after a few months of use, I started to breakout realllyyy bad</li>
            <li> There is a dramatic difference, especially on the forehead.</li>
            <li> I had not ever had big painful pimples, but I had fell for it will get bad before it gets better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few years and have no desire to try anything else.</li>
            <li> was very tight.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this system it was several years ago and my acne got worst, not to mention it dried my skin.  </li>
            <li> They told me that it would only turn watery if exposed to extreme heat or cold.</li>
            <li> Other times I&#x27;ve gotten those nasty little clogged pores, which is only noticeably in natural sunlight.  </li>
            <li> If for some reason I don&#x27;t have it and use something different, my skin lets me know it&#x27;s not happy!</li>
            <li> I usually break out a lot, but since I&#x27;ve started using this cleanser, my almost never break out anymore.</li>
            <li> It definitely reduced the size of pimples that would randomly camp out on my face.</li>
            <li> I had excessively oily skin prone to blackheads and pimples.</li>
            <li> I am not able to see any differences comparing to before using it</li>
            <li> I had him use just a small amount for a week.  </li>
            <li> I tried like every brand and line and found aloe vera gel to be the secret weapon to acne rather than other products.</li>
            <li> I kept the container in my bathroom in the undersink cabinet - thus no extreme heat or cold conditions occurred from my actions.</li>
            <li> I hardly break out anymore.  </li>
            <li> I also use this product by adding baking soda to it, rubbing it together in hands, and massaging on my face monthly or when the face seems dull and needs life.</li>
            <li> you must stick with it for at least 2 weeks to a month to start seeing results.  </li>
            <li> and if I do I will have negative effects.</li>
            <li> : When I started, I purchased the Acne Complex, which comes with an exfoliating gel, moisturizer, and spot treatment in addition to this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne and have had HORRIBLE breakouts which made me look into finding a solution that wouldn&#x27;t break my budget entirely.  </li>
            <li> I still get acne, but not the deep, angry, red, painful acne I had been getting.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of crap in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from pretty bad acne for almost to years!</li>
            <li> No more painful deep acne on my chin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad combination skin prone to break-outs constantly.</li>
            <li> I try really hard to not have a backup tube at all times!</li>
            <li> I started breaking out really badly for the past year and a half, i could not get rid of it for anything.</li>
            <li> My face was terrible after giving birth to my first born and I literally tried everything.</li>
            <li> It did not work for either of us, and made my acne much worse.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken on this it, but I transferred it to another.  </li>
            <li> But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week and my face got a lot worse.</li>
            <li> The bottle is broken, therefore, it is leaking.</li>
            <li> My skin got worse and as soon as I stopped using it my skin cleared up.</li>
            <li> My package came in today and it was  broken and leaking</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend that anyways because it is over-washing, which is just as unhealthy and not washing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an oily, acne prone beast but this really decreased my break outs, it was recommended by a youtube guru and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> The poor kid.  </li>
            <li> If something doesn&#x27;t work for you, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the product is lousy; it just means the product isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Sometimes as an adult, I still get those random ugly pimples!  </li>
            <li> Mine was a little oily but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne just a few bumps and pimples that come up  </li>
            <li> During PMS I get white-heads in crops on my eyebrows, hair line, nostrils and chin which usually swell to the point where they are painful.</li>
            <li> The wrong face wash came</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after weeks of usage, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li> am going to continue using Murad because it is helping, and it is possible that with me and how awful my acne is, that it just takes longer.</li>
            <li> I read in an article that R&amp;B singer Melanie Fiona uses this product to control her random breakouts.</li>
            <li> It has kept acne breakouts at bay and has helped with balancing my skin as well (I do not have dry/oily spots randomly all over)</li>
            <li> Its useless to take off eye makeup though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also this cleanser does not seem to dry out my skin too terribly.  </li>
            <li> then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Neutrogena wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me!  </li>
            <li> Very difficult on a girl&#x27;s self image and self confidence.  </li>
            <li> I have used all the very expensive cleansers that money can</li>
            <li> I was having a bad forehead breakout</li>
            <li> Well they hit it on the nose for getting bad but it been two months</li>
            <li> I started having breakouts really bad, every week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen my skin so bad.</li>
            <li> and i have really bad acne.</li>
            <li> but if your skin is oily it shouldn&#x27;t be too bad</li>
            <li> Still have some acne but its not as bad as it was before.</li>
            <li> Oily to the point where sometimes I look like I&#x27;m sweating :(</li>
            <li> Still breaking out though! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now got to book an appointment with a dermatologist to fix all these breakouts. :(</li>
            <li> Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and I&#x27;m speaking from experience here.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed since i blew about $80 on all the Murad products.</li>
            <li> It was the WORST</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had terrible acne, but some spots here and there.</li>
            <li> One morning I woke up with an awful rash on my face and neck and immediately printed the return label for this.  </li>
            <li> If you have acne, blemishes from makeup...try this product, you will not be disappointed!!!!  </li>
            <li> Horrible experience.</li>
            <li> And for those people with review said that Murad make their breakout even worst, just keep using this for about a month</li>
            <li> I have horrible black-heads in the hundreds on my nose, forehead and chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I broke out so horrible along my jawline.</li>
            <li> Well, it was terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2000. It&#x27;s just the face wash that works for me. Haven&#x27;t had breakouts since then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good cleanser for porous and acne prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and cleanses it at the same time</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.....keeps my skin clear without drying it out. I have very senstive skin and it is not harsh on my face like Benzoyl peroxide products can be.</li>
            <li> This, along with Murad&#x27;s exfoliating acne treatment gel and skin perfecting lotion are the perfect skin regimen (I would say that I have combination skin), and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Little expensive, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;All acne users know that each product works differently on each person.  There is no one cure-all.&lt;br /&gt;I have had good luck with breakouts, but this will not help your blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is buy the travel size and give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> Love the cleanser but you can get for cheaper</li>
            <li> My face was terrible after giving birth to my first born and I literally tried everything. This product was recommended to me from a friend so I thought i would give it a shot. I ended up ordering off of amazon because it was a lot cheaper to order here vs. stores in the mall.  I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to others. I am very relieved to have found a product that worked so well for me. i will definitely order again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Best Stuff Ever!!!! Skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I never had acne until my mid 20&#x27;s. I tried everything you could think. From prescription creams to home remedies involving Indian spices that turn your face orange. I didn&#x27;t even know what this stuff was at first.  I was showering at a friends house and used it. When I got out of the shower within a matter of 10 minutes, my face was no longer red and my pimples downed in size by a great amount! I have oily oily OILY skin. Oily to the point where sometimes I look like I&#x27;m sweating :( but this is freaking fabtastic! It clears my oil right up! I also purchased the clarisonic Mia 2 and pimples are finally a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> I just started using this 3 days ago. I was very impressed with how great it started to immediately work on my oily t-zone. I first used it on a Thursday evening, and Friday was fine. However, when I used it on Friday, I woke up Saturday morning with my eyes swollen and puffy. I wasn&#x27;t sure that it was the product since we have had some warm weather and it could be allergens, so I used it again Saturday, and now my eyes are swollen again today (Sunday). I just wanted to put this in a review to give a possible warning and to see if perhaps anyone else is experiencing this problem. My skin looks great, but I may have to discontinue using the product. I will update this review when I either confirm or eliminate that the problem is with the cleanser.    UPDATE: I changed the rating to 5 stars even though I decided that the minor swelling and puffiness around my eyes was indeed caused by this product. Not only did the area around my eyes swell, but my skin got so dry that I could rub it off with my fingers even though I was using adequate moisturizer. Why the 5 stars then? Because, I was so amazed at how this product controlled my oiliness, that I wanted to experiment to see if there was some sort of \\&quot;adjustment\\&quot; period to the skin cells. I continued to use the product, and after a few days, not only did I not have an oil problem and my eyes were back to normal, but I had wonderfully smooth and hydrated skin! I would have never considered using a product that had caused such a reaction, but I am so glad I gave it the time that it needed to work. And by the way, I am 49 years-old and have never been able to find a product that did anything to control the oiliness. Best product ever!</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this cleanser! Still breaking out though! :(</li>
            <li> I have no Idea why it picks who it wants to work for. It was the WORST **** I ever used on my face. I was having a bad forehead breakout so I used Murad because it was for sensitive skin. Well The next day I had three big pimples on my cheek. I had not ever had big painful pimples, but I had fell for it will get bad before it gets better. Well they hit it on the nose for getting bad but it been two months and I have had a new pimple everyday from tiny to huge. I usually heal quick but for some reason some of the pimples leave marks even if you do not touch. I have enough. EVEN a handful of members agreed on ACNE.ORG. I wish I did my research maybe I would have seem the lawsuits that they have had for the ****.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters love this product and Anazon sells it at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I was using proactiv with ok, but not perfect, results. My friend recommended Murad, and since I respect her, I bought 2 kits (one for me and one for my sister) wasting about $200. It did not work for either of us, and made my acne much worse. My face was red and felt like it would explode. For some people it&#x27;s better to use products with benzoyl peroxide (which is not in the Murad products, if I am not mistaken).</li>
            <li> This product is great, I am currently deployed and have to deal with the elements drying my face out while my T-zone is oily. This product perfectly balances my skin; along with the Toner and the Skin Perfecting Lotion. The Skin Perfecting Lotion is actually the best product of the three, and has given me tremendous results. It gives the perfect amount of moisture and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken on this it, but I transferred it to another.  Not much care is given to packaging.</li>
            <li> i have seen and heard where everyone has used everything on the market, and i am one of those people too. i thought i was doomed with acne forever. then i saw the tv ad for Murad and i thought what do i have to lose? so i ordered it,and it is amazing. within a week i started to see my face clearing up and it actually looked and felt better too. i use the 3 step system which probably helps alot too. but i am going to use this until they discontinue. Murad saved my face :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF I USE TO USE IT YEARS AGO IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD THE WHOLE KIT BUT THESE TIME I JUST BOUGHT THE CLEANER AND STILL LOVE IT, IT HAS HELPED WITH THE OILYNESS OF MY SKIN AND IS CLEANERING UP THE MARKS I DONT HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH ACNE BUT I LOVE THIS STUFF ANYWAY AND HAS A GREAT COOL FEELING ON THE SKIN!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had terrible acne, but some spots here and there. My sister always had this in their shower so I would use it when visiting. I noticed after I got home how any spots I had were drying/clearing up. This was over 3 years ago and I&#x27;m still using it today! If for some reason I don&#x27;t have it and use something different, my skin lets me know it&#x27;s not happy! I do have very sensitive skin on my face, and have never had any problems with this product. I highly recommend at least trying it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling refreshingly clean after use. It keeps oil at bay all day! The smell is light and not at all overpowering, simply smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It works well on my combination dry / oily skin. Does not irritate or cause redness.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced this product to me and I thank her all the time. I usually break out a lot, but since I&#x27;ve started using this cleanser, my almost never break out anymore. Thank you Murad.</li>
            <li> After still having some acne breakouts in my early 30s, a friend told me about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it and the exfoliating cleaner by Murad for nearly 10 years now and it&#x27;s the only product that has completely stopped me from having breakouts.    It can be drying so I only use it on the areas of my face where I consistently breakout or tend to be oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every type of acne product out there and this is by far my favorite! It works a lot better than proactive without sucking all the moisture out of your skin. Also, Amazon has the best price especially when you can use their free shipping!</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad. I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID but they never fully got rid of my pimples. So then I tried murad at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face i had never had anything like that in my whole life. But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.I had not seen blackheads on my face since i was a teen. Even though i have stopped using murad for about two weeks it&#x27;s damage is still being done. my face has those big red pimples all over it and some are still coming up because of the blackheads. The healing process is taking longer then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy. All i have to say is buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few years and have no desire to try anything else. It has a gentle, minty feel and leaves skin refreshed and rejuvenated. It&#x27;s a very gentle cleanser, and since I have especially sensitive skin, I find that it works best. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a long-term cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love it so far. I have been using it for a little over a week and I can tell a huge difference in my skin! So nice to find a good face wash, I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Purchased it for my 16 year old son. In a week his acne looked better. I also bought the acne spot treatment from Murad too. Very effective when used together.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product for her acne.</li>
            <li> except when I am pregnant, bc unfortunately, some of the ingredients are a bit unsafe for pregnant women. It makes your face feel truly clean and a bit tingly. It completely cleared up my face and I am so thankful to finally find a product that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, bought one less than a year ago and I still use it today. A little bit goes a long way with this product, a pea-size amount usually does the trick. It definitely reduced the size of pimples that would randomly camp out on my face. The only gripe I have about this is that it does dry out the skin quite a bit, and my skin type is normally not sensitive, but I just pair this with my favorite moisturizer and it&#x27;s good as gold. Don&#x27;t let the price on this one scare you, it&#x27;s cheaper buying it on Amazon than say Beauty Brands (where I bought mine for $26).</li>
            <li> Great product - love it</li>
            <li> works great. good price.</li>
            <li> excellent product for acne prone skin, at an exceptionally low price. Use with the exfoliating acne treatment gel, acne spot treatment and the skin perfecting lotion for even better results.</li>
            <li> this has worked for me and i have oily skin the price was not bad used along with toner and correcting cream it has work better than the other acne products i have used,although it never cleared up my acne completely but a big difference sceen from before i started using it works better than anything else i have tried before.</li>
            <li> Since I have adult acne and have never had acne before, this has been the only cleaner to actually put a halt to this crazy outbreak and thoroughly washes off all of my make up - have re-bought several times.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing good results from using this product. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad for years and love it!</li>
            <li> Great for stopping breakouts I use it everyday and my face is always clear.</li>
            <li> I have had acne issues since puberty and I am now 39 years old.  Very difficult on a girl&#x27;s self image and self confidence.  I&#x27;ve been on antibiotics several times, every topical wash and treatment.  I even resorted to Accutane 2 times which cleared my skin for sure, but the acne quickly returned after finishing the treatment.  I found Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser a little over a year ago and it has changed my skin.  I hardly break out anymore.  It&#x27;s a miracle for me!!  It also causes my skin to have a clean, glow look.  I recommend this 100% to anyone with acne issues that are keeping you down.  Remember though - you must stick with it for at least 2 weeks to a month to start seeing results.  I also purchased the Exfoliating Acne Gel to put on after washing with the cleanser.  I think it&#x27;s a must to partner these two products together for the &amp;#34;clearing&amp;#34; to work.  Again, great products that actually work!!</li>
            <li> It took months, but I now have pretty clear skin! I started having breakouts really bad, every week. Switched to the Murad system and my fave has never been so clear. I&#x27;ll continue to use!!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. Can&#x27;t go without. 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Worked great when I used with Mario Badescu Aloe Moisturizer for day and Retinol​ Cream at night. This regimen totally cleared up my adult acne. Then, I got pregnant and my skin revolted against everything, including this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun to clean up my face. Been using Neutrogena&#x27;s 3 step acne process sold in drugstores and has worked really well. But i wanted to see if i could find something that cleared up my skin 100%. I was getting some pimples here and there with Neutrogena&#x27;s stuff and just wanted to see if i could find something a little better. Did research online to find a good product, felt hopeful with customer reviews of Murad on here. Spent way too much money on Murad products, bought the cleanser, the spot treatment and the moisturizer and after 2 weeks my skin exploded into a field of acne so bad that my face hurt just to touch it. I&#x27;ve never seen my skin so bad. Needless to say, i quickly returned back to Neutrogena and already my skin is getting back to normal after just a couple of days on Neutrogena. Very disappointed since i blew about $80 on all the Murad products. Neutrogena only costs about $36 in the drugstore for the 3 step system and lasts for a long time. Tossing my Murad products in the trash, unless someone wants to buy off me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> for the last 10 or so years acne has been a real struggle for me. I had excessively oily skin prone to blackheads and pimples. Since using this on a regular basis (2x/day) along with the Murad toner my level of oil has gone down drastically. I&#x27;m also proud to announce j have been pimple free for 6 months now and I only started using this 6.5-7 months ago.</li>
            <li> Really does clear skin fast. I get alot of acne any face was clear by the second day. But beware that it does dry the skin. I suggest that after first 2 uses only use every other day... my skin got very dry and itchy and flaky.  Now im trying to reverse the dryness...</li>
            <li> Great acne control face wash. It can be very drying so make sure you have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing. I would recommend purchasing this cleanser for adult acne twice daily and a good lotion to prevent drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect product for acne. Works very well without over drying the skin. Easy to wash off, and works well with acne. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am thirteen and i have really bad acne. I started using this 8-9 months ago right after the philosophy clear days ahead. I love murad. I like the cooling sensation on my face. i quit using it for a month. i couldnt go without it. i picked it up and used it again. i am glad i found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with combination skin and little breakouts, but little is enough. When I first tried this system it was several years ago and my acne got worst, not to mention it dried my skin.  Well fast forward, I&#x27;ve decided to try it again.  This time I only use the cleanser at night followed by palmers skin therapy oil as my nightly moisturizer.  In the morning, I use only water (no cleansers), the murad toner, and murad lotion moisturizer.  My skin started to look better in one week.  I think the less I use the less this product would dry my skin and cause more breakouts.  The system requires twice a day use, but if your skin starts to feel tight or dry and more breakouts surface, I recommend using it once a day and use the other products sparingly.  I gave it a four because I can&#x27;t use it twice a day and if I do I will have negative effects. The products do work well together, just have to use it in a way that will work for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a couple of years and worked well to my oily skin. However, I just started feeling this is too strong (make my skin too dry). Maybe because of my age (mid-30s).</li>
            <li> Great price. Better than in store</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six months now. I have mild acne at my best, and moderate acne on my worst days. It seems to be hormone/stress/diet related. I&#x27;m 23.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short story: While using this product, my skin has ranged from minimal acne to moderate acne. So I have no idea if this stuff actually works. What I do know is that, overall, it has a drying effect for me. It seems to me that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and therefore these reviews can only be minimally helpful toward finding a skincare routine that works for your individual situation. I have also found that this product works better in conjunction with other Murad products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer, long-winded, and overly detailed review: When I started, I purchased the Acne Complex, which comes with an exfoliating gel, moisturizer, and spot treatment in addition to this cleanser. With all of these products used in conjunction, my acne was mildly reduced but EXTREMELY dry. I removed the exfoliating gel from my routine, and the dryness was reduced. I was satisfied at this point as I was resigned to the fact that my skin would never be clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran out of the Murad moisturizer, so I fell back on Clinique Dramatically Different, which I happened to have on hand. My acne worsened—in new areas of my face, I might add—and my skin was somehow still dry. I was also using a scrub at this time, two to three times a week. Even though this felt great, I think I was severely irritating my skin. Yikes. I&#x27;ll take the blame for that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two weeks ago, I started a new diet, which has me eating a ridiculous amount of vegetables (compared to my horrendously unhealthy preferences before). I have eaten more kale in two weeks than I have in my whole life. I also decided to experiment with my skincare routine. Now, I use this Murad cleanser ONLY AT NIGHT (since it&#x27;s drying), followed by Neutrogena On the Spot treatment (with a thin layer all over my face, and a little thicker on my problem areas), and Dramatically Different to moisturize. In the morning, I use the much more gentle Clinique Comforting Cream Cleaser, a tiny bit of On the Spot on any large pimples, and Dramatically Different to moisturize. In two weeks, my acne has been greatly reduced! My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear and soft since I was using The Pill as an acne solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what I&#x27;ve learned overall is the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Eat your veggies&lt;br /&gt;b) Be gentle - if you&#x27;re going to exfoliate, do it infrequently and choose a chemical exfoliant over a mechanical one (meaning a gel over a scrub).&lt;br /&gt;c) Be patient - there is no way to know what&#x27;s working if you don&#x27;t give products a little time&lt;br /&gt;d) Neutrogena On the Spot may be the best drugstore acne product ever.&lt;br /&gt;e) What works for me might not work for anyone else. If something doesn&#x27;t work for you, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the product is lousy; it just means the product isn&#x27;t *right* for you.</li>
            <li> I use this face wash twice a day.  I do not use any other Murad products.  I can, with 100% certainty, tell you this product works.  The key is to leave it on your face for at least 60 seconds and let it kill all the surface bacteria.  It will take a full bottle before you will really begin to notice a decrease in blemishes and the rate in which they occur.  This is also the best price I have seen it for.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with this product, it feels so fresh &amp; clean. Acne clears up in 2 days. Does not over dry your skin, pleasant fragrance!</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I had mild acne and occasional breakouts. At first it cleared my skin but after a few months of use, I started to breakout realllyyy bad, I haven&#x27;t had such breakouts before I used this product. My cheeks especially. I don&#x27;t discourage you from buying it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for every type of skin obviously. Mine was a little oily but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for six months now. I have to say it&#x27;s great and refreshing. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have clear skin all the time now. When I do run out and use another product, I notice an immediate change in my skin. I try really hard to not have a backup tube at all times!</li>
            <li> This product will destroy your face. I used it for a week and my face got a lot worse. If you have sensitive skin I would recommend you not to buy it.     Get acne free, that stuff is just like proactiv but cheaper. Stick wit proactiv or acne free those actually work.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin probably, my forehead tends to get oily, but the rest of my face is fine. I tried so many different cleansers and products. this is the only one that actually helps. But be careful - it can dry your skin, so apply very briefly and gently where your skin doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I use for day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive facial skin and all other products leave my face feeling dry and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  keep my face clean and clear with non of those side effects. I have this product for 2-3 months now and wash day and night and still have more than half left over. Great product and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone looking for an alternative facial wash.&lt;br /&gt;The Murad moisturizer lotion is great too!</li>
            <li> I love it. It lasts for about 4 months! I use it twice a day pea size amount and it lathers very well! I have oily skin and it cleans it very well without drying!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have recently finished my first bottle of this cleanser. I thought it was a very effective cleaner; it made my face tingle slightly and feel very clean without over-drying. While it did improve my breakouts, it isn&#x27;t the cure-all solution that people are always seeking (psst, it doesn&#x27;t exist).     One thing that is really great about it is how little you need to use. It foams up really well so you can get away with a using a very small amount to clean your entire face and neck. One bottle lasted me significantly longer than other products due to this reason. It also helps offset the higher price of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> My acne is currently very well controlled, maybe it&#x27;s bc I&#x27;m getting older (29yrs). I still get mild breakouts every few weeks and wanted something to help control it. I tired the anti-redness cleanser and loved that and thought I&#x27;d try this. This cleanser is much too drying for my skin. I used it on two occasions, and within 30 seconds felt extreme dryness on my face. I also thought like my skin looks a bit scaly , which made going without makeup  a look I was not comfortable with.  Oh well, maybe this product is just too strong for me, I&#x27;m going to go back to the anti-redness formulation.</li>
            <li> Works well without too much drying.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for quite a while now until the tube is almost empty.  I think this is a good cleanser with the added benefits of salicylic acid.  I think I have less blackheads.  Also this cleanser does not seem to dry out my skin too terribly.  I may use this again and I am a chronic skin care changer.</li>
            <li> Tried to switch out my proactive plus for murad.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks, and I definitely don&#x27;t think that it clears my skin as well as the proactive used to.  But, it&#x27;s not a terrible product- just not the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to post my review until I had enough time to use it and to see how it affected my skin. I initially put off purchasing Murad products due to the price tag, but let me tell you, they are worth it. At first, it seemed that this cleanser was drying on my face, but in reality, it&#x27;s really gentle for me (I&#x27;ve got fair, combo skin, prone to deep, cystic acne along my chin and whiteheads on my forehead/temples). After using this cleanser for about a month, my skin has really cleared up! No more painful deep acne on my chin! I still get a few bumps around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; but nothing like before. The best part is that I only need a tiny amount, like smaller than a pea. So I can really stretch how much I spent on this cleanser. I highly recommend this cleanser and now that I have the Olay face scrubber, it&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and every now and then I try something else. Always go back to this. It&#x27;s an essential for me.</li>
            <li> One lovely college age daughter now has clear, blemish free skin after using this product.  We have tried Pro Active, other drug store acne products but find this one, combined with a healthy lifestyle, good nutrition, good sleep, and exercise, works the best. She also uses the Murad vitamins, so they may be a contributing factor.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have read the reviews and found a system that actually works.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and for some reason Proactiv gave me an allergic reaction.  I think it was too harsh.  I suffer from adult acne and have had HORRIBLE breakouts which made me look into finding a solution that wouldn&#x27;t break my budget entirely.  There is no worse feeling then paying an arm and a leg for a bunch of expensive products that don&#x27;t work!  Murad has a great reputation as well, and although it&#x27;s not too pricey, it&#x27;s not too cheap either.  Unfortunately Neutrogena wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me!  It&#x27;s important to get products in the same line so that they work well together towards a common goal.  And definitely get your skin evaluated first before making your purchase.  Massage Envy locations use Murad products, so they were able to give me a skin analysis and I went home and ordered the stuff a la carte.  I use this along with the Clarifying Toner and Gentle Acne gel and it has reduced the amount of breakouts within the first week of me using it!  It also shortens the duration and lowers the severity of new breakouts.  I will be using this stuff for a while!  It&#x27;s always good to stick with something that works!</li>
            <li> I ordered this a week ago and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, along with Murad&#x27;s Acne Clearing Solution and Murad&#x27;s Acne Clarifying Wipes. And both seem to be working alright at the moment. I thought it would be clearing a bit faster and I&#x27;ve been getting more breakouts while using it, so it works at getting rid of acne (slowly). I&#x27;ll probably update this after another week or so, to see if there&#x27;s any improvement.</li>
            <li> Very drying product. Definitely cleared up acne, but was harsh on my sensitive skin. I could only wash my face with this a couple of times per week or my skin would get way too dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face was for years and it was the only one that has ever worked for me consistently.</li>
            <li> I have been through many products trying to get my skin under control. I like this cleanser because it smells very good, makes your face feel very tingly, fresh, and clean. Doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin, unless it gets around my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lush coal soap for acne at night, and using the murad clarifying cleanser in the shower in the morning. Each time, I follow with the murad exfoliating acne gel. I think the gel is what really keeps my skin from breaking out, rather than the wash. After washing my face is clean and warm and pores are open and the gel seems to penetrate well (no matter what wash I use) and I wake up with new acne much less than I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COULD SKIP THIS CLEANSER, BUT PLEASE TRY TO EXFOLIATING ACNE GEL- I think it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> The bottle is broken, therefore, it is leaking. So the sink is getting most of my face soap :( .</li>
            <li> I originally bought this cleanser from the infomercial with the whole 3 step system.  They warned that the skin would look worse before it got better, which it did.  I have since figured out that the cleanser is really the key for me.  I have dry skin and would get lots of acne on my chin regularly and occasionally in random places on my face.  I am over forty.  The original 3 steps definitely worked and I still use the second step occasionally.  But really, this cleanser keeps me acne free.  I am happy and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I think it&#x27;s not really necessary to use an acne cleanser as that dried out my skin even more. For cleansing my face, I prefer to use Philosophy purity cleanser, which really removes all make up and keeps my skin clean and without drying out. In talking about In the Murad line, I also use the acne gel and spot treatment, which I found to work well for my acne prone skin. In order to balance out the dryness, I use Vitaville Argan Oil, which is well known for it&#x27;s anti-aging and healing properties. Apparently, for centuries Moroccan and Indian women use the argan oil for their skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this hoping to finally clear up my adult acne and the reviews were great so I gave it a try.  It made me break out more which is to be expected when trying a new acne product...but 2 weeks later it wasn&#x27;t getting better and my skin felt so rough.  I also had a more tight/shiny look to my skin.  One morning I woke up with an awful rash on my face and neck and immediately printed the return label for this.  I do not recommend this for even mildly sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling very clean and soft. I have used dozens of face washes and this one is near the top.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser I have ever used. Not over-drying, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am not able to see any differences comparing to before using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Murad before and for me it works wonders. I&#x27;d recommend using the entire 3-step regime since the wash alone could be very drying.</li>
            <li> Best face wash for breakouts I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> We typically get this product at our local store. However my step daughter lives in another state so I ad it shipped directly to her. It works wonder on teen acne.....You know the T zone kind.</li>
            <li> So I seldom write reviews (yes I know I should because they certainly help), however, I had to write one for this product.  I have been using it now for one week and my skin looks like it did when I was 24!  You can add on about 30 years to figure out my age lol lol.  I have used all the very expensive cleansers that money can but, but this one will be my one and only from now on! So I wear tinted moisturizer, foundation, translucent powder, bronzing powder and a powder blush everyday (wow sounds like a lot but that&#x27;s my routine).  When I get home from work I immediately use an eye makeup remover only on my eyes, I then use a cotton soft disposable pad that I saturate with plain water to take off a lot of my face make up.  After my face is somewhat clean and damp I put about the size of a large pea amount of this cleanser on each cheek and rub rub rub until it starts to slightly foam up and turn white.  After lightly rubbing about one minute all over my face, not near my eyes, I then use a facecloth with warm water to rinse it all off.  My face is amazingly clean and any blemishes from the makeup that I had a week ago are 95% gone!!  If you have acne, blemishes from makeup...try this product, you will not be disappointed!!!!  Honest to goodness!!!  Love it and sorry I spent all that good money on those department store products!!!  Enjoy!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one the best cleanse/tone, I have been using this product for the past ten years and wouldn&#x27;t want to replace it with anything else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a teen (am now mid-30s), and always relied on simple soap and benzoyl peroxide-based spot treatments.  Tried this because I wanted to try a salicylic acid-based treatment, and it worked like a charm.  Wash with it morning and night, and I stopped breaking out.  I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all my spot treatments because I just don&#x27;t need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test whether this was just a fluke, I&#x27;ve tried other, cheaper products.  Every time, the acne comes back and then goes away when i start using the Murad cleanser again.  For my skin, this is the stuff.  I&#x27;m a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  mind the expiration dates.  I&#x27;ve found that mine started to become less effective the older it got, probably due to some component of it breaking down over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just my two cents as a scientist, but acne can be caused by a lot of different things.  It might be your body&#x27;s immune response.  It might be a particular bacterium that lives on your skin that is sensitive to one sort of antibiotic rather than another.  What works for others might not work for you.  My only suggestion is to try products with different active ingredients and see what works for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleaners over the years, and Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser really works great.  I&#x27;m in my late fifties and still have many acne outbreaks.  Murad keeps my acne under control.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another face wash again! I have recently had severe hormonal acne outbreaks that have lead to scarring and this wash alone keeps all but one or two a month at bay! I have never had a face wash do this for me!</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and love it. It is gentle enough to use everyday to keep your skin clear and completion beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t dry you out the way most other acne products do. I am a 50ish year old who loves this product. Whether your teen or in your mature skin years looking for clear beautiful skin I would highly recommend this product. You will love the way it feels but more important you&#x27;ll love the way you look.</li>
            <li> helps with mild acne, I use it along with a scrub every other day tho as you won&#x27;t get any exfoliation but it cleanses well, I like it. Can be a little drying but if your skin is oily it shouldn&#x27;t be too bad</li>
            <li> This cleanser left a film, or residue, on my face every time I used it. It&#x27;s like you can never feel clean or get it all off. Obviously it says it stays on your skin all day to continue fighting off acne. But it never, ever feels clean. Must just be my preference. Didn&#x27;t do a lick of good with clearing up my skin though, either. My skin got worse and as soon as I stopped using it my skin cleared up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend - but obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I have sensitive/oily skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars simply because it really worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 24, I have pale, slightly sensitive, typical combination skin - a little oily and prone to break outs on my T-zone, but prone to dryness everywhere else. I live in NYC, so it&#x27;s moderate to low humidity right now (I didn&#x27;t have this cleanser in the summer, so I don&#x27;t know how it performs in high humidity). It&#x27;s very frustrating trying to find the right cleanser for combination skin. Either they&#x27;re over-drying, or they&#x27;re ineffective against the breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried many, and up until now Neutrogena seemed to be the best brand, but I&#x27;m totally converted now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about three weeks and my skin is just about flawless. I still get a spot now and then, of course; no cleanser is made of magic and fairy dust. But this is the clearest I can remember my skin being. Not only that, but my skin doesn&#x27;t seem irritated at all. It looks healthy, not parched or pink, and yet this cleanser does a really good job of taking all my makeup off. Actually, even the fine lines around my eyes are gone. Mind you, I&#x27;m not claiming this cleanser has anti-aging properties. I think what happened is that the acne cleansers I had been using before were over-drying parts of my face and the lack of moisture balance was the only reason I had fine lines in the first place. Now that my skin feels balanced and happy, it&#x27;s prettier than it&#x27;s ever looked. I&#x27;ve stopped putting foundation and powder on altogether - I just use a bit concealer and I&#x27;m out the door. I&#x27;m very very happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s nice to finally get to write a glowing review for a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will absolutely re-buy this product. If you have combination skin, give Murad a shot. It worked wonders for me, so it&#x27;s worth a try, right?</li>
            <li> It works FAST. Helps keep the skin clear and clean. And simple to use. Just wash and go. Effective product.</li>
            <li> Use this almost daily and I love it.  Works like a charm without drying out my skin. This is great.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle of this, and as a product junkie, this is a huge deal! Leaves my skin clean without being tight, and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> has a nice tingling feeling, but didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.  maybe i didn&#x27;t give it long enough, but after a week the skin got a lot worse</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser for so many years, I have lost count.  It is the primary cleanser I use on my face daily.  I would not have any other product.  It has consistently provided healthy cleansing for my face.  I will never switch to any other facial cleanser.  Thank goodness for Dr. Murad!</li>
            <li> it seems to be working so far</li>
            <li> The wrong face wash came</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this! I&#x27;ve been suffering from pretty bad acne for almost to years! It has help quite a bit with the redness and it made all my pimples smaller and takes away any irritation I have but definitely didn&#x27;t get rid of my acne and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months!!</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves you with a clean feeling - haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of improvement with my acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying it at my sister&#x27;s house.  While I love the product, I find it dries my skin if used daily.  I&#x27;ve switched to using this every other day and do like how clean it leaves my skin.  I&#x27;ll contemplate trying other Murad products based on my satisfaction with this one.</li>
            <li> Great Face wash to help with my adult acne.  Cleans wells and helps my breakouts be minimal.  Highly recommend to people in need of a good acne face wash.</li>
            <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;all in 1 acne kit&amp;#34; a couple months ago.  I found that I tend to use more cleanser than anything else.  So great that I can buy a bigger tube of just the wash without having to waste the other products that come in the kit.  Love this product.  I always joke that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s with the skin of a 16 year old in terms of breakouts.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from over the counter, to Proactive.  This is the only product that has made my skin look healthier and feel better and clear up my acne.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has problem skin.  And it smells great too!!</li>
            <li> The best thing i love about the product is that is doesn&#x27;t have an oily wash. Lathers very well were you can see little bubbles and very  very easy to rinse off. Leaves your face feeling smooth and fresh. Not a hard wash either where your skin feels dried out, however i should add that i have brown skin. I have also tried many acne products, this one worked the best for my face. This cleanser even proved to be the most effective item in the Murad kit, at least for me. Now i only purchase the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad product for years and love this! Quality from shipper was excellent. Live in CA and received in 2 days. No complaints and will be ordering it again!!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive combination skin, so I am always on the look out for cleansers which are cruelty free, effective and don&#x27;t make my face look all scratched up.&lt;br /&gt;Although this cleanser keeps my break outs at bay and makes the texture of my skin feel smoother and it does leave my face feeling clean...it has an effectiveness plateau.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, but after about the first 2wks. it sort of reached the peak of it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2 times a day...once in the morning and again at night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I smells a little like eucalyptus, but it&#x27;s not a strong scent.  It is reasonably gentle, but I suggest moisturizing after use, as it may leave your skin feeling a little tight/dry.&lt;br /&gt;I might try the 30 day starter kit to see if using the rest of the products in the line along with this particular product enhances the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an over night miracle this is not the item for you.  However if you&#x27;re looking for something which is effective over time it&#x27;s worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;To me the price is a bit high, so if I decide not to try the 30 day starter kit I may be looking for a more cost effective cleanser/system.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is fairly average.</li>
            <li> This face wash really improves my skin. I have never been one to think I needed to spend more on face products, but this cleanser makes a big difference and is definitely worth the extra money. I had to travel recently and didn&#x27;t use it, and could tell my skin was worse only a few days later. I have used Proactiv and many other products in the past, and this has worked the best for me. It is so simple to use (instead of three steps) and I even saw a recommendation for this product in a magazine from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash so far.</li>
            <li> Delivered and works as described.</li>
            <li> I love it! great smell and nice clean feeling after washing.</li>
            <li> I didnt see much results with this product, when it came to clearing up acne. So i wouldnt buy it again</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It does visibly reduce fine lines and makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Best thing for clogged pores on my jaw line! I use this twice a week and it keeps my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Need to buy more!  Gets my face clean and rinses well, no residue.</li>
            <li> My second purchase.  All of the other good posts are correct.</li>
            <li> Love!  Been using it for years and the only thing that has worked on my break outs!!</li>
            <li> Yes, received as promised!</li>
            <li> I chose this line based on the recommendation of a local spa I visited. I have loved their products ever since.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying this product. I use it with my Clarisonic, so it&#x27;s lasting a really long time. I use this cleanser once a day or it makes my skin too dry now that it&#x27;s winter, but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has cleared up and looks better than it has in a long time!</li>
            <li> Not drying. Very effective in maintaining clear skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best wash ever-i&#x27;ll never go back and use anything else. I originally got this was with the 3 piece Murad starter kit. I ran out of wash before everything else so I just bought this, since I had enough lotion and gel left over. This product makes my skin so soft, and noticeably clearer. I&#x27;m 27 and have the skin of a teenager sometimes-this has helped more than anything. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of crap in it. It does smell a little funny, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. My skin feels a little tight if I don&#x27;t put my lotion on right away, but it never has dried out my skin enough so that it peels. I love this wash and wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else. It may not work as well for everyone, since we are all different, but it certainly has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> This cleaners is the business buy some&lt;br /&gt;Im a b lack  male who uses it ive  been Useing this. Cleaners for the past 10 years and ever time I run out and buy some more use It feels like a ton of dirt done lifted off my face thanks Murad</li>
            <li> Best for clean, clear skin!</li>
            <li> Works excellent!  Used daily in combination with Adovia mud soap improved my skin!  The results are amazing!  I am very very  happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and lasts a long time...I am hooked on Murad products!</li>
            <li> My skins was too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li> I have literally tried EVERYTHING. I started breaking out really badly for the past year and a half, i could not get rid of it for anything. Everything i tried broke me out more and it was seriously a losing battle. I have heard about this murad cleanser but never really looked into it. I was at Ulta one day and saw a travel size and figured i had nothing to lose. WOW. I freaking love this. My skin has never been this clear. I still get little break outs on my chin but NOTHING compared to what i used to have. I actually finally feel comfortable going about my day without makeup. I havent done that in years. I also noticed if i do get a pimple it goes away a few days faster when i use this product. I believe its worth a shot, when i run out of the travel size i will definitely purchase the normal size.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after weeks of usage, I&#x27;m sold.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> for over 10 years and this cleanser still one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> Murad is the only product that works. I have tried the proactive and foam id, every product under the sun! My skin is oily but can dry out super easily, and Murad is the only face product that absorbs the extra oil without making my skin feeling dry and tight. I have now been using it 3 years!!! yes it still works after that long! TRY IT!!! You will never have to look for a face cleanser again.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad, but not great either. You can buy other products at a fraction of the costs that are just as (and even more) effective. No noticable improvement in my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves a slight cooling sensation on my skin (which I like). It also does not foam up as much as I prefer, and as a result I end up using more product then I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will NOT purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser, I started seeing the results within one week.  I would recommend this product to anyone battling acne.</li>
            <li> I loved this but don&#x27;t need it any longer.</li>
            <li> Amazing acne product that doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin!</li>
            <li> Worked for a few weeks and then didn&#x27;t seem as effective. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Strong but definitely leave your face feeling</li>
            <li> Was only able to use this product for 3 days before my skin became irritated and dried out. It&#x27;s caused more harm than good! Would not recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> My package came in today and it was  broken and leaking</li>
            <li> I hesitate to write this review because every person&#x27;s skin chemistry is different, but so far I have enjoyed this face wash, the green tea extract has a cooling effect on the skin, which is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Murad since it was a cruelty-free brand, and have had great success with it (I pair it with my Clarisonic a few times a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get a pimple or two here and there, but I&#x27;ve only been using the face. Next time I intend to try the entire line, and I&#x27;m sanguine in what the results will be.</li>
            <li> They should not be allowed to sell this stuff. If you only have moderate acne do not buy this! It caused major problems with my skin. Horrible experience.</li>
            <li> After the brand that i usually ordered from you was not listed any more, I became quite frustrated, so I decided to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; this one that pretty well matched the ingredients of the other.  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I started using this about 10 years ago and when they say, “If it ain’t broke don’t BREAK it”, they’re referring to this as part of the daily regimen.  I have incredibly oily skin and it has taken me a while to find something that works for me.  I get multiple compliments and on my skin and people always ask me what I use on my face.  A tube this size should last a few months with use twice a day.  It smells great, you only need a pea-sized amount, it washes off makeup well, and leaves your skin with a healthy shine, the salicylic acid helps manage breakouts.  I recommend using this with Dr. Murad’s Pure skin vitamin supplements to really kick off clearing your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad combination skin prone to break-outs constantly. I&#x27;ve used pro-active and other drugstore brand face cleansers that didn&#x27;t improve my skin at all. I was given a sample version of Murad clarifying cleanser a couple months back, and used it twice a day with a face brush. It has made a huge difference. My skin isn&#x27;t flawless by any means, but it looks noticably better. That&#x27;s why I decided to get the full-size version. This cleanser is perfect for those with combination-oily skin and really clears out pores well. It can be a bit drying, so make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s contains many toxic chemicals such as triclosan and tetrasodium edta which is partially why it seems to work. It does leave a refreshingly cool tingle on the face after use. It has helped to clear me up. However, I worry that I&#x27;m doing more harm than good by loading my body up with these harmful chemicals. For the outrageously high prices being charged by Murad one should be receiving a more naturally composed product. Be cautious when reading the ingredient labels on Murads website as they tend to omit all of the harmful chemicals in their products. Also, be aware that most of their moisturizers contain parabens and many other potentially unsafe chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had semi-oily skin especially in my T-zone.  Sometimes as an adult, I still get those random ugly pimples!  Other times I&#x27;ve gotten those nasty little clogged pores, which is only noticeably in natural sunlight.  Honestly, this stuff is so awesome!!  It helps keep pimples away and my pores clean.  Seriously, love love this stuff!!  I would definitely recommend using it with the toner and moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has consistently worked to control my acne. How do I know its the cleanser and not something else that&#x27;s working for me? Whenever I stop using it for a few days I immediately break out. It&#x27;s a little drying, so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and while I still breakout I will keep using this. I don&#x27;t have bad acne just a few bumps and pimples that come up  and this stuff actually makes your skin feel nice and clean after using it</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT. after two uses my face has completely swollen, my eye nearly swollen SHUT! I am not kidding. Apparently, these reactions are common. My face burns, itches, and has swollen. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product line for two days and my face has broken out in the worse kind of pimples -- deep, sore, red ones. I&#x27;ve got so many new breakouts, I&#x27;m starting to panic because my face looks ten times worse. And it&#x27;s only been two days! If you want to try this out, be sure to check your face by day two to ensure you are not getting the same reaction as me. I&#x27;ve now got to book an appointment with a dermatologist to fix all these breakouts. :( Buyer be warned!!!</li>
            <li> I had been use Murad for years, it is not the best acne face cleanser, but it really does work to prevent and clean up breakout. Honestly it make skin dried a little so very important to follow up with moisture. And for those people with review said that Murad make their breakout even worst, just keep using this for about a month I will said then you will see the result, ,because this is what the Murad product claim and it really does, when I first using it years ago, it make my breakout went crazy for the first3 weeks, but I tried to keep up with this as the product claim it might explore the hidden blemish and clean up your skin deeply. So after a month later, the result show up as they promise. so I suggest people don&#x27;t give up on this product unless there had been no result after a month.</li>
            <li> This product does work, but it&#x27;s extremely drying so I wouldn&#x27;t use much, or use it frequently. I put it on after a layer of jojoba oil to prevent extreme dryness</li>
            <li> I started using this product and the skin perfecting lotion at the same time. After four days of use, I broke out into an allergic reaction on my face where my eyes were swollen shut in my face was completely swollen. I had to go to the doctor and he told me to discontinue use. I return the product in they refunded my money. That is why I gave two stars instead of one, I appreciate the refund.  Obviously, this may not happen to everyone but be cautious and know that they will refund your product if it does not work for you. The face wash really dried out my face but I was expecting this due to the high content of medicine.  My face started going through the purge process that some other reviews talk about where a bunch of white heads pop up. I was okay with the idea of this purge process but I continued reading reviews and many said it didn&#x27;t get better it only got worse and worse and worse, so I am kind of glad I didn&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;m 59 and have been using this product for about 5 years..I won&#x27;t use anything else...I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my complextion since I&#x27;ve been using this...love that it&#x27;s a cleanser and toner all in one.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, but smooth and refreshed...has a slight mentholy  tingle to it...plus a little goes a long way for a very reasonable price, especially on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> TL;DR It&#x27;s great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to be clear that this is my first time ordering this from amazon, but I have used this product for about two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by an esthetician for my sever acne (in combination with the skin perfecting lotion). I had tried a lot of different products before I was introduced to this gem, and I never plan on using anything else. I still get acne, but not the deep, angry, red, painful acne I had been getting. When I do get acne now, it is very mild and heals quickly (usually less than a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin will never be completely clear (Thanks, Genetics!) but this keeps it under control better than any other product I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&lt;br /&gt;Exuviance&lt;br /&gt;Proactive&lt;br /&gt;Biore&lt;br /&gt;Clean and Clear&lt;br /&gt;Olay&lt;br /&gt;Clinique&lt;br /&gt;The list goes on. But they all pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Works so great! Love it!</li>
            <li> Worked OK. Did not help my acne but after working with a dermatologist it was because benzoyl peroxide is what I needed in my face wash.</li>
            <li> best cleanser so far for me. smell nice, not think, skin feels refreshing and actually works for my acne skin for a close to 30 girl. Highly recommend to try! even my mom close to 50 loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the best!  I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this is the first one that actually works.  Within a week my skin was completely clear and has stayed that way with continued use.  Its not drying or harsh and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Good product. Worked good.</li>
            <li> works great on my skin and especially with the serums. will never give this stuff up.</li>
            <li> Let me provide a run-down of my acne trouble BEFORE using Murad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. During PMS I get white-heads in crops on my eyebrows, hair line, nostrils and chin which usually swell to the point where they are painful. If I get any on the sides of my face, near my eyes, then my eyes swell and start closing on me.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have horrible black-heads in the hundreds on my nose, forehead and chin.&lt;br /&gt;3. I get tiny white-heads on my lower jaw and that will swell to giant white-heads if popped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER using Murad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regard to number 1, I still got the white-head crops during PMS but the swelling problem has stopped completely. I am still getting white-heads on my cheeks near my nose, but they don&#x27;t swell and go away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For number 2, I have almost no black-heads on my chin, and forehead. I still have hundreds of black-heads on my nose, but next to my nose they are nearly extinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number 3, I still get these little white-heads and I just leave them alone, because next day they disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Murad once in the morning and once in the evening. After three days I did notice the results of numbers 2 and 3. It is working, and it is doing something, but three weeks in, the results are not what are described in their advertisements. I don&#x27;t look that much different than when I did before using Murad, other than I am not swollen anymore. I did choose this product primarily to be pain free, and not so much about vanity, but I am tired of being mistaken for a teenager due to acne in my mid-twenties. I have noticed that the lack of better results are due to my hair secreting a lot of oils, which means I need to wash my hair every single day, as well as condition it. If I don&#x27;t do this, I break out, even though I am using Murad. I did try washing my face with Dove soap and then using Murad just to see if that made a difference, and it did not. I don&#x27;t recommend that anyways because it is over-washing, which is just as unhealthy and not washing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had problems with peeling skin, dryness or sensitivity. My skin gets a little tight right after washing my face with Murad, but that goes away after about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue using Murad because it is helping, and it is possible that with me and how awful my acne is, that it just takes longer. Not everyone sees dramatic results right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend it? If you are going to keep up with it, and based on the good feedback I have read and my own experience, yes.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face perfectly. I love it. I don&#x27;t get dry from it but it cleanly strips the oil from my forehead and nose. It keeps me blemish free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad for almost 2 years now and I&#x27;ve never had a problem. It&#x27;s a little pricier than your average face wash but it works great. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper on here versus buying at your local makeup store.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I read in an article that R&amp;B singer Melanie Fiona uses this product to control her random breakouts. I was curious to see if it would work on my sudden, stress breakouts as well. It cleared my skin up within two days or less. I have sensitive skin too, and it did not hurt me at all. This is a true must have.</li>
            <li> I have used it 2x a day and so far am not pleased at the no results, especially for the money and claims by the company.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was very cleansing but It didn&#x27;t help with my acne. I have normal skin with moderate acne, this cleanser made my face get oilier through out the day.</li>
            <li> Better price on amazon than other retailers. Cooling effect on skin. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Another product that my facialist recommended before I got married and it really worked, it&#x27;s so different from regular face wash.</li>
            <li> works very well and keeps my face very clear of all acne and blemishes.  I will be buying this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WHOLE MURAD LINE. THIS CLEANSER IS GREAT! CLEANS DEEP AND SMELLS GREAT. IT CAN BE A BIT DRYING, BUT I MOISTURIZE AFTER PRETTY WELL. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I SWITCH BETWEEN THIS AND ANOTHER MURAD CLEANSER FOR ULTIMATE BEAUTY CLEANSING.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Still have some acne but its not as bad as it was before.</li>
            <li> I decided to give in to the relatively high price of this cleanser after hearing all the hype and being fed up with my skin routine to rid of my acne. I&#x27;ve been seeing a dermatologist regularly for almost 6 years to clear my acne and after using topical treatments, pills, including things like Retin-A and different antibacterial oral pills nothing was even making a slight difference in my skin. My skin is extremely oily so i&#x27;ve always struggled keeping my skin at the perfect balance. After using this for a week, I was unimpressed, thinking that this was just another product that wasn&#x27;t going to work for me but everyone else. Now after about 3 weeks i&#x27;m seeing a change in my skin! I&#x27;ve had clearer skin, and minimal breakouts and i&#x27;m excited to see the result after extended use. A plus of the product is the freshness and zing your skin feels while using it. I&#x27;m thinking about getting the blackhead set as well if I continue to like the cleanser. My only concern is that I would pair using this with a heavy duty lotion after use because it can be and feel drying after use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser for about 5 years.  Great stuff....especially on my adult skin. It&#x27;s cleansing without being drying. A tube of this stuff lasts me 2-4 months. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an oily, acne prone beast but this really decreased my break outs, it was recommended by a youtube guru and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with it and it feels like I dipped it into a mentholated cloud of soap. Feels clean, clears up breakouts and the smell makes all the boys come running. Ha-ha just kidding nobody will run at you when you use this face wash but you&#x27;ll look good.</li>
            <li> I bought is product for my husband due to his adult acne issues.  He wasn&#x27;t thrilled about trying another product but eventually he did begin and was pleased with the results.  He has been using this cleanser for 3 years and we can truly see a difference.  Disclosure, he also uses the other additional Murad Acne product line to go with this cleanser as well.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like I do than this is your go to facial cleanser. I have tried so many different cleansers from drugstore brands to higher end department store brands and this by far is the best one. It lathers up really nice and you only need a pea size amount for your WHOLE face! I use the Murad skin perfecting lotion and also the exfoliating acne treatment gel along with this cleanser and the combo works really well with my skin. It has kept acne breakouts at bay and has helped with balancing my skin as well (I do not have dry/oily spots randomly all over) it&#x27;s much more even. It smells nice to and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean, not tight or &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; clean if you know what I mean. Give it a try, I am sure you will love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now, and feel compelled to write a review.  I was VERY skeptical about using this product, as many people are skeptical about using new acne products.  I am 21 years old and have very dry skin, redness around my nose (maybe rosacea?), and pimples everywhere, not cystic, but definitely raised pimples/acne all over my face.  I used to get so many compliments on a daily basis about my &#x27;porcelain&#x27; skin, but it has turned into a dry red bumpy nightmare since I stopped taking birth control last May.  I have tried it all -- tea tree oil, lavender oil, Neutrogena natural this, natural that, &amp;#34;Yes to (tomatoes, grapefruit) products, Acne spot treatments of every brand you can name at the drug store, and so on.  I thought I wasn&#x27;t moisturizing it enough, so I would throw in some lotion, antibiotic creams, all of that.  My diet is pretty good also, I avoid dairy products, don&#x27;t eat a lot of wheat, and avoid fast food like the plague.  Nothing seemed to help the rough dry texture, uneven tone, and pimple map on my face.  I was so self-conscious it was starting to really affect me on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a break down of the changes I saw on a weekly basis:&lt;br /&gt;Week one: I immediately saw a change in the texture of my skin.  It was no longer rough and flaky.  In the beginning I was using the kit as directed, which is the cleanser morning and night, with the exfoliating gel morning and night and moisturizer also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week two: After a week of following the kit directly, I noticed that the exfoliating gel twice a day was making my skin a tiny bit itchy, so I stopped using it in the morning and only used the gel at night.  This really helped solve that minor problem.  Week two was as the booklet described -- I was breaking out a little bit more.  They said it was going to happen, so I just sucked it up and dealt with it.  Even though my skin was breaking out more, I was still seeing a huge improvement every day in the texture and quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week three: This is the exciting part!  After changing up my routine, cleansing morning and night, moisturizing after, and only applying the gel at night, my skin literally just gets better after every single use.  My skin is soft and clearER.  I say clearER because, of course, it is not completely pimple free, but I can honestly say I am acne free.  Every day the pimples shrink and are fading away, but it is expected to have an occasional pimple here or there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave 4 out of 5 stars is simply because the gel was a tiny bit much for me to apply it twice a day, but that is just my individual experience with it.  However, I think the exfoliating gel is very important in the routine and will always use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to this product is managing your expectations, following the directions, and WAIT FOR THE RESULTS.  This product really is about improving your overall skin health and texture.  It is not about scrubbing the pimples away, and it is not about dowsing it with acne medicine either.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, and WAIT for the results.  Manage your expectations and understand that you are going to have a pimple here or there.  What really amazes me about this product is how healthy and clear my skin looks.  I think this product is worth trying if you have &#x27;tried everything&#x27;.  The 30 day kit is a great price for the amount of stuff you get (the mask cream is still full in my bottle, the gel is also).  TRY IT!  I am so happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 10 years and it works really we&#x27;ll on my skin. I tried Clinique, Proactive, and other over the counter products and nothing worked. I&#x27;ll get a pimple here and there but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and this has been my go-to cleanser for a decade. I keep trying samples of other fancy cleansers, but always return to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 4 days now and I can already see a huge difference. I have oily, acne prone skin and this cleanser works great. On a regular day, my face is shine free for at least 8 hours. I dont expect it to last as long once it gets warmer but that comes with having oily skin. Works well with St. Ives blemish and blackhead scrub which I have used forever and cant live without.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product again for 6 months now in combination with the other acne products in the Murad line. I have seen a huge change in my skin and would highly recommend this and the other products to anyone dealing with acne, young or old.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter who has been using it for years and loves it it doesn&#x27;t break out her skin</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I will use on my acne prone, oily face. I like all of Murad&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  If you are a first time user, it takes a month or so to pull all the yucky stuff out of your pores and then it just makes your skin look amazing (without drying it out).</li>
            <li> I have had acne practically all of my teen/early adulthood and this is the only product that has done wonders. I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful. I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li> Great price! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more! Got it in decent time too! Love this product!  Will order again for sure!</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash all times. I have oily acne prone skin. Proactiv gives me allergy because of the benzoil peroxide, but this has salicylic acid not peroxide in it.</li>
            <li> Dr. Murad&#x27;s products are wonderful for all skin types, and I have tried them all. You will have noticeably clearer skin using twice per day. It will not dry problems skin, yet you will feel that your skin has been deeply cleansed. It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena or ProActiv. Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and I&#x27;m speaking from experience here.</li>
            <li> Fads dark marks and keeps my acne in check</li>
            <li> I love that this product isn&#x27;t tested on animals. I&#x27;ve heard of this company before and they have a great reputation as a skin care company. I love this product. it works really well. it takes care of blemishes and when i use it regularly it keeps them at bay. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> This product arrived as described, quickly and sealed. I will be purchasing from this seller again.  The Murad Acne Clarifying cleanser is one of the only products I have found to actually work.  I am 37 years old and get adult acne from time to time.  I tend to break out in the T zone.  I have tried numerous products and this one works.  It cleans out my pores, reduces by break outs, and helps remove the oil.  If you have dry skin, I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser for my son and I have noticed a difference in his skin. However, it is recommended to be used with an acne treatment gel/cream product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my pre-teen daughter. She uses it with the Murad Step-2 Treatment cream. It has really cleared up her skin! There is a dramatic difference, especially on the forehead. Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this works really good along with the toner. I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line. I tried like every brand and line and found aloe vera gel to be the secret weapon to acne rather than other products. The face wash, toner, and aloe vera gel is all I need now even when break outs occur. I may on occasion use the Murad mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product by hand application in the a.m. and with clarisonic in the p.m. I also use this product by adding baking soda to it, rubbing it together in hands, and massaging on my face monthly or when the face seems dull and needs life. I apply aloe vera gel next. I don&#x27;t use the toner if I do the baking soda facial. Oh yeah, a Great facial.</li>
            <li> Love it and it does the job!</li>
            <li> I love murad products and this one did not disappoint at all.  It helps keep my face clear and clean.  A definite recommendation.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, this makes my acne much more worse than before, why it&#x27;s allowed sell such poison, i really wonder.</li>
            <li> I havve tried eveything from Proactiv to plain old dial soap and this cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve found. I saw a marked improvement within just a few days of use. It hasn&#x27;t quite cleared me up completely but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried. If you buy the cleanser, toner, exfoliating gel, and spot treatment you will see a huge improvement in your skin. I reccommend this to all of my friends though.</li>
            <li> Large size, works well</li>
            <li> I used this product maybe 4 times and it completely destroyed my skin. I broke out so horrible along my jawline. It wasn&#x27;t normal acne either. It lasted 4 weeks. It was almost like a rash more than acne. The rest of my face felt like it had been burned. It stung to move my face and t was very tight. This product completely changed my skin and I am still battling trying to get back to how it was before I used this product. If you have sensitive skin I would highly reccommend you STAY AWAY from this product.</li>
            <li> The best acne product that I have come across. I love it and will recommend this product to anyone who suffers from light to severe acne.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser which is step 1 to clear skin. It gives a tingly sensation due to the 1.5% salycylic acid ingredient. You can feel the deep cleansing effects. Its useless to take off eye makeup though.&lt;br /&gt; I use the entire murad acne complex line. I suggest you purchase the exfoliating acne treatment gel to pair it with, or the gentle treatment gel if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. it keeps my face somewhat clear although I still have issues with acne, this product works. The face wash last forever too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used Murad for a couple years now, but i find that using JUST this cleaner helps to keep my face really clear! At least 90% of my breakout are KEPT gone thanks to this stuff. I use it every morning and night, even right after the gym cause sweat on the face for too long causes breakouts. Love this stuff! :))</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while. It works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son because it got such good reviews on here.  I had him use just a small amount for a week.  Well, it was terrible.  Each day his face broke out more.  I gave it 7 days but by the last day his forehead was just a map of pimples.  The poor kid.  I stopped it.  I did some research and tried BELLA YASA..and it has really been helping him.  Along with the neutrogena spot treatment in the day and Cerave Facial moisturizing lotion (PM) at night.  He is better..much different.  This was pricey and I would not recommend it based on our experience.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, this my every day face cleanser, it removes makeup, leaves my fave feeling so fresh! A little goes along way. It clears up my blemishes that I gets once a month.</li>
            <li> I love this for my face.</li>
            <li> My acne was fully gone in less than 2 days.  If anyone ever has a breakout that they need gone ASAP....you buy THIS :).</li>
            <li> It controls my acne (i am 43 and still get breakouts!). Every few days I will put 2-3 aspirin in a tiny cup and let them dissove then wash my face and before I rinse off the murad I put the aspirin mixture on my face and let it all site for 2-3 min. It feels awesome and my face looks younger.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. Not drying but definitely effective in managing breakouts.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought this and it seems to be keeping my acne away! I like that it&#x27;s light and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole handful.</li>
            <li> This review is more regarding the seller who sold me a defective product than the product itself. Normally this is a gel that works great and keeps my skin clear. However, I purchased this from BeautyEncounter and it turned liquidy in 2 months. I contacted Murad to see if this was normal and it is not. They told me that it would only turn watery if exposed to extreme heat or cold. I kept the container in my bathroom in the undersink cabinet - thus no extreme heat or cold conditions occurred from my actions. I&#x27;ve had other bottles of this that have lasted 6 months or more without turning into liquid. The seller would not accept returns and made no offer to compensate me for the defective bottle that was sold to me. That said, I will not be purchasing from them again and will make sure to order directly from Murad where an item can be returned for up to 60 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for 17 year old daughter, she used as soon as it arrived. Within 3 day we started to see her skin clear up.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and this keeps me from becoming shiny all day.&lt;br /&gt;I wash twice a day with this and use oil-free moisturizer and I never get shiny.&lt;br /&gt;2-weeks after using it my acne began to clear up and after a month it was all gone with NO PICKING.&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: one 6.75 oz tube lasts over 12 months with pea-sized portions because it is really foamy!&lt;br /&gt;I used to use proactive, but now have even better skin for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser but still have bumps on my forehead after a months use</li>
            <li> Great product! I keep buying it over and over.</li>
            <li> Murad blows proactiv out the water! Love it when combined with the toner &amp; moisturizer! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 months now &amp; i am amazed! Wish i found it sooner</li>
    </ol>
