            <li>It does smell nice</li>
            <li>Really couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderfully it worked.</li>
            <li>, it leaves a nice smell to me anyway</li>
            <li>Smells really good and clean.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s OK to use just don&#x27;t expect miracle results.</li>
            <li>We both love this product.</li>
            <li>I used it today, and it&#x27;s a nice low-suds shampoo that rinsed out easily and got my wig clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner had step by step easy instructions to follow.  </li>
            <li>This product was easy to use and did the job.  </li>
            <li>and It seems like it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
            <li>but it does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for extensions and hair pieces</li>
            <li>light fragrance</li>
            <li>and it makes brushing it super easy over all i</li>
            <li>My wigs look clean after using and no shiny, greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>my wig came out less shiny and more natural looking, which is awesome,</li>
            <li>came quickly, just what I needed</li>
            <li>and I loved it my wig feels soft and it dulled the shine some and thats what i really wanted</li>
            <li>Works as expected - pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent but is easy to swish a wig in and rinse out without a residual build up.</li>
            <li>After a light spritz of synthetic hair conditioning spray and a quick brush-through, my piece air dries back into its original light, swingy shape.</li>
            <li>I got this on time and used it right away</li>
            <li>This shampoo for synthetic wigs is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I had been buying my wig shampoo from the online seller where I purchase my wigs, and I really didn&#x27;t like the way my wig smelled after drying.  </li>
            <li>if you think it stinks as well, just use the Revlon conditioner after and that stuff smells awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost tempted to use it for my real hair.</li>
            <li>Before washing it, the wig was really shiny and fake-looking.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleaner for your wigs that works well.  </li>
            <li>Mi sister is so happy with this gift, the other day she came back with her extensions completely entangled (yes, after party)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s considerably better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Also, I think it&#x27;s great for de-shining those super shiny, fake looking wigs!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>it doesnt remove large knots but it made a considerable difference.</li>
            <li>But after washing it with this shampoo, it looks natural and realistic!</li>
            <li>It really revitalized some old ratty wigs that we use on the nursing lab manikins.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t have your wig looking brand new</li>
            <li>My wig looked like new after I washed it in this product.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s the authentic shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it took the shine out of mine like other reviewers but a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on two wigs so far, a curly one and a short, straight one.</li>
            <li>We were pleasantly surprised and  did not have to replace them.</li>
            <li>they also smelled of cigarette smoke, she thought it would be thrown, but now, she uses this product, following the instructions and extensions look like new ones!</li>
            <li>i was spilled open a little when it arrived but was shipped quickly</li>

            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s made by Revlon</li>
            <li> you just put a little in cold water and swish the wig around a bit</li>
            <li> I am skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong with something made by Revlon.</li>

            <li> I used it today, and it&#x27;s a nice low-suds shampoo that rinsed out easily and got my wig clean. I chose Revlon because their products always work awesome for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this several times.  I have a wig, not the one from CHINA, that I wear all of the time.  This is an excellent cleaner for my wig.</li>
            <li> Works as expected - pleasant smell.  I had been buying my wig shampoo from the online seller where I purchase my wigs, and I really didn&#x27;t like the way my wig smelled after drying.  So I tried this product.  I like it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> you just put a little in cold water and swish the wig around a bit.. let it air dry. and brush.. this is for my short cropped wigs..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they come out with less shine, which is the look i&#x27;m going for..</li>
            <li> If the perfume wasn&#x27;t so strong, I&#x27;d give this great synthetic hair cleanser an enthusiastic five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it cleans thoroughly without stripping the surface of the strands or damaging knots.  After a light spritz of synthetic hair conditioning spray and a quick brush-through, my piece air dries back into its original light, swingy shape. It&#x27;s considerably better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite cleanser so far, except it really stinks, might just be me who thinks that, everyone else I know doesn&#x27;t. if you think it stinks as well, just use the Revlon conditioner after and that stuff smells awesome. my wig came out less shiny and more natural looking, which is awesome, cause I don&#x27;t want it soooo obvious i&#x27;m wearing a wig lol</li>
            <li> came quickly, just what I needed</li>
            <li> What can be said about cleanser for wigs....it works, the product is being used. Will purchase again and again: is that 20 words?</li>
            <li> It is what it says and does what it says. Very pleased with it and have to keep typing til it tells me I can submit lol</li>
            <li> i was spilled open a little when it arrived but was shipped quickly and It seems like it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and clean. I&#x27;m almost tempted to use it for my real hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on two wigs so far, a curly one and a short, straight one. It won&#x27;t have your wig looking brand new but it does make a huge difference. Also, I think it&#x27;s great for de-shining those super shiny, fake looking wigs! I&#x27;d definitely recommend and I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I am skeptical about this. I used it on my Jessica Simpson extensions and didn&#x27;t see a difference. It does smell nice but I am not sure if it detangles or adds any shine. If you need to wash your extensions anyways then it&#x27;s OK to use just don&#x27;t expect miracle results.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received does not smell like the Revlon cleanser I&#x27;ve bought from wig companies.  The bottle is smaller too.  Not sure it&#x27;s the authentic shampoo.</li>
            <li> works great on all my wigs !!  And great price.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for extensions and hair pieces</li>
            <li> Good value and great product. Really couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderfully it worked. Should have had this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig shampoo. I love the way my wig looks after I use this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I washed a wig with this today. Before washing it, the wig was really shiny and fake-looking. But after washing it with this shampoo, it looks natural and realistic! Seriously, it&#x27;s made by Revlon, you can&#x27;t go wrong with something made by Revlon.</li>
            <li> this shampoo made my piece a lot softer than it had been. it felt great! it doesnt remove large knots but it made a considerable difference. i would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Mi sister is so happy with this gift, the other day she came back with her extensions completely entangled (yes, after party) they also smelled of cigarette smoke, she thought it would be thrown, but now, she uses this product, following the instructions and extensions look like new ones! We both love this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner had step by step easy instructions to follow.  I had never cleansed wigs before, but was doing this to donate to the Cancer Patients at the City of Hope.  This product was easy to use and did the job.  The wigs came out just beautiful!</li>
            <li> about the best I&#x27;ve used for cleaning my wigs.</li>
            <li> It really revitalized some old ratty wigs that we use on the nursing lab manikins.  We were pleasantly surprised and  did not have to replace them.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser and smells nice! I try to use it at least once a week...I cannot tell what the texturizing element does.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet because I am waiting for my wig shipment. I hope that it is all that!</li>
            <li> This shampoo for synthetic wigs is exactly what I was looking for.  My wigs look clean after using and no shiny, greasy residue.  The other shampoos I&#x27;ve used seem to leave a shiny film on my wigs, making them look like greasy hair, especially the hair around my face.  I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My wig looked like new after I washed it in this product.  There is no friz in my wig but I can&#x27;t say if it was my care of the wig or using this product.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> great shampoo for wigs.  light fragrance</li>
            <li> I got this on time and used it right away and I loved it my wig feels soft and it dulled the shine some and thats what i really wanted, it leaves a nice smell to me anyway and it makes brushing it super easy over all i this product great buy.</li>
            <li> Makes even older/highly used hair pieces spring back to life! Gets rid of the dull frizzy look that happens after continuous wear.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleaner for your wigs that works well.  It does get out any product or smells.  Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent but is easy to swish a wig in and rinse out without a residual build up.</li>
            <li> A couple drops in water swish rinse and you are done.  I&#x27;m not sure it took the shine out of mine like other reviewers but a good product.</li>
