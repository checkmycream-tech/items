            <li>First off I must say that I have problem skin to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Arbutin and retinol makes scars less visible, and especially retinol is great for wrinkles and acne and scars, because it encourages  cell turnover (can not be used while pregnant and nursing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> so my cuticles and my hands looked horrible, But after one day of using I seen a complete difference.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but this product seemed to do nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> Like lots of people, I have a bad Vitamin D deficiency, so I figured this might help combat the effects on the skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read about this product in a woman&#x27;s magazine and figure I give it a try.  I just started using it about 3 wks ago and it has improve the softest of my skin.  I am turning 49 this year and never had any problems with my skin until now that I hit menapouse.  My skin has gotten drier but his product seems to help.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT.  I THINK IT IS WORKING. RECOMMENED FROM DR. OZ, THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A TRY. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the Vitamin D Serum. I have been using for months and my skin has never been smoother. I wash with an oatmeal soap for exfoliation and I follow up with the serum after I apply my moisturizer. I really apply liberally at night and then I have the best looking complexion in the AM.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results &amp; it is VERY oily. I used it for a few weeks. I don&#x27;t like the oiliness of it but would have continued to use if I had seen some results.</li>
            <li> Since i have srarted using this product I get asked all the time what makes my dace glow.  I love how it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Makes skin glow and look brighter!  It appears oily but it is not.  It leaves skin smooth, soft and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;s</li>
            <li> Excellent after a facial or exfoliation. I used this after a light glycolic peel and it really helped my skin. Also great after same brands alpha beta peel which is good once a week</li>
            <li> I put this serum with the skin Ceuticals B5 hydrating serum. then apply your moisturizer.  Great routine. or use with any other serum.</li>
            <li> I read that women over 50 should use vitamin D oil.  This is a really good product &amp; I don&#x27;t intend to be without it.</li>
            <li> I like the feel &amp; glow it give my face without leaving it feeling greasy.  I usually add a few drops to my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Use at night under moisturizer.  A great replenishment for skin ,  not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Was told it works in tandem with acid</li>
            <li> Along with the vitamin B serum, this vitamin D oil is really the balm. I am 51 years old and I get compliments on my skin from many poeple.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!!!...I use it am/pm to get my vitamin D...very moisturizing and is nice under sunscreen or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Adds moisture, soaks in nice, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the serum for about three weeks.  My skin is softer.  I like the fact that  it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin  oily. I think it&#x27;s worth the money. I May do a follow up review as more time goes by.</li>
            <li> been using this on the face about two weeks and can&#x27;t tell a difference yet,but does refresh the skin so it seems</li>
            <li> OK,I purchased this for my Very Dry Hands and it works!!! But I found out I can go to Walmart by the &amp;#34;Vitamin Isle&amp;#34; and Buy Vitamin D oil for 7.00 and works just the same...I love Vitamin D!!! I do a lot of paper work so my cuticles and my hands looked horrible, But after one day of using I seen a complete difference. By the month my hands looked so much younger and healthier.</li>
            <li> Perfect for even oily skin. A twice-a-day must have, it immediately changes skin&#x27;s texture and works well even with multiple layers of product over or under.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Keeps skin looking great.</li>
            <li> Always hard to say for sure if a facial product like this is making a difference but I think this one does.  It is oily - which my dry skin loves (I have to be careful not to use too much) and it doesn&#x27;t make you break out. But if you have oily skin you may not like it.  My skin asorbs it right up and is only a bit oily for a few minutes.  I use Dr Dennis Gross daily alpha beta peel packets which I LOVE.  This goes nicely after that.</li>
            <li> I started using this in combination with the Decleor oil I apply for daytime.  Like lots of people, I have a bad Vitamin D deficiency, so I figured this might help combat the effects on the skin.  Feels good, absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but this product seemed to do nothing for me.  First off I must say that I have problem skin to begin with.  If your skin is clear, you may have no problem.  I&#x27;m 37 with hormonal skin that&#x27;s oily.  However, I&#x27;m very healthy and eat mostly organic.  I noticed there is almond oil in this product and have used that in the past and much too oily for my skin.  I use this product on my neck and chest and a dab under my eyes.  Oh well!  Don&#x27;t seem to get results from this product line. I&#x27;m a licensed beauty professional and know a lot about ingredients and such.  I&#x27;m now trying products by Boscia.  Botanical and pure.  I intend to use only that line to correct my ph balance.  Vitamin C seems to benefit me more.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands after my face and neck!  Wonderful results!</li>
            <li> This is great serum! I can see improvement in my skin just after 2 nights-it was radiant, glowy, fresh. The best is to use it at night regime, after cleansing face. I use it also after peels to it has even more impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some benefits:&lt;br /&gt;- the consistency is oily, due to oils from sweet almond, lavender, geranium, avocado and vitamin D and E,&lt;br /&gt;- vitamin D and E  improve skin&#x27;s elasticity and bounce,&lt;br /&gt;- ferulic acid and peptides have anti aging properties,&lt;br /&gt;- squalane and hyaluronic acid spheres hydrate the skin,&lt;br /&gt;- glycolic acid and willow bark extract help to reduce pores and exfoliate,&lt;br /&gt;- arbutin, retinol and antioxidants gave me a visible radiance. Arbutin and retinol makes scars less visible, and especially retinol is great for wrinkles and acne and scars, because it encourages  cell turnover (can not be used while pregnant and nursing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3-4 drops on my fingers and than massage into face. I leave my clean face slightly damp (after toning) so it is easier to spread. The 1 oz bottle will last a while and truly this is great night serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I orginaly gave 5 stars but I realized that after short period of time serum gets thicker, it&#x27;s hard to get it out from the bottle. I exchange that in Sephora for new one and after 2 weeks the same. It is waste of money, but product itself works well for me.</li>
            <li> I first got this as a sample and had just been through a surgery that left my skin a bit peaked and dry.  This oil was amazing at bringing back the resiliency in my skin and my color.  I bought two bottles and I am glad I did, as I am sure that I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but it does wonders for your face.  I have normal skin. It&#x27;s a must for people with dry or combination skin. I use to use it day and night. But, because it&#x27;s only 1 ounce, I just started just using it at night. Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than Sephora.</li>
