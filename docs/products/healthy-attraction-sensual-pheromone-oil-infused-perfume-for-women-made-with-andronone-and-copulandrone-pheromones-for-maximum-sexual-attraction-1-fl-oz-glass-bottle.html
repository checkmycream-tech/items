            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance, this might not be the the best choice for you.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice and refreshing, I like it.</li>
            <li>If you are going to use this, make sure you put it on 8 hours before you have to be anywhere, it is very strong.</li>

            <li>, I am married, and happily.</li>
            <li>The first thing I looked at was of course if it was safe, lol.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong at 1st.</li>
            <li>the smell is KIND of strong, but not that i know, i can apply it accordingly.</li>
            <li>then I decided ok, I can get this.</li>
            <li>I thought sure, let&#x27;s see what happens</li>
            <li>And I gave it away for free because I cannot, CANNOT deal with my husband being all over me like a dog to a fire hydrant!!!ably wouldn&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>

            <li>It is made with Andronone and Copulandrone pheromones for maximum sexual attraction - 1 Fl Oz Glass Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>.I am sure it should help attract a companion .&lt;br</li>
            <li>People at her work were being more helpful and paying more attention to her.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Smelled better on  my daughter than me</li>
            <li>I have noticed more men paying more attention to me when I wear this product.</li>
            <li>For me, top notes are a blend of pine and citrus.</li>
            <li>It is okay</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>The carrier needs to take better care of people&#x27;s stuff...  </li>
            <li>Not at the moment, but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t notice it, and was intrigued by the lovely scent, so it does work in a way.</li>
            <li>The effects of pheromones has been documented many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>i really like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;idk about the pheromones working lol</li>
            <li>Love that it gets the hubby</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE THE WAY THIS STUFF SMELLS</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals.</li>
            <li>but I am sure they will love it also.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the bottle I immediately fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>Could it have been he was just being respectful?</li>
            <li>Glad it wasn&#x27;t pricey.</li>
            <li>This is a very unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>Well I have to admit, I was kind of excited to get this.</li>
            <li>all excited to smell me!  </li>
            <li>The package was good and safe and it was a fast delivery.</li>
            <li>After browsing the mall for awhile, I kind of decided that it didn&#x27;t really matter whether the pheromones worked or not, I just really liked the scent.</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh, I received many compliments :)</li>
            <li>My husband  seemed to be more attentive to my presence.  </li>
            <li>It combines good with the skin and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t  be more excited.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to spray and is not sticky when used.</li>
            <li>Paraben free, Sugar free, Sulfate free, (my favorite part)</li>
            <li>I typically spray it on my wrists and that is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very cool smell great would love to see the long time use of this product!!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good sized bottle, the smell is pretty strong at first</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute little fun bottle perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li>That its made in the USA, Paraben free ,Sugar free and Sulfate free.</li>
            <li>This was an okay scent, it was a bit powerful</li>
            <li>but the scent is light and feminine.</li>
            <li>It has a light floral scent and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>light floral and fruity</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Overall, he always likes to way I smell, so I will continue using it regardless because it does have a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>I spritzed it on lightly, it really doesn&#x27;t take much and immediately was engulfed in a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It reminds be a bit of Juniper Breeze from Bath &amp; Body Works if you are familiar with that fragrance.</li>
            <li>Luckily the bottle was fine.</li>
            <li>The great thing about that look is the fact that as long as I have a bottle of this Sensual Pheromone Oil Infused Perfume, I will never have to forget that look because I can see it anytime</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice this actually having an effect, but it is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>If you like the smell which is really sweet</li>
            <li>wow, wear at tour own risk.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s somewhat of a sweet floral scent,</li>
            <li>At first its a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>STRENGTH PHEROMONE OILS designed to stimulate the love and sexual appeal of the opposite sex&lt;br /&gt;INCREASE</li>
            <li>This product is designed to stimulate the love and sexual appeal of the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>But I will be back with more after more experiments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ATTENTIVE. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands that I think are much more effective.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t have any one come chasing me down the street, but I did get compliments at the store about how great I smell.</li>
            <li>Very light but strong enough for someone to smell you.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if the perfume adjusts to everyone&#x27;s body and smells completely different or  not, but on me it smells really good, and a lot of perfumes do not smell that great on me.</li>
            <li>Only thing i wished was there was more of it!</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the perfume, but obviously my husband felt a bit more strongly about it...</li>
            <li>not only does it have a great soft smell</li>
            <li>I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, oily which is good because it will last longer!</li>
            <li>The scent is not very heavy and not light it is just perfect.</li>
            <li>, it calmed down and was pleasant.</li>
            <li>If trying to attract the other sex it works pretty well, since my husband would not leave me alone and kept saying I smelled good.</li>
            <li>I get hit on on the daily by customers, but I thought it would be more fun to stir up the oblivious fellow employees.</li>
            <li>and if it&#x27;s amazing then I will gift it to my NOTORIOUSLY single friend and see if she finds the *ONE</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit to adapt to your body and it smells good.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and does exactly what the label mentions.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to people who like and are interested in attraction oils and perfumes.</li>
            <li>and I have actually noticed that I seem to be getting more looks and attention when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>Of course one of the first things I looked at after receiving this product was that...</li>
            <li>This perfume has crisp, fresher scent.</li>
            <li>I think it really works to attract guys!</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail, the box was pretty banged up.</li>
            <li>The perfume bottle was in a smaller box, which faired better than its counterpart..  </li>
            <li>The first time I wore it</li>
            <li>This is good for everyday or occasions</li>
            <li>Good for everyday.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special as far as &amp;#34;attraction&amp;#34; yet, but maybe I haven&#x27;t found my right amount of spray.</li>
            <li>WITH EACH WOMEN&#x27;s natural pH balance and pheromone output to develop her natural sexual scent&lt;</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell like gross chemicals and alcohol, but it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li>Mixes with each woman&#x27;s  natural pH balance and pheromone output to develop her natural sexual scent.</li>
            <li>It started out sweet, it had some floral notes and overall just a very pretty feminine smell.</li>
            <li>the durability is ok, but I wish it was longer for a person who stays all day long out.</li>
            <li>It comes in a 1oz small bottle which is good to spray on the go.</li>
            <li>The bottle is small but it is a good amount of perfume inside.</li>
            <li>The pheromone oil comes in the cute little bottle as pictured, it comes as an actually perfume with a squirt top.</li>
            <li>omg, he just is always very uhhhm..</li>
            <li>I really like this product for which i received to review.</li>
            <li>If you use to much it can become over powering.</li>
            <li>He was totally ready to go all day and couldnt keep his mitts off me.</li>
            <li>Ladies unless your REALLY in the mood for some bow chicka</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I really noticed, aside from playing 20 questions with customers all day.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>My wife chooses this perfume over her others if we are going out together, since she does enjoy the attention from the opposite sex, but not looking for anything else.</li>
            <li>This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>It has a very lite scent</li>
            <li>very naive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>got this bottle of Pheromone Oil infused perfume almost really as a joke, thinking to myself...</li>
            <li>I like it so much I will keep on wearing it</li>
            <li>I like the smell so much</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is pretty strong when first applied with a moderate sillage.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong at first, but it dies down after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>It dies down after about 20 minutes, but I can still smell it pretty strongly.</li>
            <li>At least some of the guys I work with are cute, seeing as everyone who shops here are cheap, old people...</li>
            <li>It has a decent smell.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>THIS special scent lasted ALL day long, gagging me.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my wife to try, and so far she loves the smell almost as much as I do.</li>
            <li>To keep this simple - not one man known or unknown to me mentioned that I smelled good or showed any extra attention to me</li>
            <li>At first the overwhelming flowery smell gagged me, ten minutes later it changed to a gut wrenching musky scent and about an hour later blended into a hideous 1970&#x27;s old lady Avon perfume....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the Attraction or Sensual part, but it does have a pretty nice flowery scent, though it&#x27;s a little stronger than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be musky but surprisingly clean.</li>
            <li>but my husband did enjoy it, guessing it smelled different to him since he is the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>For many years When I was a kid, I would see ads for these types of perfumes in magazines and was always left curious as to what they were all about.</li>
            <li>the spot I put it on smells very soft now.</li>
            <li>It was a bit heavy at first but it quickly changed and adapted to my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to put too much on at first, so I used only one spritz and that lasted all</li>
            <li>Has a nice floral scent unlike my other ones that are slightly musky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never forget that wild look in his eyes, it was almost primal....</li>
            <li>I have worn it once, so far.</li>
            <li>how sensitive I am to smell.</li>
            <li>I have two adult sons at home</li>
            <li>It smells old lady-ish.</li>
            <li>I think it actually enhances what one already smells like rather than having an actual distinct scent..</li>
            <li>I have noticed my husband being totally drawn to me more than usual, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>And at my work place no less lol.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Be careful and use it sparingly ;-)</li>
            <li>I  really enjoy the smell of this product but a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCTION OF NATURALLY occurring body pheromone output from the female wearer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product in the last few days but even in that time I have gotten a few compliments on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li>I have quite a collection, mostly from Bath &amp; Body Works and Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li>Alas, it seems more research is needed..</li>
            <li>It goes on a little strong at first but dissipates slowly over time which I like.</li>
            <li>Sure, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the whole idea of being aggressively fawned over by men because of a perfume, but I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>but I can not really say it is working because my male friend generally loves my natural scent.</li>
            <li>Being very unlike him to do, I was a little taken back by it...completely forgot about the perfume I was rocking.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smell is nice and refreshing, I like it.</li>
            <li> If you are going to use this, make sure you put it on 8 hours before you have to be anywhere, it is very strong.</li>

            <li> the smell is KIND of strong, but not that i know, i can apply it accordingly.</li>
            <li> then I decided ok, I can get this.</li>
            <li> I thought sure, let&#x27;s see what happens</li>
            <li> And I gave it away for free because I cannot, CANNOT deal with my husband being all over me like a dog to a fire hydrant!!!ably wouldn&#x27;t use it!</li>

            <li> It is made with Andronone and Copulandrone pheromones for maximum sexual attraction - 1 Fl Oz Glass Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> .I am sure it should help attract a companion .&lt;br</li>
            <li> People at her work were being more helpful and paying more attention to her.</li>

            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> Smelled better on  my daughter than me</li>
            <li> I have noticed more men paying more attention to me when I wear this product.</li>
            <li> For me, top notes are a blend of pine and citrus.</li>
            <li> It is okay</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> The carrier needs to take better care of people&#x27;s stuff...  </li>
            <li> Not at the moment, but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t notice it, and was intrigued by the lovely scent, so it does work in a way.</li>
            <li> The effects of pheromones has been documented many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> i really like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;idk about the pheromones working lol</li>
            <li> Love that it gets the hubby</li>

            <li> BUT I LOVE THE WAY THIS STUFF SMELLS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> but I am sure they will love it also.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the bottle I immediately fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> Could it have been he was just being respectful?</li>
            <li> Glad it wasn&#x27;t pricey.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique fragrance.</li>
            <li> Well I have to admit, I was kind of excited to get this.</li>
            <li> all excited to smell me!  </li>
            <li> The package was good and safe and it was a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> After browsing the mall for awhile, I kind of decided that it didn&#x27;t really matter whether the pheromones worked or not, I just really liked the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh, I received many compliments :)</li>
            <li> My husband  seemed to be more attentive to my presence.  </li>
            <li> It combines good with the skin and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t  be more excited.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to spray and is not sticky when used.</li>
            <li> Paraben free, Sugar free, Sulfate free, (my favorite part)</li>
            <li> I typically spray it on my wrists and that is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very cool smell great would love to see the long time use of this product!!!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good sized bottle, the smell is pretty strong at first</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute little fun bottle perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li> That its made in the USA, Paraben free ,Sugar free and Sulfate free.</li>
            <li> This was an okay scent, it was a bit powerful</li>
            <li> but the scent is light and feminine.</li>
            <li> It has a light floral scent and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> light floral and fruity</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Overall, he always likes to way I smell, so I will continue using it regardless because it does have a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> I spritzed it on lightly, it really doesn&#x27;t take much and immediately was engulfed in a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It reminds be a bit of Juniper Breeze from Bath &amp; Body Works if you are familiar with that fragrance.</li>
            <li> Luckily the bottle was fine.</li>
            <li> The great thing about that look is the fact that as long as I have a bottle of this Sensual Pheromone Oil Infused Perfume, I will never have to forget that look because I can see it anytime</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice this actually having an effect, but it is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell which is really sweet</li>
            <li> wow, wear at tour own risk.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s somewhat of a sweet floral scent,</li>
            <li> At first its a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> STRENGTH PHEROMONE OILS designed to stimulate the love and sexual appeal of the opposite sex&lt;br /&gt;INCREASE</li>
            <li> This product is designed to stimulate the love and sexual appeal of the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> But I will be back with more after more experiments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ATTENTIVE. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that I think are much more effective.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t have any one come chasing me down the street, but I did get compliments at the store about how great I smell.</li>
            <li> Very light but strong enough for someone to smell you.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the perfume adjusts to everyone&#x27;s body and smells completely different or  not, but on me it smells really good, and a lot of perfumes do not smell that great on me.</li>
            <li> Only thing i wished was there was more of it!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the perfume, but obviously my husband felt a bit more strongly about it...</li>
            <li> not only does it have a great soft smell</li>
            <li> I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, oily which is good because it will last longer!</li>
            <li> The scent is not very heavy and not light it is just perfect.</li>
            <li> , it calmed down and was pleasant.</li>
            <li> If trying to attract the other sex it works pretty well, since my husband would not leave me alone and kept saying I smelled good.</li>
            <li> I get hit on on the daily by customers, but I thought it would be more fun to stir up the oblivious fellow employees.</li>
            <li> and if it&#x27;s amazing then I will gift it to my NOTORIOUSLY single friend and see if she finds the *ONE</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to adapt to your body and it smells good.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and does exactly what the label mentions.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to people who like and are interested in attraction oils and perfumes.</li>
            <li> and I have actually noticed that I seem to be getting more looks and attention when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> Of course one of the first things I looked at after receiving this product was that...</li>
            <li> This perfume has crisp, fresher scent.</li>
            <li> I think it really works to attract guys!</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail, the box was pretty banged up.</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle was in a smaller box, which faired better than its counterpart..  </li>
            <li> The first time I wore it</li>
            <li> This is good for everyday or occasions</li>
            <li> Good for everyday.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special as far as &amp;#34;attraction&amp;#34; yet, but maybe I haven&#x27;t found my right amount of spray.</li>
            <li> WITH EACH WOMEN&#x27;s natural pH balance and pheromone output to develop her natural sexual scent&lt;</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell like gross chemicals and alcohol, but it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> Mixes with each woman&#x27;s  natural pH balance and pheromone output to develop her natural sexual scent.</li>
            <li> It started out sweet, it had some floral notes and overall just a very pretty feminine smell.</li>
            <li> the durability is ok, but I wish it was longer for a person who stays all day long out.</li>
            <li> It comes in a 1oz small bottle which is good to spray on the go.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but it is a good amount of perfume inside.</li>
            <li> The pheromone oil comes in the cute little bottle as pictured, it comes as an actually perfume with a squirt top.</li>
            <li> omg, he just is always very uhhhm..</li>
            <li> I really like this product for which i received to review.</li>
            <li> If you use to much it can become over powering.</li>
            <li> He was totally ready to go all day and couldnt keep his mitts off me.</li>
            <li> Ladies unless your REALLY in the mood for some bow chicka</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I really noticed, aside from playing 20 questions with customers all day.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> My wife chooses this perfume over her others if we are going out together, since she does enjoy the attention from the opposite sex, but not looking for anything else.</li>
            <li> This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> It has a very lite scent</li>
            <li> very naive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> got this bottle of Pheromone Oil infused perfume almost really as a joke, thinking to myself...</li>
            <li> I like it so much I will keep on wearing it</li>
            <li> I like the smell so much</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is pretty strong when first applied with a moderate sillage.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong at first, but it dies down after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> It dies down after about 20 minutes, but I can still smell it pretty strongly.</li>
            <li> At least some of the guys I work with are cute, seeing as everyone who shops here are cheap, old people...</li>
            <li> It has a decent smell.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS special scent lasted ALL day long, gagging me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife to try, and so far she loves the smell almost as much as I do.</li>
            <li> To keep this simple - not one man known or unknown to me mentioned that I smelled good or showed any extra attention to me</li>
            <li> At first the overwhelming flowery smell gagged me, ten minutes later it changed to a gut wrenching musky scent and about an hour later blended into a hideous 1970&#x27;s old lady Avon perfume....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the Attraction or Sensual part, but it does have a pretty nice flowery scent, though it&#x27;s a little stronger than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be musky but surprisingly clean.</li>
            <li> but my husband did enjoy it, guessing it smelled different to him since he is the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> For many years When I was a kid, I would see ads for these types of perfumes in magazines and was always left curious as to what they were all about.</li>
            <li> the spot I put it on smells very soft now.</li>
            <li> It was a bit heavy at first but it quickly changed and adapted to my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to put too much on at first, so I used only one spritz and that lasted all</li>
            <li> Has a nice floral scent unlike my other ones that are slightly musky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never forget that wild look in his eyes, it was almost primal....</li>
            <li> I have worn it once, so far.</li>
            <li> how sensitive I am to smell.</li>
            <li> I have two adult sons at home</li>
            <li> It smells old lady-ish.</li>
            <li> I think it actually enhances what one already smells like rather than having an actual distinct scent..</li>
            <li> I have noticed my husband being totally drawn to me more than usual, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> And at my work place no less lol.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Be careful and use it sparingly ;-)</li>
            <li> I  really enjoy the smell of this product but a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCTION OF NATURALLY occurring body pheromone output from the female wearer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product in the last few days but even in that time I have gotten a few compliments on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a collection, mostly from Bath &amp; Body Works and Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> Alas, it seems more research is needed..</li>
            <li> It goes on a little strong at first but dissipates slowly over time which I like.</li>
            <li> Sure, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the whole idea of being aggressively fawned over by men because of a perfume, but I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> but I can not really say it is working because my male friend generally loves my natural scent.</li>
            <li> Being very unlike him to do, I was a little taken back by it...completely forgot about the perfume I was rocking.  </li>
            <li> Though it isn&#x27;t in my usual fragrance family, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have honestly never seen him like that, maybe when we first got together</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t, I just said that because I am frustrated, hahaahaa.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t, I just said that because I am frustrated, hahaahaa.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I was never one to buy into the whole &amp;#34;pheromone attraction&amp;#34; thing, at least not in humans...</li>
            <li> Used it yesterday, nothing from the desired subject, senpai, but one of the younger boys was certainly friendlier than usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the perfume its self or my newly found confidence that comes along with it.</li>
            <li> This scent is not overwhelming  if you spray to much like my other scents.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t know I would wear this every day as it doesn&#x27;t mix well with my other fragrances, but when I want to have a fresher, sportier scent, this would be my go to.</li>
            <li> Lasted a really long time!</li>
            <li> This definitely is set apart from other pheromones perfumes  I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different when wearing this product as some of the other reviewers have posted.</li>
            <li> sent my single friend a message to come over NOW to come and take this out of my house so that I can please get my stuff done.</li>
            <li> The down fall is that she said it was not just the men, women were also getting in her personal space.</li>
            <li> LOL, she LIKES being alone and miserable.</li>
            <li> LOL, she LIKES being alone and miserable.</li>
            <li> And the bag boy double bagged the heavy stuff for me.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way though.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does not bother my skin like some other products have.</li>
            <li> That may be partly because it smells so different than what I usually wear.</li>
            <li> I felt like this was different and usual</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t get me into trouble, may purchase a stun gun next just in case,  this will probably just be an everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> I do NOT want the attention of other men, I have a hard enough time keeping my husband off of me.</li>
            <li> I have gone to several events in the past few days</li>
            <li> I was getting NOTHING accomplished and it was driving me crazy to the point that I went to the bathroom and used a wet cloth to try and get the Pheromone Perfume OFF of me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I typically prefer fruity/sweet/floral.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, a little musky.  </li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t wear this everyday.</li>
            <li> You have to use it everyday to get those pheromones going.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I would purchase this again though.</li>
            <li> I usually get complimented on my fragrances, however I did not get any mention on this one and it was noticeable</li>
            <li> So, with this added I am not sure if helps in his attraction to me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the title says oil.</li>
            <li> Secondary note verbena.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle but I like it.  </li>
            <li> and he went crazy.  </li>
            <li> maybe ill get a date or two!</li>
            <li> * because her dating life is horrible.</li>

            <li> The first thing I looked at was of course if it was safe, lol. Paraben free, Sugar free, Sulfate free, (my favorite part) No Animal Testing and Made in thr USA!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I decided ok, I can get this. WHY I have no idea, I am married, and happily. I do NOT want the attention of other men, I have a hard enough time keeping my husband off of me. Not in THAT way... omg, he just is always very uhhhm.. ATTENTIVE. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I thought sure, let&#x27;s see what happens and if it&#x27;s amazing then I will gift it to my NOTORIOUSLY single friend and see if she finds the *ONE* because her dating life is horrible. I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the product description it says that it is:&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA STRENGTH PHEROMONE OILS designed to stimulate the love and sexual appeal of the opposite sex&lt;br /&gt;INCREASE YOUR CHANCES to find your SOUL MATE- entice and arouse teasing any man you want&lt;br /&gt;SWEET AND SENSUAL FLORAL fragrance is the perfect blend of femininity and erotic sexuality&lt;br /&gt;MIXES WITH EACH WOMEN&#x27;s natural pH balance and pheromone output to develop her natural sexual scent&lt;br /&gt;INCREASES THE PRODUCTION OF NATURALLY occurring body pheromone output from the female wearer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW... I NEED to tell you that if you do NOT want to be paid ANY kind of attention too, you do NOT wear this. Don&#x27;t even be in the same room as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to kick my husband out of the house because he wouldn&#x27;t stop following me, rubbing my back (you know what that means), and trying to kiss my neck. I was getting NOTHING accomplished and it was driving me crazy to the point that I went to the bathroom and used a wet cloth to try and get the Pheromone Perfume OFF of me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent my single friend a message to come over NOW to come and take this out of my house so that I can please get my stuff done. She has no idea what I am talking about, so I just told her I bought her a gift. I took OFF the sticker becuase I don&#x27;t want her to KNOW what it is, and if she did she probably wouldn&#x27;t use it! LOL, she LIKES being alone and miserable. She doesn&#x27;t, I just said that because I am frustrated, hahaahaa.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review. And I gave it away for free because I cannot, CANNOT deal with my husband being all over me like a dog to a fire hydrant!!!ably wouldn&#x27;t use it! LOL, she LIKES being alone and miserable. She doesn&#x27;t, I just said that because I am frustrated, hahaahaa.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review. And I gave it away for free because I cannot, CANNOT deal with my husband being all over me like a dog to a fire hydrant!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It reminds me of jasmine and rose. I thought it would smell like gross chemicals and alcohol, but it actually smells really good. I am not sure if the perfume adjusts to everyone&#x27;s body and smells completely different or  not, but on me it smells really good, and a lot of perfumes do not smell that great on me. I cannot comment on if it actually attracted people to me or not, but my boyfriend did like the smell of it on me.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> I really like this product for which i received to review. The scent is not very heavy and not light it is just perfect. As soon as I asked my spouse what he thought of the smell he liked it. So it works both ways in the smell department. It is easy to spray and is not sticky when used. I typically spray it on my wrists and that is perfect. It lasts all day and does exactly what the label mentions. I recommend this to people who like and are interested in attraction oils and perfumes.</li>
            <li> Just tried this today. It has a decent smell. Not sure that I would purchase this again though.</li>
            <li> The pheromone oil comes in the cute little bottle as pictured, it comes as an actually perfume with a squirt top. I was not fond of the smell but my husband did enjoy it, guessing it smelled different to him since he is the opposite sex. If trying to attract the other sex it works pretty well, since my husband would not leave me alone and kept saying I smelled good. The product does not leave your skin oily even though it is called Pheromone oil, it goes on just like perfume with no leftover residue.</li>
            <li> What a sensual product , this product arrived just as described .The packaging was perfect and arrived in a timely manner , the product was in perfect condition on arrival .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a healthy attraction sensual pheromone oil infused perfume for women.This product is designed to stimulate the love and sexual appeal of the opposite sex.Increase your chances to find your soul mate and entice and arouse teasing any man you want.The floral  fragrance is the perfect blend of femininity and erotic sexuality.Mixes with each woman&#x27;s  natural pH balance and pheromone output to develop her natural sexual scent.It is made with Andronone and Copulandrone pheromones for maximum sexual attraction - 1 Fl Oz Glass Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and found it to have a very pleasant scent , I have not put it to the test in the dating world but other people have told me it smells wonderful .I am sure it should help attract a companion .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Gave this to my girl friend and I did not tell her it had pheromones in it. After using it for a couple of days, she told me that people were as she put it, getting in her personal space. People at her work were being more helpful and paying more attention to her. The down fall is that she said it was not just the men, women were also getting in her personal space.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this works or not. I  going to keep using it and see.</li>
            <li> i have tried it a couple times and it seems to do what it says it does to me</li>
            <li> Has a great smell. . Does not bother my skin like some other products have. It stays on for awhile too!</li>
            <li> This smells okay but I cannot say it works as a pheromone. I have tried other brands that I think are much more effective. A little of this goes a long way though.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it and I am honestly impressed not only does it have a great soft smell but it calls attention I love it very happy</li>
            <li> I like the smell, a little musky.  I have noticed my husband being totally drawn to me more than usual, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Smelled better on  my daughter than me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> The Healthy Attraction Sensual Pheromone Perfume for women smells beautiful and I have actually noticed that I seem to be getting more looks and attention when I&#x27;m wearing it. It appears to be working for me. Love it!</li>
            <li> I gave this to a special lady and she loved it. She said it was one of the best perfumes she has used. She told me it had a great aroma. I am definitely buying it again for her.</li>
            <li> O. M. G.  This smells soooooo good!  I just got it and sprayed it on my neck and wrists.  I went to go give my husband a hug and he went crazy.  Great product! I will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product in the last few days but even in that time I have gotten a few compliments on how nice I smell.  I think it actually enhances what one already smells like rather than having an actual distinct scent.. Therefore I think it might vary for each person.</li>
            <li> Of course one of the first things I looked at after receiving this product was that... No animal testing was done.. That its made in the USA, Paraben free ,Sugar free and Sulfate free. I  really enjoy the smell of this product but a little does go a long way. If you use to much it can become over powering. It comes in a cute little fun bottle perfect for on the go. I have noticed more men paying more attention to me when I wear this product. Not sure if its the perfume its self or my newly found confidence that comes along with it. If you like pheromones you will like this!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review. I want to note even though the description states this is an &amp;#34;oil,&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t. It is a 1 oz spray perfume. I am the type of person who ALWAYS wears perfumes, lotions, body sprays, etc. I have quite a collection, mostly from Bath &amp; Body Works and Victoria&#x27;s Secret. I typically prefer fruity/sweet/floral. This perfume has crisp, fresher scent. For me, top notes are a blend of pine and citrus. Secondary note verbena. If you like musk/earthen scents, you will like this. It reminds be a bit of Juniper Breeze from Bath &amp; Body Works if you are familiar with that fragrance. I can see men liking this for themselves. Though it isn&#x27;t in my usual fragrance family, I really like it. So does my boyfriend. He&#x27;s not tearing my clothes off by any means, but he does like to get in close and sniff every so often. That may be partly because it smells so different than what I usually wear. I feel a bit of a mood boost when I wear it. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is pretty strong when first applied with a moderate sillage. If you are sensitive to fragrance, this might not be the the best choice for you. It dies down after about 20 minutes, but I can still smell it pretty strongly. A little goes a long way. Overall, I don&#x27;t know I would wear this every day as it doesn&#x27;t mix well with my other fragrances, but when I want to have a fresher, sportier scent, this would be my go to. Give this one a try. If you don&#x27;t like it on yourself, you can always give it to the man in your life.</li>
            <li> It is okay but not what I thought. Has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite and I noticed nothing different.  If you like the smell which is really sweet just not what I prefer then it would be a great perfume.  Lasted a really long time!</li>
            <li> Very cool smell great would love to see the long time use of this product!!!</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! I got all my girlfriends to try it and buy it! I think it really works to attract guys! Smells good!</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle but I like it.  My man is all over me when I wear this, no lie!  Be careful and use it sparingly ;-)</li>
            <li> Me and my husband both got the men and womens version of this item for review. The mens is amazing and guess what, so is the womans! I put mine on the next day and didnt tell him, boy did it catch him off gaurd! He was totally ready to go all day and couldnt keep his mitts off me. Ladies unless your REALLY in the mood for some bow chicka wow, wear at tour own risk. It will have your husband or so, ALL OVER YOU.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! Great product.</li>
            <li> Well I have to admit, I was kind of excited to get this. Sure, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the whole idea of being aggressively fawned over by men because of a perfume, but I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;  And at my work place no less lol.&lt;br /&gt;When I got this in the mail, the box was pretty banged up. The perfume bottle was in a smaller box, which faired better than its counterpart..  Luckily the bottle was fine. Whew! The carrier needs to take better care of people&#x27;s stuff...  Dammnit...&lt;br /&gt;I work at a hardware store as a cashier. I get hit on on the daily by customers, but I thought it would be more fun to stir up the oblivious fellow employees. At least some of the guys I work with are cute, seeing as everyone who shops here are cheap, old people... So I decided to experiment. Used it yesterday, nothing from the desired subject, senpai, but one of the younger boys was certainly friendlier than usual. That&#x27;s all I really noticed, aside from playing 20 questions with customers all day. Alas, it seems more research is needed..&lt;br /&gt;Senpai WILL notice me. Lol,  I have issues...  But I will be back with more after more experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, it&#x27;s a good sized bottle, the smell is pretty strong at first but it isn&#x27;t too offensive..  If it doesn&#x27;t get me into trouble, may purchase a stun gun next just in case,  this will probably just be an everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and not too overpowering</li>
            <li> I just got it today and all I can say is that, even if my husband doesn&#x27;t like it (I do). We will see how tonight goes when he gets home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the perfume for a couple days now and I really like it. It comes in a 1oz small bottle which is good to spray on the go. The scent is strong at first, but it dies down after a couple of minutes. The perfume is suppose to blend with your body chemicals to make a alluring scent to the opposite sex, so it may smell different on each woman. The scent I experience was a light, flowering scent which was really pleasant. I would spray it twice for it to last longer throughout the day. The question is did I have men falling head over hills? Not at the moment, but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t notice it, and was intrigued by the lovely scent, so it does work in a way. I would recommended this if just for the scent alone. I receive this product for my unbiased opinion, and all opinions are mine.</li>
            <li> No Animal Testing and Made in the USA!!! I ordered this for my wife to try, and so far she loves the smell almost as much as I do. It does not &amp;#34;drive me crazy&amp;#34;, but I can sit and smell it for hours. So yes I would say that it is the pheromones at work here. My wife chooses this perfume over her others if we are going out together, since she does enjoy the attention from the opposite sex, but not looking for anything else. The effects of pheromones has been documented many, many years ago. This stuff works, without you or those influenced even knowing that something is working. The only way that this would not work on any man, is if they have no sense of smell. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> I like wearing  scents with pheromones.  In my younger days I would go out clubbing  and I would attract a lot of attention  and get compliments on how good I smelled by the males.  My husband  knows when I wear &amp;#34; my scents&amp;#34;,  so when I had the opportunity  to try out this scent I couldn&#x27;t  be more excited.  Has a nice floral scent unlike my other ones that are slightly musky.  This scent is not overwhelming  if you spray to much like my other scents.  This definitely is set apart from other pheromones perfumes  I have tried.  My husband  seemed to be more attentive to my presence.  Bonus was he didn&#x27;t  have the slightest  clue i was wearing  pheromones.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Nobody has thrown themselves at me but you never know</li>
            <li> i really like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;idk about the pheromones working lol</li>
            <li> This was an okay scent, it was a bit powerful so I won&#x27;t wear this everyday. I usually get complimented on my fragrances, however I did not get any mention on this one and it was noticeable so I&#x27;m torn on what others think of it.</li>
            <li> It has a very lite scent but I can not really say it is working because my male friend generally loves my natural scent. So, with this added I am not sure if helps in his attraction to me. Overall, he always likes to way I smell, so I will continue using it regardless because it does have a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> I like the nice, floral, feminine scent.  It goes on a little strong at first but dissipates slowly over time which I like. As for the the pheromone aspect of it, I honestly have not noticed a difference but I still like thee perfume.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Love that it gets the hubby all excited to smell me!  :)  I&#x27;d say it works!</li>
            <li> Smells great my roommate and I share it ! No luck lol but lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> I was never one to buy into the whole &amp;#34;pheromone attraction&amp;#34; thing, at least not in humans...I was proven very naive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this bottle of Pheromone Oil infused perfume almost really as a joke, thinking to myself...&amp;#34;really?, pheromones...give me a break&amp;#34; but decided why not try it and see for myself once and for all.  Upon receiving this in the mail, I sprayed some on my neck and wrists and just went about my day.  I like the smell of the perfume, but obviously my husband felt a bit more strongly about it...he literally cornered me when I went to put laundry away!  Being very unlike him to do, I was a little taken back by it...completely forgot about the perfume I was rocking.  I have honestly never seen him like that, maybe when we first got together but that was five years and two kids ago!  I&#x27;ll never forget that wild look in his eyes, it was almost primal....I LOVED IT!  The great thing about that look is the fact that as long as I have a bottle of this Sensual Pheromone Oil Infused Perfume, I will never have to forget that look because I can see it anytime I wear this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review and opinions.</li>
            <li> I have gone to several events in the past few days so it was a great time to try this product out. Some men, at the events, I knew and some I did not. To keep this simple - not one man known or unknown to me mentioned that I smelled good or showed any extra attention to me BUT I LOVE THE WAY THIS STUFF SMELLS ON ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I like it so much I will keep on wearing it and if I get some extra attention because of it I will update my review with all the juicy details. I like the smell so much I would consider repurchasing it even if it doesn&#x27;t attract men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy Vibes provided this oil for my review and feedback.</li>
            <li> I like this smell. It smells nice. Reminds Me Of the 80s. But I still like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice this actually having an effect, but it is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Smells like perfume but has no effect on my husbands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong at 1st. Takes a little bit to adapt to your body and it smells good. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually attracts the opposite sex but the scent is light and feminine.</li>
            <li> Smell great.  I have gotten compliments from both men and females who want to know what I have on.  So it worked with my chemistry</li>
            <li> this smells so good! love it!</li>
            <li> All I have to say is, it works!</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Smells very fresh, I received many compliments :)</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Have had no complaints yet..only compliments</li>
            <li> At first the overwhelming flowery smell gagged me, ten minutes later it changed to a gut wrenching musky scent and about an hour later blended into a hideous 1970&#x27;s old lady Avon perfume....THIS special scent lasted ALL day long, gagging me.</li>
            <li> the smell is KIND of strong, but not that i know, i can apply it accordingly. i havent had any complaints when ive been out. maybe ill get a date or two! LOL</li>
            <li> I have worn it once, so far. At first its a bit too strong. Over 15 minutes or so, it calmed down and was pleasant. I still put on my own perfume as well. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals. It has a light floral scent and smells fantastic. I only sprayed one squirt on my wrists and rubbed on my neck. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot to smell great. I haven&#x27;t tested the scent around men yet but I am sure they will love it also.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, oily which is good because it will last longer!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different when wearing this product as some of the other reviewers have posted.</li>
            <li> This smells good but it isn&#x27;t real. My mom, brothers gf, and I all put it on and all smelt the same. Unless we have the same PH then this is just a really nice perfume. Not sure why the title says oil.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique fragrance. I spritzed it on lightly, it really doesn&#x27;t take much and immediately was engulfed in a pleasant scent. It was a bit heavy at first but it quickly changed and adapted to my body chemistry. I feel like the scent changed a lot over the course I was wearing it as it adapted to me. It started out sweet, it had some floral notes and overall just a very pretty feminine smell. I wasn&#x27;t attracting every man I passed by lol but my boyfriend sure liked it! I felt like this was different and usual then your standard perfume and it smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 1 week now. Smell is nice and refreshing, I like it. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special as far as &amp;#34;attraction&amp;#34; yet, but maybe I haven&#x27;t found my right amount of spray. I will continue to play around with it and update my review at a later date.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the amount. I was happy to receive it and to try it on me. It combines good with the skin and it dries fast. The bottle is small but it is a good amount of perfume inside. The package was good and safe and it was a fast delivery. This is good for everyday or occasions just dipends on the type you are, but adapts both situations. the durability is ok, but I wish it was longer for a person who stays all day long out. Good for everyday.</li>
            <li> If you are going to use this, make sure you put it on 8 hours before you have to be anywhere, it is very strong. But it has now been 12 hours and the spot I put it on smells very soft now. It could be me and how sensitive I am to smell. But I didn&#x27;t have any one come chasing me down the street, but I did get compliments at the store about how great I smell. And the bag boy double bagged the heavy stuff for me. He may just do his job well, but I will just say it was because of this pheromone perfume.</li>
            <li> Please buy this perfume. It has the best smell. Very light but strong enough for someone to smell you. You have to use it everyday to get those pheromones going.</li>
            <li> This came today and I dont know about the &amp;#34;healthy Attraction&amp;#34; aspect of it .. but i loveee the smell. I expected it to be musky but surprisingly clean. Only thing i wished was there was more of it!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful!!!! husband loves it. get compliments. light floral and fruity</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the Attraction or Sensual part, but it does have a pretty nice flowery scent, though it&#x27;s a little stronger than I had expected. I have gotten a couple of compliments on how it smells when I&#x27;ve worn it, however.</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is amazing! For many years When I was a kid, I would see ads for these types of perfumes in magazines and was always left curious as to what they were all about. I recently got the opportunity to try this product and thought, why not? Upon opening the bottle I immediately fell in love with the scent. I would say it&#x27;s somewhat of a sweet floral scent, the flower I would use to describe this would have to be Honeysuckle. Now about the &amp;#34;attraction&amp;#34; part. I have two adult sons at home and I was reluctant to wear this around them, so I didn&#x27;t use it until I knew I would be away from them! The first time I wore it I went to the mall with a male friend and noticed no difference in his demeanor. Could it have been he was just being respectful? Dunno. After browsing the mall for awhile, I kind of decided that it didn&#x27;t really matter whether the pheromones worked or not, I just really liked the scent. I didn&#x27;t want to put too much on at first, so I used only one spritz and that lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, someone may have better luck at &amp;#34;attracting&amp;#34; someone than I did with this product, but I&#x27;m happy with just this beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> The scent was undetectable after just a couple of hours. It smells old lady-ish. It had impact on my boyfriend either. Glad it wasn&#x27;t pricey.</li>
            <li> Smells good. That&#x27;s it, though.</li>
