            <li> Just a note to let you know this is my wife&#x27;s signature perfume, and the price is the best we have ever found.  The bottles arrived about 3 days after purchase.  Great service.</li>
            <li> Ordered product on March 29.  Was notified by e-mail that the item was on backorder, but would be sent as soon as their shipment arrived.  On April 18, the money for this order was taken out of my account.  As of today, May 14, I am still waiting for my purchase.  I notified Samsonline and was informed that they too, could not track my order that was supposedly sent.  They are trying to make my order good, but I am still waiting.</li>

            <li> My 91 yr, old Mother wanted only a perfume by Revlon.  They do not make the Intimate that she wore for years,so I just picked this after reading other reviews.  What a surprise!  This is great smelling perfume for any age.  I wear only Ralph Lauren;s Romance but would use this if I happen to be out!  My Mother loved it. It has a great oriental, woodsy smell that lasts a long time!  Will order more for my Mom for sure</li>
