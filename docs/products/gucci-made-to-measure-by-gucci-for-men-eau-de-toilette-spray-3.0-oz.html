            <li>great packaging and price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tempted to purchase tis fragrance  for awhile and happy I made the decision.</li>
            <li>Smells great for any ages-- lasts for a couple of hours but have to reapply unless its just my nose getting used to the scent...</li>
            <li>This cologne smells great</li>
            <li>Great manly smell.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>Awesome product fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li>I loved Nobile and until now hadn&#x27;t found anything that works with my body chemistry like it did, I got the most compliments when I wore Nobile.</li>
            <li>Better than Dolca &amp; Gabbanna Gentleman.</li>
            <li>My husband love this spray and I love when he wear it.</li>
            <li>Gucci really did a good job when they created this.</li>
            <li>I love how this cologne smells not to light not to strong.</li>
            <li>Not nearly dark in scent as envy but great nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, and is by Gucci, so I assume it is very fancy.</li>
            <li>Came sealed in original plactic and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it is still really full.</li>
            <li>My first Gucci brand fragrance, but one that is great and consistent with other luxury brand fragrances I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Made to Measure is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you want to turn some heads.</li>
            <li>Very nice , soft not strong for the summer</li>
            <li>Very manly and lasts 8+ hours.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Product looks and smell like the one in the major department stores.</li>
            <li>I know your probably thinking that it makes little sense to buy the smaller one, but it will last forever, so you really don&#x27;t need the 3 oz.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Well this was product for my male companion he loves it. It was a gift for him so attach was suppose to be a gift note . When he open the box the note was missing . He loves it but it thrown outside is door when he was home all day .</li>
            <li> I have 2 Daughters that worked at Nordys ans Saks... this is a BABE magnet.  Highest quality!!!  Better than Dolca &amp; Gabbanna Gentleman.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and is by Gucci, so I assume it is very fancy. My boyfriend loved it. I know your probably thinking that it makes little sense to buy the smaller one, but it will last forever, so you really don&#x27;t need the 3 oz. one. He has had his since Christmas and the novelty hasn&#x27;t worn off yet, he sprays it every time we leave the house and it is still really full.</li>
            <li> Made to Measure is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you want to turn some heads. Very manly and lasts 8+ hours. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My first Gucci brand fragrance, but one that is great and consistent with other luxury brand fragrances I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;ve been tempted to purchase tis fragrance  for awhile and happy I made the decision.</li>
            <li> Very nice , soft not strong for the summer</li>
            <li> Beautifull Gucci  perfum</li>
            <li> great packaging and price!</li>
            <li> Smells great for any ages-- lasts for a couple of hours but have to reapply unless its just my nose getting used to the scent...</li>
            <li> I loved Nobile and until now hadn&#x27;t found anything that works with my body chemistry like it did, I got the most compliments when I wore Nobile. Made is the closest thing I have found.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than in retail stores. Came sealed in original plactic and smells fantastic. Would definitely recommend for going out and nightlife.</li>
            <li> My husband love this spray and I love when he wear it. He get compliments all the time when we go out.</li>
            <li> Awesome product fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I love how this cologne smells not to light not to strong. Gucci really did a good job when they created this.</li>
            <li> Great manly smell.  Softer than Gucci Envy that I was looking for.  (sad its no longer made)  Overall I like the scent and its last a long time.  Not nearly dark in scent as envy but great nonetheless.  Reminds me of Aqua Di Gio but stronger and not as fruity.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Product looks and smell like the one in the major department stores. The real deal.</li>
