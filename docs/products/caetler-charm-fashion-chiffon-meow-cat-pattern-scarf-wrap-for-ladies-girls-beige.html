            <li>Great present for anyone who loves cats.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i thought it was gonna be alot cheaper quality because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>but i was so wrong this scarf is so adorable the cat prints are so cute and the material is very good quality i recommend for anyone who wants a good quality scarf at a cheap price</li>
            <li>I figured for such a good price I could try it out</li>
            <li>Great scarf at a great price, shipping took a bit-but worth the wait, just plan the get it a little later</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute scarf but very short</li>
            <li>The scarf itself is lovely, but it is PINK, not beige nor ecru.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long enough to wrap like a real scarf which is nice.</li>
            <li>i adore this scarf its so soft !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really light and delicate scarf that looks just as good if not better than the picture!</li>
            <li>Could be an issue with messing up the cloth, but so far it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The fabric is amazingly soft and billowy... and has cats on it.</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, the pattern and fabric is nice and soft, but the seam on the outside is kind of sewn poorly.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scarf, with the little black cats on it.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, it marred the cat pattern slightly on one side, but overall it still is a really good product.</li>

            <li> I got sent the wrong scarf, white with blue designs, but I really like it so only -2 stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered another very similar one in black as well.</li>
            <li> I was worried by some of the other reviews, but I found no flaws.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would mention to be careful with is wearing it with things that might snag the delicate materials.</li>
            <li> , that is black and the price could not be beat anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> The material is a bit thin...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a thin piece of material.</li>
            <li> Would buy again even with how delicate it is!!</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;ve been having a lot of snow and cold weather, I had to wear my winter jacket, and the Velcro on the jacket snagged the fabric of the scarf and pulled out a thread.</li>

            <li> I fell in love with this scarf, with the little black cats on it.  I couldn&#x27;t resist it because I happen to have a cat, that is black and the price could not be beat anywhere else.  It matches my fleece hooded coat and it is just &amp;#34;darn cute.&amp;#34;</li>
