            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are great products out there, but I can&#x27;t spend $300 on a jar of face cream.</li>

            <li>Be sure to buy the one with pycnogenol and astaxanthin.</li>
            <li>Would prefer something that could keep moisturizer more sanitary.  </li>
            <li>I love the lavender scent too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Is not horrible, but not my favorite.</li>

            <li>This cream goes on so smooth and it has a light, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face look soft and healthy, and more youthful (I&#x27;m 48 years</li>
            <li>Amazon made it easy because the price was right and signing for scheduled deliveries</li>
            <li>Not necessarily a bad thing, but it takes some practice, and moist fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but luckily I did.</li>
            <li>I cannot say I see less wrinkles, just that my face feels great.</li>
            <li>And another great thing about this is that my skin doesn&#x27;t get the oily shine like it used to, with other creams, and I have pretty oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Derma-E since everything is natural.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed well.</li>
            <li>So far, no acne aggravation at all; I love that part.</li>
            <li>The delivery and product were as expected but not that impressed with the actual cream and</li>
            <li>but overall i liked it.  </li>
            <li>This cream has 2 powerful antioxidants.</li>
            <li>It is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I would like it if the jars were bigger but having it is just as nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer for my 70+ year old neck and face which easily breaks out with oilier and far more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I used to pay full price buying through derma-e website (and also at Whole Foods market stores) to get the freshest batches but most recent Amazon product</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and my skin now looks better than it did 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>I may get a bit of a shine if I&#x27;m out in the hot weather for long periods, or something on that line, but this cream is much, much better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and sometimes I forget if I have applied it, fragrance is light, barely noticeable, works well with my foundation</li>
            <li>Derma-E Age-Defying Day Cream is an affordable facial moisturizer which absorbs easily without leaving a residual greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>In general, it is a good product that keeps my skin smooth and subtle.</li>
            <li>and she is very pleases with the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the only one sticking my clean finger into it</li>
            <li>I normally use dr hauschka products for my skin, but I was at whole foods when I got a sample of this and decided to buy after trying it.</li>
            <li>It soaks up into the skin well and has a pleasant scent, my only issue is that I have sensitive skin so sometimes my skin reacts slightly to it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised - this product really works</li>
            <li>After application of this cream I feel of tightness, poorly absorbed and remains on the skin white streaks and I want to wash it off immediately.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much per application as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it was getting hard to afford.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helping to smooth the rough facial texture I&#x27;ve been seeing now in my 40&#x27;s, and seems to brighten my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Derma-E for several years now, and believe that it really does keep skin feeling supple and reduces wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>far as getting rid of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>So far it has help a lot.</li>
            <li>The item arrived so quickly, it surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I use this, but it does go on thick and does not feel nice when left on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to my normal skincare and less expensive.</li>
            <li>Derma e products that contain Astaxanthin keep my sensitive and moderately adult-acne prone skin clear like nothing else that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I rarely apply tinted sun screen if I plan to stay out of the sun, because the derma e creme is slightly tinted.  </li>
            <li>and this creme really helps my skin not feel very dry, especially now in winter.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything different than other products.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything different than other products.</li>
            <li> I was getting from other creams, is now gone from switching to something natural.  </li>
            <li> So much so, I purchased three small jars.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: this moisturizer just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my skin (which isn&#x27;t even that dry.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will also add that of all the really expensive stuff I&#x27;ve tried that was supposed to remove wrinkles and do alot of other things, I think this cream is better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not migrate into eyes and ruin my contact lenses like some of the other moisturizers or facial sunscreens that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seemed to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 57 and have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> But add-on moisturizer may be needed in very dry and windy days.</li>
            <li> No real results after a couple of weeks,</li>
            <li> It might not be moisturizing enough for a desert winter (combination skin type), but I&#x27;ll know in a few months.</li>
            <li> Breakouts are minimal (almost non-existent with diligent use); non-irritating like products with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid or alpha</li>
            <li> Like the other Derma-e moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, it only takes a little bit of product, but a lot of blending.</li>
            <li> noticed it leaves an ever so slight pink tint to my makeup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it removes all wrinkles completely (at least not yet), but it seems to get rid of the smaller wrinkles, and it softens the other wrinkled areas, so they don&#x27;t look as wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the odor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m saving almost half of the cost.  </li>
            <li> But my first experience with derma e age-defying day creme is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Heavy yet not moisturizing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> This product was a little thick</li>
            <li> I have not liked all of dermaE&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> My face does not feel the least bit dry in our cold climate.  </li>
            <li> I introduced it to my daughter also, who has had serious acne issues since her teens</li>
            <li> It has none of the bad parabens and bad ingredients in other face creams, so that&#x27;s my main reason for purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even try and put makeup on over it - terrible, rough-feeling base.</li>
            <li> This has a terrible smell to it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it.  I love Derma-E since everything is natural.  Making my skin firmer.</li>
            <li> This has a terrible smell to it and I cannot stand to use it on my face and smell it all night or day.  So, I am using it on my chest, hands and feet instead.  No real results after a couple of weeks, but I don&#x27;t expect miracles either without  longer usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and it has been good for my skin.  It is absorbed well. I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions.  I like the product and will likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> seemed to dry out my skin.  i&#x27;m 57 and have very dry skin.  if you are in this category, it may not work for you.</li>
            <li> Heavy yet not moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I normally use dr hauschka products for my skin, but I was at whole foods when I got a sample of this and decided to buy after trying it. It soaks up into the skin well and has a pleasant scent, my only issue is that I have sensitive skin so sometimes my skin reacts slightly to it. It&#x27;s a great alternative to my normal skincare and less expensive. I would recommend this product to my friends, it gives my skin a glow.</li>
            <li> Derma-E Age-Defying Day Cream is an affordable facial moisturizer which absorbs easily without leaving a residual greasy feeling.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of the ingredients.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands, and this is the one I keep coming back to.  I&#x27;ve used Derma-E for several years now, and believe that it really does keep skin feeling supple and reduces wrinkles.  Please don&#x27;t change a thing, Derma-E!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of derma e night cream.  Love its moisturizing effect on my skin.  But my first experience with derma e age-defying day creme is disappointing.  It just kind of lays on top of the skin, doesn&#x27;t hydrate. Don&#x27;t even try and put makeup on over it - terrible, rough-feeling base. Accentuates wrinkles instead of moisturizing them.  At $25 for 2 oz it&#x27;s not cheap. I&#x27;m hoping I can return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for about 6 months and I love it.  I&#x27;ve tried all the really expensive stuff and this works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  It has none of the bad parabens and bad ingredients in other face creams, so that&#x27;s my main reason for purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red blotchiness I was getting from other creams, is now gone from switching to something natural.  This cream goes on so smooth and it has a light, fresh scent.  Makeup goes on great over top of it too.  And another great thing about this is that my skin doesn&#x27;t get the oily shine like it used to, with other creams, and I have pretty oily skin.  I may get a bit of a shine if I&#x27;m out in the hot weather for long periods, or something on that line, but this cream is much, much better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as getting rid of wrinkles.  I can&#x27;t say that it removes all wrinkles completely (at least not yet), but it seems to get rid of the smaller wrinkles, and it softens the other wrinkled areas, so they don&#x27;t look as wrinkled.  It makes my face look soft and healthy, and more youthful (I&#x27;m 48 years old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also add that of all the really expensive stuff I&#x27;ve tried that was supposed to remove wrinkles and do alot of other things, I think this cream is better.  I&#x27;m sure there are great products out there, but I can&#x27;t spend $300 on a jar of face cream.</li>
            <li> Not too light, not too heavy, just perfect and I can smell the lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have combination skin and it has done wonders evening out my skin tone and firming it.</li>
            <li> Like the other Derma-e moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, it only takes a little bit of product, but a lot of blending. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it takes some practice, and moist fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it leaves an ever so slight pink tint to my makeup. The lavender scent is wonderful, though. It&#x27;s also helping to smooth the rough facial texture I&#x27;ve been seeing now in my 40&#x27;s, and seems to brighten my skin. So far, no acne aggravation at all; I love that part. It might not be moisturizing enough for a desert winter (combination skin type), but I&#x27;ll know in a few months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but I have not had a blemish for years since using this product. No lie. I introduced it to my daughter also, who has had serious acne issues since her teens and she is very pleases with the results. Be sure to buy the one with pycnogenol and astaxanthin. I think that&#x27;s the effective ingredient.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The Derma e products that contain Astaxanthin keep my sensitive and moderately adult-acne prone skin clear like nothing else that I&#x27;ve tried.  Breakouts are minimal (almost non-existent with diligent use); non-irritating like products with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid or alpha hydroxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduced fine lines and improved skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not migrate into eyes and ruin my contact lenses like some of the other moisturizers or facial sunscreens that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Consistency of product requires packaging in a jar?  Would prefer something that could keep moisturizer more sanitary.  I&#x27;m the only one sticking my clean finger into it so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it was getting hard to afford.  Amazon made it easy because the price was right and signing for scheduled deliveries I got another break and no shipping fees.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> After application of this cream I feel of tightness, poorly absorbed and remains on the skin white streaks and I want to wash it off immediately. I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I like how this feels on my skin.  I love the lavender scent too.  I use it on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> I use this, but it does go on thick and does not feel nice when left on.&lt;br /&gt;Is not horrible, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that satisfied with this product.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything different than other products. The delivery and product were as expected but not that impressed with the actual cream and what it claims to do for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and my skin now looks better than it did 10 years ago. I have healther looking skin with more even skin tone and firmness.</li>
            <li> This product was a little thick but overall i liked it.  I have not liked all of dermaE&#x27;s products but I would buy this again.  I liked the smell.  I think it has tea tree oil in it, too, which also helped with my acne as well.  I wore it day and night.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: this moisturizer just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my skin (which isn&#x27;t even that dry.) I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell or the sticky, paste-like texture. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle I have because I paid for it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Im only giving it four stars because I actually meant to purchase the night creme but the packaging is so similar that I made a mistake, I still like the product, it&#x27;s light weight and sometimes I forget if I have applied it, fragrance is light, barely noticeable, works well with my foundation but I need the night creme for both day and night for the extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dema-e age-defying day creme with pycnogenol for many years.  It has helped with my rosacea.  I used to pay full price buying through derma-e website (and also at Whole Foods market stores) to get the freshest batches but most recent Amazon product had sufficient expiration time (2+ years) and I&#x27;m saving almost half of the cost.  Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream in hopes it would help my Roseaca. So far it has help a lot. This cream has 2 powerful antioxidants. My skin looks and feels amazing. You don&#x27;t have to use very much per application as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The item arrived so quickly, it surprised me.  My face does not feel the least bit dry in our cold climate.  My only complaint would be the odor.  It is not pleasing though the moisturizer is.  I cannot say I see less wrinkles, just that my face feels great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Effective and we&#x27;ll priced.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I have ever used. It goes on so smooth and is not greasy or overly perfume smelling. It soaks into the skin immediately without a trace of build up. I have used this before, ran out of it and could not find it but luckily I did. It is worth the purchase. So much so, I purchased three small jars. I would like it if the jars were bigger but having it is just as nice. I put  it on before bed and on in the morning after washing my face. It seems to help my powder to go on smoother. Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> been using for years.  Best combination of anti-oxidants, moisturizer, etc.  Good price</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin and this creme really helps my skin not feel very dry, especially now in winter.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised - this product really works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels and looks wonderful.  I am very happy&lt;br /&gt;with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for my 70+ year old neck and face which easily breaks out with oilier and far more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this product so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should. Has quite a bit of fragrance to it. It is a very thick cream and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this day creme (day and nite) for 2 years. I like the fact that it has no preservatives (which I am allergic to) and has ingredients (starts with pyco...) that reduce wrinkles. It does not have Vit A as I am using it during daytime. I am concern about vit A in day creme which can cause photosensitivity. In general, it is a good product that keeps my skin smooth and subtle. But add-on moisturizer may be needed in very dry and windy days.</li>
            <li> I rarely apply tinted sun screen if I plan to stay out of the sun, because the derma e creme is slightly tinted.  I would order again. The jar contains a generous amount of product for the price.</li>
