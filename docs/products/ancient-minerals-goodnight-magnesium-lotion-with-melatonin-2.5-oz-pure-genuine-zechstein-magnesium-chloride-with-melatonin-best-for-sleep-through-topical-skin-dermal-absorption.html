            <li>works good, I like the ingredients</li>
            <li>Both are good products, but I cannot compare dosages or contents of product delivered when you apply them.  </li>

            <li>but it is good for relief.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product - delivery fast and packaging great.  </li>
            <li>I find it superior to the MELATONIN SLEEP CREAM, which is also a very good product, but this seems to be more potent and works faster.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I even used it myself and well let&#x27;s be honest--</li>
            <li>Smells nice and is creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>plenty of water througout the day, and don&#x27;t drink any alcohol or beverages before bed and maybe try a warm soothing shower or bath before bed.</li>
            <li>The purchase process and delivery were perfect and fast.  </li>
            <li>and it is a nice lotion formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for airplane rides and right after you shower before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is the best, most natural product on the market.</li>
            <li>and I wake up feeling way more well rested and as if my sleep was richer and more effective.</li>
            <li>Very good product so far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure because I stopped using it immediately after that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post an update once I&#x27;ve used it some more.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>I think that I sleep better.</li>
            <li>Works SO much better than sleep aid pills.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>My husband and I LOVE this cream and use it nightly....</li>
            <li>I really love it and keep a supply on hand always.</li>
            <li>Lovely product, though it makes my wife sleepy when she uses it.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>, I have REALLY SMOOTH feet!</li>
            <li>Three of us (in this household) use this product; we love it.</li>
            <li>Smell is just okay</li>
            <li>I should mention that the nights we forget, she sleep walks and is up many many times throughout the night.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to add to your magnesium therapy but be aware that when you put it on it will sting for a minute.</li>
            <li>we are both falling asleep more easily and staying asleep longer than we have in ages.</li>
            <li>More importantly product works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying my restful, pain free sleep.</li>
            <li>The combination of magnesium and melatonin is helping me to sleep more soundly at night.</li>
            <li>Great natural remedy.</li>
            <li>This worked very well for me, making me sleepy and having a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li>Good product I recomend works very well.</li>
            <li>(nothing works all the time) and is a very effective product, easy to use and not messy.  </li>
            <li>My only way to a good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li>We go to sleep so easy and experience a deeper sleep.great</li>
            <li>Applies easily, without the sticky feeling one would get with magnesium oil, but not as concentrated.</li>
            <li>Best of all, my muscles are not &amp;#34;twitchy&amp;#34; when I lay down to sleep at night.</li>
            <li>His melatonin was fine, but the magnesium spray helped his migraines.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>but I honestly find myself falling asleep so much faster</li>
            <li>It does not help me sleep or calm me into a better nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to see this product on Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m pretty sure it clogs the pores.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I really can go without coffee in the morning when I have a great long sleep.</li>
            <li>I sleep deeper with this product so its good for anyone with sleep deficiencies caused by lack of enough magnesium in the body.  </li>
            <li>Really ,helps with a relaxing nights sleep feeling more refreshed after 1st night</li>
            <li>It really does work as I am able to get to sleep and stay asleep.</li>
            <li>The measured dose and airless pump are super features.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and keeps you asleep for 4 hours.</li>
            <li>But, this is probably better FOR you since it is magnesium, an element the body needs and that really is good for joints and would last better for long term pain relief.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed fairly quickly and does its job quickly, too.  </li>
            <li>I  continue to enjoy the Ancient Mineral&#x27;s magnesium lotion, and was excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li>It Would be  worth the money.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve been using it, no only do I sleep more soundly, and no longer have leg or foot cramps</li>
            <li>In fact, the top clear lid that should have been on it, was not.</li>
            <li>This puts you right to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I use this right before bed.  </li>
            <li>This puts me right to sleep without the grogginess you may experience if taking sleeping aides.</li>
            <li>if you are mag deficient here&#x27;s a way of getting more,osmosis gives it to you in a pleasant vehicle that is easy to apply</li>
            <li>I bought it hoping it would help my twin sons fall asleep peacefully and stay asleep.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate their specifying exactly what you are getting.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, just started using my second bottle.</li>
            <li>From the first night we used this we both slept well.</li>
            <li>If melatonin pills don&#x27;t work for you then maybe it&#x27;s just your brain chemistry, but this works better for me than any sleeping bill or melatonin pill and with the added benefit of relaxing my muscles in a similar way that an Epsom salt bath would.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has also helped with my neck pain, I wish I would of found this much sooner!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look at electronics before bed and make sure you are sleeping in a cool dark room and are clearing your mind of worrying thoughts.</li>
            <li>This, of course, contains magnesium which also helps sleeping, and the manufacturer states clearly that each full pumpful delivers 25mg of elemental magnesium along with 3mg of melatonin.  </li>
            <li>but I am super sensitive to even one aspirin.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product , I combine a small amount (less than a full dose) with transdermal magnesium and a quick ice bath to put myself into a deep sleep!</li>
            <li>So, there is no way to know how much melatonin you are getting since the product is not metered and the label doesn&#x27;t tell you the melatonin content.  </li>
            <li>I have to take sleeping pills at night, so I can&#x27;t speak for the sleep aid properties, but is very relaxing to rub on hands and feet at night.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful with night time rest.  </li>
            <li>Product would not come out of the bottle regardless of how much you pump it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not lightning fast like taking a melatonin pill but the effects are a lot longer - keeps me a asleep longer</li>
            <li>Really helps, can feel some pain relief.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and really, doesn&#x27;t seem to make me sleepy, but if relieves pain, then that helps to relax.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything though.</li>
            <li>I sleep really well</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion applied at night before bed.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised to read that most of us are not getting enough Magnesium.</li>
            <li>This is natural, needed by the body and it seems to &#x27;warm&#x27; as sinks in.</li>
            <li>Unlike normal melatonin pills which can make one feel so sleepy they feel almost drugged, this cream lulls you gently to sleep.</li>
            <li>This lotion is wonderful, but very expensive for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li>I found this particular brand &amp;#34;Goodnight Magnesium&amp;#34; recommended  from reading Dr. Sircus&#x27;s books on magnesium.</li>
            <li>Definitely sleeping better since starting to use this product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Anyway first night and second night I used this produce the sharp shooting pain was greatly diminished and the melatonin quicky helped me settle down.  </li>
            <li>Next morning she woke up feeling relaxed and fresh with no pain and stress where I applied the lotion.</li>
            <li>you feel normal.....</li>
            <li>I was ordering Magnesium lotion and saw this new product from Ancient Minerals.</li>
            <li>The only product that is  be better for quick joint pain relief is Janets&#x27; Glucosamene cream- which is hard to find.</li>
            <li>then I rubbed some in and don&#x27;t remember what happened next ;-)  </li>
            <li>Not sure that this works for sleeping better.</li>
            <li>Haha, way to blame this great product for your bad travel choices.</li>
            <li>There are no ingredients which are reactive on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s said to be calming and a natural body ache relief as it contains magnesium.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my feet so soft.</li>
            <li>Both my sister and I use this product and it does relieve discomfort from spasms, old injuries, and</li>
            <li>This container should last for a while given it doesn&#x27;t take much of the cream to see the results.</li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old asks for this lotion every night.</li>
            <li>It worked well for me as a moisturizer for my legs and back for pain relief/muscle relaxant when travelling, small and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Rub some of this lotion on the back of your neck and shoulders and in the soft skin spots like your elbow and knee pits so it will soak in well.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Goodnight&amp;#34; part means it also has a tiny bit of melatonin in it, which is a natural element your body makes to help you sleep</li>
            <li>an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an extremely active person and I noticed a large difference in how I felt after applying the spray at night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say other than it has helped me immensely.</li>
            <li>It has helped my sleep and my wife&#x27;s sleep in a dramatic, smooth and natural way that nothing else has.</li>

            <li> I appreciate their specifying exactly what you are getting.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, just started using my second bottle.</li>
            <li> From the first night we used this we both slept well.</li>
            <li> If melatonin pills don&#x27;t work for you then maybe it&#x27;s just your brain chemistry, but this works better for me than any sleeping bill or melatonin pill and with the added benefit of relaxing my muscles in a similar way that an Epsom salt bath would.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has also helped with my neck pain, I wish I would of found this much sooner!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look at electronics before bed and make sure you are sleeping in a cool dark room and are clearing your mind of worrying thoughts.</li>
            <li> This, of course, contains magnesium which also helps sleeping, and the manufacturer states clearly that each full pumpful delivers 25mg of elemental magnesium along with 3mg of melatonin.  </li>
            <li> but I am super sensitive to even one aspirin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product , I combine a small amount (less than a full dose) with transdermal magnesium and a quick ice bath to put myself into a deep sleep!</li>
            <li> So, there is no way to know how much melatonin you are getting since the product is not metered and the label doesn&#x27;t tell you the melatonin content.  </li>
            <li> I have to take sleeping pills at night, so I can&#x27;t speak for the sleep aid properties, but is very relaxing to rub on hands and feet at night.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful with night time rest.  </li>
            <li> Product would not come out of the bottle regardless of how much you pump it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not lightning fast like taking a melatonin pill but the effects are a lot longer - keeps me a asleep longer</li>
            <li> Really helps, can feel some pain relief.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and really, doesn&#x27;t seem to make me sleepy, but if relieves pain, then that helps to relax.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything though.</li>
            <li> I sleep really well</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion applied at night before bed.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised to read that most of us are not getting enough Magnesium.</li>
            <li> This is natural, needed by the body and it seems to &#x27;warm&#x27; as sinks in.</li>
            <li> Unlike normal melatonin pills which can make one feel so sleepy they feel almost drugged, this cream lulls you gently to sleep.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful, but very expensive for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> I found this particular brand &amp;#34;Goodnight Magnesium&amp;#34; recommended  from reading Dr. Sircus&#x27;s books on magnesium.</li>
            <li> Definitely sleeping better since starting to use this product</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Anyway first night and second night I used this produce the sharp shooting pain was greatly diminished and the melatonin quicky helped me settle down.  </li>
            <li> Next morning she woke up feeling relaxed and fresh with no pain and stress where I applied the lotion.</li>
            <li> you feel normal.....</li>
            <li> I was ordering Magnesium lotion and saw this new product from Ancient Minerals.</li>
            <li> The only product that is  be better for quick joint pain relief is Janets&#x27; Glucosamene cream- which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> then I rubbed some in and don&#x27;t remember what happened next ;-)  </li>
            <li> Not sure that this works for sleeping better.</li>
            <li> Haha, way to blame this great product for your bad travel choices.</li>
            <li> There are no ingredients which are reactive on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s said to be calming and a natural body ache relief as it contains magnesium.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my feet so soft.</li>
            <li> Both my sister and I use this product and it does relieve discomfort from spasms, old injuries, and</li>
            <li> This container should last for a while given it doesn&#x27;t take much of the cream to see the results.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old asks for this lotion every night.</li>
            <li> It worked well for me as a moisturizer for my legs and back for pain relief/muscle relaxant when travelling, small and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Rub some of this lotion on the back of your neck and shoulders and in the soft skin spots like your elbow and knee pits so it will soak in well.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Goodnight&amp;#34; part means it also has a tiny bit of melatonin in it, which is a natural element your body makes to help you sleep</li>
            <li> an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an extremely active person and I noticed a large difference in how I felt after applying the spray at night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say other than it has helped me immensely.</li>
            <li> It has helped my sleep and my wife&#x27;s sleep in a dramatic, smooth and natural way that nothing else has.</li>
            <li> It is really a quality product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is really working or not</li>
            <li> I have major neuropathy in my hand and feet and other areas due to chemo damage.  </li>
            <li> When I go to sleep the sharp pain and constant shooting pain and tingles keep me awake.  </li>
            <li> , then this thing never absorbed properly, i could take off a layer of it with my nails.</li>
            <li> and my daughter seems to be calmer (not normal for her:)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it makes me fall asleep necessarily, but I notice that my sleep is definitely deeper</li>
            <li> Half a pump on her lower back gets rid of the jitters that she and I both can not stand!</li>
            <li> Product was dried around the dispenser, making me believe that not only was the product opened, it had also been used.  </li>
            <li> Just be carefully you don&#x27;t habitually use this everyday, or else you&#x27;ll actually NEED it to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not sticky and I really only just put a little on my index finger tip and thumb tip and give myself a neck massage with it to rub it in and on any other sore spots.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had neuropathy it is hard to image since words typically do not do justice.  </li>
            <li> With that addition, it also keeps the stronger magnesium only type cream from stinging, which happens  on some people, but is very slight.</li>
            <li> I was wondering the other night why at 3am</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my bottle didn&#x27;t come with a lid, which means the pump can get depressed and dispense lotion during travel.</li>
            <li> But it is too expensive and it doesn‘t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wait for nighttime either because nerves need calming anywhere anytime.&lt;br /&gt;Besides settling down firing nerves</li>
            <li> Non greasy and not very strong smell.  </li>
            <li> May I recommend that you start with less quantity than what they suggest and then go from there.</li>
            <li> Feels a little sticky going on, but that feeling subsides soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I think everyone could use a little Goodnight Magnesium in their lives.</li>
            <li> I use this for me and my daughter and also add a little of the Ancient Minerals oil to it</li>
            <li> that sleeping pills, especially crazy ones like ambien ... and alcohol too, are so bad for your sleep and sleep is the most important thing you can do for yourself.</li>
            <li> There is nothing harsh about it....</li>
            <li> That coupled with my firm mattress</li>
            <li> And my appetite totally changes and I crave health foods instead of unhealthy ones.</li>
            <li> Some people/kids have trouble sleeping..</li>
            <li> I only use a small dab on my temples, forehead and behind my ears at night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review because I don&#x27;t like to write negative reviews, but I keep getting emails asking to review the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, MELATONIN SLEEP CREAM does not specify the amount of active ingredient you are getting, which I failed to mention in my review of it, although the jar contains 4 oz. of product.  </li>
            <li> With calming magnesium and melatonin you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> In addition, I had very twisted and disturbing dreams on the nights that I used this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I immediately found relief from my painful insomnia.</li>
            <li> I hate to say, but it didn&#x27;t,t work that we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Holy crap my boyfriend</li>
            <li> Very expensive horrible product.</li>
            <li> After 2 months using this product i found it of a very bad quality, it doesn&#x27;t even work for me, never helped me.</li>
            <li> And the horrible oily texture stays with you forever</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good product to add to your magnesium therapy but be aware that when you put it on it will sting for a minute. Keep it away from your eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product and good quality.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in my daughter&#x27;s sleep habits since we have started using this lotion in her nightly routine.  She sleeps all night now without waking.  My only complaint is that my bottle didn&#x27;t come with a lid, which means the pump can get depressed and dispense lotion during travel.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels good. There are no ingredients which are reactive on my sensitive skin. The measured dose and airless pump are super features. Best of all, my muscles are not &amp;#34;twitchy&amp;#34; when I lay down to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sold on this lotion.  I bought it hoping it would help my twin sons fall asleep peacefully and stay asleep.  It&#x27;s said to be calming and a natural body ache relief as it contains magnesium.  I used this on my sons for a couple of nights and found no difference in their sleep. I even used it myself and well let&#x27;s be honest-- if my boys aren&#x27;t sleeping, momma&#x27;s not sleeping-- so I didn&#x27;t find that it helped me at all.  In addition, I had very twisted and disturbing dreams on the nights that I used this.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related to the lotion or not, but that was the only change in my routine at the time which leads me to believe that it might be. I can&#x27;t say for sure because I stopped using it immediately after that.  I am going to try it again just because I paid for it and I feel like I should use every drop.  I&#x27;ll post an update once I&#x27;ve used it some more.</li>
            <li> works good, I like the ingredients</li>
            <li> Comparable to snake oil.  It does not work.</li>
            <li> This review is for the ANCIENT MINERALS &amp;#34;GOODNIGHT&#x27; MAGNESIUM LOTION WITH MELATONIN.  An excellent product to help you get to sleep faster.  You just use one press of the pump to release the amount of product and then spread it on your skin.  I put some on my temples and the rest on the inside of my arms.  It is absorbed fairly quickly and does its job quickly, too.  It helps me to get to sleep faster (nothing works all the time) and is a very effective product, easy to use and not messy.  I find it superior to the MELATONIN SLEEP CREAM, which is also a very good product, but this seems to be more potent and works faster.  It is also very much more expensive.  You get 2.5 oz. (75ml) in one container.  This, of course, contains magnesium which also helps sleeping, and the manufacturer states clearly that each full pumpful delivers 25mg of elemental magnesium along with 3mg of melatonin.  I appreciate their specifying exactly what you are getting.  Since each pumpful delivers 1 ml of product, this container should deliver 75 dosages of product.  Unfortunately, MELATONIN SLEEP CREAM does not specify the amount of active ingredient you are getting, which I failed to mention in my review of it, although the jar contains 4 oz. of product.  So, there is no way to know how much melatonin you are getting since the product is not metered and the label doesn&#x27;t tell you the melatonin content.  Both are good products, but I cannot compare dosages or contents of product delivered when you apply them.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because of the expensiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> Non greasy and not very strong smell.  It seems to help with leg cramps at night</li>
            <li> I sleep deeper with this product so its good for anyone with sleep deficiencies caused by lack of enough magnesium in the body.  Magnesium is good for depression too.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Really ,helps with a relaxing nights sleep feeling more refreshed after 1st night</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and transformed migraines. I especially benefit from massaging Goodnight Magnesium Lotion into the nape of the neck and shoulders. I don&#x27;t wait for nighttime either because nerves need calming anywhere anytime.&lt;br /&gt;Besides settling down firing nerves, my over-all health improved with the daily addition of sub-dermal magnesium. I also take another form of this mineral.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderfully soothing. I have to take sleeping pills at night, so I can&#x27;t speak for the sleep aid properties, but is very relaxing to rub on hands and feet at night. Smells nice and is creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this product on Amazon prime.  It was more expensive elsewhere when you factored in shipping.  It is very helpful with night time rest.  With calming magnesium and melatonin you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product. Some others have stated that it leaves your skin feeling itchy or oily, but I found neither to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an extremely active person and I noticed a large difference in how I felt after applying the spray at night. I didn&#x27;t feel as sore or achy after playing pick up basketball the next day.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product - delivery fast and packaging great.  More importantly product works.  I have major neuropathy in my hand and feet and other areas due to chemo damage.  When I go to sleep the sharp pain and constant shooting pain and tingles keep me awake.  If you&#x27;ve never had neuropathy it is hard to image since words typically do not do justice.  It is as if you are walking on barbed wire.  Anyway first night and second night I used this produce the sharp shooting pain was greatly diminished and the melatonin quicky helped me settle down.  For me getting 2-3 consecutive hours of sleep is incredible.  Thank you ancient minerals.... Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I use this nightly and no longer have the occassional cramps Iuse to have in my feet and ankles.  I do recommend this</li>
            <li> Very good product so far.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It leaves my feet so soft. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This puts you right to sleep.  I use this right before bed.  It works quickly and keeps you asleep for 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just started using my second bottle. Works great with shoulder problems</li>
            <li> I love this lotion I think that I sleep better. Wish it came in a larger size. It Would be  worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good product to add magnesium as your body needs it. Feels a little sticky going on, but that feeling subsides soon.</li>
            <li> The perfect help that I needed to get to sleep and stay asleep. Works SO much better than sleep aid pills. This product is fabulous! Non-greasy, absorbs immediately, no noticeable scent, and it works. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> helps relieve shoulder and neck pain after rotator cuff surgery.  loved the melatonin to help with elusive sleep post surgery</li>
            <li> I was ordering Magnesium lotion and saw this new product from Ancient Minerals. I thought, why not give ti a try.  I love it!  It&#x27;s easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Great idea!</li>
            <li> I am not a headache person but I am super sensitive to even one aspirin. May I recommend that you start with less quantity than what they suggest and then go from there. To this point tho, I am a smallish person, weighing 108 @ 5&#x27;2&amp;quot;.  It really does work as I am able to get to sleep and stay asleep. The headache goes away once I get up and am moving.</li>
            <li> The word Great does not do justice to this product. It is the best, most natural product on the market. It has helped my sleep and my wife&#x27;s sleep in a dramatic, smooth and natural way that nothing else has. It appears to be very good for stress points in the body as well. My wife was having stress and pain in her left shoulder neck area. I put one squirt on the area and rubbed it in. Immediately she felt relief and then slept like a baby all night. Next morning she woke up feeling relaxed and fresh with no pain and stress where I applied the lotion. Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product , I combine a small amount (less than a full dose) with transdermal magnesium and a quick ice bath to put myself into a deep sleep!</li>
            <li> Unlike normal melatonin pills which can make one feel so sleepy they feel almost drugged, this cream lulls you gently to sleep. There is nothing harsh about it....i.e. you don&#x27;t feel groggy the next day....if you awake to go to the bathroom during the night, you don&#x27;t feel as though you are in a drugged stupor....you feel normal.....just sleepy. My husband and I LOVE this cream and use it nightly....we are both falling asleep more easily and staying asleep longer than we have in ages.</li>
            <li> Good product. Both my sister and I use this product and it does relieve discomfort from spasms, old injuries, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a cure but it is good for relief.</li>
            <li> After discussions with my women&#x27;s group about the critical need for magnesium and how one aspect relates to sleep, I promptly purchased a bottle of ancient minerals lotion. I immediately found relief from my painful insomnia. I gave a bottle to my son-in-law because of his migraines. He kept the spray but had to give me back the lotion with melatonin. He slept for two days. His melatonin was fine, but the magnesium spray helped his migraines. I&#x27;m enjoying my restful, pain free sleep.</li>
            <li> I wrote this on my girls legs before bed to help them get to sleep some nights. I will say it stings if they have any cuts or scrapes. It&#x27;s a little pricey so I doubt I will buy it again and I&#x27;ll just stick to the version without the melatonin.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to read that most of us are not getting enough Magnesium. From the first night we used this we both slept well.</li>
            <li> My husband and I rub this cream on the bottoms of our feet about 30 min before bedtime. We go to sleep so easy and experience a deeper sleep.great</li>
            <li> This worked very well for me, making me sleepy and having a good nights sleep. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. If melatonin pills don&#x27;t work for you then maybe it&#x27;s just your brain chemistry, but this works better for me than any sleeping bill or melatonin pill and with the added benefit of relaxing my muscles in a similar way that an Epsom salt bath would. I&#x27;m not sure it makes me fall asleep necessarily, but I notice that my sleep is definitely deeper and I wake up feeling way more well rested and as if my sleep was richer and more effective. I really love it and keep a supply on hand always. It&#x27;s great for airplane rides and right after you shower before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I read one review here that someone said it was sticky and stayed on their skin, but then followed up with how they were on a vacation on an island and couldn&#x27;t shower for 2 days. Haha, way to blame this great product for your bad travel choices. The lotion is not sticky and I really only just put a little on my index finger tip and thumb tip and give myself a neck massage with it to rub it in and on any other sore spots. That coupled with my firm mattress and I sleep so well.&lt;br /&gt;Drink plenty of water througout the day, and don&#x27;t drink any alcohol or beverages before bed and maybe try a warm soothing shower or bath before bed. Rub some of this lotion on the back of your neck and shoulders and in the soft skin spots like your elbow and knee pits so it will soak in well. You will have wonderful dreams and wake up feeling as if your REM sleep went deeper and longer than before. Don&#x27;t look at electronics before bed and make sure you are sleeping in a cool dark room and are clearing your mind of worrying thoughts. It&#x27;s really a great tool in your sleep tool box.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that sleeping pills, especially crazy ones like ambien ... and alcohol too, are so bad for your sleep and sleep is the most important thing you can do for yourself. I love the fact that I really can go without coffee in the morning when I have a great long sleep. And my appetite totally changes and I crave health foods instead of unhealthy ones.</li>
            <li> Product would not come out of the bottle regardless of how much you pump it.</li>
            <li> Now I know why it got great reviews. It&#x27;s not lightning fast like taking a melatonin pill but the effects are a lot longer - keeps me a asleep longer</li>
            <li> Really helps, can feel some pain relief. We take a lot of magnesium also. The only product that is  be better for quick joint pain relief is Janets&#x27; Glucosamene cream- which is hard to find. But, this is probably better FOR you since it is magnesium, an element the body needs and that really is good for joints and would last better for long term pain relief.  This is natural, needed by the body and it seems to &#x27;warm&#x27; as sinks in. I often combine to the two products. I also sometimes mix with NOW&#x27;s product, argan oil for heat- I found this particular brand &amp;#34;Goodnight Magnesium&amp;#34; recommended  from reading Dr. Sircus&#x27;s books on magnesium. The &#x27;Goodnight&amp;#34; part means it also has a tiny bit of melatonin in it, which is a natural element your body makes to help you sleep and as you get older you produce less of it.  With that addition, it also keeps the stronger magnesium only type cream from stinging, which happens  on some people, but is very slight. This doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and really, doesn&#x27;t seem to make me sleepy, but if relieves pain, then that helps to relax.  It is really a quality product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say other than it has helped me immensely. I&#x27;ve had insomnia for a while again where the max sleep is 2 hrs. This puts me right to sleep without the grogginess you may experience if taking sleeping aides. This container should last for a while given it doesn&#x27;t take much of the cream to see the results.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, though it makes my wife sleepy when she uses it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. But it is too expensive and it doesn‘t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> I  continue to enjoy the Ancient Mineral&#x27;s magnesium lotion, and was excited to try this new product. I apply it to my forehead, neck and tummy at bedtime. The combination of magnesium and melatonin is helping me to sleep more soundly at night.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  I only use a small dab on my temples, forehead and behind my ears at night before I go to bed.  Maybe I&#x27;m imagining it but I honestly find myself falling asleep so much faster</li>
            <li> I hate to say, but it didn&#x27;t,t work that we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Great bye bye leg cramps and you sleep like a baby</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, in excellent condition. Applies easily, without the sticky feeling one would get with magnesium oil, but not as concentrated. It worked well for me as a moisturizer for my legs and back for pain relief/muscle relaxant when travelling, small and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! Holy crap my boyfriend and I sleep like logs when we put it on before bed. Recommending it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I think everyone could use a little Goodnight Magnesium in their lives. Kinda pricey but since I&#x27;ve been using it, no only do I sleep more soundly, and no longer have leg or foot cramps, I have REALLY SMOOTH feet!</li>
            <li> After 2 months using this product i found it of a very bad quality, it doesn&#x27;t even work for me, never helped me. And the horrible oily texture stays with you forever, i&#x27;m pretty sure it clogs the pores. I went on vacation to an island and couldn&#x27;t shower for 2 days, then this thing never absorbed properly, i could take off a layer of it with my nails. Very expensive horrible product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. &amp;#34;Lights out,&amp;#34; in no time at all, and no groggy after-feeling (quite the contrary) in the morning. Three of us (in this household) use this product; we love it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is really working or not but I keep using it.</li>
            <li> Use this every night and definitely helps me sleep</li>
            <li> Just be carefully you don&#x27;t habitually use this everyday, or else you&#x27;ll actually NEED it to fall asleep. I was wondering the other night why at 3am I hadn&#x27;t fallen to sleep yet --  then I rubbed some in and don&#x27;t remember what happened next ;-)  It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything though.</li>
            <li> The purchase process and delivery were perfect and fast.  The product just does not work for me the way they say it will.  It does not help me sleep or calm me into a better nights sleep.  I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the dosage and applying it in different spots and that did not help.  Smell is just okay and it is a nice lotion formula.</li>
            <li> if you are mag deficient here&#x27;s a way of getting more,osmosis gives it to you in a pleasant vehicle that is easy to apply</li>
            <li> I sleep really well if I use this two hours before I go to bed. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great natural remedy. The magnesium and melatonin mix makes falling asleep&lt;br /&gt;easy and, best of all, there&#x27;s no drug hangover!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review because I don&#x27;t like to write negative reviews, but I keep getting emails asking to review the product. So. My container of the lotion was not sealed. In fact, the top clear lid that should have been on it, was not. Product was dried around the dispenser, making me believe that not only was the product opened, it had also been used.  I threw it away, without even using it, because I didn&#x27;t trust it. And we all know what a pain it is to return items, so I just chalked it up as a lesson learned: Buy products in a store.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help me fall asleep or relieve my restless legs symptoms as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion applied at night before bed.  It really works!</li>
            <li> Good product I recomend works very well. Well invest money.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old asks for this lotion every night. Half a pump on her lower back gets rid of the jitters that she and I both can not stand! She literally says that she loves her night-night lotion. I should mention that the nights we forget, she sleep walks and is up many many times throughout the night. We don&#x27;t often forget! Some people/kids have trouble sleeping..this combo is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I use this for me and my daughter and also add a little of the Ancient Minerals oil to it and it doesn&#x27;t itch at all like it does when just using the oil. Definitely sleeping better since starting to use this product and my daughter seems to be calmer (not normal for her:)&lt;br /&gt;It has also helped with my neck pain, I wish I would of found this much sooner!</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful, but very expensive for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> My only way to a good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> Not sure that this works for sleeping better.</li>
    </ol>
