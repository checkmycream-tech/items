            <li>It is Very effective.</li>
            <li>The pain relief is amazing!</li>
            <li>It seems to work for the most part and can get very warm!!</li>
            <li>Has a somewhat pleasant smell; not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but the odor is not too pleasant...</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say anything good about it.</li>
            <li>it good but not as good as the one in the tube if you have that one</li>
            <li>Just one pump would be good for each hand.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>is as good as any on the market.</li>
            <li>It is  a good  product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tiger Balm products for years with mostly good results.  </li>
            <li>Fixes up arthritis as good as anything I have ever tried - use it on my feet and ankles every day and can stay on feet all day without pain</li>
            <li>However, this Rub works good too.</li>
            <li>BUT is good for the purpose of calming any pain on ligaments.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I like the feeling of the product &amp; its&#x27; interesting smell on my aches &amp; pains!</li>
            <li>definitely better than taking a bunch of oral pain pills!</li>
            <li>Love the pump!</li>
            <li>Superb product works very well.</li>
            <li>Sure smells good.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of minty with a trace of licorice.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have a pump bottle, making use easier.</li>
            <li>Tiger Balm takes care of her arthritis pain and is in a handy pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice fell.</li>
            <li>This product was somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li>Strong and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Tiger Balm Arthritis Product works well but has a very strong smell after application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell</li>
            <li>It also has a very strong odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found helpful so far.</li>
            <li>The tiger balm that comes in the jars is much more effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most penetrating and effective muscle cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It is great and really helpful!</li>
            <li>just wish they made something this effective without the strong smell.  </li>
            <li>hope to see more squirts out there ladies</li>
            <li>Its Ok</li>
            <li>so I can sleep better.</li>
            <li>none of the doctors or specialist have been able to figure it out.  </li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for this product, there would be times I wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk or bear the pain.  </li>
            <li>This is the best topical product I have found.  </li>
            <li>Use several times a day, when needed, for best results.</li>
            <li>I love tiger balm</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a horrible one though.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Works ok.  </li>
            <li>My massage clients love it -- including the smell.  </li>
            <li>Have used for years and it sure helps</li>
            <li>I love all the Tiger Balm products.</li>
            <li>For most artthritis sufferers, I can recommend that you give it a try.</li>
            <li>If you make a patch out of plastic wrap maybe it would work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we tried it</li>
            <li>Love this prodict.</li>
            <li>---its the best i could find to reduce  my wife,s pain in her back.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It gave me the relief (temporarily) that I wanted, and I was pleased  with the feel and gexture of the liquid.</li>
            <li>My mom love this.</li>
            <li>I love tiger balm products, have been using for years.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the ordering and receiving of this product but didn&#x27;t feel like it really helped me.</li>
            <li>works better for me than my wife --got</li>
            <li>The women in my family love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>one would think that the fewer words the better.</li>
            <li>I love Tiger Balm and am using this rub to see if it specifically helps arthritic knees.  </li>
            <li>I like this brand more than most.......</li>
            <li>It is all natural ingredients &amp; it smells good too, like cinnamon!  </li>
            <li>pretty good, I think.</li>
            <li>Dosent seem to be as strong but much better than anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li>excellent product that works better than the slightly harder cream or salve offered by tiger balm</li>
            <li>The Tiger Balm Rub spreads easily and is marvelous for sore muscles and probably for minor arthritis discomfort.</li>
            <li>Great ingredient concept; right for me right now.</li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This pumper is creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and not greasy.</li>
            <li>only ok for her --works great for me however..</li>
            <li>Puts on when she has a flare-up but the odor is too strong for her.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell but my wife and I are used to it and it is away of letting her know I am hurting without saying anything.</li>
            <li>but it may be too strong for some.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as the sports rub since it is in a pump form.  </li>
            <li>When I apply this upstairs my girlfriend can immediately tell from the kitchen downstairs, that is how strong the smell is.</li>
            <li>There is a strong menthol aroma that comes from it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The scent of the Tiger Balm Rub isn&#x27;t as strong as the Tiger Balm Cream</li>
            <li>smells too strong but appears to work well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered on Amazon, got free shipping, got my product in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Great Ointment....for Sore Legs n muscles...USE Daily!</li>
            <li>I already use the extra strength on my ankles and all their products are great.</li>
            <li>(I know manufactures of Arnica had to reduce the amount of arnica in ointments because it kept it available too</li>
            <li>This product works wonders, but I still prefer the original &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It feels great for a long time!  </li>
            <li>so I can clean it off me before bed.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant enough, too.</li>
            <li>Very effective for minor aches and pains/</li>
            <li>so far this is the most helpful thing I&#x27;ve found for my &amp;#34;bone to bone, no cartilage&amp;#34; knee aches and pains!  </li>
            <li>Great, eases discomfort quickly and lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li>It has a very pungent aroma, but doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like so many lotion/ointments.</li>
            <li>I just know that Tiger Balm seems to help me considerably ,where most  products of this kind don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tiger Balm for many years, and this one is the easiest, and you can really feel it working.</li>
            <li>I also received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>Is easier to used in the pump form and spreads out quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff ever, its the only rub that actually gives u relief from arthritis pain.....</li>
            <li>liquid rub is easy to apply and may work very well for some folks.  </li>
            <li>But be warned, it does have a very overpowering odor!!</li>
            <li>Plus shipping arrived exactly on time!</li>
            <li>and I am 75 years old!!!!!</li>
            <li>Anything that can do that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I feel the consumer would be far better served just getting some over the counter rub and save themselves a bunch of money.</li>
            <li>Ordered for lady co-worker with arthritis from fingers to shoulder on right arm.</li>
            <li>Delivery right on time.</li>
            <li>It goes on thicker and doesn&#x27;t evaporate as quickly, so I get much deeper and prolonged relief out of it.</li>
            <li>She says that is better absorbed than any of the same products on the market.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>This was my first order of the Tiger Balm.</li>
            <li>was my first time to order the arthritis  tiger balm rub</li>
            <li>The intense, sweetish smell clung to skin, clothing, bedclothes, everything!</li>
            <li>This one is for arthritis and only product I have been able to find that takes the pain away.</li>
            <li>and IT REALLY HELPED!</li>
            <li>This stuff works exactly as it says it will.  </li>
            <li>most likely it will go in garbage.</li>
            <li>However, I do use this as an adjunct to more mainstream medical pain treatment.  </li>
            <li>i also use it for my back which has always bothered me and it is better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this for temporary relief of muscle pain and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>was a bit skeptical at first, but once I used it, I found it to be a great relief!  </li>
            <li>But it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Love it for pain relief in shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>and I love just having it around for such occasions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any person that has mild to severe</li>
            <li>When my shoulder is really bothering me I can rub some of this in and right away the relief begins.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t report on the efficacy of this product, because it has such a strong odor that I stopped using it after one application.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is the strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li>A little spendy, but works great for my various aches.</li>
            <li>The Ultra was good but hard to apply.</li>
            <li>It takes the soreness away from me, as I am getting ready to go to sleep.</li>
            <li>but nothing&#x27;s really helped her pain.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>This Tiger Balm Rub does not help as much as the patch, but it helps a LOT.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much jack.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It just burns the whole area where you rub it.</li>
            <li>and I loved the smell, but this stuff sucks for arthritis pain</li>
            <li>have tried many other rubs and this one truly helps my pain.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t found any that works better than the other</li>
            <li>Very little goes a long way and did I say it works great?  </li>
            <li>Pleased to say this product totally dulled her pain for several hours.</li>
            <li>bought the patches from this same brand at a local store and they worked better than any of the others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>No complaint</li>
            <li>Using Tiger Balm Patches help me a lot (better than prescription pain patches) but all patches break me out in a rash after a few days.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t last long and really has a strong smell until you wash off.</li>
            <li>It really smells great, but after a few days I noticed that the area I used the Tiger Balm on was covered in small raised bumps.</li>
            <li>This new product,  marketed for arthritis, shows some promise.  </li>
            <li>It does not cure it, but it does make it considerably bearable - thank you!</li>
            <li>it was the first thing that actually worked for my pain that was over-the-counter</li>
            <li>Yes, it has the chondrotin, glucosamine, and MSM, and a few other things, but something has made it more effective than anything else for a few of my massage clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>biggest / only issue for losing a star is that the pump does not seal, and to get it to seal, I must squirt a full pump out and make sure to screw it down tight.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my aching 60 year old knee</li>
            <li>It is a pretty small bottle, but I don&#x27;t think you really need to use much.</li>
            <li>Suffer with RA so pain is a constant companion but this rub helps so much.  </li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My niece swears by this product, but I guess my skin may be too sensitive to use it.</li>
            <li>the camphor &amp; menthol are double what is often found, but does not burn too much.</li>
            <li>I have used everything for my arthritis pain and this stuff is the only stuff I have found that really gets in and gives me pain relief when I&#x27;m hurting.</li>
            <li>My joint pain is internal so the balm doesn&#x27;t really work for my purpose.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent initially, but the scent does not last overly long.  </li>
            <li>I have to send it back, the scent is too strong for my athma, when I lay down it closes my airway.</li>
            <li>one more word is required to finish this review; how dumb.  </li>
            <li>I have had severe pain in my feet, knees, lower back since I was 3 years old ...</li>
            <li>but apparently they changed the ingredients</li>
            <li>Even though my hands felt like they were on fire, the tingle was more irritating than comforting like you expect from tiger balm products.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for others looking for a topical application that offers local pain relief.</li>
            <li>In the area we live in the price of this product is comparable to other products of this type.</li>

            <li> very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I like the feeling of the product &amp; its&#x27; interesting smell on my aches &amp; pains!</li>
            <li> definitely better than taking a bunch of oral pain pills!</li>
            <li> Love the pump!</li>
            <li> Superb product works very well.</li>
            <li> Sure smells good.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of minty with a trace of licorice.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to have a pump bottle, making use easier.</li>
            <li> Tiger Balm takes care of her arthritis pain and is in a handy pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice fell.</li>
            <li> This product was somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Strong and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Tiger Balm Arthritis Product works well but has a very strong smell after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell</li>
            <li> It also has a very strong odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found helpful so far.</li>
            <li> The tiger balm that comes in the jars is much more effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most penetrating and effective muscle cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It is great and really helpful!</li>
            <li> just wish they made something this effective without the strong smell.  </li>
            <li> hope to see more squirts out there ladies</li>
            <li> Its Ok</li>
            <li> so I can sleep better.</li>
            <li> none of the doctors or specialist have been able to figure it out.  </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this product, there would be times I wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk or bear the pain.  </li>
            <li> This is the best topical product I have found.  </li>
            <li> Use several times a day, when needed, for best results.</li>
            <li> I love tiger balm</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a horrible one though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  </li>
            <li> My massage clients love it -- including the smell.  </li>
            <li> Have used for years and it sure helps</li>
            <li> I love all the Tiger Balm products.</li>
            <li> For most artthritis sufferers, I can recommend that you give it a try.</li>
            <li> If you make a patch out of plastic wrap maybe it would work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we tried it</li>
            <li> Love this prodict.</li>
            <li> ---its the best i could find to reduce  my wife,s pain in her back.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It gave me the relief (temporarily) that I wanted, and I was pleased  with the feel and gexture of the liquid.</li>
            <li> My mom love this.</li>
            <li> I love tiger balm products, have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the ordering and receiving of this product but didn&#x27;t feel like it really helped me.</li>
            <li> works better for me than my wife --got</li>
            <li> The women in my family love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> one would think that the fewer words the better.</li>
            <li> I love Tiger Balm and am using this rub to see if it specifically helps arthritic knees.  </li>
            <li> I like this brand more than most.......</li>
            <li> It is all natural ingredients &amp; it smells good too, like cinnamon!  </li>
            <li> pretty good, I think.</li>
            <li> Dosent seem to be as strong but much better than anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li> excellent product that works better than the slightly harder cream or salve offered by tiger balm</li>
            <li> The Tiger Balm Rub spreads easily and is marvelous for sore muscles and probably for minor arthritis discomfort.</li>
            <li> Great ingredient concept; right for me right now.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This pumper is creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and not greasy.</li>
            <li> only ok for her --works great for me however..</li>
            <li> Puts on when she has a flare-up but the odor is too strong for her.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell but my wife and I are used to it and it is away of letting her know I am hurting without saying anything.</li>
            <li> but it may be too strong for some.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the sports rub since it is in a pump form.  </li>
            <li> When I apply this upstairs my girlfriend can immediately tell from the kitchen downstairs, that is how strong the smell is.</li>
            <li> There is a strong menthol aroma that comes from it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The scent of the Tiger Balm Rub isn&#x27;t as strong as the Tiger Balm Cream</li>
            <li> smells too strong but appears to work well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered on Amazon, got free shipping, got my product in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li> Great Ointment....for Sore Legs n muscles...USE Daily!</li>
            <li> I already use the extra strength on my ankles and all their products are great.</li>
            <li> (I know manufactures of Arnica had to reduce the amount of arnica in ointments because it kept it available too</li>
            <li> This product works wonders, but I still prefer the original &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It feels great for a long time!  </li>
            <li> so I can clean it off me before bed.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant enough, too.</li>
            <li> Very effective for minor aches and pains/</li>
            <li> so far this is the most helpful thing I&#x27;ve found for my &amp;#34;bone to bone, no cartilage&amp;#34; knee aches and pains!  </li>
            <li> Great, eases discomfort quickly and lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> It has a very pungent aroma, but doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like so many lotion/ointments.</li>
            <li> I just know that Tiger Balm seems to help me considerably ,where most  products of this kind don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tiger Balm for many years, and this one is the easiest, and you can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> I also received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li> Is easier to used in the pump form and spreads out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever, its the only rub that actually gives u relief from arthritis pain.....</li>
            <li> liquid rub is easy to apply and may work very well for some folks.  </li>
            <li> But be warned, it does have a very overpowering odor!!</li>
            <li> Plus shipping arrived exactly on time!</li>
            <li> and I am 75 years old!!!!!</li>
            <li> Anything that can do that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I feel the consumer would be far better served just getting some over the counter rub and save themselves a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> Ordered for lady co-worker with arthritis from fingers to shoulder on right arm.</li>
            <li> Delivery right on time.</li>
            <li> It goes on thicker and doesn&#x27;t evaporate as quickly, so I get much deeper and prolonged relief out of it.</li>
            <li> She says that is better absorbed than any of the same products on the market.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> This was my first order of the Tiger Balm.</li>
            <li> was my first time to order the arthritis  tiger balm rub</li>
            <li> The intense, sweetish smell clung to skin, clothing, bedclothes, everything!</li>
            <li> This one is for arthritis and only product I have been able to find that takes the pain away.</li>
            <li> and IT REALLY HELPED!</li>
            <li> This stuff works exactly as it says it will.  </li>
            <li> most likely it will go in garbage.</li>
            <li> However, I do use this as an adjunct to more mainstream medical pain treatment.  </li>
            <li> i also use it for my back which has always bothered me and it is better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this for temporary relief of muscle pain and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> was a bit skeptical at first, but once I used it, I found it to be a great relief!  </li>
            <li> But it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Love it for pain relief in shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> and I love just having it around for such occasions.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any person that has mild to severe</li>
            <li> When my shoulder is really bothering me I can rub some of this in and right away the relief begins.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t report on the efficacy of this product, because it has such a strong odor that I stopped using it after one application.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li> A little spendy, but works great for my various aches.</li>
            <li> The Ultra was good but hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It takes the soreness away from me, as I am getting ready to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> but nothing&#x27;s really helped her pain.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> This Tiger Balm Rub does not help as much as the patch, but it helps a LOT.  </li>
            <li> thank you so much jack.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It just burns the whole area where you rub it.</li>
            <li> and I loved the smell, but this stuff sucks for arthritis pain</li>
            <li> have tried many other rubs and this one truly helps my pain.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found any that works better than the other</li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way and did I say it works great?  </li>
            <li> Pleased to say this product totally dulled her pain for several hours.</li>
            <li> bought the patches from this same brand at a local store and they worked better than any of the others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No complaint</li>
            <li> Using Tiger Balm Patches help me a lot (better than prescription pain patches) but all patches break me out in a rash after a few days.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t last long and really has a strong smell until you wash off.</li>
            <li> It really smells great, but after a few days I noticed that the area I used the Tiger Balm on was covered in small raised bumps.</li>
            <li> This new product,  marketed for arthritis, shows some promise.  </li>
            <li> It does not cure it, but it does make it considerably bearable - thank you!</li>
            <li> it was the first thing that actually worked for my pain that was over-the-counter</li>
            <li> Yes, it has the chondrotin, glucosamine, and MSM, and a few other things, but something has made it more effective than anything else for a few of my massage clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> biggest / only issue for losing a star is that the pump does not seal, and to get it to seal, I must squirt a full pump out and make sure to screw it down tight.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my aching 60 year old knee</li>
            <li> It is a pretty small bottle, but I don&#x27;t think you really need to use much.</li>
            <li> Suffer with RA so pain is a constant companion but this rub helps so much.  </li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My niece swears by this product, but I guess my skin may be too sensitive to use it.</li>
            <li> the camphor &amp; menthol are double what is often found, but does not burn too much.</li>
            <li> I have used everything for my arthritis pain and this stuff is the only stuff I have found that really gets in and gives me pain relief when I&#x27;m hurting.</li>
            <li> My joint pain is internal so the balm doesn&#x27;t really work for my purpose.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent initially, but the scent does not last overly long.  </li>
            <li> I have to send it back, the scent is too strong for my athma, when I lay down it closes my airway.</li>
            <li> one more word is required to finish this review; how dumb.  </li>
            <li> I have had severe pain in my feet, knees, lower back since I was 3 years old ...</li>
            <li> but apparently they changed the ingredients</li>
            <li> Even though my hands felt like they were on fire, the tingle was more irritating than comforting like you expect from tiger balm products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for others looking for a topical application that offers local pain relief.</li>
            <li> In the area we live in the price of this product is comparable to other products of this type.</li>
            <li> balm at first feels like fire, but once it calms down, it brings a soothing relief to those knees and other joints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an active 62 yr old female, 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and 140 lbs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because she was having minor back and some joint pain</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t the pain relief is as long lasting as the cream.</li>
            <li> For sinus, I rub it all over the back of my neck and put a little on my chest and within a few minutes, I can breath better and the swelling, in the back of my neck, usually goes away within a few hours.</li>
            <li> Long time lover of tiger balm</li>
            <li> been promoting them as long as they&#x27;ve been promoting me &amp; now,</li>
            <li> So for my minor aches and pains I&#x27;ve used it to</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit different from the other products, though.</li>
            <li> As with any other product, there are individual differences at work.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very strong, but isn&#x27;t necessarily bad.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it tight enough once, and it ate away the vinyl/fake vinyl and plastics it got in contact with.</li>
            <li> and the regular was not warm enough.</li>
            <li> This is just as I expected for joint and muscle pain treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great believer in nostrums and potions, but this product came highly recommended by sources I respect.</li>
            <li> Try any of their other products instead.</li>
            <li> My mom swore by it and my aunt has extremely severe crippling arthritis</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t extremely pungent and it starts working on contact.  </li>
            <li> while greasy keeps the active ingredients in contact with the area longer  </li>
            <li> (if you are using it for something else you can just wash your hands) feel gross and icky.</li>
            <li> plus is this one leaves a less greasy feel,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my hands hurt, I just rub it on and the pain fades, in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> hence the missing star.</li>
            <li> A few girls at the gym said they almost puked and I should never apply it before I go.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for the bumps to go away after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste a squirt.</li>
            <li> This stiff just works.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my grandma who suffers from knee pain, as well as arthritis in her hands; and she said it has helped with the pain considerably.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item after reading the reviews but I have to say I am completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from arthritis and hate the cold weather, you will be able to use this arthiritis Balm Rub</li>
            <li> Stronger than the neck and shoulder rub but not as thick.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;ve ever had too much goldschlager you will hate this.</li>
            <li> IT COULD BE WORSE</li>
            <li> I have particularly annoying and painful arthritis in both thumbs and in my right index finger (the mouse finger, of course)</li>
            <li> I occasionally have very painful joints and this does wonders.</li>
            <li> The actual product does work, but the delivery is terrible.</li>
            <li> My mom puts this on before she sleeps and in the morning she said that the swelling decreased!</li>
            <li> I only wish I could use it on my hands, where the pain is the worst.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, unless you want to wear rubber gloves after applying, you can&#x27;t use it on your hands because it would probably end up in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Stinks but works for my torn rotator cuffs and bum hip.  </li>
            <li> It has helped to loosen my knee up, particularly in cold and damp weather.  </li>
            <li> Too bad,</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 65-year-old mother who has terrible arthritis pain in her fingers.</li>
            <li> but the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and does nothing for the pain.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis. It takes the soreness away from me, as I am getting ready to go to sleep. I could not survive a day without the tiger balm.</li>
            <li> Long time lover of tiger balm I&#x27;ve done it all with tiger balm been promoting them as long as they&#x27;ve been promoting me &amp; now, squirt squirt; awesome! Great ingredient concept; right for me right now. hope to see more squirts out there ladies</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> This is just as I expected for joint and muscle pain treatment. No complaint and I&#x27;ll buy this again if I need to.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 65-year-old mother who has terrible arthritis pain in her fingers. She&#x27;s been on every prescription drug and joint supplement you can imagine but nothing&#x27;s really helped her pain. Pleased to say this product totally dulled her pain for several hours. Anything that can do that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> tiger balm is the best</li>
            <li> I always buy it for my dad who has an arthritis and it works well on his knees. Thank you</li>
            <li> Its Ok but the smell is terrible. It does not go away and if I use it at night the smell keeps me awake. Does help with the pain though.</li>
            <li> A co-worker who was using the Tiger Balm Rub recommended I get it for my wife  who is suffering arthritic joint pain in her knees. It has been a great help in relieving  the pain. She has been recommending it to family and friends with similar problems.</li>
            <li> This was my first order of the Tiger Balm. I bought it for ankle and lower back pain. It seems to work for the most part and can get very warm!! But be warned, it does have a very overpowering odor!!</li>
            <li> The pain relief is amazing!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item after reading the reviews but I have to say I am completely disappointed. I feel the consumer would be far better served just getting some over the counter rub and save themselves a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> I like tiger balm and this was my first time to order the arthritis  tiger balm rub and I&#x27;m happy with it. I also received the product quickly.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> I have severe pain in my hips at night after going to bed. I am an active 62 yr old female, 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and 140 lbs. Tiger Balm Arthritis Rub seems to ease the pain so I can sleep better.</li>
            <li> Prince Of Peace - Arthritis Rub, 4 fl oz creams works the best out of any others under the name of Tiger Balm.  It is all natural ingredients &amp; it smells good too, like cinnamon!  I have had severe pain in my feet, knees, lower back since I was 3 years old ... none of the doctors or specialist have been able to figure it out.  If it weren&#x27;t for this product, there would be times I wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk or bear the pain.  It does not cure it, but it does make it considerably bearable - thank you!</li>
            <li> Superb product works very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought this for my mom because she was having minor back and some joint pain and it worked well. I will definitely buy again. Plus shipping arrived exactly on time! Perfectly happy with everything! 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t report on the efficacy of this product, because it has such a strong odor that I stopped using it after one application. The intense, sweetish smell clung to skin, clothing, bedclothes, everything! Too bad, but I can&#x27;t say anything good about it.</li>
            <li> Sure smells good.  Heats up the area that you apply it to.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Rub it in after shower in the morning. Pain gone for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> Works great!  This one is for arthritis and only product I have been able to find that takes the pain away.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;I would order again</li>
            <li> This is the best topical product I have found.  It really helps.</li>
            <li> Greatest product, on earth, for arthritis and sinus congestion. When my hands hurt, I just rub it on and the pain fades, in just a few minutes. For sinus, I rub it all over the back of my neck and put a little on my chest and within a few minutes, I can breath better and the swelling, in the back of my neck, usually goes away within a few hours. Use several times a day, when needed, for best results.</li>
            <li> Helps with my knee pain.</li>
            <li> Stinks but works for my torn rotator cuffs and bum hip.  Stronger than the neck and shoulder rub but not as thick.</li>
            <li> Have osteoarithitis and this product has been a big help to me with the pain, I use especially at night.</li>
            <li> Great, eases discomfort quickly and lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> I love tiger balm it was the first thing that actually worked for my pain that was over-the-counter and I loved the smell, but this stuff sucks for arthritis pain and it makes your hands (if you are using it for something else you can just wash your hands) feel gross and icky. I got no relief!!  Even though my hands felt like they were on fire, the tingle was more irritating than comforting like you expect from tiger balm products.</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps my achy legs. Only one drawback is the smell but it&#x27;s not a horrible one though. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great believer in nostrums and potions, but this product came highly recommended by sources I respect. I tried it on my aching 60 year old knee and IT REALLY HELPED! It didn&#x27;t cure the knee, but it reduced the pain I have when walking by about 60%...pretty good, I think. It has a very pungent aroma, but doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like so many lotion/ointments. I just know that Tiger Balm seems to help me considerably ,where most  products of this kind don&#x27;t do much. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like it very much but I was looking for the cream in the tube but I got this one it good but not as good as the one in the tube if you have that one please let me know . thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found helpful so far.</li>
            <li> excellent product that works better than the slightly harder cream or salve offered by tiger balm</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition. Ordered for lady co-worker with arthritis from fingers to shoulder on right arm. Puts on when she has a flare-up but the odor is too strong for her. I use regular Tiger Balm Ultra for lower back pain relief after yard mowing and I like the odor. There is no cure for arthritis but one can get relief with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I think it can help with any type of ache and pain. I bought it for my grandma who suffers from knee pain, as well as arthritis in her hands; and she said it has helped with the pain considerably. It is a pretty small bottle, but I don&#x27;t think you really need to use much. Just one pump would be good for each hand.</li>
            <li> Suffer with RA so pain is a constant companion but this rub helps so much.  Plan to continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  Has a somewhat pleasant smell; not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This stuff works exactly as it says it will.  I have rheumatoid arthritis, and this has eased pain in my ankles and hands.  I have even used it on my back when that has been acting up.  The smell is very strong, but isn&#x27;t necessarily bad.  It smells kind of minty with a trace of licorice.  I apologize to my coworkers when I use it and then have to go to work, but they say they don&#x27;t mind it.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Does relieve my back pain but the odor is not too pleasant...hence the missing star.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t last long and really has a strong smell until you wash off. The tiger balm that comes in the jars is much more effective.</li>
            <li> My massage clients love it -- including the smell.  Very effective.  I quit using the Tiger Balm ointment as this is easier to apply and does last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Thia ia the ONLY topical cream I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works on my joints/back. The smell is pleasant enough, too. I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> tiger balm in the pump is the best solution I have found for my arthritis pain . I have at times in my neck , my knee and my hip. It has a strong smell but my wife and I are used to it and it is away of letting her know I am hurting without saying anything. have tried many other rubs and this one truly helps my pain. try it ---you will like it</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Have used for years and it sure helps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most penetrating and effective muscle cream I&#x27;ve used.  Your skin burns after about 10 seconds and it continues to sink into the skin and move into the muscles.  It feels great for a long time!  Great massage lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tiger Balm for many years, and this one is the easiest, and you can really feel it working. It doesn&#x27;t stain like the red one does. The Ultra was good but hard to apply. and the regular was not warm enough. This pumper is creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought a tin of Tiger Balm when I was in Romania.  This is not even close......most likely it will go in garbage.</li>
            <li> It is great and really helpful!</li>
            <li> Excellent therapy for arthritis. It is Very effective. I Recomment it to everyone with arthritis or aches and pains, especially in the joints.</li>
            <li> works great for sore backs and necks</li>
            <li> Tiger Balm Arthritis Product works well but has a very strong smell after application. The apllicator nozzle would not close also.</li>
            <li> I love all the Tiger Balm products. It is nice to have a pump bottle, making use easier. The smell is a bit different from the other products, though.</li>
            <li> A+ great stuff. will help with a clogged nose. Try it in your steam room of sauna. Strong and pleasant scent. would again.</li>
            <li> Help my back pain a lot!</li>
            <li> I have osteoarthritis and am always looking for something to ease my aches and pains.  Arthritis Tiger Balm seems to help.  It has a strong scent initially, but the scent does not last overly long.  The scent also seems to open up my sinuses, so I have no objection to it at all.  I&#x27;ve shared a bottle with my sister who also has osteoarthritis.  Hoping it will also help her.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product! I occasionally have very painful joints and this does wonders. The only problem is the odor. It&#x27;s very strong. I don&#x27;t mind it, but I can&#x27;t say the same for the others in my house! Otherwise, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I could not find this pumper bottle of Tiger Balm in any of my local drug stores or discount stores.  I ordered on Amazon, got free shipping, got my product in a timely manner.  I like the feeling of the product &amp; its&#x27; interesting smell on my aches &amp; pains!</li>
            <li> is as good as any on the market. is it the best? don&#x27;t know. arthritis is severe. haven&#x27;t found any that works better than the other</li>
            <li> It is  a good  product. I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tiger Balm products for years with mostly good results.  This new product,  marketed for arthritis, shows some promise.  It has helped to loosen my knee up, particularly in cold and damp weather.  However, I do use this as an adjunct to more mainstream medical pain treatment.  As with any other product, there are individual differences at work.  For most artthritis sufferers, I can recommend that you give it a try.</li>
            <li> Runny. Smelly. Bottle doesn&#x27;t pump well, but leaks if it&#x27;s knocked over. Tiger Balm does great stuff, but this isn&#x27;t one of them. The actual product does work, but the delivery is terrible. Try any of their other products instead.</li>
            <li> I have a herniated disc and a disc budge with nerve damage in my neck from a car accident and this is the only thing that takes away my pain. Prescription level aspirin and pain relievers don&#x27;t come close to this. This stiff just works. Only drawback is the strong menthol smell. It doesn&#x27;t bother me because it does work but it may be too strong for some. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> A little spendy, but works great for my various aches. I like that it doesn&#x27;t burn like some products.</li>
            <li> I use this for all of my aches and pains. I have rheumatoid arthritis and my joints are in constant pain. This helps relieve some of the pain associated with my r/a.</li>
            <li> Great Ointment....for Sore Legs n muscles...USE Daily! Will KEPP Using n Buying!  Thanx, LesH</li>
            <li> it used to be great but apparently they changed the ingredients</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, especially on the knees.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the sports rub since it is in a pump form.  Is easier to used in the pump form and spreads out quickly. Dosent seem to be as strong but much better than anything else on the market.  Very strong smell but I like it.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!! I USE IT ON MY BACK AND HANDS. MY MOM BREAKS A VERTABRA EACH WEEK AND IT HELPS HER BACK WITH SORENESS. SMELLY BUT WORKS!</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and does nothing for the pain.</li>
            <li> Using Tiger Balm Patches help me a lot (better than prescription pain patches) but all patches break me out in a rash after a few days. This Tiger Balm Rub does not help as much as the patch, but it helps a LOT.  The Tiger Balm Rub gives you a cooling sensation while relieving your pain. I highly recommend this to any person that has mild to severe pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have sensitive skin &amp; I&#x27;ve had no problem using this Tiger Balm Rub.</li>
            <li> Helps greatly on my arthritis. i also use it for my back which has always bothered me and it is better than anything else I have tried. You just have to get acclimated to the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work as well as the patches did. If you make a patch out of plastic wrap maybe it would work better. It also has a very strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the patches from this same brand at a local store and they worked better than any of the others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for  my sister who swears by the product.  I gave it to her and she can&#x27;t quit raving about it.  Tiger Balm takes care of her arthritis pain and is in a handy pump bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband is a chef and on his feet all day.  He has osteoarthritis arthritis in both feet and ankles.  After being in the kitchen all day his feet and ankles stiffen up and he&#x27;s quite crippled up after getting home.  Rubbing the tiger balm on him helps reduce the pain and inflammation and helps him sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liquid rub is easy to apply and may work very well for some folks.  I&#x27;m glad we tried it but we&#x27;ll be going back to the Tiger Balm Sports Rub, 1.7-Ounce Tin (Pack of 4) because it seems to last longer and penetrate deeper to relieve his symptoms.</li>
            <li> Fixes up arthritis as good as anything I have ever tried - use it on my feet and ankles every day and can stay on feet all day without pain and I am 75 years old!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this for temporary relief of muscle pain and it seems to work pretty well. Easy to apply and not greasy. I would recommend this for others looking for a topical application that offers local pain relief.</li>
            <li> Love this prodict. I already use the extra strength on my ankles and all their products are great. I also like the smell</li>
            <li> so far this is the most helpful thing I&#x27;ve found for my &amp;#34;bone to bone, no cartilage&amp;#34; knee aches and pains!  definitely better than taking a bunch of oral pain pills!</li>
            <li> When I apply this upstairs my girlfriend can immediately tell from the kitchen downstairs, that is how strong the smell is. It is a cinnamon smell which I don&#x27;t mind but if you&#x27;ve ever had too much goldschlager you will hate this. A few girls at the gym said they almost puked and I should never apply it before I go. So I can only use it after the gym and before I shower so I can clean it off me before bed.</li>
            <li> TIGER BALM i s great product I&#x27;ve used the patches for about a month and it helped me a Igreat deal. Ive been usingit when ever I feel any aches. I have arthritis  in my knees and this helped me. I recomend this to anyone..</li>
            <li> My mom puts this on before she sleeps and in the morning she said that the swelling decreased! So thankful for this product!</li>
            <li> I bought Tiger Balm to help ease the arthritis pain in my shoulder. It really smells great, but after a few days I noticed that the area I used the Tiger Balm on was covered in small raised bumps. It took a few days for the bumps to go away after I stopped using it. I used it on my knee and the same thing happened, except the area became itchy and red. I never got to see if it worked to ease the arthritis pain. My niece swears by this product, but I guess my skin may be too sensitive to use it.</li>
            <li> This is pushed as an arthritis / joint rub. Yes, it has the chondrotin, glucosamine, and MSM, and a few other things, but something has made it more effective than anything else for a few of my massage clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Pro or con, the camphor &amp; menthol are double what is often found, but does not burn too much. I suppose that&#x27;s because its not in ointment form. Ointment (which this is not) while greasy keeps the active ingredients in contact with the area longer  (I know manufactures of Arnica had to reduce the amount of arnica in ointments because it kept it available too long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is this one leaves a less greasy feel,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest / only issue for losing a star is that the pump does not seal, and to get it to seal, I must squirt a full pump out and make sure to screw it down tight. I didn&#x27;t get it tight enough once, and it ate away the vinyl/fake vinyl and plastics it got in contact with. I wish it were a self sealing pump, and though not space saving &amp; increases breakage risks, I wish could be locked up so you don&#x27;t waste a squirt.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from arthritis and hate the cold weather, you will be able to use this arthiritis Balm Rub well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in the bedroom and put it on whenever I get achy!  There is a strong menthol aroma that comes from it.&lt;br /&gt;And, if you put it on and then go to bed, your linens will maintain the aroma of the menthol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm at first feels like fire, but once it calms down, it brings a soothing relief to those knees and other joints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical at first, but once I used it, I found it to be a great relief!  Especially in the colder months of the year!</li>
            <li> I like it because it works for me. I have used others but they did not come up to expectation.</li>
            <li> Very effective for minor aches and pains/</li>
            <li> ---its the best i could find to reduce  my wife,s pain in her back. we could use a larger bottle however. thank you so much jack.</li>
            <li> We were recommended to this product by a fellow co-worker about 15 years ago. We swear by it for sore muscles or to help loosen muscles before a run.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.</li>
            <li> I bought Tiger Balm for husbands achy back... he loves it. Used it and he had relief for hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Mom who has severe arthritis and now she can sleep at night. She loves the product.</li>
            <li> I have used everything for my arthritis pain and this stuff is the only stuff I have found that really gets in and gives me pain relief when I&#x27;m hurting. I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver! When my shoulder is really bothering me I can rub some of this in and right away the relief begins.</li>
            <li> Like all the others write, this stuff smells! But it works pretty well. I have severe psoriatic arthritis and I don&#x27;t want to always be using pain medications. I use the Tiger Balm with a heating pad and it helps. I only wish I could use it on my hands, where the pain is the worst. Unfortunately, unless you want to wear rubber gloves after applying, you can&#x27;t use it on your hands because it would probably end up in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks. This is the best stuff ever, its the only rub that actually gives u relief from arthritis pain.....i give it 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> My joint pain is internal so the balm doesn&#x27;t really work for my purpose.</li>
            <li> It gave me the relief (temporarily) that I wanted, and I was pleased  with the feel and gexture of the liquid.</li>
            <li> I just ordered and tried this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of TB, since my issue IS arthritis pain. This product works wonders, but I still prefer the original &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;. It goes on thicker and doesn&#x27;t evaporate as quickly, so I get much deeper and prolonged relief out of it. However, this Rub works good too. I recommend!</li>
            <li> My mom love this. She says that is better absorbed than any of the same products on the market. Drawback is that is mentholated.</li>
            <li> I have particularly annoying and painful arthritis in both thumbs and in my right index finger (the mouse finger, of course) and I feel that this rub has eased the pain. It does have an odor, which my cat is not fond of, but I stay away from her when I put it on!  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice fell. Delivery right on time.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE&lt;br /&gt;STILL HAVE PAIN&lt;br /&gt;MAYBE IT COULD BE WORSE</li>
            <li> Instant relief from pain. I love tiger balm products, have been using for years.</li>
            <li> This works great!!!  Very little goes a long way and did I say it works great?  It makes fibromyalgia pain easier to handle, especially before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the ordering and receiving of this product but didn&#x27;t feel like it really helped me.</li>
            <li> I have to send it back, the scent is too strong for my athma, when I lay down it closes my airway. I want a refund or exchange exchange.</li>
            <li> This cream is fire. It just burns the whole area where you rub it. BUT is good for the purpose of calming any pain on ligaments.</li>
            <li> Love it for pain relief in shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> it best thing that work on me so I will keep order it as lone u got on amazon</li>
            <li> works better for me than my wife --got it in hopes it would help her --but only ok for her --works great for me however..</li>
            <li> The Tiger Balm Rub spreads easily and is marvelous for sore muscles and probably for minor arthritis discomfort. The scent of the Tiger Balm Rub isn&#x27;t as strong as the Tiger Balm Cream and I don&#x27;t the pain relief is as long lasting as the cream. In the area we live in the price of this product is comparable to other products of this type.</li>
            <li> The women in my family love this stuff.  My mom swore by it and my aunt has extremely severe crippling arthritis and she loves it too.  So for my minor aches and pains I&#x27;ve used it to and I love just having it around for such occasions. The smell isn&#x27;t extremely pungent and it starts working on contact.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> smells too strong but appears to work well.  just wish they made something this effective without the strong smell.  one more word is required to finish this review; how dumb.  one would think that the fewer words the better.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Tiger for years...  I wanted to try this and have been very pleased.  Love the pump!</li>
            <li> I love Tiger Balm and am using this rub to see if it specifically helps arthritic knees.  I&#x27;ve got my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> This product was somewhat effective. I have noticed some helpful results.</li>
            <li> I like this brand more than most.......you can feel it doing something......keep rubbing it in....I&#x27;ve bought this before.</li>
            <li> Tiger Balm is the best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
    </ol>
