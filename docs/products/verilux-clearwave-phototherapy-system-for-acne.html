    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>But the best part is: no side effects!</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t know this is the best way to go about</li>
            <li>The Verilux Clearwave Phototherapy System for Acne is awesome</li>
            <li>product works great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the construction seemed great.</li>
            <li>I am still happy with how it does help with acne</li>
            <li>Honestly, I like it BEST for the wrinkle reduction, which it is NOT intended for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know that I&#x27;m in it to win it and</li>
            <li>I guess we can say we are not part of the 80% who experienced successful results.  </li>
            <li>wrinkle reduction, which is most welcome!  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil + Verilux seems to be a really good combo though.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil + Verilux seems to be a really good combo though.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this item a fair shake.</li>
            <li>Our yonger twin \\&quot;S\\&quot; is not as fair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still a good value, something to consider.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Chances are you probably ARE superior to them.</li>
            <li>Never seen so many people with great skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a cure, but it is certainly a good tool to keep handy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a cure, but it is certainly a good tool to keep handy.</li>
            <li>but they need to design a better battery for the $35.00 price tag for a replacement!ement!</li>
            <li>I have been using this device for about 1 month and love it!</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be super happy as I am! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>once the bulb warms up it feels kind of soothing...</li>
            <li>Not trusting my own eye, I asked my wife, and she too didn&#x27;t see an improvement.</li>
            <li>Head Gets Warm -</li>
            <li>Head Gets Warm -</li>
            <li>The manufacturer claims 600 is the maximum that the LEDs can be guaranteed to be 100% effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We are a 1 income household so for me, this is a nice treat as we can&#x27;t afford going to the spa to get facials every week</li>
            <li>kind of treatment is painless without the use of any chemicals.  </li>
            <li>- I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I had hoped for the type I have but am continuing to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having acne--real acne, not a lone zit once or twice a year-- is kind of like being obese.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and is built well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, before I bought this device, I was using the Ansr beam which I had great success with.</li>
            <li>Charging Light Is Bright</li>
            <li>- You should charge this in the bathroom because the light is really bright when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li>So far, however, I will say that I am very impressed and plan to buy a replacement head/batteries when they are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: After a good, full two weeks of use, I can confirm that this thing is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>: After a good, full two weeks of use, I can confirm that this thing is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Most people are vegetarian, or rides bicycle to commute to work and school or vegan.</li>
            <li>:) it has that clock.</li>
            <li>:) what do you think of this product?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably this is for a more patient person.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good success with Glycolics and will just use those.</li>
            <li>but when the weather changes to something more seasonable my skin becomes irritated, mostly in the area I shave.</li>
            <li>This device is better made than most, although I did have some problems with it staying on and operating as it</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>That was ok.</li>
            <li>And the best part was that there wasn&#x27;t any initial breakout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if more time allows them to improve as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin feels/looks better.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if more time allows them to improve as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin feels/looks better.</li>
            <li>Before you buy, be sure that you know what type of acne</li>
            <li>do not dislike it, but I am not in love with it, either.</li>
            <li>OK, so i got the Verilux Clearwave because i work in a salon</li>
            <li>pasting your magical home remedy, or your spam website, or whatever it is</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no home remedy, drug or voodoo magic that I don&#x27;t know about, but people are relentless in their pursuit of giving me unsolicited advice (after they&#x27;ve mocked me and refused to give me a raise, of course).</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have to make sure that you don&#x27;t get better than them as the result of advice they gave you to feel better about themselves.</li>
            <li>They want to feel better about themselves, whether it&#x27;s by feeling smarter or feeling more knowledgeable than YOU.</li>
            <li>Assuming you don&#x27;t die of boredom or frustration during use, you may want more than tape holding the battery in place.</li>
            <li>The max I seem to be able to get is 3 sessions before it goes into HP mode.</li>
            <li>LET IT BE KNOWN that I will not hesitate to amend this review and shred this product if I do not get better results than this.</li>
            <li>I think a better alternative is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Do not trust these people who claim it&#x27;s safe for your eyes, because the fact is we don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>My doctor said LEDs used this way are OK.</li>

            <li>My doctor said LEDs used this way are OK.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have pretty good skin</li>
            <li>Portland Oregon where I live, everyone has great skin.</li>
            <li>So far, we&#x27;re happy with the results and glad we tried this.</li>
            <li>The head doesn&#x27;t get too hot but it will warm up if you use it on more than one or two areas for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head doesn&#x27;t get too hot but it will warm up if you use it on more than one or two areas for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She likes the light better than a rotating cleansing brush because it doesn&#x27;t aggravate her already irritated skin.</li>
            <li>While we found this to be easy to set up it is a bit of a hassle to use, you have to hold it</li>
            <li>Battery depletes very quickly.</li>
            <li>Overheats too easily.</li>
            <li>I can easily see doing 12 sessions on my face and jawline alone.</li>
            <li>Please make sure to read the directions, to make sure the device is right for you before buying.</li>
            <li>This kind of malarkey is what I thought of when I first looked at LED skin lights.</li>

            <li>Despite the cost, often they seem cheaply made, and break easily.</li>
            <li>but as I said, I&#x27;m very impressed with even the minor improvements that I think this will be worth the price of replacement heads and batteries when they are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>no one said it would be cheap, easy or endurable.</li>

            <li>Most products will dry my skin out, so I&#x27;ll have to skip a couple of days, but with the VERILUX, I&#x27;ve experienced none of the side effects that I experience with the lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light couldn&#x27;t be easier to use: charge it overnight in the stand,</li>
            <li>Usability is as important as whether the product works or not -</li>
            <li>light therapy has been a miracle worker for me</li>
            <li>But if you have an occasional pimple, I think it works great.</li>
            <li>wand works by shining UV light onto the pimple, which penetrates the epidermis, and kills the bacteria that causes the acne.</li>
            <li>Each treatment consists of holding the wand on the pimple and it shines the light on it for 3-minutes, so it shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li>* 600 Treatments - You must replace the light head after 600 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light Head Must Come In Contact With Skin</li>
            <li>Dislike the fit of the goggles</li>
            <li>so I got light system for her to try.</li>
            <li>The light wand has improved her skin without the drying side effects.</li>
            <li>Since it is working, she&#x27;s going to continue using the light</li>
            <li>The system comes with goggles to protect the eyes from the light.</li>
            <li>It might be the light wave or something.</li>
            <li>We are through the looking-glass with bizarre technology here, folks.</li>
            <li>600 uses may sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s 600-3 minute sessions.</li>
            <li>In 10 years, if you are reading a review I am writing whilst in the midst of a brave battle with skin cancer or Arnegram-Clark syndrome, refer back to this review.</li>
            <li>think if you are on the fence about a light therapy skin device, you should take the plunge, but not with this product.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;C. Chemical free, drug free and won&#x27;t bleach your linens and clothing</li>
            <li>and I just can&#x27;t write enough great things about this</li>
            <li>Our oldest twin \\&quot;R\\&quot; has a more fair complextion and his results were noticable the next day.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good product, but it might be better for teen&#x27;s than adults.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m arrogant and I think I&#x27;m better than other people because I use makeup and want to feel attractive.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend a good facial brush, scrub and great facial wash in conjunction with this product</li>
            <li>I want to make Verilux eat this, but they probably all live in Kenya and are already eating exotic food products with President Obama&#x27;s cousins (WOOF!).</li>

            <li>/&gt;During this week I noticed a significant decrease in oil production in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During this week I noticed a significant decrease in oil production in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Verilux is a familiar brand in our house.  </li>
            <li>The goggles that come with it seem to work pretty well, although I feel like they could be better.</li>
            <li>So along comes the Verilux which i was really excited about</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I think this was good idea using science behind it and works great with design that recharges.</li>
            <li>The device did not want to remain on for the full cycle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product even advertised that it does that, but I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product even advertised that it does that, but I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>When I was a teenager, when no amount of washing helped enough, I would have loved a chance to try a multi-pronged approach, including this.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen good enough results YET to recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li>After 3 or so treatments, my Verilux overheats and I have to let it cool off before I can continue using it.</li>
            <li>It would take all night to cover my whole face, and for results they recommending treating more than once a day</li>
            <li>Also, by not being able to really move it because of the touch sensor it just dries out my skin</li>
            <li>want to make sure you understand that no matter how much you think you can help by clicking the comment button and copying/</li>
            <li>the full</li>
            <li>If you break out around your nose, good luck making the light stay on long enough to do any good.</li>
            <li>It means the device is in Heat Protection mode--you need to allow a device designed to generate heat to cool off.</li>
            <li>It actually really helps, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, more toned, and looks so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I use it as flash light right now and auto seconds counter.</li>
            <li>I have to honestly tell you that after only 3 days of treatment twice daily, the results are remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Even if the battery life was better, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this 4 or more times in a row because the device will overheat and automatically shut itself down until it cools off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think, for me, I am going to look into getting one of the older model Verilux lamps that you sit in front of as it seems like it would be faster than treating so many areas 3 minutes at a time, with this treatment head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product worked like a charm on the mild forehead breakouts.</li>
            <li>Overheats quick.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne problems, with mild blackheads.</li>
            <li>and I would guess this has a lot to do with helping with the mild acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been healing rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay charged that well and battery dies quickly.</li>
            <li>On one hand, that&#x27;s nice, as I don&#x27;t yet have many wrinkles, but on the other I still get some pimples, whiteheads, etc.  </li>
            <li>I do think it is preventing new outbreaks more than treating existing pimples.  </li>
            <li>This is a great solution for acne if you want something that helps prevent and it not full of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>The Verilux Clearwave Acne System is a handheld device that delivers timed \\&quot;doses\\&quot; of blue light that studies have shown to be effective in treating certain types of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell when this thing keeps choking on its own heating sensors and uses a battery that has ADD.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell when this thing keeps choking on its own heating sensors and uses a battery that has ADD.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silent (except for the beeps) and gets warm but not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s rarely any sun and when it happens people come out to not to expose themselves to sun but to workout and play sports.</li>
            <li>has given a wonderful review talking about the science behind this product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, saying it helps moderate may even be too kind.</li>
            <li>In fact, saying it helps moderate may even be too kind.</li>
            <li>It was only mildly effective for me.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the overnight success I get with 5% benzoyl peroxide cream for infrequent acne.  </li>
            <li>I suspect some initial success comes from the lightly-warming affect of the light which might melt some oil buildup much like a warm washcloth</li>
            <li>So for the first 600, you can calculate the cost per dose (0.25), per day (0.75) per spot, per week (1.50-2.25) per spot, and and full course (6.00-24.75) (2-3 times per week, 4-11 weeks).  </li>
            <li>Initially, it seems like it could be effective for the price</li>
            <li>This unit, however, is a nice compliment that can be used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It clearly indicates it is NOT for Rosacea, which many of us 40+ people suffer from.  </li>
            <li>This extends to informing me that I have a problem in the first place, as if I didn&#x27;t notice the redness, inflammation, and bumps ON MY FACE IN A SOCIETY FULL OF MIRRORS.</li>
            <li>If it can affect people taking thyroid medication, that tells me this light is going more than skin deep.</li>
            <li>If it can affect people taking thyroid medication, that tells me this light is going more than skin deep.</li>
            <li>The most frequently reported drawback being time invested in treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have used Tria products and yes, it is time-consuming but well worth</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>then its going to turn right off.</li>
            <li>, go right now, and order this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not interested in making you better; they&#x27;re interested in making THEM better.</li>
            <li>Overall, this seems like a pretty good system, albeit at a prett high price.</li>
            <li>The intense blue light activates chemicals inside the Propionibacterium acnes known as porphyrins, which are organic compounds that have very intense absorption bands in the visible region; hence they respond to light by producing free radicals, which are atoms with unpaired electrons.</li>
            <li>The next day, even though the pimple was still red, I could feel that the swelling had greatly subsided and the area wasn&#x27;t as tender to the touch.</li>
            <li>Ansr is next on my list, and after that, I may go on to MIT for experimental radioactive treatment that will make me have babies with nine heads, or possibly to a good old-fashioned snake oil salesman.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t use chemicals and it just light a flashlight with special blue LEDs, but the manual does state a lengthy list of precautions to avoid if pregnant, taking certain medications or topical creams, or certain kind of acne that you must take heed of.  </li>
            <li>and i can move it around my face very much.</li>
            <li>I will update my review once I have more treatments under my belt and if I get my hands on the red treatment</li>

            <li>First, the VERILUX is NOT RECOMMENDED for use on severe Nodular or Cystic acne.</li>
            <li>- I guessthis is a safety feature but the light head will not turn on if it&#x27;s not in direct contact with skin.</li>
            <li>I took off one star because of the price and the fact that you must buy replacement heads in the future.this is a safety feature but the light head will not turn on if it&#x27;s not in direct contact with skin.</li>
            <li>But that would have been OK if it actually worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consequently for those who would like to blast their entire face, you won&#x27;t be able to do it all in one sitting.</li>
            <li>I began to treat, as the directions suggest, the same areas two-three times a day to see if it made things even better.</li>
            <li>More of the same results.</li>

            <li>The manual provides more extensive explanation of what is covered and what is not.  </li>
            <li>I plugged this on and docked it on the charger overnight the first time I unboxed it.  </li>
            <li>The instruction guide gives more specific info on what types of acne it is designed for.</li>
            <li>We have twin sons who are 14, who have been battling moderate to more severe acne for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>First off let me say the product works.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to spend a lot of money on a skin product, I&#x27;d probably go with the Clarisonic first.</li>
            <li>and there where a treatment works at first, then I develop a resistance to it.</li>
            <li>You will be passed over for promotions, or not get jobs in the first place, people won&#x27;t go on dates with you based on it, people won&#x27;t want to help you when you need it--</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve tried their way and it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t follow their exact regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a red if I can ever get this thing to work, but it sure won&#x27;t be from this brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;11/17/2012 EDIT THE FIRST</li>
            <li>More edits to follow, but I am going to get a different device when I run out of uses on this.alcohol between uses.</li>

            <li>More edits to follow, but I am going to get a different device when I run out of uses on this.</li>
            <li>I get most hormonal acne and stopped using all topical treatments about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>What is does do, is clear the skin from bacteria in a fast, and easy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems very solid and is very straightforward to use.</li>
            <li>have had great results with the VERILUX CLEARWAVE ACNE TREATMENT WAND and find that it is a great alternative to acne medications that contain Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid and other harsh ingredients that can dry skin out,</li>
            <li>I think it does require a little bit more commitment than using any of the over the counter offerings currently available.  </li>
            <li>Since the recommended times that you do treatments per day is up to 3xs, depending on the severity of your acne, to do 2 cheeks it takes 12 hours (including the wait time to recharge and cool down)TO COMPLETE ONE TREATMENT!</li>
            <li>manufacturer reports studies have shown an 80% success rate, which is pretty high, but remember that is for the duration of 4-11 weeks.  </li>
            <li>the light heads are actually kind of hard to find....odd as that seems to be how this product makes</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;ll come out with a more compact version that is able to reach the \\&quot;hard to get to\\&quot; areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;D. Detects contact with the skin and dispenses a powerful, acne-clearing 3-minute application of therapeutic blue light to the affected area</li>
            <li>She has tried many various drugstore and prescription acne medications before and while some have helped, the side effect of most of them was very dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>It is a little frustrating, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be able to come up with a pretty good routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Her skin is still not perfectly clear, but it has made enough of a difference that people who hadn&#x27;t seen her in a while commented on how good she looked.</li>
            <li>You have to hold it on a pimple for an allotted period of time which can become cumbersome if you are working a large area.</li>
            <li>If you only have one zit - that is just fine.  </li>
            <li>think the blue light works very well for certain types of acne.</li>
            <li>My breakouts were huge, too, taking several weeks to heal.</li>
            <li>It uses blue light to conduct photodynamic therapy, or PDT, that uses properties of sunlight without the harmful ultraviolet rays.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really share it, who wants someone else&#x27;s face grease.</li>
            <li>The head that comes with it is blue light.  </li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t like to expose themselves too much to sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve subsequently gone for professional light therapy and the outcome is well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>I gave up after four nights of using it because it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolute miracle for someone who has struggled with monthly acne for 15 years with no relief.</li>
            <li>especially adult</li>
            <li>However, I recommend applying some sort of heavy-duty anti-aging product (maybe even a red light treatment, which is recommended) immediately afterwards to avoid wrinkling of the skin.</li>
            <li>I am still very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As an adult, I find faster success with the creams.  </li>
            <li>so you can just let it lay gently instead of holding it for 9 minutes for 3 spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t have much difference</li>
            <li>and my wife also didn&#x27;t experience much difference.  </li>
            <li>am guessing this technology works as I haven&#x27;t really had the patience or the real requirement to use it.</li>
            <li>The unit itself seems very well put together.</li>
            <li>But this really does work.</li>
            <li>It is a three-min blue light treatment.</li>
            <li>I really expected more for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m not too concerned about needing red light therapy at this point.</li>
            <li>suppose this shouldn&#x27;t surprise me in America, where everyone becomes an expert ready for punditry on cable news whenever they think they see a problem.</li>
            <li>People see the rash on your face, and suddenly everyone&#x27;s a dermatologist who has the precise solution--</li>
            <li>This thing kills germs on my skin, but it allows stuff to prosper on the very area which claims to kill the bacteria?</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, it cost way too much to just use as a flashlight</li>
            <li>There also does seem to be research that backs up the claim that this blue LED light will kill acne bacteria.</li>
            <li>B005XSPD3S BrightPad BT-L84 Acne Light]], especially if you want to also try red light for its healing and anti-aging properties.</li>

            <li>/&gt;The nice thing about the Verilux, compared to the Tanda Zap, is that the treatment head is larger, so you can treat a bigger area in one shot.  </li>
            <li>Just light up your 3 favorite problem spots, throw it on the charger, and later on that day do some other areas.</li>
            <li>The verilux product does not work near as effectively as the other lights.</li>
            <li>I use Cetaphil cleanser because I have very sensitive skin, but sometimes I feel like Cetaphil isn&#x27;t strong enough to combat my skin problems.</li>

            <li>(yes, after 1 - 3 min cycle) I have been checking reviews from other sites, and there are many complaints about battery life.</li>
            <li>My acne has not gotten any better by using this product but has with other lights.</li>
            <li>It gets to the root cause to kill the bacteria, for certain kinds of mild to moderate acne, and results in 4-11 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product five times so far (I only use it once a day, right before bed), and it appears to be helping me with my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>I also feel like this is another special treat for me because of the same reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know they think they&#x27;re being helpful, but do people with clear skin just never get tired of the sound of their own voice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing is pretty self-explanatory as far as assembly and charging go.</li>
            <li>They do not make a perfect seal naturally, and this just felt really awkward to me.</li>
            <li>Another reason is less sun exposure which inflames any pore clog much more and increase sebum to come out of skin because of sun exposure.</li>
            <li>Some areas of my skin began to look significantly better while others seemed less effected.</li>
            <li>Some areas of my skin began to look significantly better while others seemed less effected.</li>
            <li>The more severe the acne, though, the LESS of an effect I saw from the device.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad that I spent the $50 to try the Tanda Zap before trying this, so I knew what to expect as far as clearing capabilities and sensation (</li>
            <li>I like the Clearwave better than the Ansr because, as another reviewer stated, it has a larger head and you can treat a larger patch of skin at one time, so</li>
            <li>It says not to use it if you take antihistamines, which I do occasionally when my PBS flares up, because they make you light sensitive.  </li>
            <li>my forehead with smallish classic whitehead pimples, and my chin where I get ingrown hairs and stuff from shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>main issue I have with this is how it requires you to see nothing during the procedure, as the googles won&#x27;t let you.</li>
            <li>It claims in studies to report 80% for the mild to moderate acne it targets.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for mild acne breakouts, and maintaining a daily skin treatment regimen.  </li>
            <li>Basically it&#x27;s for mild to moderate acne and not recommended for someone with severe nodule acne or severe cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Most Victorian medical stuff did not have any science to back it up.</li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry.</li>

            <li>The whole head has to be in contact with your skin to activate, and it seems to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I can highly recommend the Clearwave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this does work I think the price to maintain this is a bit high.</li>
            <li>They think there is a one zit fits all solution for what can be a highly individualized problem, and nothing you have ever done before their advice counts.</li>
            <li>The Verilux head has to be directly in contact with the skin on all parts of the head for the light to stay on, so unless it is on a flat surface of your face (forehead or cheeks...or sometimes chin)</li>
            <li>HP does not mean that Harry Potter has arrived to zap your acne.</li>
            <li>This is about my right to the pursuit of happiness, and the society of mediocrity that tells me I should settle for less and lower my expectations.</li>
            <li>overall opinion after only a little more than 3 weeks is that this is a great little gadget.</li>

            <li>Now, on the shaving issues- not so much, but really there&#x27;s only so much this sort of treatment can do with a ingrown hair-</li>
            <li>But, with that being said, it&#x27;s still probably more effective than most oral/topical treatments, and without the nasty side effects.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now, and it seems like I&#x27;ve had more break-outs</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep working with it for a few more months and see how it goes and update this review.</li>
            <li>TWO: after using the device pretty regularly, I decided that my face wasn&#x27;t going to react negatively to the LED light and that it might actually be helping my skin look better.</li>
            <li>Will light therapy stand the test of time, or will I move on to other voodoo products?</li>

            <li>my Clearwave quits after 600 uses, I think I&#x27;ll spring for the Aurora rather than continue to buy new heads.</li>
            <li>Since this is a long-term acne treatment system, I thought it would make sense to update my review periodically with my new findings, praises, critiques, discoveries, and results.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ll update here when something new happens, or when I finish my 600 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ll update here when something new happens, or when I finish my 600 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just so I could get my hands on something new, seemed a bit unreasonable, so I&#x27;ve been using it for about four weeks</li>
            <li>I would never have purchased this item if the marketing dept. had made the customer very clear once opened it cannot be returned.</li>
            <li>also found the charger to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Another thing, 3 minutes per application is not that long, but if you have more than one, you can easily spend half an hour or more; then multiply that 3 times a day and you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li>You can also treat multiple areas, but I did notice that after 5 \\&quot;doses\\&quot; in one shot, my Verilux Clearwave gave me the code that meant it had gotten too hot, so I couldn&#x27;t do my whole face and neck, but could do considerably more area than I could with the very small treatment head on the Tanda Zap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin and type of acne is different, so it will likely work better on some than others.</li>
            <li>And the lights animate, going up and down, but the light will go out once it&#x27;s completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin is pretty sensitive, and just about everything, which is why I occasionally get blemishes.</li>
            <li>We are thrilled with the initial results and are anxious to see how this goes as time moves forward.</li>
            <li>I used the Verilux every day and even though it is not painful, it is extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li>I understand not wanting to use drugs or chemicals but honestly for us its just easier to wipe spots with antispetic and dry up in a few days.</li>
            <li>Nothing too life-changing, when it says it only helps mild to moderate they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li>Nothing too life-changing, when it says it only helps mild to moderate they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li>It might be a good idea to get a small light for the little corners and use this one for larger areas, but that&#x27;s assuming this thing actually works, and we are not done agonizing through this just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This device is for people with acne, but only certain types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly report back if I can ever get this thing to stay on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly report back if I can ever get this thing to stay on</li>
            <li>They make full spectrum lights which I love as if it brings sunlight in your house, particularly in the winter months when it is too cold to go</li>
            <li>This can be a frustration for the forehead and nose area, which are more curvy and less flat.</li>
            <li>I get occasional breakouts and alcohol or other typical treatments work fairly well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well with my Clarsonic to clear up my forehead breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much acne anymore, but occasionally it happens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as skin clearing-</li>
            <li>so you can use the wand near your temples.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li>This was an experimental period.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was also surprised that it needs to be charged every day.  </li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter has been using the Clearwave system for about 3 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>As far as the battery charge, we charged it for 12 hours before using it like the instruction sheet said.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not going to work for very severe acne (or</li>
            <li>I purchased this to assist with a form of adult acne that I have.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve stuck with it this far, you understand my frustration.</li>
            <li>I guess I have sensitive skin and have discontinued the use because of this reason.</li>
            <li>You can only get 4 -3 min treatments out of 1 charge, so if you have more than a few spots to treat, you have to recharge (this can be a pain)</li>
            <li>Alas, it wasn&#x27;t that effective in our case.</li>
            <li>Wait about a minute for it to cool down and use it again on another bunch of zits.</li>
            <li>But when I say it helps, I mean it is not the magical solution all of us dealing with acne are dreaming of.  </li>
            <li>I do see a positive effect in reducing acne, but not a profound effect.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you are using any prescription product such as Retin-A or other medications that cause hypersensitivity to UV light, you might get burned or rashes from this</li>
            <li>Now of course since I have hit my fifth decade, I don&#x27;t have the kind of serious acne that hit me as a teen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A. Painlessly destroys acne-causing bacteria in skin pores without harming surrounding tissue&lt;br /&gt;B. Cleared by the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne, this easy-to-use device is rechargeable, portable and ergonomically designed with single button operation</li>
            <li>Having said that, if I had known about the Sirius Aurora before I purchased the Clearwave, I would have purchased that one instead, because the heads on the Clearwave last for 600 uses of 3 minutes each, then you have to buy a new head for $35.</li>
            <li>New ones are not emerging, ones already swollen appear to have stopped in their tracks, and the red patches seem to have gotten a healing boost.</li>
            <li>Not one new red splotch, bump or cyst.</li>

            <li>And, following the directions, your skin will STAY clear!</li>
            <li>The battery charge has held pretty well unlike some other users have found.</li>
            <li>There is also a red light (\\&quot;soothing\\&quot;) head available from Verilux (though as of last week they were completely out of them and they were not sure when they would be back in stock) which appeals to me as I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have acne and my skin is starting to show signs of aging (a childhood spent at the beach getting sun poisoning did not help!)...</li>
            <li>It says it can take a few weeks to work, that seems so odd to me, since the type of acne it treats is the kind that clears up give a bit of regular face washing anyway.</li>

            <li>blue light works in small area.</li>

            <li>She has used it for several weeks and so far there has been some improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li>However I seem to have adult acne all over my face and this device only covers an area about the size of a fifty cent piece.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the band could be better designed, but it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li>I did, however, feel like my face was less oily and a few spots did seem more evenly toned.</li>
            <li>The indicator light may go off, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t still charging.</li>
            <li>I have not had a single new breakout in any area of treatment.</li>

            <li>Although if I miss a night once in a while its not a big deal, but if I try to use it every other night, I don&#x27;t get much results.</li>
            <li>For me, it was definitely not or minimally effective with only a few treatments, and only mildly effective longer term.  </li>

            <li> But the best part is: no side effects!</li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t know this is the best way to go about</li>
            <li> The Verilux Clearwave Phototherapy System for Acne is awesome</li>
            <li> product works great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the construction seemed great.</li>
            <li> I am still happy with how it does help with acne</li>
            <li> Honestly, I like it BEST for the wrinkle reduction, which it is NOT intended for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know that I&#x27;m in it to win it and</li>
            <li> I guess we can say we are not part of the 80% who experienced successful results.  </li>
            <li> wrinkle reduction, which is most welcome!  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil + Verilux seems to be a really good combo though.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil + Verilux seems to be a really good combo though.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this item a fair shake.</li>
            <li> Our yonger twin \\&quot;S\\&quot; is not as fair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still a good value, something to consider.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Chances are you probably ARE superior to them.</li>
            <li> Never seen so many people with great skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a cure, but it is certainly a good tool to keep handy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a cure, but it is certainly a good tool to keep handy.</li>
            <li> but they need to design a better battery for the $35.00 price tag for a replacement!ement!</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for about 1 month and love it!</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be super happy as I am! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> once the bulb warms up it feels kind of soothing...</li>
            <li> Not trusting my own eye, I asked my wife, and she too didn&#x27;t see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Head Gets Warm -</li>
            <li> Head Gets Warm -</li>
            <li> The manufacturer claims 600 is the maximum that the LEDs can be guaranteed to be 100% effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We are a 1 income household so for me, this is a nice treat as we can&#x27;t afford going to the spa to get facials every week</li>
            <li> kind of treatment is painless without the use of any chemicals.  </li>
            <li> - I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I had hoped for the type I have but am continuing to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having acne--real acne, not a lone zit once or twice a year-- is kind of like being obese.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and is built well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, before I bought this device, I was using the Ansr beam which I had great success with.</li>
            <li> Charging Light Is Bright</li>
            <li> - You should charge this in the bathroom because the light is really bright when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> So far, however, I will say that I am very impressed and plan to buy a replacement head/batteries when they are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : After a good, full two weeks of use, I can confirm that this thing is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> : After a good, full two weeks of use, I can confirm that this thing is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Most people are vegetarian, or rides bicycle to commute to work and school or vegan.</li>
            <li> :) it has that clock.</li>
            <li> :) what do you think of this product?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably this is for a more patient person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good success with Glycolics and will just use those.</li>
            <li> but when the weather changes to something more seasonable my skin becomes irritated, mostly in the area I shave.</li>
            <li> This device is better made than most, although I did have some problems with it staying on and operating as it</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> That was ok.</li>
            <li> And the best part was that there wasn&#x27;t any initial breakout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if more time allows them to improve as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin feels/looks better.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if more time allows them to improve as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin feels/looks better.</li>
            <li> Before you buy, be sure that you know what type of acne</li>
            <li> do not dislike it, but I am not in love with it, either.</li>
            <li> OK, so i got the Verilux Clearwave because i work in a salon</li>
            <li> pasting your magical home remedy, or your spam website, or whatever it is</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no home remedy, drug or voodoo magic that I don&#x27;t know about, but people are relentless in their pursuit of giving me unsolicited advice (after they&#x27;ve mocked me and refused to give me a raise, of course).</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have to make sure that you don&#x27;t get better than them as the result of advice they gave you to feel better about themselves.</li>
            <li> They want to feel better about themselves, whether it&#x27;s by feeling smarter or feeling more knowledgeable than YOU.</li>
            <li> Assuming you don&#x27;t die of boredom or frustration during use, you may want more than tape holding the battery in place.</li>
            <li> The max I seem to be able to get is 3 sessions before it goes into HP mode.</li>
            <li> LET IT BE KNOWN that I will not hesitate to amend this review and shred this product if I do not get better results than this.</li>
            <li> I think a better alternative is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Do not trust these people who claim it&#x27;s safe for your eyes, because the fact is we don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> My doctor said LEDs used this way are OK.</li>

            <li> My wife and I have pretty good skin</li>
            <li> Portland Oregon where I live, everyone has great skin.</li>
            <li> So far, we&#x27;re happy with the results and glad we tried this.</li>
            <li> The head doesn&#x27;t get too hot but it will warm up if you use it on more than one or two areas for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head doesn&#x27;t get too hot but it will warm up if you use it on more than one or two areas for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She likes the light better than a rotating cleansing brush because it doesn&#x27;t aggravate her already irritated skin.</li>
            <li> While we found this to be easy to set up it is a bit of a hassle to use, you have to hold it</li>
            <li> Battery depletes very quickly.</li>
            <li> Overheats too easily.</li>
            <li> I can easily see doing 12 sessions on my face and jawline alone.</li>
            <li> Please make sure to read the directions, to make sure the device is right for you before buying.</li>
            <li> This kind of malarkey is what I thought of when I first looked at LED skin lights.</li>

            <li> Despite the cost, often they seem cheaply made, and break easily.</li>
            <li> but as I said, I&#x27;m very impressed with even the minor improvements that I think this will be worth the price of replacement heads and batteries when they are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Most products will dry my skin out, so I&#x27;ll have to skip a couple of days, but with the VERILUX, I&#x27;ve experienced none of the side effects that I experience with the lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light couldn&#x27;t be easier to use: charge it overnight in the stand,</li>
            <li> Usability is as important as whether the product works or not -</li>
            <li> light therapy has been a miracle worker for me</li>
            <li> But if you have an occasional pimple, I think it works great.</li>
            <li> wand works by shining UV light onto the pimple, which penetrates the epidermis, and kills the bacteria that causes the acne.</li>
            <li> Each treatment consists of holding the wand on the pimple and it shines the light on it for 3-minutes, so it shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> * 600 Treatments - You must replace the light head after 600 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light Head Must Come In Contact With Skin</li>
            <li> Dislike the fit of the goggles</li>
            <li> so I got light system for her to try.</li>
            <li> The light wand has improved her skin without the drying side effects.</li>
            <li> Since it is working, she&#x27;s going to continue using the light</li>
            <li> The system comes with goggles to protect the eyes from the light.</li>
            <li> It might be the light wave or something.</li>
            <li> We are through the looking-glass with bizarre technology here, folks.</li>
            <li> 600 uses may sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s 600-3 minute sessions.</li>
            <li> In 10 years, if you are reading a review I am writing whilst in the midst of a brave battle with skin cancer or Arnegram-Clark syndrome, refer back to this review.</li>
            <li> think if you are on the fence about a light therapy skin device, you should take the plunge, but not with this product.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;C. Chemical free, drug free and won&#x27;t bleach your linens and clothing</li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t write enough great things about this</li>
            <li> Our oldest twin \\&quot;R\\&quot; has a more fair complextion and his results were noticable the next day.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, but it might be better for teen&#x27;s than adults.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m arrogant and I think I&#x27;m better than other people because I use makeup and want to feel attractive.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend a good facial brush, scrub and great facial wash in conjunction with this product</li>
            <li> I want to make Verilux eat this, but they probably all live in Kenya and are already eating exotic food products with President Obama&#x27;s cousins (WOOF!).</li>

            <li> /&gt;During this week I noticed a significant decrease in oil production in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Verilux is a familiar brand in our house.  </li>
            <li> The goggles that come with it seem to work pretty well, although I feel like they could be better.</li>
            <li> So along comes the Verilux which i was really excited about</li>
            <li> but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I think this was good idea using science behind it and works great with design that recharges.</li>
            <li> The device did not want to remain on for the full cycle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product even advertised that it does that, but I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product even advertised that it does that, but I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, when no amount of washing helped enough, I would have loved a chance to try a multi-pronged approach, including this.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen good enough results YET to recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li> After 3 or so treatments, my Verilux overheats and I have to let it cool off before I can continue using it.</li>
            <li> It would take all night to cover my whole face, and for results they recommending treating more than once a day</li>
            <li> Also, by not being able to really move it because of the touch sensor it just dries out my skin</li>
            <li> want to make sure you understand that no matter how much you think you can help by clicking the comment button and copying/</li>
            <li> the full</li>
            <li> If you break out around your nose, good luck making the light stay on long enough to do any good.</li>
            <li> It means the device is in Heat Protection mode--you need to allow a device designed to generate heat to cool off.</li>
            <li> It actually really helps, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, more toned, and looks so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I use it as flash light right now and auto seconds counter.</li>
            <li> I have to honestly tell you that after only 3 days of treatment twice daily, the results are remarkable.  </li>
            <li> Even if the battery life was better, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this 4 or more times in a row because the device will overheat and automatically shut itself down until it cools off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think, for me, I am going to look into getting one of the older model Verilux lamps that you sit in front of as it seems like it would be faster than treating so many areas 3 minutes at a time, with this treatment head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product worked like a charm on the mild forehead breakouts.</li>
            <li> Overheats quick.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne problems, with mild blackheads.</li>
            <li> and I would guess this has a lot to do with helping with the mild acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been healing rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged that well and battery dies quickly.</li>
            <li> On one hand, that&#x27;s nice, as I don&#x27;t yet have many wrinkles, but on the other I still get some pimples, whiteheads, etc.  </li>
            <li> I do think it is preventing new outbreaks more than treating existing pimples.  </li>
            <li> This is a great solution for acne if you want something that helps prevent and it not full of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> The Verilux Clearwave Acne System is a handheld device that delivers timed \\&quot;doses\\&quot; of blue light that studies have shown to be effective in treating certain types of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell when this thing keeps choking on its own heating sensors and uses a battery that has ADD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell when this thing keeps choking on its own heating sensors and uses a battery that has ADD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silent (except for the beeps) and gets warm but not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s rarely any sun and when it happens people come out to not to expose themselves to sun but to workout and play sports.</li>
            <li> has given a wonderful review talking about the science behind this product.  </li>
            <li> In fact, saying it helps moderate may even be too kind.</li>
            <li> In fact, saying it helps moderate may even be too kind.</li>
            <li> It was only mildly effective for me.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the overnight success I get with 5% benzoyl peroxide cream for infrequent acne.  </li>
            <li> I suspect some initial success comes from the lightly-warming affect of the light which might melt some oil buildup much like a warm washcloth</li>
            <li> So for the first 600, you can calculate the cost per dose (0.25), per day (0.75) per spot, per week (1.50-2.25) per spot, and and full course (6.00-24.75) (2-3 times per week, 4-11 weeks).  </li>
            <li> Initially, it seems like it could be effective for the price</li>
            <li> This unit, however, is a nice compliment that can be used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It clearly indicates it is NOT for Rosacea, which many of us 40+ people suffer from.  </li>
            <li> This extends to informing me that I have a problem in the first place, as if I didn&#x27;t notice the redness, inflammation, and bumps ON MY FACE IN A SOCIETY FULL OF MIRRORS.</li>
            <li> If it can affect people taking thyroid medication, that tells me this light is going more than skin deep.</li>
            <li> If it can affect people taking thyroid medication, that tells me this light is going more than skin deep.</li>
            <li> The most frequently reported drawback being time invested in treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have used Tria products and yes, it is time-consuming but well worth</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> then its going to turn right off.</li>
            <li> , go right now, and order this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not interested in making you better; they&#x27;re interested in making THEM better.</li>
            <li> Overall, this seems like a pretty good system, albeit at a prett high price.</li>
            <li> The intense blue light activates chemicals inside the Propionibacterium acnes known as porphyrins, which are organic compounds that have very intense absorption bands in the visible region; hence they respond to light by producing free radicals, which are atoms with unpaired electrons.</li>
            <li> The next day, even though the pimple was still red, I could feel that the swelling had greatly subsided and the area wasn&#x27;t as tender to the touch.</li>
            <li> Ansr is next on my list, and after that, I may go on to MIT for experimental radioactive treatment that will make me have babies with nine heads, or possibly to a good old-fashioned snake oil salesman.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t use chemicals and it just light a flashlight with special blue LEDs, but the manual does state a lengthy list of precautions to avoid if pregnant, taking certain medications or topical creams, or certain kind of acne that you must take heed of.  </li>
            <li> and i can move it around my face very much.</li>

            <li> First, the VERILUX is NOT RECOMMENDED for use on severe Nodular or Cystic acne.</li>
            <li> - I guessthis is a safety feature but the light head will not turn on if it&#x27;s not in direct contact with skin.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because of the price and the fact that you must buy replacement heads in the future.this is a safety feature but the light head will not turn on if it&#x27;s not in direct contact with skin.</li>
            <li> But that would have been OK if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consequently for those who would like to blast their entire face, you won&#x27;t be able to do it all in one sitting.</li>
            <li> I began to treat, as the directions suggest, the same areas two-three times a day to see if it made things even better.</li>
            <li> More of the same results.</li>
            <li> I began to treat, as the directions suggest, the same areas two-three times a day to see if it made things even better.</li>
            <li> More of the same results.</li>
            <li> The manual provides more extensive explanation of what is covered and what is not.  </li>
            <li> I plugged this on and docked it on the charger overnight the first time I unboxed it.  </li>
            <li> The instruction guide gives more specific info on what types of acne it is designed for.</li>
            <li> We have twin sons who are 14, who have been battling moderate to more severe acne for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> First off let me say the product works.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to spend a lot of money on a skin product, I&#x27;d probably go with the Clarisonic first.</li>
            <li> and there where a treatment works at first, then I develop a resistance to it.</li>
            <li> You will be passed over for promotions, or not get jobs in the first place, people won&#x27;t go on dates with you based on it, people won&#x27;t want to help you when you need it--</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve tried their way and it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t follow their exact regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a red if I can ever get this thing to work, but it sure won&#x27;t be from this brand.</li>

            <li> /&gt;11/17/2012 EDIT THE FIRST</li>
            <li> More edits to follow, but I am going to get a different device when I run out of uses on this.</li>
            <li> I get most hormonal acne and stopped using all topical treatments about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> What is does do, is clear the skin from bacteria in a fast, and easy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems very solid and is very straightforward to use.</li>
            <li> have had great results with the VERILUX CLEARWAVE ACNE TREATMENT WAND and find that it is a great alternative to acne medications that contain Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid and other harsh ingredients that can dry skin out,</li>
            <li> I think it does require a little bit more commitment than using any of the over the counter offerings currently available.  </li>
            <li> Since the recommended times that you do treatments per day is up to 3xs, depending on the severity of your acne, to do 2 cheeks it takes 12 hours (including the wait time to recharge and cool down)TO COMPLETE ONE TREATMENT!</li>
            <li> manufacturer reports studies have shown an 80% success rate, which is pretty high, but remember that is for the duration of 4-11 weeks.  </li>
            <li> the light heads are actually kind of hard to find....odd as that seems to be how this product makes</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ll come out with a more compact version that is able to reach the \\&quot;hard to get to\\&quot; areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;D. Detects contact with the skin and dispenses a powerful, acne-clearing 3-minute application of therapeutic blue light to the affected area</li>
            <li> She has tried many various drugstore and prescription acne medications before and while some have helped, the side effect of most of them was very dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little frustrating, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be able to come up with a pretty good routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Her skin is still not perfectly clear, but it has made enough of a difference that people who hadn&#x27;t seen her in a while commented on how good she looked.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it on a pimple for an allotted period of time which can become cumbersome if you are working a large area.</li>
            <li> If you only have one zit - that is just fine.  </li>
            <li> think the blue light works very well for certain types of acne.</li>
            <li> My breakouts were huge, too, taking several weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> It uses blue light to conduct photodynamic therapy, or PDT, that uses properties of sunlight without the harmful ultraviolet rays.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really share it, who wants someone else&#x27;s face grease.</li>
            <li> The head that comes with it is blue light.  </li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t like to expose themselves too much to sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve subsequently gone for professional light therapy and the outcome is well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> I gave up after four nights of using it because it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> This is an absolute miracle for someone who has struggled with monthly acne for 15 years with no relief.</li>
            <li> especially adult</li>
            <li> However, I recommend applying some sort of heavy-duty anti-aging product (maybe even a red light treatment, which is recommended) immediately afterwards to avoid wrinkling of the skin.</li>
            <li> I am still very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As an adult, I find faster success with the creams.  </li>
            <li> so you can just let it lay gently instead of holding it for 9 minutes for 3 spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t have much difference</li>
            <li> and my wife also didn&#x27;t experience much difference.  </li>
            <li> am guessing this technology works as I haven&#x27;t really had the patience or the real requirement to use it.</li>
            <li> The unit itself seems very well put together.</li>
            <li> But this really does work.</li>
            <li> It is a three-min blue light treatment.</li>
            <li> I really expected more for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not too concerned about needing red light therapy at this point.</li>
            <li> suppose this shouldn&#x27;t surprise me in America, where everyone becomes an expert ready for punditry on cable news whenever they think they see a problem.</li>
            <li> People see the rash on your face, and suddenly everyone&#x27;s a dermatologist who has the precise solution--</li>
            <li> This thing kills germs on my skin, but it allows stuff to prosper on the very area which claims to kill the bacteria?</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it cost way too much to just use as a flashlight</li>
            <li> There also does seem to be research that backs up the claim that this blue LED light will kill acne bacteria.</li>
            <li> B005XSPD3S BrightPad BT-L84 Acne Light]], especially if you want to also try red light for its healing and anti-aging properties.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The nice thing about the Verilux, compared to the Tanda Zap, is that the treatment head is larger, so you can treat a bigger area in one shot.  </li>
            <li> Just light up your 3 favorite problem spots, throw it on the charger, and later on that day do some other areas.</li>
            <li> The verilux product does not work near as effectively as the other lights.</li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil cleanser because I have very sensitive skin, but sometimes I feel like Cetaphil isn&#x27;t strong enough to combat my skin problems.</li>

            <li> (yes, after 1 - 3 min cycle) I have been checking reviews from other sites, and there are many complaints about battery life.</li>
            <li> My acne has not gotten any better by using this product but has with other lights.</li>
            <li> It gets to the root cause to kill the bacteria, for certain kinds of mild to moderate acne, and results in 4-11 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used the product five times so far (I only use it once a day, right before bed), and it appears to be helping me with my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li> I also feel like this is another special treat for me because of the same reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know they think they&#x27;re being helpful, but do people with clear skin just never get tired of the sound of their own voice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing is pretty self-explanatory as far as assembly and charging go.</li>
            <li> They do not make a perfect seal naturally, and this just felt really awkward to me.</li>
            <li> Another reason is less sun exposure which inflames any pore clog much more and increase sebum to come out of skin because of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Some areas of my skin began to look significantly better while others seemed less effected.</li>
            <li> Some areas of my skin began to look significantly better while others seemed less effected.</li>
            <li> The more severe the acne, though, the LESS of an effect I saw from the device.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad that I spent the $50 to try the Tanda Zap before trying this, so I knew what to expect as far as clearing capabilities and sensation (</li>
            <li> I like the Clearwave better than the Ansr because, as another reviewer stated, it has a larger head and you can treat a larger patch of skin at one time, so</li>
            <li> It says not to use it if you take antihistamines, which I do occasionally when my PBS flares up, because they make you light sensitive.  </li>
            <li> my forehead with smallish classic whitehead pimples, and my chin where I get ingrown hairs and stuff from shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> main issue I have with this is how it requires you to see nothing during the procedure, as the googles won&#x27;t let you.</li>
            <li> It claims in studies to report 80% for the mild to moderate acne it targets.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for mild acne breakouts, and maintaining a daily skin treatment regimen.  </li>
            <li> Basically it&#x27;s for mild to moderate acne and not recommended for someone with severe nodule acne or severe cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Most Victorian medical stuff did not have any science to back it up.</li>
            <li> Better safe than sorry.</li>

            <li> The whole head has to be in contact with your skin to activate, and it seems to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I can highly recommend the Clearwave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this does work I think the price to maintain this is a bit high.</li>
            <li> They think there is a one zit fits all solution for what can be a highly individualized problem, and nothing you have ever done before their advice counts.</li>
            <li> The Verilux head has to be directly in contact with the skin on all parts of the head for the light to stay on, so unless it is on a flat surface of your face (forehead or cheeks...or sometimes chin)</li>
            <li> HP does not mean that Harry Potter has arrived to zap your acne.</li>
            <li> This is about my right to the pursuit of happiness, and the society of mediocrity that tells me I should settle for less and lower my expectations.</li>
            <li> overall opinion after only a little more than 3 weeks is that this is a great little gadget.</li>

            <li> Now, on the shaving issues- not so much, but really there&#x27;s only so much this sort of treatment can do with a ingrown hair-</li>
            <li> But, with that being said, it&#x27;s still probably more effective than most oral/topical treatments, and without the nasty side effects.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now, and it seems like I&#x27;ve had more break-outs</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep working with it for a few more months and see how it goes and update this review.</li>
            <li> TWO: after using the device pretty regularly, I decided that my face wasn&#x27;t going to react negatively to the LED light and that it might actually be helping my skin look better.</li>
            <li> Will light therapy stand the test of time, or will I move on to other voodoo products?</li>

            <li> my Clearwave quits after 600 uses, I think I&#x27;ll spring for the Aurora rather than continue to buy new heads.</li>
            <li> Since this is a long-term acne treatment system, I thought it would make sense to update my review periodically with my new findings, praises, critiques, discoveries, and results.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ll update here when something new happens, or when I finish my 600 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ll update here when something new happens, or when I finish my 600 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just so I could get my hands on something new, seemed a bit unreasonable, so I&#x27;ve been using it for about four weeks</li>
            <li> I would never have purchased this item if the marketing dept. had made the customer very clear once opened it cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> also found the charger to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Another thing, 3 minutes per application is not that long, but if you have more than one, you can easily spend half an hour or more; then multiply that 3 times a day and you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> You can also treat multiple areas, but I did notice that after 5 \\&quot;doses\\&quot; in one shot, my Verilux Clearwave gave me the code that meant it had gotten too hot, so I couldn&#x27;t do my whole face and neck, but could do considerably more area than I could with the very small treatment head on the Tanda Zap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin and type of acne is different, so it will likely work better on some than others.</li>
            <li> And the lights animate, going up and down, but the light will go out once it&#x27;s completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin is pretty sensitive, and just about everything, which is why I occasionally get blemishes.</li>
            <li> We are thrilled with the initial results and are anxious to see how this goes as time moves forward.</li>
            <li> I used the Verilux every day and even though it is not painful, it is extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li> I understand not wanting to use drugs or chemicals but honestly for us its just easier to wipe spots with antispetic and dry up in a few days.</li>
            <li> Nothing too life-changing, when it says it only helps mild to moderate they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> Nothing too life-changing, when it says it only helps mild to moderate they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> It might be a good idea to get a small light for the little corners and use this one for larger areas, but that&#x27;s assuming this thing actually works, and we are not done agonizing through this just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This device is for people with acne, but only certain types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly report back if I can ever get this thing to stay on</li>

            <li> They make full spectrum lights which I love as if it brings sunlight in your house, particularly in the winter months when it is too cold to go</li>
            <li> This can be a frustration for the forehead and nose area, which are more curvy and less flat.</li>
            <li> I get occasional breakouts and alcohol or other typical treatments work fairly well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well with my Clarsonic to clear up my forehead breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much acne anymore, but occasionally it happens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as skin clearing-</li>
            <li> so you can use the wand near your temples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> This was an experimental period.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also surprised that it needs to be charged every day.  </li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has been using the Clearwave system for about 3 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> As far as the battery charge, we charged it for 12 hours before using it like the instruction sheet said.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not going to work for very severe acne (or</li>
            <li> I purchased this to assist with a form of adult acne that I have.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve stuck with it this far, you understand my frustration.</li>
            <li> I guess I have sensitive skin and have discontinued the use because of this reason.</li>
            <li> You can only get 4 -3 min treatments out of 1 charge, so if you have more than a few spots to treat, you have to recharge (this can be a pain)</li>
            <li> Alas, it wasn&#x27;t that effective in our case.</li>
            <li> Wait about a minute for it to cool down and use it again on another bunch of zits.</li>
            <li> But when I say it helps, I mean it is not the magical solution all of us dealing with acne are dreaming of.  </li>
            <li> I do see a positive effect in reducing acne, but not a profound effect.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you are using any prescription product such as Retin-A or other medications that cause hypersensitivity to UV light, you might get burned or rashes from this</li>
            <li> Now of course since I have hit my fifth decade, I don&#x27;t have the kind of serious acne that hit me as a teen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A. Painlessly destroys acne-causing bacteria in skin pores without harming surrounding tissue&lt;br /&gt;B. Cleared by the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne, this easy-to-use device is rechargeable, portable and ergonomically designed with single button operation</li>
            <li> Having said that, if I had known about the Sirius Aurora before I purchased the Clearwave, I would have purchased that one instead, because the heads on the Clearwave last for 600 uses of 3 minutes each, then you have to buy a new head for $35.</li>
            <li> New ones are not emerging, ones already swollen appear to have stopped in their tracks, and the red patches seem to have gotten a healing boost.</li>
            <li> Not one new red splotch, bump or cyst.</li>

            <li> And, following the directions, your skin will STAY clear!</li>
            <li> The battery charge has held pretty well unlike some other users have found.</li>
            <li> There is also a red light (\\&quot;soothing\\&quot;) head available from Verilux (though as of last week they were completely out of them and they were not sure when they would be back in stock) which appeals to me as I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have acne and my skin is starting to show signs of aging (a childhood spent at the beach getting sun poisoning did not help!)...</li>
            <li> It says it can take a few weeks to work, that seems so odd to me, since the type of acne it treats is the kind that clears up give a bit of regular face washing anyway.</li>

            <li> I thought that the band could be better designed, but it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> I did, however, feel like my face was less oily and a few spots did seem more evenly toned.</li>
            <li> The indicator light may go off, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t still charging.</li>

            <li> First and foremost, it overheats every 2 cycles, so you can only treat about a 5 inch circular area and then have to wait at least a half hour for it to cool down.</li>

            <li> i was really bummed that i wasn&#x27;t able to use it like it was advertised, especially after spending the amount on it that i did :(</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m tired of acting like I&#x27;m not worth it so that everyone else can be OK with themselves.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t expect this to clear up the small amount of scarring I still have, but when I have gotten a little pimple here and there over the past few weeks, this Verilux system has done a pretty decent job of clearing it</li>
            <li> A review is hardly a place to be dumping your emotions, but I think you need to understand what drove me to try this product or anything like it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Within a day or two, clears up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other phototherapy products, while more expensive, do not seem to have the limited lifespan of effectiveness this has on the LEDs.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop, while i think that the concept behind this product is fantastic and sound the design is flawed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will probably lose at least the first one of your 600</li>
            <li> For each flat circular spot, it takes 3 minutes, 3 times a day (9 minutes a day), 2-3 times per week, for results in 4-11 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The product has to be on an extremely flat surface to charge and I have problems trying to get it to start</li>
            <li> head on this is small enough that you have to use multiple sessions to cover your face and maybe one other area, but large enough that you can&#x27;t get it into corners like around your nose, or on some areas like your temple, or on contoured areas like your jawline.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to trade acne for dry, peeling, red, irritated skin--that&#x27;s not an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve spent my savings to have something that worked this well against acne when I was a teen, in lieu of chalky swirls of brown or white acne cream.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t refundable, at least not through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t refundable, at least not through Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, the time spent is a small sacrifice if it really works.  </li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t help that the manual said it might take 4-11 weeks to see results (about the same amount of time as the average zit cream) and after only 600 uses, the head would have to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterward, my skin felt a bit singed, like I had a minor sunburn.</li>
            <li> long</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flip side of trying everything(aside from draining you mentally and financially) is that when you take an interest in bettering your looks, people then decide that you are vain.</li>
            <li> the manual on hand because you will get strange messages on the display.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have no idea what the long term effects of this thing will be.</li>
            <li> long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have no idea what the long term effects of this thing will be.</li>
            <li> long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I did twice daily treatments, morning and night, and it cleared up the pimple by the fourth day, even though there&#x27;s still a slight mark where the pimple was, but there&#x27;s no swelling or tenderness.</li>
            <li> In some places extremely so, in others.. about the same.</li>
            <li> In some places extremely so, in others.. about the same.</li>
            <li> have never written a review, but felt that this product is such a rip off that I had to warn other people.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were just LED lights and supposed to be very minimal in energy consumption, but the charges don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I am relentless with them in keeping their faces washed and in using acne products to help dry up and keep their acne under control.  </li>
            <li> So here we have a phototherapy system with limited usage on the head.</li>
            <li> Its effect becomes clear in 3 minute sessions, and usually needs to be repeated.</li>
            <li> Mind you, there seemed to be less of them, and they had a smaller \\&quot;bump\\&quot; etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for some instant miracle cure for acne, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed, but it does seem to be a worthwhile product to try for someone suffering with breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not impossible but it would be time consuming and difficult to maneuver, so I recommend that you use it for spot treatments.</li>
            <li> Then you have to hold it to your face for three minutes, which is a long time for one spot on your face, then if you have other spots to do, your can be sitting there for a while.</li>
            <li> The only time that this mess ever cleared up was for a couple of years when I had a thyroid infection, and I had a raging case of thyroid hormone overproduction.</li>
            <li> Second, in order to protect my eyes, I needed to hold the goggles on my face rather tightly.</li>
            <li> wash the area, (2) prepare for placement &amp; know where the button is, (3) put on the goggles with very limited visibility,</li>
            <li> It has only been a little over 3 weeks, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the last few weeks and my face is</li>
            <li> But, this case, it&#x27;s not really doing that</li>
            <li> Plus the Aurora gives you three treatment heads, red and green in addition to blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though I held it firmly to my forehead, it timed out several times at 1 minute.</li>
            <li> Remember that this is basically tanning bed technology, so be careful.</li>
            <li> This thing puts the mental in temperamental.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell, and in corners, like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Blue LEDs have stopped my acne dead in its tracks.</li>

            <li> Blue LEDs have stopped my acne dead in its tracks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to keep at it, giving the product its due, and did but finally, after feeling as if I wasted time and energy, I gave up.</li>
            <li> The redness from her acne is less noticeable and there are less breakouts overall.</li>
            <li> Bad breakouts take more than a few treatments to dry up, but they WILL disappear over time.  </li>
            <li> that I am self-obsessed, looks-obsessed, shallow, and a snob because I pursue clear skin.</li>
            <li> Personally, I can highly recommend it for once-a-month, deep painful pimples that you can feel long before you can see.</li>
            <li> (I think I saw a copper-plated waterboard in there someplace) and most of it didn&#x27;t even begin to live up to outrageous claims.</li>
            <li> (I think I saw a copper-plated waterboard in there someplace) and most of it didn&#x27;t even begin to live up to outrageous claims.</li>
            <li> No issues at all on cheeks or other flat-featured areas.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day 3 min on head on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other thing she noticed was that her pimples feel hardened underneath the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried this out a few times, however I am not completely sold on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now, and a couple of trouble areas I&#x27;ve had for a long time seem to be improving.</li>
            <li> Seems to be cheaper than some of the other systems out there as well.</li>
            <li> Even as they point out all your flaws, other people will berate you for trying to fix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know from experience that this type of pimple goes from that, to more inflamed, swollen and painful, and usually takes about a week and a half to clear up, usually leaving a mark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a horrible product and I feel like I have been truely ripped off for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> Let it charge for 12 hours before you use it, and whatever you do, don&#x27;t drop the little screw that holds the battery compartment closed.</li>
            <li> I started getting a big pimple on the side of my cheek, near my nose, and it was painful, swollen and red.</li>
            <li> For 20%, there will be no success.  </li>
            <li> It was a dark and smelly time, and there was no internet.</li>
            <li> It was a dark and smelly time, and there was no internet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m a late 30s male who did suffer pretty bad acne as a youngster and still have the odd scar and the occasional pimple, despite my age.</li>
            <li> On both boys the swelling of the acne spots are reduced by at least 70% and the white and black heads appear to be drying up and going away.  </li>
            <li> It stops once it counts down to 600.  </li>
            <li> so we brought it to the bed and start using it while lying down.  </li>
            <li> People are wiping the head down with rubbingalcohol between uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed slightly smoother, tighter skin with a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;</li>
            <li> clearer with less bumps and redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &#x27;head&#x27; on it is too small and covers such a small area that you have to move it around a lot.  </li>
            <li> Rather than continuing with less effectiveness, you can buy another head from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Her skins does look clearer and less oily, though</li>
            <li> Skin my show improvement with continuous use over a period of time -- but this product is definitely not a quick fix (there is no quick fix for acne, and it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> It basically works for typical acne.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;d been using the ANSR beam previously</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built well and looks like it would hold up for a long time, so I can&#x27;t say anything negative about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had acne for a long time, and I have tried everything from common rubbing alcohol to calling a televangelist for prayer, and nothing works.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed but no the light did not improve my acne.</li>
            <li> the battery compartment screw was a bit tight and was already getting stripped.  </li>
            <li> I notice that when I am PMSing, the acne is a little worse in general and always on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I said I&#x27;m going to give this a little while longer to produce results.</li>
            <li> The manual does say that you may experience a worsening of acne breakouts as the product draws out bacteria and impurities from the skin; I did notice a little worsening on my chin</li>
            <li> I plan to keep this little baby in my \\&quot;tool</li>
            <li> If I use too little it doesn&#x27;t work, but if I use it as intended it works</li>
            <li> Far less expensive than those sold by my Dr.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With each passing day, I became annoyed with the time constraints it placed on me without seeing actual results.</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard it might not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard it might not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> course, if you have heavy acne, you should consult a Physician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chandler</li>
            <li> I recommend laying on a bed if you have to do a few spots</li>
            <li> and the battery was dead</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to waste money like this, and neither can anyone else.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to waste money like this, and neither can anyone else.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks for it to start to make a difference</li>
            <li> Use it ANYWHERE breakouts are a problem, like your back (with help, of course) and you&#x27;ll see a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> because if it&#x27;s not easy to use then you won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> my experience, it would be very difficult to use the VERILUX WAND over large areas of your face and body.</li>
            <li> As soon as it reared its ugly head, I did my first three-minute treatment with the VERILUX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> At least snake oil salesmen knew when to sit down and shut up, and I can&#x27;t say that for all the jerks who have been putting their 2 cents in on my skin all these years, and there&#x27;s something to be said for that.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so frustrating when, no matter what you do, some breakouts just will NOT totally clear up!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical of gadgets like this, and had never heard of \\&quot;blue light\\&quot; treatments for acne.</li>
            <li> otherwise, no notable sensation from the Verilux.  </li>
            <li> Also, the instructions recommend using the wand for no more than 3 treatments per pimple in one day, and no more than 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> I usually get spots around my mouth</li>
            <li> You are as lazy and ignorant as you were five minutes ago before they met you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blackheads are no more</li>
            <li> Getting blemishes near the eye or on uneven places like the nose are really impossible, since the device must maintain contact with the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head sometimes requires a very firm press against the skin to turn on.</li>
            <li> Adults mock other adults for it behind their backs and to their faces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with using this wand (at least until the fascist head tells me I have no more</li>

            <li> Sometimes it is hard to tell when it is on if you are not in front of the mirror and doesn&#x27;t see the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Treatment speed is also moderately slow.  </li>
            <li> They never recommended accutane or anything severe because I would only break out once a month, but when I did break out it was very painful (literally and emotionally).</li>
            <li> The included goggles have a small elastic band and is a little uncomfortable to put on.</li>
            <li> failure is not an option.</li>
            <li> Of course we don&#x27;t know the long term effects of staring at a computer monitor on eyes desperately seeking an acne treatment that works, either, so I think it evens out.</li>

            <li> For years I have been to dermatologists for help with hormonal, deep under the skin, painful acne.</li>
            <li> I chose to discontinue use, as I feel it is not good for my skin</li>
            <li> Their way always consists of some variation on some lame over the counter thing that everyone knows doesn&#x27;t work, usually something involving benzoyl peroxide and sandpaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is lightweight and features a head that is replaceable once you exhausted all of the measured treatments.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worse than wasting money on a gadget that does not work.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a poorly made battery.</li>

            <li> Overall, I have to say that I stopped using the Clearwave because I found the routine of it too time-intensive and boring to cover all the areas of my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 03/10/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from 4 stars to 3 as I find it ever so annoying to keep charging this, plus I used it 1X on 1 spot on my forehead a few days ago and went to use it again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to use on and around the nose -- areas where I also need to treat.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> everyone watches what you&#x27;re eating, and whatever you&#x27;re eating is WRONG, no matter what it is.</li>

            <li> It can also be too cold to operate.</li>
            <li> Have it Their way--your way is irrelevant!</li>
            <li> The dermatologists prescribed lotions (benzoyl peroxide, clindamyacin, differin, retin-a) that dried out my skin so badly and made me miserable.</li>
            <li> We were both very skeptical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad though.</li>
            <li> For one spot, 3 minutes for 3 times in the day isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> What if i have acne really badly on my chin or nose</li>
            <li> hate that I have to replace the bulbs every 600 applications.</li>
            <li> If you have one of those nasty under the surface painful zits that just wont come to a head - this will take care of it.  </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t seem terribly efficient to me.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much acne anymore, but occasionally it happens. This device is a technological wonder. It uses blue light to conduct photodynamic therapy, or PDT, that uses properties of sunlight without the harmful ultraviolet rays. Its effect becomes clear in 3 minute sessions, and usually needs to be repeated. The booklet that comes with it says 600-use life for the LEDs that are grouped in a disposable attachment that comes with the device. It works. The intense blue light activates chemicals inside the Propionibacterium acnes known as porphyrins, which are organic compounds that have very intense absorption bands in the visible region; hence they respond to light by producing free radicals, which are atoms with unpaired electrons. These unstable atoms kill the bacteria causing zits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical of gadgets like this, and had never heard of \\&quot;blue light\\&quot; treatments for acne. And it didn&#x27;t help that the manual said it might take 4-11 weeks to see results (about the same amount of time as the average zit cream) and after only 600 uses, the head would have to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after only about 2 weeks of daily use, my pimples have been disappearing! I&#x27;ve also noticed slightly smoother, tighter skin with a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; like I&#x27;ve had a facial. I tried this on my daughter, who is starting to get some acne around her nose, and it seems to be improving that area, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light couldn&#x27;t be easier to use: charge it overnight in the stand, then once you&#x27;ve figured out where to place it on your skin, put on the goggles, press the button until it beeps and a \\&quot;3\\&quot; appears on the display and hold it to your skin until it beeps again, twice. Wait about a minute for it to cool down and use it again on another bunch of zits. I get about 5-6 treatments until it has to be charged again. It&#x27;s silent (except for the beeps) and gets warm but not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve spent my savings to have something that worked this well against acne when I was a teen, in lieu of chalky swirls of brown or white acne cream. Great product!</li>
            <li> While we found this to be easy to set up it is a bit of a hassle to use, you have to hold it just right or it will stop working, then you have to readjust, if you wrap your hand around it , that helps. Then you have to hold it to your face for three minutes, which is a long time for one spot on your face, then if you have other spots to do, your can be sitting there for a while. Can&#x27;t really share it, who wants someone else&#x27;s face grease. It says it can take a few weeks to work, that seems so odd to me, since the type of acne it treats is the kind that clears up give a bit of regular face washing anyway. I understand not wanting to use drugs or chemicals but honestly for us its just easier to wipe spots with antispetic and dry up in a few days.</li>
            <li> The Verilux Clearwave Acne System is a handheld device that delivers timed \\&quot;doses\\&quot; of blue light that studies have shown to be effective in treating certain types of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight and features a head that is replaceable once you exhausted all of the measured treatments.  The head that comes with it is blue light.  There is also a red light (\\&quot;soothing\\&quot;) head available from Verilux (though as of last week they were completely out of them and they were not sure when they would be back in stock) which appeals to me as I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have acne and my skin is starting to show signs of aging (a childhood spent at the beach getting sun poisoning did not help!)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about the Verilux, compared to the Tanda Zap, is that the treatment head is larger, so you can treat a bigger area in one shot.  You can also treat multiple areas, but I did notice that after 5 \\&quot;doses\\&quot; in one shot, my Verilux Clearwave gave me the code that meant it had gotten too hot, so I couldn&#x27;t do my whole face and neck, but could do considerably more area than I could with the very small treatment head on the Tanda Zap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as skin clearing- it&#x27;s not instant, it&#x27;s not rapid clearing.  I do think it is preventing new outbreaks more than treating existing pimples.  I treated my face, but left my forehead alone for two weeks and the rest of my face is clearer than my forehead.  It definitely did not help me with a hormonal breakout, as I have always been prone to.  I think, for me, I am going to look into getting one of the older model Verilux lamps that you sit in front of as it seems like it would be faster than treating so many areas 3 minutes at a time, with this treatment head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I spent the $50 to try the Tanda Zap before trying this, so I knew what to expect as far as clearing capabilities and sensation (once the bulb warms up it feels kind of soothing...otherwise, no notable sensation from the Verilux.  The Zap vibrates while you are using it)... I will update my review once I have more treatments under my belt and if I get my hands on the red treatment head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004W8Z3IK Tanda Zap Acne Clearing Device]]vibrates while you are using it)...

            <li> Clearer skin is a definate with this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the last few weeks and my face is so&lt;br /&gt;Much clearer with less bumps and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel it work.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> It is basically a uv gun. product works great. blue light works in small area. This is basically UV gun that destroys or kills bacteria in an area. Portland Oregon where I live, everyone has great skin. Most people are vegetarian, or rides bicycle to commute to work and school or vegan. Never seen so many people with great skin. Another reason is less sun exposure which inflames any pore clog much more and increase sebum to come out of skin because of sun exposure. There&#x27;s rarely any sun and when it happens people come out to not to expose themselves to sun but to workout and play sports. I think this was good idea using science behind it and works great with design that recharges. But, failed, in one way. People don&#x27;t like to expose themselves too much to sun. But, this case, it&#x27;s not really doing that either so. I use it as flash light right now and auto seconds counter. :) it has that clock. :) what do you think of this product?</li>
            <li> Ineffective.  Nothing worse than wasting money on a gadget that does not work.  I&#x27;ve subsequently gone for professional light therapy and the outcome is well worth the cost.  I really wanted to like this product but it has no beneficial results.  Save your money instead.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have to say that I stopped using the Clearwave because I found the routine of it too time-intensive and boring to cover all the areas of my face. The &#x27;head&#x27; on it is too small and covers such a small area that you have to move it around a lot.  Also, it&#x27;s hard to &#x27;focus&#x27; it on your nose.  I gave up after four nights of using it because it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.  Usability is as important as whether the product works or not - because if it&#x27;s not easy to use then you won&#x27;t use it. Something to consider. It&#x27;s built well and looks like it would hold up for a long time, so I can&#x27;t say anything negative about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably this is for a more patient person. I&#x27;ve had good success with Glycolics and will just use those.</li>
            <li> For years I have been to dermatologists for help with hormonal, deep under the skin, painful acne. They never recommended accutane or anything severe because I would only break out once a month, but when I did break out it was very painful (literally and emotionally). My breakouts were huge, too, taking several weeks to heal. The dermatologists prescribed lotions (benzoyl peroxide, clindamyacin, differin, retin-a) that dried out my skin so badly and made me miserable. I didn&#x27;t want to trade acne for dry, peeling, red, irritated skin--that&#x27;s not an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, before I bought this device, I was using the Ansr beam which I had great success with. I like the Clearwave better than the Ansr because, as another reviewer stated, it has a larger head and you can treat a larger patch of skin at one time, so the total treatment time is shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the blue light works very well for certain types of acne. Personally, I can highly recommend it for once-a-month, deep painful pimples that you can feel long before you can see. Blast them with this device twice a day and they never surface AT ALL. This is an absolute miracle for someone who has struggled with monthly acne for 15 years with no relief. But the best part is: no side effects! No red, peeling skin. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue light therapy has been a miracle worker for me and I can highly recommend the Clearwave. Having said that, if I had known about the Sirius Aurora before I purchased the Clearwave, I would have purchased that one instead, because the heads on the Clearwave last for 600 uses of 3 minutes each, then you have to buy a new head for $35. The Sirius Aurora lasts up to 10,000 hours and you never have to buy replacement heads. Plus the Aurora gives you three treatment heads, red and green in addition to blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my Clearwave quits after 600 uses, I think I&#x27;ll spring for the Aurora rather than continue to buy new heads.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have pretty good skin but when the weather changes to something more seasonable my skin becomes irritated, mostly in the area I shave. I used the Verilux every day and even though it is not painful, it is extremely time consuming. You have to hold it on a pimple for an allotted period of time which can become cumbersome if you are working a large area. With each passing day, I became annoyed with the time constraints it placed on me without seeing actual results. Not trusting my own eye, I asked my wife, and she too didn&#x27;t see an improvement. I wanted to keep at it, giving the product its due, and did but finally, after feeling as if I wasted time and energy, I gave up.</li>
            <li> First, the VERILUX is NOT RECOMMENDED for use on severe Nodular or Cystic acne. But if you have an occasional pimple, I think it works great. Also, if you are using any prescription product such as Retin-A or other medications that cause hypersensitivity to UV light, you might get burned or rashes from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had great results with the VERILUX CLEARWAVE ACNE TREATMENT WAND and find that it is a great alternative to acne medications that contain Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid and other harsh ingredients that can dry skin out, especially adult skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, I&#x27;ve used everything from Clearasil to Pro-Activ and often with mixed results. Most products will dry my skin out, so I&#x27;ll have to skip a couple of days, but with the VERILUX, I&#x27;ve experienced none of the side effects that I experience with the lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have adult acne and tend to breakout in stages, with my pimples being very big, sometimes developing into boils, so I always have to have something to combat my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, it would be very difficult to use the VERILUX WAND over large areas of your face and body. It&#x27;s not impossible but it would be time consuming and difficult to maneuver, so I recommend that you use it for spot treatments. Also, the instructions recommend using the wand for no more than 3 treatments per pimple in one day, and no more than 2-3 times per week. So you should only do 9 treatments max per pimple, per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand works by shining UV light onto the pimple, which penetrates the epidermis, and kills the bacteria that causes the acne. Each treatment consists of holding the wand on the pimple and it shines the light on it for 3-minutes, so it shuts off automatically. From there you can move onto the next pimple if you have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****  TREATMENT  (FYI, I stopped using any lotions or cleansers that help fight acne once I started the treatments) *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) I started getting a big pimple on the side of my cheek, near my nose, and it was painful, swollen and red. The picture posted above is the beginning stage and I know from experience that this type of pimple goes from that, to more inflamed, swollen and painful, and usually takes about a week and a half to clear up, usually leaving a mark. As soon as it reared its ugly head, I did my first three-minute treatment with the VERILUX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The next day, even though the pimple was still red, I could feel that the swelling had greatly subsided and the area wasn&#x27;t as tender to the touch. I gave myself another treatment in the morning and followed that by another at night, before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) I continued treating the pimple twice a day and it cleared up by the third and fourth day. See photos above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write a review then and there but it could&#x27;ve been a fluke so I held off. Of course, I started getting another big zit on my chin, which started off the same way as the one on my cheek. So I began treatment on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I did twice daily treatments, morning and night, and it cleared up the pimple by the fourth day, even though there&#x27;s still a slight mark where the pimple was, but there&#x27;s no swelling or tenderness. I also used it on some smaller breakouts and it helped clear those up, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some drawbacks of the VERILUX ACNE WAND:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 600 Treatments - You must replace the light head after 600 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Charging Light Is Bright - You should charge this in the bathroom because the light is really bright when it&#x27;s charging. And the lights animate, going up and down, but the light will go out once it&#x27;s completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You Must Wear Protective Goggles - The included goggles have a small elastic band and is a little uncomfortable to put on. I thought that the band could be better designed, but it&#x27;s thin so you can use the wand near your temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Light Head Must Come In Contact With Skin - I guessthis is a safety feature but the light head will not turn on if it&#x27;s not in direct contact with skin. So you can&#x27;t use it on your scalp, which I wanted to do because I&#x27;ve been breaking out on various parts of my head and putting creams there is impossible because of my hair. If you have a heavy beard it might not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Head Gets Warm - The head doesn&#x27;t get too hot but it will warm up if you use it on more than one or two areas for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Unit Will Shut Off On Low Battery - The unit will turn off in the middle of a treatment once the battery gets low. I got about 8 treatments on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Comes With Charging Stand - You can charge with or without the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, see the pictures that I posted above to see the results. I&#x27;ll continue to use the VERILUX CLEARWAVE ACNE PHOTOTHERAPY SYSTEM from now on.

            <li> This device is for people with acne, but only certain types. Please make sure to read the directions, to make sure the device is right for you before buying. I&#x27;ve tried devices similar to this one before, and the quality has always been a problem. Despite the cost, often they seem cheaply made, and break easily. This device is better made than most, although I did have some problems with it staying on and operating as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I read the manual. I am glad I did. It says not to use it if you take antihistamines, which I do occasionally when my PBS flares up, because they make you light sensitive.  This I did not know. To test this device I had I had to stop taking antihistamines. That was ok. I take them only occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you need to plug it in and charge it up. This I did. Second you do the test. Finally you try it on a blemish. I tested it on my forearm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some difficulty with the forehead test. The device did not want to remain on for the full cycle. Even though I held it firmly to my forehead, it timed out several times at 1 minute. Second, in order to protect my eyes, I needed to hold the goggles on my face rather tightly. They do not make a perfect seal naturally, and this just felt really awkward to me. Getting blemishes near the eye or on uneven places like the nose are really impossible, since the device must maintain contact with the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I did get the device to do a three minute time on my forehead. Afterward, my skin felt a bit singed, like I had a minor sunburn. I chose to discontinue use, as I feel it is not good for my skin and I do not like the way it made my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Dislike the fit of the goggles&lt;br /&gt;* Dislike the screw-in battery&lt;br /&gt;* Dislike the controls, and it is hard to read them when you have the device pressed to your forehead, wearing goggles.&lt;br /&gt;* Made my skin feel sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty sensitive, and just about everything, which is why I occasionally get blemishes. I did not like the way this device made my skin feel at longer than 1 minute intervals.ensitive, and just about everything, which is why I occasionally get blemishes. I did not like the way this device made my skin feel at longer than 1 minute intervals.</li>
            <li> I have used the product five times so far (I only use it once a day, right before bed), and it appears to be helping me with my acne tremendously. However, I recommend applying some sort of heavy-duty anti-aging product (maybe even a red light treatment, which is recommended) immediately afterwards to avoid wrinkling of the skin. Remember that this is basically tanning bed technology, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Now of course since I have hit my fifth decade, I don&#x27;t have the kind of serious acne that hit me as a teen. However I still have the same oily skin. On one hand, that&#x27;s nice, as I don&#x27;t yet have many wrinkles, but on the other I still get some pimples, whiteheads, etc.  Oh well, silver lining....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two areas of problems on my face- my forehead with smallish classic whitehead pimples, and my chin where I get ingrown hairs and stuff from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked like a charm on the mild forehead breakouts. Now, on the shaving issues- not so much, but really there&#x27;s only so much this sort of treatment can do with a ingrown hair- the hair has to break out before any &#x60;cure&#x27; can be 100%. Mind you, there seemed to be less of them, and they had a smaller \\&quot;bump\\&quot; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you have heavy acne, you should consult a Physician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chandler has given a wonderful review talking about the science behind this product.  Please check it out.</li>
            <li> Used this for over 2 months, and saw zero improvement. I usually get spots around my mouth so I would place it at three different spots for three minutes. That&#x27;s nine minutes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue I have with this is how it requires you to see nothing during the procedure, as the googles won&#x27;t let you. But that would have been OK if it actually worked. So far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. My acne appears and dissapears every 1-2 weeks, just like it did before I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate that I have to replace the bulbs every 600 applications. It sounds like a lot, but it&#x27;s not. Each application is 3 minutes, so I use 3 applications per day just for the mouth area. If your acne is spread throughout your face you might need to apply this for 18+ minutes. That&#x27;s six applications per day. So you have only about 3 months of use before having to replace the bulb head.</li>
            <li> Since this is a long-term acne treatment system, I thought it would make sense to update my review periodically with my new findings, praises, critiques, discoveries, and results.  So far, however, I will say that I am very impressed and plan to buy a replacement head/batteries when they are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK ONE:  This was an experimental period. I connected the battery, put all the parts together, gave it a look-over, read the directions. That sorta thing. I also began using it, only once a day to start. What I discovered during this time are probably the biggest flaws:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Battery depletes very quickly. After 3-4 \\&quot;sessions\\&quot; you will need to plug it in and recharge for several hours. You cannot use the device while the battery is charging.&lt;br /&gt;2. The head sometimes requires a very firm press against the skin to turn on. This can be a frustration for the forehead and nose area, which are more curvy and less flat. No issues at all on cheeks or other flat-featured areas.&lt;br /&gt;3. Overheats quick. Even if the battery life was better, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this 4 or more times in a row because the device will overheat and automatically shut itself down until it cools off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consequently for those who would like to blast their entire face, you won&#x27;t be able to do it all in one sitting. It&#x27;s not so bad though. Just light up your 3 favorite problem spots, throw it on the charger, and later on that day do some other areas. It is a little frustrating, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be able to come up with a pretty good routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also during week one I couldn&#x27;t say I saw any drastic changes to my complexion. I did, however, feel like my face was less oily and a few spots did seem more evenly toned. And the best part was that there wasn&#x27;t any initial breakout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK TWO: after using the device pretty regularly, I decided that my face wasn&#x27;t going to react negatively to the LED light and that it might actually be helping my skin look better. I began to treat, as the directions suggest, the same areas two-three times a day to see if it made things even better. I think it does, though I will need to use the system for longer to fully determine that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this week I noticed a significant decrease in oil production in my skin. I don&#x27;t know if this product even advertised that it does that, but I think it&#x27;s true. My skin feels firmer and tighter, and overall cleaner. Some areas of my skin began to look significantly better while others seemed less effected. We&#x27;ll see if more time allows them to improve as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK THREE: Almost identical findings as week two. Skin feels/looks better. In some places extremely so, in others.. about the same. Nothing life-changing, or miracle-like just yet, but as I said, I&#x27;m very impressed with even the minor improvements that I think this will be worth the price of replacement heads and batteries when they are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK FOUR: More of the same results. Nothing too life-changing, when it says it only helps mild to moderate they aren&#x27;t kidding. In fact, saying it helps moderate may even be too kind. But, with that being said, it&#x27;s still probably more effective than most oral/topical treatments, and without the nasty side effects. I am still very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEXT UPDATE: I&#x27;ll update here when something new happens, or when I finish my 600 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**My overall opinion after only a little more than 3 weeks is that this is a great little gadget. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a cure, but it is certainly a good tool to keep handy. I use Cetaphil cleanser because I have very sensitive skin, but sometimes I feel like Cetaphil isn&#x27;t strong enough to combat my skin problems. Cetaphil + Verilux seems to be a really good combo though. No red skin, and some added strength against acne causing bacteria.ter.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo103Z4MT9QVGRO]]It is not an instance cure (and does not claim to).  It gets to the root cause to kill the bacteria, for certain kinds of mild to moderate acne, and results in 4-11 weeks.  It claims in studies to report 80% for the mild to moderate acne it targets.  The manual provides more extensive explanation of what is covered and what is not.  For example, it doesn&#x27;t cover razor bumps from shaving, inflamed hair follicles, curled hair under the skin, or larger inflamed issues.  It doesn&#x27;t use chemicals and it just light a flashlight with special blue LEDs, but the manual does state a lengthy list of precautions to avoid if pregnant, taking certain medications or topical creams, or certain kind of acne that you must take heed of.  You might get faster results with a 5% benzoyl peroxide cream.  But this supposedly will get to the root cause if caused by bacteria and not topical issues.  It was only mildly effective for me.  I would recommend for those who already know topical creams alone aren&#x27;t doing it and need to try to get to the root cause.  For infrequent acne, the speed and results are a bit slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPEED&lt;br /&gt;It is not an instance or overnight cure, and it makes no claims to.  It claims you should see results in 4-11 weeks.  Treatment speed is also moderately slow.  For each flat circular spot, it takes 3 minutes, 3 times a day (9 minutes a day), 2-3 times per week, for results in 4-11 weeks.  That is 18-27 minutes per week (per spot), and multiple by the number of spots you want to treat.  For one spot, 3 minutes for 3 times in the day isn&#x27;t too bad.  But to treat 3 to 5 it starts to feel lengthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer reports studies have shown an 80% success rate, which is pretty high, but remember that is for the duration of 4-11 weeks.  For 20%, there will be no success.  For me, it was definitely not or minimally effective with only a few treatments, and only mildly effective longer term.  I prefer the overnight success I get with 5% benzoyl peroxide cream for infrequent acne.  When I was a teenager, when no amount of washing helped enough, I would have loved a chance to try a multi-pronged approach, including this.  As an adult, I find faster success with the creams.  I suspect some initial success comes from the lightly-warming affect of the light which might melt some oil buildup much like a warm washcloth might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST&lt;br /&gt;It comes with only 600 treatments, measured by a computer chip in the head, and reported as a number on the front.  It stops once it counts down to 600.  The manufacturer claims 600 is the maximum that the LEDs can be guaranteed to be 100% effective.  Rather than continuing with less effectiveness, you can buy another head from the manufacturer.  So for the first 600, you can calculate the cost per dose (0.25), per day (0.75) per spot, per week (1.50-2.25) per spot, and and full course (6.00-24.75) (2-3 times per week, 4-11 weeks).  It can get expensive for more spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW&lt;br /&gt;(1) wash the area, (2) prepare for placement &amp; know where the button is, (3) put on the goggles with very limited visibility, (4) push button until it beeps once, (5) apply to area and hold for 3 minutes until it beeps twice.  Repeat 3 times per day (per spot), 2-3 times per week, for 4-11 weeks.  I recommend laying on a bed if you have to do a few spots so you can just let it lay gently instead of holding it for 9 minutes for 3 spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROBLEMS&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was the battery compartment screw was a bit tight and was already getting stripped.  It comes without the battery installed, like cordless phones, and you need to put it in.  Otherwise the construction seemed great.</li>
            <li> When I signed up to receive this item, I had no idea that it was not intended to treat cystic acne, of which recurs on me in 2 spots. Before you buy, be sure that you know what type of acne it&#x27;s intended to treat and what type it is not. I wish I had.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, between my Clarsonic Pro, Glymed facial wash and this Clearwave I see a difference in my skin. I have mild acne problems, with mild blackheads. I notice that when I am PMSing, the acne is a little worse in general and always on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a 1 income household so for me, this is a nice treat as we can&#x27;t afford going to the spa to get facials every week, that is why my husband bought me the Clarsonic Pro. I also feel like this is another special treat for me because of the same reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well with my Clarsonic to clear up my forehead breakouts and blackheads. I use this every other day 3 min on head on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this does work I think the price to maintain this is a bit high. You can only get 4 -3 min treatments out of 1 charge, so if you have more than a few spots to treat, you have to recharge (this can be a pain) the battery is 24.00 to replace and the head is 35.00 to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is by far cheaper than a weekly trip to the spa, it&#x27;s not for everyone due to the expenses of replacement parts. I also feel that if I didn&#x27;t have my Clarsonic Pro, that it would work, but having my Clarsonic I, definitely think it would not work as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend a good facial brush, scrub and great facial wash in conjunction with this product and I think you&#x27;ll be super happy as I am! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 03/10/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from 4 stars to 3 as I find it ever so annoying to keep charging this, plus I used it 1X on 1 spot on my forehead a few days ago and went to use it again and the battery was dead (yes, after 1 - 3 min cycle) I have been checking reviews from other sites, and there are many complaints about battery life. I thought I might have a faulty battery per Chandlers comment but it&#x27;s just a poorly made battery. I am still happy with how it does help with acne but they need to design a better battery for the $35.00 price tag for a replacement!ement!</li>
            <li> My wife and I used this for 2 weeks.  I only have a couple of zits while she has several.  I guess we can say we are not part of the 80% who experienced successful results.  Mine didn&#x27;t have much difference and my wife also didn&#x27;t experience much difference.  The other thing she noticed was that her pimples feel hardened underneath the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of treatment is painless without the use of any chemicals.  The idea is to shine lights that can penetrate deep enough to your skin and help kills the bacteria that are present in acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also surprised that it needs to be charged every day.  I plugged this on and docked it on the charger overnight the first time I unboxed it.  I thought they were just LED lights and supposed to be very minimal in energy consumption, but the charges don&#x27;t last very long.  Another thing, 3 minutes per application is not that long, but if you have more than one, you can easily spend half an hour or more; then multiply that 3 times a day and you know what I mean.  It is tiring to stand that long so we brought it to the bed and start using it while lying down.  Sometimes it is hard to tell when it is on if you are not in front of the mirror and doesn&#x27;t see the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verilux is a familiar brand in our house.  They make full spectrum lights which I love as if it brings sunlight in your house, particularly in the winter months when it is too cold to go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the time spent is a small sacrifice if it really works.  We know how depressing it is to have zits.  Alas, it wasn&#x27;t that effective in our case.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has been using the Clearwave system for about 3 weeks now.  Her breakouts range from severe to moderate acne problems.  Once she started using the Clearwave system, I noticed a mild change in her acne after just a few uses.  The more severe the acne, though, the LESS of an effect I saw from the device.  It has only been a little over 3 weeks, so we will see how the device performs over a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says there is no discomfort when using the Verilux, and she has been trying to keep up with the treatments.  I think it does require a little bit more commitment than using any of the over the counter offerings currently available.  Her skins does look clearer and less oily, though and I would guess this has a lot to do with helping with the mild acne breakouts.  It does require constant charging of the battery, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  She generally recharges it after each use.  I would recommend this product for mild acne breakouts, and maintaining a daily skin treatment regimen.  I have not seen good enough results YET to recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li> I said I&#x27;m going to give this a little while longer to produce results. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now, and it seems like I&#x27;ve had more break-outs than clearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the charger to be very sensitive. Sometime it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. The product has to be on an extremely flat surface to charge and I have problems trying to get it to start initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I will give this another month to work, if no results, I will discontinue use.</li>
            <li> its not working just taking away you&#x27;re money not you&#x27;re acne not recommended and the charger didn&#x27;t work by me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Verilux for approximately two weeks, and this products takes time to work. I have adult acne, especially around my chin area. There is a warning in the manual to NOT use this product on your neck area because it could possibly overstimulate your thyroid -- just so you know. I have areas on my neck that need to be treated. Also, one 3-minute treatment only covers the area the same size as the Verilux head, so you&#x27;ll have to use several treatments at a time to cover all areas where you may have breakouts. After 3 or so treatments, my Verilux overheats and I have to let it cool off before I can continue using it. It&#x27;s also difficult to use on and around the nose -- areas where I also need to treat. The manual does say that you may experience a worsening of acne breakouts as the product draws out bacteria and impurities from the skin; I did notice a little worsening on my chin but it&#x27;s been healing rather quickly. Skin my show improvement with continuous use over a period of time -- but this product is definitely not a quick fix (there is no quick fix for acne, and it&#x27;s not for me. I also use products like Noxema cleanser and Clinique Toner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged that well and battery dies quickly. U can only use couple of passes then need to charge</li>
            <li> My sister has been getting frequent acne breakouts now that she&#x27;s hit her teenage years so I got light system for her to try. She has used it for several weeks and so far there has been some improvement in her skin. The redness from her acne is less noticeable and there are less breakouts overall. Her skin is still not perfectly clear, but it has made enough of a difference that people who hadn&#x27;t seen her in a while commented on how good she looked. She likes the light better than a rotating cleansing brush because it doesn&#x27;t aggravate her already irritated skin. She has tried many various drugstore and prescription acne medications before and while some have helped, the side effect of most of them was very dry, irritated skin. The light wand has improved her skin without the drying side effects. Since it is working, she&#x27;s going to continue using the light and I&#x27;ll update this review in a couple months with a progress report. If you&#x27;re looking for some instant miracle cure for acne, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed, but it does seem to be a worthwhile product to try for someone suffering with breakouts. Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin and type of acne is different, so it will likely work better on some than others. The instruction guide gives more specific info on what types of acne it is designed for. Basically it&#x27;s for mild to moderate acne and not recommended for someone with severe nodule acne or severe cystic acne. If you have either of the latter forms of acne, the product won&#x27;t help. The system comes with goggles to protect the eyes from the light. As far as the battery charge, we charged it for 12 hours before using it like the instruction sheet said. The battery charge has held pretty well unlike some other users have found. So far, we&#x27;re happy with the results and glad we tried this.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this item a fair shake. Just opening the box and writing a review here (being a Vine voice) just so I could get my hands on something new, seemed a bit unreasonable, so I&#x27;ve been using it for about four weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m a late 30s male who did suffer pretty bad acne as a youngster and still have the odd scar and the occasional pimple, despite my age. I certainly didn&#x27;t expect this to clear up the small amount of scarring I still have, but when I have gotten a little pimple here and there over the past few weeks, this Verilux system has done a pretty decent job of clearing it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not going to work for very severe acne (or to clear pre-existing scarring), but for moderate breakouts (especially for younger folks or teenagers), I think it looks quite promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep working with it for a few more months and see how it goes and update this review. Initially, it seems like it could be effective for the price and it&#x27;s very simple to use and operate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so frustrating when, no matter what you do, some breakouts just will NOT totally clear up!  Well, this Verilux Clearwave Phototherapy tool for acne WILL END THOSE BLEMISHES regardless of whatever else you have tried! And, following the directions, your skin will STAY clear! Use it ANYWHERE breakouts are a problem, like your back (with help, of course) and you&#x27;ll see a dramatic difference. Bad breakouts take more than a few treatments to dry up, but they WILL disappear over time.  I plan to keep this little baby in my \\&quot;tool box\\&quot; forever!</li>
            <li> So here we have a phototherapy system with limited usage on the head. I have tried this out a few times, however I am not completely sold on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my issues:&lt;br /&gt;- May take several weeks to notice results? That doesn&#x27;t seem terribly efficient to me.&lt;br /&gt;- Use up to three times per day with a relatively small head - so now we are using up the limited light head three times as fast?&lt;br /&gt;- the light heads are actually kind of hard to find....odd as that seems to be how this product makes money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing this technology works as I haven&#x27;t really had the patience or the real requirement to use it. I get occasional breakouts and alcohol or other typical treatments work fairly well for me. Within a day or two, clears up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other phototherapy products, while more expensive, do not seem to have the limited lifespan of effectiveness this has on the LEDs. I&#x27;m no LED scientist, however I don&#x27;t buy that these LEDs lose their effectiveness all of a sudden after the usage period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that the replaceable head is simply a way for the company to make money on those replacement heads. Again, from what I can tell, the product does work as advertised, I just don&#x27;t know this is the best way to go about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> We have twin sons who are 14, who have been battling moderate to more severe acne for over a year now.  I am relentless with them in keeping their faces washed and in using acne products to help dry up and keep their acne under control.  Over the weekend, my husband and I were just browsing in the mall and stumbled across this product that we had never heard of.  After doing some research and reading reviews, we decided to give it a try.  I have to honestly tell you that after only 3 days of treatment twice daily, the results are remarkable.  Our oldest twin \\&quot;R\\&quot; has a more fair complextion and his results were noticable the next day.  Our yonger twin \\&quot;S\\&quot; is not as fair so his results did not show up till the third day.  On both boys the swelling of the acne spots are reduced by at least 70% and the white and black heads appear to be drying up and going away.  After \\&quot;S\\&quot; treated his face tonight, two of the blackheads on his cheek were literally being drawn out of his skin!  It was like nothing I have ever seen. We are thrilled with the initial results and are anxious to see how this goes as time moves forward.</li>
            <li> First off let me say the product works.  If you have one of those nasty under the surface painful zits that just wont come to a head - this will take care of it.  It does take several minutes.  If you only have one zit - that is just fine.  However I seem to have adult acne all over my face and this device only covers an area about the size of a fifty cent piece.  It would take all night to cover my whole face, and for results they recommending treating more than once a day - I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to assist with a form of adult acne that I have.  It basically works for typical acne.  Not as effective as I had hoped for the type I have but am continuing to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now, and a couple of trouble areas I&#x27;ve had for a long time seem to be improving. The unit itself seems very well put together. It seems very solid and is very straightforward to use. If you&#x27;re looking to spend a lot of money on a skin product, I&#x27;d probably go with the Clarisonic first. This unit, however, is a nice compliment that can be used on a daily basis. The goggles that come with it seem to work pretty well, although I feel like they could be better. Overall, this seems like a pretty good system, albeit at a prett high price.</li>
            <li> I have breakouts every once in a while and whiteheads on my chin. And my husband sometimes has breakouts. We were both very skeptical. But this really does work. It is a three-min blue light treatment. You hold it on the affected area and within a day or so it clears up. Seems to be cheaper than some of the other systems out there as well.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, but it might be better for teen&#x27;s than adults.  I have used it for three months with moderate results. Far less expensive than those sold by my Dr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It clearly indicates it is NOT for Rosacea, which many of us 40+ people suffer from.  What is does do, is clear the skin from bacteria in a fast, and easy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my skin feels tighter, and wrinkle reduction, which is most welcome!  Very easy to use, and is built well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not dislike it, but I am not in love with it, either. Honestly, I like it BEST for the wrinkle reduction, which it is NOT intended for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good value, something to consider.</li>
            <li> The verilux product does not work near as effectively as the other lights. My acne has not gotten any better by using this product but has with other lights. It might be the light wave or something. Also, by not being able to really move it because of the touch sensor it just dries out my skin and i can move it around my face very much. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Battery life is terrible. Overheats too easily. I really expected more for the price I paid. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> OK, so i got the Verilux Clearwave because i work in a salon and i&#x27;d been using the ANSR beam previously but i&#x27;m not too concerned about needing red light therapy at this point. So along comes the Verilux which i was really excited about and i couldn&#x27;t tell you if it did or did not work because i was so fed up with it after several uses it has been stashed in a drawer. Why? Here&#x27;s the scoop, while i think that the concept behind this product is fantastic and sound the design is flawed. What if i have acne really badly on my chin or nose you would think oh i&#x27;ll use this on those areas. wrong. The Verilux head has to be directly in contact with the skin on all parts of the head for the light to stay on, so unless it is on a flat surface of your face (forehead or cheeks...or sometimes chin) then its going to turn right off. i was really bummed that i wasn&#x27;t able to use it like it was advertised, especially after spending the amount on it that i did :( Maybe they&#x27;ll come out with a more compact version that is able to reach the \\&quot;hard to get to\\&quot; areas.</li>
            <li> A review is hardly a place to be dumping your emotions, but I think you need to understand what drove me to try this product or anything like it in the first place. We are through the looking-glass with bizarre technology here, folks. Run a search for Victorian medical devices and you&#x27;ll see why I was leery of this thing. I have had acne for a long time, and I have tried everything from common rubbing alcohol to calling a televangelist for prayer, and nothing works. The only time that this mess ever cleared up was for a couple of years when I had a thyroid infection, and I had a raging case of thyroid hormone overproduction. That cleared up and the acne came back with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to make sure you understand that no matter how much you think you can help by clicking the comment button and copying/pasting your magical home remedy, or your spam website, or whatever it is you think you can throw at me and knock this out, it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve had temporary luck here and there where a treatment works at first, then I develop a resistance to it. That&#x27;s as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having acne--real acne, not a lone zit once or twice a year-- is kind of like being obese. Everyone can see it, and they make assumptions about you. They think it&#x27;s your fault, even that you&#x27;re doing it on purpose, or that you&#x27;ve somehow been negligent because you don&#x27;t care. They think you have poor hygiene, you&#x27;re lazy, or that you&#x27;re eating the wrong foods, and these assumptions can have absolutely disastrous consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne is a serious problem. Whether you want to admit it or not, this is a looks-based society and we judge a book by its cover. You will be passed over for promotions, or not get jobs in the first place, people won&#x27;t go on dates with you based on it, people won&#x27;t want to help you when you need it-- they won&#x27;t want to even sit next to you. Strangers say things to you that they wouldn&#x27;t say to anyone else. Adults mock other adults for it behind their backs and to their faces. It&#x27;s not just kids acting this way. I have gone from a retail clerk to upper corporate positions and it happens everywhere. It happens in section 8 housing and it happens to high-level executives. I have seen it, and no amount of denial or trivialization can change it. Acne hits every segment of humanity, and no one likes having it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no home remedy, drug or voodoo magic that I don&#x27;t know about, but people are relentless in their pursuit of giving me unsolicited advice (after they&#x27;ve mocked me and refused to give me a raise, of course). This extends to informing me that I have a problem in the first place, as if I didn&#x27;t notice the redness, inflammation, and bumps ON MY FACE IN A SOCIETY FULL OF MIRRORS. I know they think they&#x27;re being helpful, but do people with clear skin just never get tired of the sound of their own voice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this shouldn&#x27;t surprise me in America, where everyone becomes an expert ready for punditry on cable news whenever they think they see a problem. People see the rash on your face, and suddenly everyone&#x27;s a dermatologist who has the precise solution--if you&#x27;ve tried their way and it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t follow their exact regimen. It&#x27;s like Borger King: Have it Their way--your way is irrelevant! Their way always consists of some variation on some lame over the counter thing that everyone knows doesn&#x27;t work, usually something involving benzoyl peroxide and sandpaper. They think there is a one zit fits all solution for what can be a highly individualized problem, and nothing you have ever done before their advice counts. You are as lazy and ignorant as you were five minutes ago before they met you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is where the acne/obesity thing crosses streams-- everyone watches what you&#x27;re eating, and whatever you&#x27;re eating is WRONG, no matter what it is. I think you can begin to see what&#x27;s been itching me here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip side of trying everything(aside from draining you mentally and financially) is that when you take an interest in bettering your looks, people then decide that you are vain. People have told me that I am vain, that I am self-obsessed, looks-obsessed, shallow, and a snob because I pursue clear skin. I&#x27;m arrogant and I think I&#x27;m better than other people because I use makeup and want to feel attractive. I&#x27;m supposed to just sit here with oozing red lumps of infection on my face, I&#x27;m supposed to settle for scarring and tell everyone \\&quot;That&#x27;s alright; I don&#x27;t mind.\\&quot; Even as they point out all your flaws, other people will berate you for trying to fix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have to make sure that you don&#x27;t get better than them as the result of advice they gave you to feel better about themselves. They&#x27;re not interested in making you better; they&#x27;re interested in making THEM better. They want to feel better about themselves, whether it&#x27;s by feeling smarter or feeling more knowledgeable than YOU. It&#x27;s not YOU, it&#x27;s THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are you probably ARE superior to them. Personally, I&#x27;m tired of acting like I&#x27;m not worth it so that everyone else can be OK with themselves. Why should I have to lower my standards? Why shouldn&#x27;t they have to raise theirs? This isn&#x27;t just about acne. This is about my right to the pursuit of happiness, and the society of mediocrity that tells me I should settle for less and lower my expectations. TELL YOUR CONGRESSMAN AMERICA IS ABOUT FREEDOM--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, that&#x27;s enough. If you&#x27;ve stuck with it this far, you understand my frustration. You know that I&#x27;m in it to win it and failure is not an option. You are ready to go where no one has gone before and sit for 30+ minutes at a time with a flashlight on your face, and I&#x27;m ready to tell you what happened with this stupid light wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is pretty self-explanatory as far as assembly and charging go. Let it charge for 12 hours before you use it, and whatever you do, don&#x27;t drop the little screw that holds the battery compartment closed. You will never find the screw again if you drop it, but you can tape the cover in place if you do. Assuming you don&#x27;t die of boredom or frustration during use, you may want more than tape holding the battery in place. The indicator light may go off, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t still charging. Let it go the full 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will probably lose at least the first one of your 600 uses trying to figure out how to hold it on your skin evenly. The whole head has to be in contact with your skin to activate, and it seems to be very sensitive. 600 uses may sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s 600-3 minute sessions. Divide your face the way they recommend, then add in places they don&#x27;t count, like your neck or chest, and every time you put it on your skin, that&#x27;s a 3 minute session. I can easily see doing 12 sessions on my face and jawline alone. If you commit to this, you can see how it will eat away at your time and your wallet at $35 + shipping &amp; tax for replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head on this is small enough that you have to use multiple sessions to cover your face and maybe one other area, but large enough that you can&#x27;t get it into corners like around your nose, or on some areas like your temple, or on contoured areas like your jawline. If you break out around your nose, good luck making the light stay on long enough to do any good. It might be a good idea to get a small light for the little corners and use this one for larger areas, but that&#x27;s assuming this thing actually works, and we are not done agonizing through this just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the manual on hand because you will get strange messages on the display. HP does not mean that Harry Potter has arrived to zap your acne. It means the device is in Heat Protection mode--you need to allow a device designed to generate heat to cool off. It can also be too cold to operate. This thing puts the mental in temperamental. People are wiping the head down with rubbingalcohol between uses. I don&#x27;t get it. This thing kills germs on my skin, but it allows stuff to prosper on the very area which claims to kill the bacteria? None of this makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;592 uses left, and I still haven&#x27;t reached my forehead. I have hit HP twice and the battery ran low once. The max I seem to be able to get is 3 sessions before it goes into HP mode. I want to make Verilux eat this, but they probably all live in Kenya and are already eating exotic food products with President Obama&#x27;s cousins (WOOF!). I&#x27;m too tired to swim across the ocean and you should not submerse the device in water. Why am I bothering at this point? Oh yeah, it cost way too much to just use as a flashlight and I have these unspeakable breakouts. Is it working? It&#x27;s too soon to tell, and in corners, like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well no one said it would be cheap, easy or endurable. It certainly isn&#x27;t refundable, at least not through Amazon. So we must plod forward even in the face of certain doom. While we wait for results, let&#x27;s go back to the Victorian medical device analogy. Did you run a search for them like I told you? This kind of malarkey is what I thought of when I first looked at LED skin lights. Most Victorian medical stuff did not have any science to back it up. It was a dark and smelly time, and there was no internet. A lot of it would be considered torture devices by today&#x27;s standards (I think I saw a copper-plated waterboard in there someplace) and most of it didn&#x27;t even begin to live up to outrageous claims. Of course these people believed in the regular use of opioids as a soft drink flavor, so we can&#x27;t completely write off everything they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have no idea what the long term effects of this thing will be. In 10 years, if you are reading a review I am writing whilst in the midst of a brave battle with skin cancer or Arnegram-Clark syndrome, refer back to this review. Of course we don&#x27;t know the long term effects of staring at a computer monitor on eyes desperately seeking an acne treatment that works, either, so I think it evens out. It is FDA approved, but these are the same people who approved a lot of stinkers too, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Thermaclear, and it works on those nasty huge ones that sit on your face for 6 months, hurt, and they leave a mark that lasts forever. There also does seem to be research that backs up the claim that this blue LED light will kill acne bacteria. The red claims to reduce wrinkles and jowls and stuff like that. I&#x27;ll try a red if I can ever get this thing to work, but it sure won&#x27;t be from this brand. I am getting this sneaking suspicion that I should have just bitten the bullet and bought the Quasar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing did make an immediate dent in the acne, especially the stubborn patches on my jawline. New ones are not emerging, ones already swollen appear to have stopped in their tracks, and the red patches seem to have gotten a healing boost. The problem is that this is the short term. Will light therapy stand the test of time, or will I move on to other voodoo products? It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell when this thing keeps choking on its own heating sensors and uses a battery that has ADD. Will it work on my forehead? I&#x27;ll certainly report back if I can ever get this thing to stay on long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economy is tanking. I can&#x27;t afford to waste money like this, and neither can anyone else. I will update on results with this thing as events warrant. LET IT BE KNOWN that I will not hesitate to amend this review and shred this product if I do not get better results than this. I reviewed a vacuum cleaner by this company and was similarly unimpressed. Maybe they should stick with just making lights and let someone who actually knows what they are doing create devices that use the lights. I&#x27;m going to stick with using this wand (at least until the fascist head tells me I have no more uses left).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you are on the fence about a light therapy skin device, you should take the plunge, but not with this product. Ansr is next on my list, and after that, I may go on to MIT for experimental radioactive treatment that will make me have babies with nine heads, or possibly to a good old-fashioned snake oil salesman. At least snake oil salesmen knew when to sit down and shut up, and I can&#x27;t say that for all the jerks who have been putting their 2 cents in on my skin all these years, and there&#x27;s something to be said for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/17/2012 EDIT THE FIRST: After a good, full two weeks of use, I can confirm that this thing is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Blue LEDs have stopped my acne dead in its tracks. I have not had a single new breakout in any area of treatment. I only have the pre-existing areas that are healing. Not one new red splotch, bump or cyst. The two biggest problems with this product are cost of replacement heads, and it goes into heat protection mode every 3rd or 4th session. This makes it even more cost-prohibitive than, and as tedious as, the Quasar Baby Blue. I think a better alternative is the [[ASIN:B005XSPD3S BrightPad BT-L84 Acne Light]], especially if you want to also try red light for its healing and anti-aging properties. Wear the goggles with whatever device you use. Do not trust these people who claim it&#x27;s safe for your eyes, because the fact is we don&#x27;t know. Better safe than sorry. My doctor said LEDs used this way are OK. Yours may disagree. If it can affect people taking thyroid medication, that tells me this light is going more than skin deep. More edits to follow, but I am going to get a different device when I run out of uses on this.alcohol between uses. I don&#x27;t get it. This thing kills germs on my skin, but it allows stuff to prosper on the very area which claims to kill the bacteria? None of this makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;592 uses left, and I still haven&#x27;t reached my forehead. I have hit HP twice and the battery ran low once. The max I seem to be able to get is 3 sessions before it goes into HP mode. I want to make Verilux eat this, but they probably all live in Kenya and are already eating exotic food products with President Obama&#x27;s cousins (WOOF!). I&#x27;m too tired to swim across the ocean and you should not submerse the device in water. Why am I bothering at this point? Oh yeah, it cost way too much to just use as a flashlight and I have these unspeakable breakouts. Is it working? It&#x27;s too soon to tell, and in corners, like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well no one said it would be cheap, easy or endurable. It certainly isn&#x27;t refundable, at least not through Amazon. So we must plod forward even in the face of certain doom. While we wait for results, let&#x27;s go back to the Victorian medical device analogy. Did you run a search for them like I told you? This kind of malarkey is what I thought of when I first looked at LED skin lights. Most Victorian medical stuff did not have any science to back it up. It was a dark and smelly time, and there was no internet. A lot of it would be considered torture devices by today&#x27;s standards (I think I saw a copper-plated waterboard in there someplace) and most of it didn&#x27;t even begin to live up to outrageous claims. Of course these people believed in the regular use of opioids as a soft drink flavor, so we can&#x27;t completely write off everything they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have no idea what the long term effects of this thing will be. In 10 years, if you are reading a review I am writing whilst in the midst of a brave battle with skin cancer or Arnegram-Clark syndrome, refer back to this review. Of course we don&#x27;t know the long term effects of staring at a computer monitor on eyes desperately seeking an acne treatment that works, either, so I think it evens out. It is FDA approved, but these are the same people who approved a lot of stinkers too, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Thermaclear, and it works on those nasty huge ones that sit on your face for 6 months, hurt, and they leave a mark that lasts forever.

            <li> It actually really helps, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  But when I say it helps, I mean it is not the magical solution all of us dealing with acne are dreaming of.  I still have to be vigilant with my skin care, and diet, and i have to use the bluelight every night.  Although if I miss a night once in a while its not a big deal, but if I try to use it every other night, I don&#x27;t get much results.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed but no the light did not improve my acne. We are in the process of doing Accutane after 7 years of suffering with constant breakouts</li>
            <li> I bought this product knowing that these types of devices always have drawbacks.  The most frequently reported drawback being time invested in treatment.  I have used Tria products and yes, it is time-consuming but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review, but felt that this product is such a rip off that I had to warn other people.  It works by giving you 3 minute cycles for each area you can treat underneath the circular head.  First and foremost, it overheats every 2 cycles, so you can only treat about a 5 inch circular area and then have to wait at least a half hour for it to cool down. After 2 to 3 cycles, the battery dies.  Then you have to wait over 3 hours for it to charge up.  So this means, approximately every 3 to 4 hours you can treat 3/4 of a cheek.  Since the recommended times that you do treatments per day is up to 3xs, depending on the severity of your acne, to do 2 cheeks it takes 12 hours (including the wait time to recharge and cool down)TO COMPLETE ONE TREATMENT! DO the math, there aren&#x27;t enough hours in the day to do three treatments.  Forget about the forhead and chin, you do have to sleep and go to work to afford the laser heads each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a horrible product and I feel like I have been truely ripped off for the first time in my life.  Amazon should not allow these people to sell such a low quality product on their website.</li>
            <li> I would never have purchased this item if the marketing dept. had made the customer very clear once opened it cannot be returned. Now I have a product I&#x27;m stuck with not to mention eating the cost!</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for about 1 month and love it! I get most hormonal acne and stopped using all topical treatments about 3 months ago. This is a great solution for acne if you want something that helps prevent and it not full of toxic chemicals. It takes a few weeks for it to start to make a difference but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this in use for several months now.  The Clearwave is well constructed and has held up well.  I do see a positive effect in reducing acne, but not a profound effect.  I do notice a bit of a rash with each use.  If I use too little it doesn&#x27;t work, but if I use it as intended it works but I get red blotches.  I guess I have sensitive skin and have discontinued the use because of this reason.</li>
            <li> The Verilux Clearwave Phototherapy System for Acne is awesome and I could see a result in my skin after the second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the product page, the Verilux:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Painlessly destroys acne-causing bacteria in skin pores without harming surrounding tissue&lt;br /&gt;B. Cleared by the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne, this easy-to-use device is rechargeable, portable and ergonomically designed with single button operation&lt;br /&gt;C. Chemical free, drug free and won&#x27;t bleach your linens and clothing&lt;br /&gt;D. Detects contact with the skin and dispenses a powerful, acne-clearing 3-minute application of therapeutic blue light to the affected area&lt;br /&gt;E. Comes with a rechargeable battery pack, charging stand, power supply, goggles and instructions for use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I would recommend this product to any and everyone who will listen.  My skin is brighter, more toned, and looks so much cleaner.  Blackheads are no more and I just can&#x27;t write enough great things about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go, go right now, and order this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
