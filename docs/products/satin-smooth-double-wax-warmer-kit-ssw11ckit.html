            <li>Over all I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.  </li>
            <li>When I was looking for the kit I was mostly looking for something for beginners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best starting kit I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>One thing I would advise for anyone purchasing this kit is too order more applicator sticks and wax strips.</li>
            <li>Love my kit.</li>
            <li>The video was very nice to help educate me since really had no idea what I was doing.</li>
            <li>The instructional CD its great for new users.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, easy to clean, products are exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>I like the dual warmer which makes it easy for me when having to use a variety of waxes.</li>
            <li>But the Honey wax works fine.</li>
            <li>The strips seems cheap.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and easy to use, easy lt clean and  to and store.</li>
            <li>(keep a clean face and and use a clean razor)</li>
            <li>But the bottles of all the other products included are huge and very nice.</li>
            <li>The kit came with full size cleansers and lotions.</li>
            <li>Heats was quick.</li>
            <li>But for what its worth their products work an do as they say an easy to understand for first timers.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny totally good and the double warmer is really time saving</li>
            <li>/&gt;Heats up 10 mins or so, durable strong and easy to use would definitely recommend this unit to anyone!!</li>
            <li>it works well as of right now, i don&#x27;t have any complaints.  </li>
            <li>Once he matures a little more and develps better hygiene</li>
            <li>But make sure to order a case of extra sticks.</li>
            <li>Be sure to order extra cloths and applicators.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think about saving and buying one warmer save more by buying this this kit includes everything you might need but purchase more wax of ourselves hard wax as well</li>
            <li>The video and accompanying instructions were clear and easy to follow and all the products you need to prepare, follow-up and complete are included and in substantial amounts.</li>
            <li>It came so fast too.</li>
            <li>It would be cheaper to go to the dollar store and buy sticks and just go buy a whole role of strips and cut them yourself.</li>
            <li>My skin was very irritated for days after using.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with it.</li>
            <li>I feel like such a professional :)</li>
            <li>The extra lotions and oils it comes with are nice as well; I&#x27;ve found myself using everything except the pink lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Satin Smooth Professional Double Warmer Kit</li>
            <li>I am not a professional user and after trying some other wax kits with less than satisfactory results, I found this one effective and very easy to use at home.  </li>
            <li>Only came with a small amount of strips and sticks so make sure you pick some more up before attempting a large wax like a Brazilian or back.</li>
            <li>Product met all expectations and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>So new to waxing an</li>
            <li>but after trying this first don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever want to try a different brand</li>
            <li>The products are good, but the wax and strips sucks!!</li>
            <li>I love the wax that comes with kit and the hard wax.</li>
            <li>I was so shocked by the great quality and fast service.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the creme wax it came with.</li>
            <li>Nearly ripped my skin off.</li>
            <li>I am a skin care professional, so I have experience in waxing.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the brand, I have sensitive skin and none</li>
            <li>My 12yr old son has a mustache</li>
            <li>I am a licensed professional and I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>But seriously having two different waxes ready for use at same time is the way to go specially if you have fine hair on thighs an a little thicker hair in bikini area or on calves.</li>
            <li>You get a little of all that you need, you do need to purchase some more waxing strips and sticks because there are not enough to last very long.</li>
            <li>The set is good, but pink wax in useless.</li>
            <li>And like the other reviewer said, you will need to purchase more stick and strips, but they give you enough to do a couple sets of legs or whatever at least.</li>
            <li>The warmer itself is fast and efficient (it takes less than 30 minutes for a cold wax can to heat all the way up,) and the two types of soft wax it comes with are handy, though I would&#x27;ve appreciated a hard and a soft wax if it were at all possible.</li>

            <li> 4 large, 3 small and 3 petite wood applicators.  </li>
            <li> It is brand new and has a few extras that i didn&#x27;t need</li>
            <li> Beware that you may order something and only get partial of what you want.</li>
            <li> also bought hard wax for fine hair an another hard wax for medium hair</li>
            <li> and the warmers will work with other waxes Iv noticed if your a big gigi fan or another brand</li>
            <li> What I wanted was the single warmer and couldn&#x27;t find at the time.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the single wax warmer kit.</li>
            <li> but when I opened the package the lotion leaked all over the other bottles.</li>
            <li> I used hard wax for a long time and never had problems with it.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations but the wax is a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the home kit to save a little money.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t adhere to the skin as much so waxing is just a tad bit less painful.</li>
            <li> Very Messy to use.</li>
            <li> It does not get hard...</li>
            <li> I also ordered the cherry hard wax.</li>
            <li> They send you very little of everything!!</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> if then were irritating.</li>
            <li> He started sprouting random chin hairs</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that when I received this product it was missing 3 items.</li>
            <li> very unhappy  with purchase.</li>
            <li> The honey wax, however, is awful.</li>

            <li> Exactly as described!  Perfect for starter kit!!</li>
            <li> Good starter kit. I like the dual warmer which makes it easy for me when having to use a variety of waxes.</li>
            <li> This is a great set. You get a little of all that you need, you do need to purchase some more waxing strips and sticks because there are not enough to last very long. You would save buying on here too, wax is $5 cheaper as well. I saved 32$ buying this set off here , which I was super about!! It came so fast too.</li>
            <li> This set was a great deal! The warmer itself is fast and efficient (it takes less than 30 minutes for a cold wax can to heat all the way up,) and the two types of soft wax it comes with are handy, though I would&#x27;ve appreciated a hard and a soft wax if it were at all possible.

And like the other reviewer said, you will need to purchase more stick and strips, but they give you enough to do a couple sets of legs or whatever at least. The instruction DVD is also handy if you aren&#x27;t already an experienced waxer. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this set!</li>
            <li> I am a recent Aesthetician graduate and used this warmer  at my school, I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was here before I got tracking information on it. I was so shocked by the great quality and fast service. Would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satin Smooth Professional Double Warmer Kit</li>
            <li> Met my expectations but the wax is a little sticky.</li>
            <li> So new to waxing an of course have a lot to learn but so glad I bought this also bought hard wax for fine hair an another hard wax for medium hair an found that is my best match. The video was very nice to help educate me since really had no idea what I was doing. But make sure to order a case of extra sticks. But seriously having two different waxes ready for use at same time is the way to go specially if you have fine hair on thighs an a little thicker hair in bikini area or on calves. and the warmers will work with other waxes Iv noticed if your a big gigi fan or another brand but after trying this first don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever want to try a different brand theirs is great an works for me just need to perfect my waxing. But for what its worth their products work an do as they say an easy to understand for first timers.</li>
            <li> Heats was quick. Comes with everything you need. Two great wax options included. I am an esthetician and I use this to wax clients</li>
            <li> It came and one pre wax cleanser was all over everything. It feels and looks cheap!! All plastic. They send you very little of everything!! It would be cheaper to go to the dollar store and buy sticks and just go buy a whole role of strips and cut them yourself.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional user and after trying some other wax kits with less than satisfactory results, I found this one effective and very easy to use at home.  The video and accompanying instructions were clear and easy to follow and all the products you need to prepare, follow-up and complete are included and in substantial amounts.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my daughter</li>
            <li> There are not 40 assorted size wooden applicators for the face and body.  There are only 20, 10 in each pack.  4 large, 3 small and 3 petite wood applicators.  I thought it said it was made in Glendale, AZ but it says made in China on the box and the dual wax warmer.  Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> The wax pot doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the way hott. The products are good, but the wax and strips sucks!! The strips seems cheap. Every time I used them the cotten would stick to the skin.</li>
            <li> The warmer itself is great. Heats up quickly and easy to use, easy lt clean and  to and store. I was pleasantly surprised with the creme wax it came with. It doesn&#x27;t adhere to the skin as much so waxing is just a tad bit less painful. The honey wax, however, is awful. Nearly ripped my skin off. I am a skin care professional, so I have experience in waxing. My skin was very irritated for days after using. I ended up just throwing it away. Thank goodness this was for personal use and not for clients. Although I definitely  would have tested it either way. The kit came with full size cleansers and lotions. I was pleasantly surprised with the brand, I have sensitive skin and none if then were irritating. Only came with a small amount of strips and sticks so make sure you pick some more up before attempting a large wax like a Brazilian or back. Over all I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great wax warmer! I got this for my daughter who is an estatician and she loves it! It comes with everthing you need to wax at home. I did however order extra sticks and paper as this kit does not come with a lot. But the bottles of all the other products included are huge and very nice. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works great and is a perfect starter kit as it comes with all the necessities needed for waxing.</li>
            <li> Very Messy to use. Doesn&#x27;t give enough tear strips in packet.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.  I haven&#x27;t been to the salon to have my face waxed in weeks (except to get my Brazilian).  I&#x27;m taking Viviscal for my hair loss and the hair on my face is sprouting!  I was paying almost $30 every 2 weeks to have my lip, eyes and sideburns taken off.  I decided to buy the home kit to save a little money.  Turns out I&#x27;m saving a lot.  My 12yr old son has a mustache and I can&#x27;t trust him to shave properly yet (keep a clean face and and use a clean razor) so I wax his lip too.  He loves it!  He started sprouting random chin hairs I waxed that too.  Once he matures a little more and develps better hygiene then I&#x27;ll let him shave but for now this is working great.  Those canister collars are awesome!  I feel like such a professional :)</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing kit. Everything you need to get your business started.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. When I was looking for the kit I was mostly looking for something for beginners. This one came with the DVD which is helpful. What I wanted was the single warmer and couldn&#x27;t find at the time. Now that I do see it I kinda regret getting the double. You don&#x27;t need that big of a warmer. If it&#x27;s just you using the wax kit I recommend getting the single wax warmer kit. It has everything you need. Be sure to order extra cloths and applicators. You will need them!</li>
            <li> The set is good, but pink wax in useless. It does not get hard...at all. Not even when i roll an ice-cube on it. I used hard wax for a long time and never had problems with it. Maybe because i used a blue wax. Very dissapointed with it. But the Honey wax works fine.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a Cosmetologist and was very happy to receive this gift.  And it came with everything, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> Everything was great &amp; it was a great price!! The lotion smells awesome! It&#x27;s the best starting kit I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works well.  And the extra stuff that came with it makes me feel like I just stepped out of a waxing salon.</li>
            <li> A+ seller!  Product met all expectations and would highly recommend.  Great quality and a must own for all waxing needs!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional and I ordered this product. I also ordered the cherry hard wax. I love the wax that comes with kit and the hard wax. It is an excellent product. One thing I would advise for anyone purchasing this kit is too order more applicator sticks and wax strips. The kit does not come with very many.</li>
            <li> I just graduated from school as an esthetician and we would use these double warmers at school as well. I love it! Works great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the actual product yet but when I opened the package the lotion leaked all over the other bottles. Just a heads up to anyone wanting go purchase it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny totally good and the double warmer is really time saving don&#x27;t think about saving and buying one warmer save more by buying this this kit includes everything you might need but purchase more wax of ourselves hard wax as well</li>
            <li> I bought  this 8 month ago..now 1 warmmer didnot work at all very unhappy  with purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that when I received this product it was missing 3 items. All of which are key items to preform a wax service such as the cleanser, aloe gel, and the hydrating lotion. Beware that you may order something and only get partial of what you want.</li>
            <li> it works well as of right now, i don&#x27;t have any complaints.  It is brand new and has a few extras that i didn&#x27;t need but it was there.  The instructional CD its great for new users.  I show it to my employees to enhance their skills..</li>
            <li> Love my kit. Great quality, easy to clean, products are exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> Great price, works great and cheaper here then at &amp;#34;professional only&amp;#34; beauty supply stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up 10 mins or so, durable strong and easy to use would definitely recommend this unit to anyone!!</li>
