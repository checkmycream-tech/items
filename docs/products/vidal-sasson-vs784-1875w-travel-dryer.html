            <li>I have a very curly hair, thank you to Vidal, my hair is beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a nice travel dryer for the price.  </li>
            <li>I had used this product before from another store and loved that it has an iconic setting for faster than ever drying.</li>
            <li>I had this handy throughout the trip.</li>
            <li>She liked it until that.</li>
            <li>I had one of these for 2 years and liked it.  </li>
            <li>because you know you have a good product and there had better be a spare on hand.</li>
            <li>This one is a good choice, I have owned many hair dryers</li>
            <li>All good and suits my needs, this I will be able to take with me where ever I travel in the world.</li>
            <li>- good, looks like Revlon but better grip on switch to low/high/off</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT a real &amp;#34;Best Buy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is extremely light and the most attractive dryer in this price range.    </li>
            <li>This item was delivered in a very timely fashion and is great value for the price! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, great for travel and surprisingly powerful for its size.</li>
            <li>and the good thing is you can take it with you so comfortable in your bag ..</li>
            <li>Light weight too, definately a good buy.</li>
            <li>It is light and flexible, and does a good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Very handy and useful</li>
            <li>And  for MN abate the cool is very easy!</li>
            <li>This is a very light dryer.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself is very light and</li>
            <li>Is very light &amp; compact.</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely and is easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>powerful and great that it folds for easy travel</li>
            <li>This little hairdryer is perfect...perfect size, perfect weight, perfect price and worked really well during my trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li>Love the compact size</li>
            <li>I even think it&#x27;s better than my home dryer.</li>
            <li>When I turned out the lights, the spark was even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>So glad nothing caught fire and that it didn&#x27;t get me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more compact.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you don&#x27;t use a brush to style your hair it will stay on better.  </li>
            <li>Could volumize better</li>
            <li>I have bought blow dryers for many many years.  </li>
            <li>i dont understand why is it soo cheap?!    </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this Product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I like this much better than a conair it replaced.</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I didn&#x27;t have any problems.  </li>
            <li>I love the dual voltage option.</li>
            <li>This used to be an OK dryer.  </li>
            <li>It would cost more than 50% of the price to avail yourself of this warranty.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for apartment life and styling my short hair with ease.</li>
            <li>I made sure it was on the lowest voltage</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>i use it to straighten my hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love is compact size and it is lightweight compared to others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>great but found Babyliss much lighter</li>
            <li>What more can you say.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I will be able to use it for my US travels, but it is not usable in Europe.</li>
            <li>I travel internationally quite often and this blow dryer is perfect!!</li>
            <li>I love the dual voltage and included diffuser.</li>
            <li>my favorite hair dryer for home and travel.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Works great, is very compact, and works as well as my full size hair dryer!</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good hair pressure/flow....</li>
            <li>Works great and is light weight which I really need.</li>
            <li>With a folding handle, it stores more easily.</li>
            <li>The size is very comfortable for my hand to hold, and it is light weight.  </li>
            <li>Nice cold air option makes it a win win. !</li>
            <li>The dryer was powerful and collapsed nicely for travel.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, easy to maneuver and blows the warm air just right.  </li>
            <li>The handle folds in for easy storage or travel.  </li>
            <li>It sparked and could have easily started a fire, yet when I tried to tell the supplier about it I find that it is &amp;#34;not eligible for return or replacement&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>What I find to be the most useful part of any hair dryer is the diffuser (the plastic attachment which focuses the air) as this allows for better control of air direction and focus.</li>
            <li>Also, easy to pack when I travel.  </li>
            <li>I borrow this when I was staying the night somewhere and loved it so much more than my old Conair hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is lightweight and has a fairly strong motor too.  </li>
            <li>Hair dries quickly and the unit is very light weight, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It drys your hair fast without being too hot which is great.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it comes out fine...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and folds up and packs easily.  </li>
            <li>It works fine and switching the 120-250V was no problem at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length and fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>previous version was perfect.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is fine for traveling.</li>
            <li>elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer for daily use or for travel.</li>
            <li>The dual wattage feature is great, especially if you&#x27;re traveling to Europe.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it folds, it has a place to hang it.  </li>
            <li>Great product this is my third one.</li>
            <li>I appreciate and genuinely enjoy using it every day, and I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>I find this aspect extremely important because it helps not to overdry/cook your hair and your face.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to go with what I had been happy with, but in the travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the light weight too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it and will look for another kind of travel dryer soon.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.</li>
            <li>smoke and a clanking sound this time).  </li>
            <li>I have had one before and liked it so much I bought another for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is light weight.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>So far I have loved my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Very powerful airflow.</li>
            <li>Very powerful for its size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, dries your hair quickly without frizz (my hair is curly) and is compact and stores easily.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than a normal hairdryer (perfect for traveling)</li>
            <li>Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs)</li>
            <li>But I learned that needing to return something to Amazon is rather straightforward.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for travel AND everyday use!</li>
            <li>The first functioned for more than two years, which I think is acceptable for a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a small and reliable hair dryer this is a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li>The good points of the dryer are that it is indeed very light weight and does dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>hairdryer is a great size, powerful more than other travel hairdryers and reliable.</li>
            <li>it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size to pack in a travel bag, but also good for everyday use, so I don&#x27;t need to have two dryers.</li>
            <li>A long time ago I had a huge Vidal Sasson dryer that I loved.  </li>
            <li>It does have a cool shot button</li>
            <li>I gave to my sister, and she didn&#x27;t even get one full use out of it.</li>
            <li>- good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great lightweight compact travel dryer that folds easily and takes up little space.</li>
            <li>Amazon promptly sent me a replacement (Customer service was fast, friendly and great) but the replacement unit did the same thing.</li>
            <li>i mean it preforms just great!!!</li>
            <li>It took up no room in my suitcase and is a much better alternative than the hair dryers that are in most European hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li>It dries the hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This dryer has alot of power and quickly dries my hair.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly but without burning.</li>
            <li>If you use a dryer without the diffuser you can notice your hair blowing around more wildly so it is useful for avoiding knots as well as keeping you from blowing hair upwards too much</li>
            <li>and it dries it well and quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has good heat, a lot of air force and easy to control the air flow with the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also smaller than my regular blow dryer and fits better in the suitcase.</li>
            <li>Looks like, when the dryer expands from getting hot, the attachment doesn&#x27;t quite fit snuggly anymore.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this dryer.</li>
            <li>Just warm air, does not dry hair.</li>
            <li>Fast and strong.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s not too hot!</li>
            <li>It was larger than I anticipated, but will work okay to travel!  </li>
            <li>This is the only hairdryer I have and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>The hot setting is hot and strong.</li>
            <li>and I commented that many times the excellence of a dryer Nose measured by its size but by the capacity and speed of its technology, as well as that of the hair dryer that I got on amazon a year ago, which is very good for its features, it weighs nothing, and is quick to dry your hair, since I bought this product on amazon, I have not used other than that</li>
            <li>Great little dryer.</li>
            <li>Great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Ceramic and high power dryers will provide hotter air allowing for quicker drying (however higher heats result in more damage and if you have thinner hair you should probably stick to lower heats).</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and everywhere you go.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful dryer.</li>
            <li>For $15 I think it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Nice and light, hair dries fast enough and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>powerful, durable and compact.  </li>
            <li>Since I liked the funcitonality, I bought a second one.  </li>
            <li>When drying your hair you must make sure that you always keep it clear of hair.</li>
            <li>The low setting is almost cool and blows very lightly.</li>
            <li>just packed it right in my luggage.</li>
            <li>(My hair is right to my shoulders.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, so now I use it as my main blow dryer.</li>
            <li>am sure this is a great size for travel especially since the handle folds, but I use it everyday and haven&#x27;t taken it anywhere.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  ;))</li>
            <li>Small and works great.</li>
            <li>The high setting is very powerful and it might not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>the plastic guards on the back are not as good as my old dryer - i.e. you have to watch out not to get your hair stuck in the backdraft</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;bubbly round design (see the bump on the top?) is elegant looking</li>
            <li>I would not recommend to people with fine hair or sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>Also, with my fine hair the high setting is much too hot for my scalp.    </li>
            <li>Good product for the price..a little louder than I thought</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a voltage problem, so when I was back in the US</li>
            <li>I will continue to try to find out how to encourage some sort of recall, but in the meantime, don&#x27;t risk this - be safe and buy a different dryer!</li>
            <li>The only problem I had, and many people may not have an issue with this, was the directional concentrator does not turn.  </li>
            <li>Does not get hot like a blow dryer should.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It worked like a charm the first three times.  </li>
            <li>cheap quality compared to my old vidal sasson hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Just change the voltage, add your adapter plug and you&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li>I brought this dryer and was so pleased I am buying a second one to keep at my dad&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>While I personally leave the ion option on, and find many claims that it does work, I cannot find any scientific research on the topic however see no reason not to use it.</li>
            <li>It has a cooling button on the back and an ion switch on the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;elegant design but more basic feel than</li>
            <li>Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb)</li>
            <li>I love the concentrator on this one, just on the low setting it works wonders!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it folds up and fits perfectly in my side pocket of my gym bag &amp; cuts time in half because it dries my hair so much faster than other dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I had other blow dryers I used in the meantime but bought this one again since I remember loving it.</li>
            <li>To be completely fair, I am reviewing last year&#x27;s version of this dryer, which looks similar (gold color), but who knows-</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this hair dryer for the year I had it because it was very compact and portable, however about two weeks ago as I was using the dryer it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li>Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>They have just as much power as other full size ones and love the settings on them.</li>
            <li>I doubted the positive reviews I read on this product but decided to try anyway for our overseas trip.  </li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference with my hair the first time i used this product.</li>
            <li>The spark was more pronounced when the unit was on high and then was switched off, than from low.</li>
            <li>- loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;</li>
            <li>ion&#x27;s,,the only drawback is that is has a button to cut the heat off(push) to set the curl, it just puts it in low speed, other than that its great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more powerful than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve used, which makes drying much faster.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle than the larger ones.</li>
            <li>love that this is small and light weight.</li>
            <li>Apparently my old hairdryer was pretty low quality because I LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>The dryer works fine, but I was looking to replace a travel dryer I already have, and this on is twice as big.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first because of some of the ratings that this particular item had received, but I took a chance and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Great little blow dryer that we definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for this hair dryer at $25 which includes taxes and delivery.</li>
            <li>Really, truly nothing has changed.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s VERY lightweight.</li>
            <li>and it comes with the concentrator, which I need because I tend to get the dryer really close to my hair</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>I like the power of this dryer and its ionic technology: it dries my hair fast and without drying it.</li>
            <li>This hair drier is collapsable, but by no means small.&lt;br /&gt;The power and heat is very inadequate.  </li>
            <li>The Vidal Sasson Ionic Travel dryer I received in the mail is working very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any traveler!</li>
            <li>My wife is very picky about her dryers.</li>
            <li>The fourth time it began emmitting a buzzing sound and smoke started coming out.  </li>
            <li>But bear in mind, that it is very unreliable.</li>
            <li>Much of the damage to hair comes from how people use the their hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that something this small could be so effective!</li>
            <li>The one from 2007 did not last long in my house because a family member liked it so much she took it home with her.</li>
            <li>so I did not feel the need to spend a fortune on a hair dryer with various special options or intense quality claims.</li>
            <li>Besides, the purpose of the cool shot button is not to cool down your scalp.  </li>
            <li>It is light and small, BUT very powerful.  </li>
            <li>and I would be hesitant to put it on high as it seemed that it would really be pushing the limit.  </li>
            <li>This works, and as an added bonus folds and packs in a suitcase quite easily (and is smaller than my old one)</li>
            <li>The first time I used the dryer it immediately made a loud noise and smoke started coming out.</li>
            <li>I sometimes flip my hair upside down to dry it because it gives hair a lot more volume when I felt a huge pull on my head and smelt burning hair.</li>
            <li>I love how it folds to take up less room in my bag.  </li>
            <li>if only the concentrator was more solid.</li>
            <li>but OK..the older aqau/green model rocked...</li>
            <li>If you need such precise attention you are likely aware of it and did not consider this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High produces high wind speed and high temperature.</li>
            <li>Very packable and is more powerful than my everyday BIG one at home!!</li>
            <li>The high mode doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This dries my hair just as fast as any other professional standard I&#x27;ve used, and is nice and compact.  </li>
            <li>For me, the most important thing about a travel dryer is strong airflow, but that can be hard to find: so many are super-hot but offer only very weak flow.</li>
            <li>I use it more to set my style after I&#x27;ve dried it.</li>
            <li>This is normal for dual-voltage appliances.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still stronger and better than quite a few others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;bubbly round design (see the bump on the top?) makes bulky packing</li>
            <li>It is smaller in size than my previous models, but very powerful!!  </li>
            <li>Hair dryers generally do the same thing, provide warm air to help dry your hair.</li>
            <li>: I haven&#x27;t thought about this too much until I read the other reviews, and, you know, they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough to make your hair dry quickly.</li>
            <li>This dryer has the high heat put out for fast drying but is light and portable for everyday use or travel.</li>
            <li>When I used it overseas, I got the same amount of power on the lower setting as I get with the higher setting in a 110 outlet, so I did not ever put it on high.  </li>
            <li>and I was thrilled with how fast it dried my hair!!!</li>
            <li>to buy a new one instead of trying to send this one to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>This new version is lighter and even quieter.</li>
            <li>This new one is larger and does not get as hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Amazon and by chance searched to see if I could find this product here, needless to say I&#x27;m PSYCHED and loving ordering this way!</li>
            <li>Heat is very gentle on hair than other dryers I&#x27;ve tried which were too hot.</li>
            <li>My hair felt softer, shinier and it dried my hair pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li>It left my hair looking really straight!</li>
            <li>Its small and cute.</li>
            <li>I need low to still be hot for styling.</li>
            <li>I has a one year \\&quot;joke\\&quot; warranty, which means you can return it only during the first 30 days.  </li>
            <li>The directions say to use on low setting when changing the voltage to 240, so I did and with the higher voltage</li>
            <li>My old one gave up on me after faithfully working well all over the worl for 14 years!</li>
            <li>Though I was able to get a little more use out of the replacement one, I would&#x27;ve expected a hair dryer to last more than at least a year!</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair and use the dryer to style my hair as much as dry it.</li>
            <li>but as long as you&#x27;re careful it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>If you need a hair dryer for simply drying your hair or for daily styling needs yet do not need all the special options expensive hair dryers advertise this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Certain parts of styling are made easier by correct use of different heats and at times the cooling option.</li>
            <li>I do buy quality product as I am not rich to buy cheap things that break.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it seemed that it was a great small hair dryer to always have at hand in a small bathroom &amp; for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a really loud dryer.</li>
            <li>I changed the voltage before I left so it was ready to go upon my arrival.  </li>
            <li>The hair remains soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this dryer on 3 trips so far</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of them in the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>I had an old hair dryer from Vidal Sasson which was over 10 years old.</li>
            <li>It was even taking longer time compare to the 10 years old one.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is also loud (however my old one did claim to be \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;).     </li>
            <li>I do not find the noise volume to be uncomfortably loud.</li>
            <li>As soon as it came I threw out my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair and when my old dryer suddenly burned out I wanted something light weight but powerful enough to dry my hair fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Again, customer service was fast friendly and didn&#x27;t give me a hard time about this problem.  </li>
            <li>It is a small compact size and fits easily in my drawer.</li>
            <li>I was also not able to turn the voltage button easily.  </li>
            <li>The third overheated and burned out within days, and the fourth OVERHEATED AND BURNED OUT LITERALLY THE FIRST TIME I USED IT.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough on the low setting to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer has two settings: low and high.</li>
            <li>Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.</li>
            <li>I never use the high setting because the low seems to be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its small, and fits in luggage, and is cheap.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast - and I have long</li>
            <li>I have normal, straight, thick hair which is not difficult to manage</li>
            <li>It blew a little harder, so it had decent air movement, if that blowing feel is important to you.  </li>
            <li>but I certainly couldn&#x27;t dry my hair in any reasonable time using it only on LOW.  </li>
            <li>, the low setting actually blows like it&#x27;s on high!</li>
            <li>It was coming right where the unit folds down.</li>
            <li>It offers only high and low speed options.</li>
            <li>This model is not as small as my original travel hairdryer</li>
            <li>Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight</li>
            <li>I have a ton of long hair and it only takes me about 3 minutes to full dry it.</li>
            <li>Not really a travel dryer because it is still a large product</li>
            <li>the low setting in a 220 outlet is the same power as you get on high in a 110 outlet.  </li>
            <li>but yet it&#x27;s still powerful enough to dry my super thick hair.</li>
            <li>I flat iron my hair but blow dry it first.  </li>
            <li>Most of my hairdryers go 5+ years, so I feel a little let down by this one.  </li>
            <li>Well, how long is a hair dryer really supposed to last?  </li>
            <li>Finally, one day as I was blow drying my hair it sparked at the outlet where it was plugged in and completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>Recent models are faulty; do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>It barely dries my hair.</li>
            <li>Functioned as promised but it frizzled out on me after two years (smoke and sudden loud noises).  </li>
            <li>Nice product, but web site fails to add this warning from the printed Operating Instructions that come with the hair dryer: &amp;#34;The dryer switch must be in and remain in the &amp;#34;LOW&amp;#34; operating position when using 250 volts.</li>
            <li>the ON button is a rocker switch which is hard to turn on and with 3 settings, easy to overshoot the middle position.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that a previous reviewer said that it wasn&#x27;t too hot, because my experience is just the opposite.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the concentrator is fairly easy to knock off again, otherwise this would have had 5 stars for its price.  </li>
            <li>My last dryer dried my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>My only critique is that it only has a high and low setting.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a dryer that folds for travel and yet is powerful enough to dry my long hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be more annoyed since it&#x27;s such a hassle to return things.</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you&#x27;re on vacation and need a dryer that does the bare minimum, but not for regular use.</li>
            <li>I hope it will keep blowing my hair for a long time as the old one did.</li>
            <li>Small but powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small but still has a powerful blow.</li>
            <li>The review would have been higher, however the movement of the low/off/high switch does not smoothly give the desired location.</li>
            <li>I also like that it folds in half making it much easier to pack and store.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry my hair a lot faster even though it&#x27;s the same wattage as my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>I tried to deal with it by holding it farther away from my head, but even so, if a single hair goes astray and ends up near the back end of the dryer then it gets ripped out, sucked into the motor and burned.</li>
            <li>My previous one which was the same model,  only lasted a couple of years, but I don&#x27;t expect much for the price, and would replace it with the same one again.  </li>

            <li> and the good thing is you can take it with you so comfortable in your bag ..</li>
            <li> Light weight too, definately a good buy.</li>
            <li> It is light and flexible, and does a good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Very handy and useful</li>
            <li> And  for MN abate the cool is very easy!</li>
            <li> This is a very light dryer.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself is very light and</li>
            <li> Is very light &amp; compact.</li>
            <li> It folds up nicely and is easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> powerful and great that it folds for easy travel</li>
            <li> This little hairdryer is perfect...perfect size, perfect weight, perfect price and worked really well during my trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li> Love the compact size</li>
            <li> I even think it&#x27;s better than my home dryer.</li>
            <li> When I turned out the lights, the spark was even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> So glad nothing caught fire and that it didn&#x27;t get me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more compact.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you don&#x27;t use a brush to style your hair it will stay on better.  </li>
            <li> Could volumize better</li>
            <li> I have bought blow dryers for many many years.  </li>
            <li> i dont understand why is it soo cheap?!    </li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love this Product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> I like this much better than a conair it replaced.</li>
            <li> I was so glad that I didn&#x27;t have any problems.  </li>
            <li> I love the dual voltage option.</li>
            <li> This used to be an OK dryer.  </li>
            <li> It would cost more than 50% of the price to avail yourself of this warranty.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for apartment life and styling my short hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I made sure it was on the lowest voltage</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> i use it to straighten my hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love is compact size and it is lightweight compared to others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> great but found Babyliss much lighter</li>
            <li> What more can you say.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I will be able to use it for my US travels, but it is not usable in Europe.</li>
            <li> I travel internationally quite often and this blow dryer is perfect!!</li>
            <li> I love the dual voltage and included diffuser.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair dryer for home and travel.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great, is very compact, and works as well as my full size hair dryer!</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good hair pressure/flow....</li>
            <li> Works great and is light weight which I really need.</li>
            <li> With a folding handle, it stores more easily.</li>
            <li> The size is very comfortable for my hand to hold, and it is light weight.  </li>
            <li> Nice cold air option makes it a win win. !</li>
            <li> The dryer was powerful and collapsed nicely for travel.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, easy to maneuver and blows the warm air just right.  </li>
            <li> The handle folds in for easy storage or travel.  </li>
            <li> It sparked and could have easily started a fire, yet when I tried to tell the supplier about it I find that it is &amp;#34;not eligible for return or replacement&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> What I find to be the most useful part of any hair dryer is the diffuser (the plastic attachment which focuses the air) as this allows for better control of air direction and focus.</li>
            <li> Also, easy to pack when I travel.  </li>
            <li> I borrow this when I was staying the night somewhere and loved it so much more than my old Conair hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer is lightweight and has a fairly strong motor too.  </li>
            <li> Hair dries quickly and the unit is very light weight, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It drys your hair fast without being too hot which is great.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it comes out fine...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and folds up and packs easily.  </li>
            <li> It works fine and switching the 120-250V was no problem at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> previous version was perfect.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is fine for traveling.</li>
            <li> elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer for daily use or for travel.</li>
            <li> The dual wattage feature is great, especially if you&#x27;re traveling to Europe.</li>
            <li> This one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it folds, it has a place to hang it.  </li>
            <li> Great product this is my third one.</li>
            <li> I appreciate and genuinely enjoy using it every day, and I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> I find this aspect extremely important because it helps not to overdry/cook your hair and your face.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to go with what I had been happy with, but in the travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the light weight too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it and will look for another kind of travel dryer soon.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.</li>
            <li> smoke and a clanking sound this time).  </li>
            <li> I have had one before and liked it so much I bought another for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is light weight.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> So far I have loved my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Very powerful airflow.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, dries your hair quickly without frizz (my hair is curly) and is compact and stores easily.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than a normal hairdryer (perfect for traveling)</li>
            <li> Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs)</li>
            <li> But I learned that needing to return something to Amazon is rather straightforward.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for travel AND everyday use!</li>
            <li> The first functioned for more than two years, which I think is acceptable for a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small and reliable hair dryer this is a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li> The good points of the dryer are that it is indeed very light weight and does dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> hairdryer is a great size, powerful more than other travel hairdryers and reliable.</li>
            <li> it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size to pack in a travel bag, but also good for everyday use, so I don&#x27;t need to have two dryers.</li>
            <li> A long time ago I had a huge Vidal Sasson dryer that I loved.  </li>
            <li> It does have a cool shot button</li>
            <li> I gave to my sister, and she didn&#x27;t even get one full use out of it.</li>
            <li> - good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lightweight compact travel dryer that folds easily and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> Amazon promptly sent me a replacement (Customer service was fast, friendly and great) but the replacement unit did the same thing.</li>
            <li> i mean it preforms just great!!!</li>
            <li> It took up no room in my suitcase and is a much better alternative than the hair dryers that are in most European hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li> It dries the hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This dryer has alot of power and quickly dries my hair.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly but without burning.</li>
            <li> If you use a dryer without the diffuser you can notice your hair blowing around more wildly so it is useful for avoiding knots as well as keeping you from blowing hair upwards too much</li>
            <li> and it dries it well and quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has good heat, a lot of air force and easy to control the air flow with the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also smaller than my regular blow dryer and fits better in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> Looks like, when the dryer expands from getting hot, the attachment doesn&#x27;t quite fit snuggly anymore.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Just warm air, does not dry hair.</li>
            <li> Fast and strong.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s not too hot!</li>
            <li> It was larger than I anticipated, but will work okay to travel!  </li>
            <li> This is the only hairdryer I have and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The hot setting is hot and strong.</li>
            <li> and I commented that many times the excellence of a dryer Nose measured by its size but by the capacity and speed of its technology, as well as that of the hair dryer that I got on amazon a year ago, which is very good for its features, it weighs nothing, and is quick to dry your hair, since I bought this product on amazon, I have not used other than that</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Ceramic and high power dryers will provide hotter air allowing for quicker drying (however higher heats result in more damage and if you have thinner hair you should probably stick to lower heats).</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and everywhere you go.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful dryer.</li>
            <li> For $15 I think it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Nice and light, hair dries fast enough and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> powerful, durable and compact.  </li>
            <li> Since I liked the funcitonality, I bought a second one.  </li>
            <li> When drying your hair you must make sure that you always keep it clear of hair.</li>
            <li> The low setting is almost cool and blows very lightly.</li>
            <li> just packed it right in my luggage.</li>
            <li> (My hair is right to my shoulders.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, so now I use it as my main blow dryer.</li>
            <li> am sure this is a great size for travel especially since the handle folds, but I use it everyday and haven&#x27;t taken it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.  ;))</li>
            <li> Small and works great.</li>
            <li> The high setting is very powerful and it might not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> the plastic guards on the back are not as good as my old dryer - i.e. you have to watch out not to get your hair stuck in the backdraft</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;bubbly round design (see the bump on the top?) is elegant looking</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to people with fine hair or sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> Also, with my fine hair the high setting is much too hot for my scalp.    </li>
            <li> Good product for the price..a little louder than I thought</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a voltage problem, so when I was back in the US</li>
            <li> I will continue to try to find out how to encourage some sort of recall, but in the meantime, don&#x27;t risk this - be safe and buy a different dryer!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had, and many people may not have an issue with this, was the directional concentrator does not turn.  </li>
            <li> Does not get hot like a blow dryer should.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm the first three times.  </li>
            <li> cheap quality compared to my old vidal sasson hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Just change the voltage, add your adapter plug and you&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li> I brought this dryer and was so pleased I am buying a second one to keep at my dad&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> While I personally leave the ion option on, and find many claims that it does work, I cannot find any scientific research on the topic however see no reason not to use it.</li>
            <li> It has a cooling button on the back and an ion switch on the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;elegant design but more basic feel than</li>
            <li> Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb)</li>
            <li> I love the concentrator on this one, just on the low setting it works wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because it folds up and fits perfectly in my side pocket of my gym bag &amp; cuts time in half because it dries my hair so much faster than other dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I had other blow dryers I used in the meantime but bought this one again since I remember loving it.</li>
            <li> To be completely fair, I am reviewing last year&#x27;s version of this dryer, which looks similar (gold color), but who knows-</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this hair dryer for the year I had it because it was very compact and portable, however about two weeks ago as I was using the dryer it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> They have just as much power as other full size ones and love the settings on them.</li>
            <li> I doubted the positive reviews I read on this product but decided to try anyway for our overseas trip.  </li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference with my hair the first time i used this product.</li>
            <li> The spark was more pronounced when the unit was on high and then was switched off, than from low.</li>
            <li> - loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;</li>
            <li> ion&#x27;s,,the only drawback is that is has a button to cut the heat off(push) to set the curl, it just puts it in low speed, other than that its great!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more powerful than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve used, which makes drying much faster.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> love that this is small and light weight.</li>
            <li> Apparently my old hairdryer was pretty low quality because I LOVE this one.</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine, but I was looking to replace a travel dryer I already have, and this on is twice as big.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first because of some of the ratings that this particular item had received, but I took a chance and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Great little blow dryer that we definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for this hair dryer at $25 which includes taxes and delivery.</li>
            <li> Really, truly nothing has changed.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s VERY lightweight.</li>
            <li> and it comes with the concentrator, which I need because I tend to get the dryer really close to my hair</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> I like the power of this dryer and its ionic technology: it dries my hair fast and without drying it.</li>
            <li> This hair drier is collapsable, but by no means small.&lt;br /&gt;The power and heat is very inadequate.  </li>
            <li> The Vidal Sasson Ionic Travel dryer I received in the mail is working very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any traveler!</li>
            <li> My wife is very picky about her dryers.</li>
            <li> The fourth time it began emmitting a buzzing sound and smoke started coming out.  </li>
            <li> But bear in mind, that it is very unreliable.</li>
            <li> Much of the damage to hair comes from how people use the their hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that something this small could be so effective!</li>
            <li> The one from 2007 did not last long in my house because a family member liked it so much she took it home with her.</li>
            <li> so I did not feel the need to spend a fortune on a hair dryer with various special options or intense quality claims.</li>
            <li> Besides, the purpose of the cool shot button is not to cool down your scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is light and small, BUT very powerful.  </li>
            <li> and I would be hesitant to put it on high as it seemed that it would really be pushing the limit.  </li>
            <li> This works, and as an added bonus folds and packs in a suitcase quite easily (and is smaller than my old one)</li>
            <li> The first time I used the dryer it immediately made a loud noise and smoke started coming out.</li>
            <li> I sometimes flip my hair upside down to dry it because it gives hair a lot more volume when I felt a huge pull on my head and smelt burning hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it folds to take up less room in my bag.  </li>
            <li> if only the concentrator was more solid.</li>
            <li> but OK..the older aqau/green model rocked...</li>
            <li> If you need such precise attention you are likely aware of it and did not consider this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High produces high wind speed and high temperature.</li>
            <li> Very packable and is more powerful than my everyday BIG one at home!!</li>
            <li> The high mode doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This dries my hair just as fast as any other professional standard I&#x27;ve used, and is nice and compact.  </li>
            <li> For me, the most important thing about a travel dryer is strong airflow, but that can be hard to find: so many are super-hot but offer only very weak flow.</li>
            <li> I use it more to set my style after I&#x27;ve dried it.</li>
            <li> This is normal for dual-voltage appliances.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still stronger and better than quite a few others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;bubbly round design (see the bump on the top?) makes bulky packing</li>
            <li> It is smaller in size than my previous models, but very powerful!!  </li>
            <li> Hair dryers generally do the same thing, provide warm air to help dry your hair.</li>
            <li> : I haven&#x27;t thought about this too much until I read the other reviews, and, you know, they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough to make your hair dry quickly.</li>
            <li> This dryer has the high heat put out for fast drying but is light and portable for everyday use or travel.</li>
            <li> When I used it overseas, I got the same amount of power on the lower setting as I get with the higher setting in a 110 outlet, so I did not ever put it on high.  </li>
            <li> and I was thrilled with how fast it dried my hair!!!</li>
            <li> to buy a new one instead of trying to send this one to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> This new version is lighter and even quieter.</li>
            <li> This new one is larger and does not get as hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Amazon and by chance searched to see if I could find this product here, needless to say I&#x27;m PSYCHED and loving ordering this way!</li>
            <li> Heat is very gentle on hair than other dryers I&#x27;ve tried which were too hot.</li>
            <li> My hair felt softer, shinier and it dried my hair pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking really straight!</li>
            <li> Its small and cute.</li>
            <li> I need low to still be hot for styling.</li>
            <li> I has a one year \\&quot;joke\\&quot; warranty, which means you can return it only during the first 30 days.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to use on low setting when changing the voltage to 240, so I did and with the higher voltage</li>
            <li> My old one gave up on me after faithfully working well all over the worl for 14 years!</li>
            <li> Though I was able to get a little more use out of the replacement one, I would&#x27;ve expected a hair dryer to last more than at least a year!</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and use the dryer to style my hair as much as dry it.</li>
            <li> but as long as you&#x27;re careful it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> If you need a hair dryer for simply drying your hair or for daily styling needs yet do not need all the special options expensive hair dryers advertise this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Certain parts of styling are made easier by correct use of different heats and at times the cooling option.</li>
            <li> I do buy quality product as I am not rich to buy cheap things that break.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it seemed that it was a great small hair dryer to always have at hand in a small bathroom &amp; for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a really loud dryer.</li>
            <li> I changed the voltage before I left so it was ready to go upon my arrival.  </li>
            <li> The hair remains soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer on 3 trips so far</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of them in the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> I had an old hair dryer from Vidal Sasson which was over 10 years old.</li>
            <li> It was even taking longer time compare to the 10 years old one.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is also loud (however my old one did claim to be \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;).     </li>
            <li> I do not find the noise volume to be uncomfortably loud.</li>
            <li> As soon as it came I threw out my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and when my old dryer suddenly burned out I wanted something light weight but powerful enough to dry my hair fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Again, customer service was fast friendly and didn&#x27;t give me a hard time about this problem.  </li>
            <li> It is a small compact size and fits easily in my drawer.</li>
            <li> I was also not able to turn the voltage button easily.  </li>
            <li> The third overheated and burned out within days, and the fourth OVERHEATED AND BURNED OUT LITERALLY THE FIRST TIME I USED IT.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough on the low setting to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer has two settings: low and high.</li>
            <li> Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.</li>
            <li> I never use the high setting because the low seems to be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its small, and fits in luggage, and is cheap.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast - and I have long</li>
            <li> I have normal, straight, thick hair which is not difficult to manage</li>
            <li> It blew a little harder, so it had decent air movement, if that blowing feel is important to you.  </li>
            <li> but I certainly couldn&#x27;t dry my hair in any reasonable time using it only on LOW.  </li>
            <li> , the low setting actually blows like it&#x27;s on high!</li>
            <li> It was coming right where the unit folds down.</li>
            <li> It offers only high and low speed options.</li>
            <li> This model is not as small as my original travel hairdryer</li>
            <li> Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight</li>
            <li> I have a ton of long hair and it only takes me about 3 minutes to full dry it.</li>
            <li> Not really a travel dryer because it is still a large product</li>
            <li> the low setting in a 220 outlet is the same power as you get on high in a 110 outlet.  </li>
            <li> but yet it&#x27;s still powerful enough to dry my super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair but blow dry it first.  </li>
            <li> Most of my hairdryers go 5+ years, so I feel a little let down by this one.  </li>
            <li> Well, how long is a hair dryer really supposed to last?  </li>
            <li> Finally, one day as I was blow drying my hair it sparked at the outlet where it was plugged in and completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> Recent models are faulty; do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> It barely dries my hair.</li>
            <li> Functioned as promised but it frizzled out on me after two years (smoke and sudden loud noises).  </li>
            <li> Nice product, but web site fails to add this warning from the printed Operating Instructions that come with the hair dryer: &amp;#34;The dryer switch must be in and remain in the &amp;#34;LOW&amp;#34; operating position when using 250 volts.</li>
            <li> the ON button is a rocker switch which is hard to turn on and with 3 settings, easy to overshoot the middle position.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a previous reviewer said that it wasn&#x27;t too hot, because my experience is just the opposite.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the concentrator is fairly easy to knock off again, otherwise this would have had 5 stars for its price.  </li>
            <li> My last dryer dried my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> My only critique is that it only has a high and low setting.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that folds for travel and yet is powerful enough to dry my long hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be more annoyed since it&#x27;s such a hassle to return things.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you&#x27;re on vacation and need a dryer that does the bare minimum, but not for regular use.</li>
            <li> I hope it will keep blowing my hair for a long time as the old one did.</li>
            <li> Small but powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but still has a powerful blow.</li>
            <li> The review would have been higher, however the movement of the low/off/high switch does not smoothly give the desired location.</li>
            <li> I also like that it folds in half making it much easier to pack and store.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry my hair a lot faster even though it&#x27;s the same wattage as my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> I tried to deal with it by holding it farther away from my head, but even so, if a single hair goes astray and ends up near the back end of the dryer then it gets ripped out, sucked into the motor and burned.</li>
            <li> My previous one which was the same model,  only lasted a couple of years, but I don&#x27;t expect much for the price, and would replace it with the same one again.  </li>
            <li> Even on low it dryed my hair fairly quick, especially considering I have long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my regular blow dryer because I live in a small apartment and have to move frequently.</li>
            <li> I think a blow dryer should last more than 1 year, so am disappointed in this product&#x27;s durability, but on the other hand, I didn&#x27;t like it much, so am glad I am forced to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> i wanted a hairdryer that was as small as possible because i travel a lot but still had enough power to dry my long hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to take in my suitcase and it seems to be gentle enough on my hair.</li>
            <li> The new technology \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; should make the drying time short, but it was not true for me.</li>
            <li> For a small hairdryer it really has some power.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;ionic&#x27; setting seems to make a small difference in how fast your hair dries.</li>
            <li> She had o VS like this before and it died after a long life do I foound the next gerneration on  Amazon.</li>
            <li> In literally less than a minute my hair was completely dry, and it was shinier than normal.</li>
            <li> the small size was my main objective anyway.</li>
            <li> I think I used it a total of 15 - 20 times, and I do not have a lot of hair to dry.</li>
            <li> take longer to dry my hair compared to my last vidal sasson.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it as my everyday hairdryer and my old one is stored in the back of my closet.</li>
            <li> this is really a featherweight dryer and works well,  but caught my hair twice (in ionic settings) and a bunch of hairs went  inside, after that I was scared to use this dryer, so I could  use it for hardly a week after buying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have ridiculously long hair</li>
            <li> so always left the house in the morning with \\&quot;wet head\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected and it was what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it created a minor explosion and I could hear a piece crash into something on the inside of the dryer, then the smell of burning.    </li>
            <li> Loud shrill high pitched whine when drying, but does dry a little faster than my other travel dryier that is not sonic but not by much, not worth hurting my hearing.  </li>
            <li> I had to return it again then bought 2 dryer - one for travel and the other for home, from the local beauty store.</li>
            <li> My wife returned this because it is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving this only one, because I suspect with five other five start reviews it was just a defective one in the bunch.  </li>
            <li> The handle felt a little fatter than usual when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Comparing this to other travel dryers… was going to use for travel with 220v where typically only &amp;#34;low heat&amp;#34; can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to blow dry my hair with this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> We turned it off and it didn&#x27;t blow dry any slower or faster.  </li>
            <li> I have to wear earplugs with unit to safely dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer takes awhile to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is only 5 months old, it is on 125V, nothing changed from the previous few weeks...</li>
            <li> Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; when I want it to switch off.</li>
            <li> It also seems that with a so called &#x27;limited warranty&#x27; of this manufacturer, it would be easier (</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that takes a while to dry normally.  </li>
            <li> I tried out the unit in the dark and the same spark happened.  </li>
            <li> Obviously if you are checking out this hair dryer you are looking for an affordable option and this provides equal, if not better, results than its overpriced counterparts.</li>
            <li> (it is not Vidal Sassoon) to report this problem, so I wanted to get this review out as soon as possible before it burns down someone&#x27;s house!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the second for about two years, and it is still functioning, though it has begun to overheat, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will continue to operate.</li>
            <li> Minus one star because the attachment is always getting knocked off.</li>
            <li> The box did not appear to have been wet or damaged.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> And this one was too big and heavy to be a travel dryer, it would take up the space in your suit case.</li>
            <li> Well, this functioned well enough for the first couple years, but now as it ages the motor has been sucking in hair through the metal mesh on the back end which creates a horrid, impossible to get rid of burnt hair smell, which then gets blown onto the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough.it took too long to the dry hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this little hairdryer!</li>
            <li> When 1 of the dryers broke down (after several years of use everyday)</li>
            <li> Not that small and attachment, very inconveniently, only goes in</li>
            <li> I would definitely say that it&#x27;s on the lighter side, and it&#x27;s small, too.</li>
            <li> Had to throw it away because I would&#x27;ve returned past the 30 days warranty period and did not want to deal with shipping back and forth with the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Since this one feels cheaper than the other one I bought years ago, I will be giving it four stars.</li>
            <li> Now it is completly dry in less time!</li>
            <li> During the summer I usually dry my hair on the cold setting, as it&#x27;s already too hot in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Based on some previous feedbacks, it seems to be a &#x27;usual&#x27; way how these fans end their short lives.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> My next hair dryer will have at least two choices for temperature settings.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> but I finally remembered to at least post and warn others.  </li>
            <li> I have short, but thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely do NOT recommend!!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the diffuser that is advertised with it (additional purchase) does not fit this dryer whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shinier and less frizzy than conair.</li>
            <li> It went belly-up in less than three days (</li>
            <li> Both stopped producing heat in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was ionic like my previous one though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;switch for low/high/off is a slide - like it (less slippery esp when working with hair</li>
            <li> Stylist Travel Dryer, Black (1lb) -</li>
            <li> It burns my scalp so badly that I have to keep pulling the hair dryer away so that my head can cool down.  </li>
            <li> My original&lt;br /&gt;VS dryer finally gave up the ghost after 12 years of hard use!  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and never had the patience to wait for it to totally dry</li>
            <li> it folds in half to take up less space!  </li>
            <li> it takes up little space in my luggage.</li>
            <li> 2) the cold burst isn&#x27;t cold - it&#x27;s just slightly less hot and with far less wind force.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally assume but since it was advertised with this dryer I didn&#x27;t give it a second thought! :(</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d a replacement hairdryer from VS after sending the broken one back...</li>
            <li> tonight the replacement is also dead after 8 months of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9ce9c35dec714bbc2287e49eda6b7216]]I wanted to wait until I had used this for a few of months in the states and 2 weeks overseas.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy for me. . .</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> but it did not fit</li>
            <li> This little blow dryer although small and compact has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> needs to try and work very hard to dry.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a few inches past my collarbones), so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get tired of holding it, but that may also be because your hair dries faster, so you don&#x27;t have to hold it as long.  </li>
            <li> A lot of power for a little hair dryer!</li>
            <li> It is past Amazon&#x27;s return date</li>
            <li> This is not a safe product.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why Vidal Sasson dropped &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; from his travel dryer title over past models which said that.</li>
            <li> Small, and folds to close</li>
            <li> I usually keep one in the bathroom and one in my suitcase (for traveling).  </li>
            <li> Lots of power and small for travel.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy for a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> But I straighten my thick curly/wavy hair with it</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair that I straighten and</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s not the one shown in the description photos.</li>
            <li> Folds into a very small package for a &amp;#34;weekend&amp;#34; size bag.</li>
            <li> This dryer started making really awful high pitched noises a month and a half after using it once a day.</li>
            <li> Too bad, but it obviously has design flaws.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> It is small, efficient, and has been working without fail for 6 months already.</li>
            <li> Our arms don&#x27;t get tired holding it up.  </li>
            <li> , THIS IS A TOTAL PIECE OF CRAP.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s irritating but what can you expect for something at this price level?</li>
            <li> but it is rather awkwardly located and sort of stiff to push, so</li>
            <li> That does me no good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shoddy and dangerous product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I didn&#x27;t use the dryer for the rest of the trip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did its job.</li>
            <li> When it started working weird, I ordered Ionic Travel Dryer from Amazon, I trusted the brand name Vidal Sasson, but it was defective</li>
            <li> I used this product for four weeks with no abnormal stresses on it and it started smoking one morning and failed.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Ordered twice thinking I had the gotten the wrong product.</li>
            <li> However, I use the concentrator all the time and it repeatedly falls off, which is very irritating.  </li>
            <li> Hi, I bought this hair dryer because mine was cutting off when it got warm(bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this brand for 10 years, I bought expensive ones before, this item is beyond any expectation!</li>
            <li> The noise level isn&#x27;t as bad as some hair dryers we have owned.</li>
            <li> Well, 3 years of use and today it ground to an ugly electrical-smelling halt.  </li>
            <li> i hate this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality of the dryer that it could not hold up for nine months.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the worst ever!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one like it, but its not the worst dryer I&#x27;ve used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great value.  Love the compact size and it&#x27;s lightweight.  Best of all it has improved my hair&#x27;s texture.  Makes it shine and no flyaways.</li>
            <li> Great any-time dryer. I use it at home and when I travel. Gets the job done. I have short, fine hair and use the dryer to style my hair as much as dry it. The hot setting is hot and strong. The low setting is almost cool and blows very lightly. I use it more to set my style after I&#x27;ve dried it. Minus one star because the attachment is always getting knocked off. Looks like, when the dryer expands from getting hot, the attachment doesn&#x27;t quite fit snuggly anymore. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Small but powerful. Folds into a very small package for a &amp;#34;weekend&amp;#34; size bag. It equals in performance my regular dryer that I use daily.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to blow dry my hair with this blow dryer! It left my hair looking really straight!</li>
            <li> Well, this functioned well enough for the first couple years, but now as it ages the motor has been sucking in hair through the metal mesh on the back end which creates a horrid, impossible to get rid of burnt hair smell, which then gets blown onto the rest of your hair. I tried to deal with it by holding it farther away from my head, but even so, if a single hair goes astray and ends up near the back end of the dryer then it gets ripped out, sucked into the motor and burned. I don&#x27;t have ridiculously long hair (it&#x27;s a few inches past my collarbones), so that&#x27;s not the problem. I recommend this if you&#x27;re on vacation and need a dryer that does the bare minimum, but not for regular use.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer. It&#x27;s compact, great for travel and surprisingly powerful for its size. But I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the last one I had shorted out after just 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money. It&#x27;s a really good dryer for travel. I even think it&#x27;s better than my home dryer.</li>
            <li> I think a blow dryer should last more than 1 year, so am disappointed in this product&#x27;s durability, but on the other hand, I didn&#x27;t like it much, so am glad I am forced to buy a new one.  To be completely fair, I am reviewing last year&#x27;s version of this dryer, which looks similar (gold color), but who knows- they may have changed it, for all I know.    Anyway, my gripes are 1) the ON button is a rocker switch which is hard to turn on and with 3 settings, easy to overshoot the middle position. 2) the cold burst isn&#x27;t cold - it&#x27;s just slightly less hot and with far less wind force.  During the summer I usually dry my hair on the cold setting, as it&#x27;s already too hot in my bathroom.  So what I want is lots of air and no heat - just the opposite of what this dryer delivered.    A long time ago I had a huge Vidal Sasson dryer that I loved.  I&#x27;m going to try something else this time, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to take to Vietnam to utilize the dual voltage feature.  When I was drying my hair, I noticed a white spark coming from the handle of the unit when I would shut it off. It was coming right where the unit folds down. The spark was more pronounced when the unit was on high and then was switched off, than from low. When I turned out the lights, the spark was even more noticeable.  Needless to say I didn&#x27;t use the dryer for the rest of the trip. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a voltage problem, so when I was back in the US I tried out the unit in the dark and the same spark happened.  Amazon promptly sent me a replacement (Customer service was fast, friendly and great) but the replacement unit did the same thing. I returned both units and got a refund. Again, customer service was fast friendly and didn&#x27;t give me a hard time about this problem.  So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. But I learned that needing to return something to Amazon is rather straightforward.  So buyer beware with this product.</li>
            <li> This dryer is awesome! I have really thick hair and never had the patience to wait for it to totally dry so always left the house in the morning with \\&quot;wet head\\&quot;. Now it is completly dry in less time!</li>
            <li> Great dryer - and that price! For me, the most important thing about a travel dryer is strong airflow, but that can be hard to find: so many are super-hot but offer only very weak flow. Not this one. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This dries my hair just as fast as any other professional standard I&#x27;ve used, and is nice and compact.  Another bonus is its very light so great or doing styles that take a while</li>
            <li> This dryer started making really awful high pitched noises a month and a half after using it once a day. A fuse must&#x27;ve blown because the dryer started smelling like burnt toast. It&#x27;s also a really loud dryer. Would not recommend - you get what you pay for.    ***EDIT*** I rec&#x27;d a replacement hairdryer from VS after sending the broken one back... tonight the replacement is also dead after 8 months of use. Though I was able to get a little more use out of the replacement one, I would&#x27;ve expected a hair dryer to last more than at least a year! Would never purchase this item again...</li>
            <li> This little hairdryer is perfect...perfect size, perfect weight, perfect price and worked really well during my trip to Europe.  It drys your hair fast without being too hot which is great.  It took up no room in my suitcase and is a much better alternative than the hair dryers that are in most European hotel rooms.  I changed the voltage before I left so it was ready to go upon my arrival.  I definitely recommend this little hairdryer!</li>
            <li> I like it. Its small and cute. So far so good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best ever! I&#x27;m using this brand for 10 years, I bought expensive ones before, this item is beyond any expectation! I have a very curly hair, thank you to Vidal, my hair is beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to handle than the larger ones. Heat is very gentle on hair than other dryers I&#x27;ve tried which were too hot. Great for everyday use and everywhere you go.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this hair dryer for the year I had it because it was very compact and portable, however about two weeks ago as I was using the dryer it suddenly stopped working. I fiddled with the cord and it started working again. This happened about 3-4 times where it would stop but then start again if I messed with the cord. Finally, one day as I was blow drying my hair it sparked at the outlet where it was plugged in and completely stopped working. Scared me to death. So glad nothing caught fire and that it didn&#x27;t get me.</li>
            <li> Product has a musty/mildewy smell to it. The box did not appear to have been wet or damaged. Item did ship on time. Would not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful dryer. It dries the hair quickly. The hair remains soft and shiny. The only complaint I have is it&#x27;s size. In my opinion, it is almost the size of a regular hair dryer. I suppose if the size is smaller, it would not have the same power. That is why I give it a four star. The price is reasonable for this hair dryer at $25 which includes taxes and delivery. I will continue to use it at home.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this dryer.  It worked great when I travelled to Italy this summer.  However, today I was drying my hair when suddenly flames burst out of the back and it caught on fire!  The dryer is only 5 months old, it is on 125V, nothing changed from the previous few weeks... then this suddenly happens.  It scared me to death.  It is past Amazon&#x27;s return date and I can&#x27;t find who manufactures it (it is not Vidal Sassoon) to report this problem, so I wanted to get this review out as soon as possible before it burns down someone&#x27;s house!  Really, truly nothing has changed.  I will continue to try to find out how to encourage some sort of recall, but in the meantime, don&#x27;t risk this - be safe and buy a different dryer!</li>
            <li> This item was delivered in a very timely fashion and is great value for the price! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I needed a lightwieght hair dryer for my upcoming trip to Africa, and it needed to have worldwide dual voltage (as this one does). I tested it out today and I was thrilled with how fast it dried my hair!!! My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try it sooner! In literally less than a minute my hair was completely dry, and it was shinier than normal. I was so surprised that something this small could be so effective! And it&#x27;s VERY lightweight. Perfect for travel AND everyday use!</li>
            <li> The dryer was powerful and collapsed nicely for travel.  The only problem I had, and many people may not have an issue with this, was the directional concentrator does not turn.  It only points horizontally and I prefer vertical.  Otherwise, this dryer is very good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer on 3 trips so far and it&#x27;s worked great.  I love how it folds to take up less room in my bag.  It&#x27;s 1875W so it dries my hair just as well as my big one at home and it comes with the concentrator, which I need because I tend to get the dryer really close to my hair (the heat will burn your hair without the concentrator).  The only thing I wish it had is a retractable cord but I guess you can&#x27;t have everything.  I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Totally happy with this hair dryer!  I have short, but thick hair.  This dryer has alot of power and quickly dries my hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit big for a compact travel dryer. The low setting is too low, not enough power.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Dec. 2010. Haven&#x27;t used it much. maybe once a week. It stopped working. didn&#x27;t even last a year. Don&#x27;t buy this. it was good while it lasted.  I tried circuit breaker in two different bathrooms. don&#x27;t know what the problem was. oh well. my loss.  [...]</li>
            <li> I have purchased a total of four of these hair dryers. The first functioned for more than two years, which I think is acceptable for a travel hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had the second for about two years, and it is still functioning, though it has begun to overheat, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will continue to operate. The third overheated and burned out within days, and the fourth OVERHEATED AND BURNED OUT LITERALLY THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. Recent models are faulty; do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Well, 3 years of use and today it ground to an ugly electrical-smelling halt.  During its lifetime, it was somewhat louder than ideal.  It blew a little harder, so it had decent air movement, if that blowing feel is important to you.  Most of my hairdryers go 5+ years, so I feel a little let down by this one.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did its job. It&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s nothing remarkable about it.</li>
            <li> Hi, I bought this hair dryer because mine was cutting off when it got warm(bad thermostat)and this one even has an ion diffuser,because hair needs ion&#x27;s,,the only drawback is that is has a button to cut the heat off(push) to set the curl, it just puts it in low speed, other than that its great!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer for daily use or for travel. I like the ionic option- it helps with humidity!. The dryer is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well, how long is a hair dryer really supposed to last?  I purchased this in February 2008 and used it daily (not just for travel) until it started smoking last week - so almost 3 years.  For $15 I think it was worth it.  Nice and light, hair dries fast enough and not frizzy.  I haven&#x27;t decided whether I&#x27;ll upgrade or just go with a known quantity here.</li>
            <li> I like this blow dryer so much I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of them in the last 10 years. I use the travel size as my daily dryer since it works as well as the larger version but it&#x27;s more compact.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this travel dryer for a vacation. I didn&#x27;t even remove it from the box just packed it right in my luggage. The first time I used the dryer it immediately made a loud noise and smoke started coming out. This is not a safe product. Will not purchase a Vidal Sassoon product again. Very upset that I wasted money on this and the shipping.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I like the power of this dryer and its ionic technology: it dries my hair fast and without drying it. But it&#x27;s somehow big for a travel dryer and the metallic coat tends to fall if you don&#x27;t protect it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice travel dryer for the price.  The dual wattage feature is great, especially if you&#x27;re traveling to Europe. It has a lot of power.  However, I use the concentrator all the time and it repeatedly falls off, which is very irritating.  Maybe if you don&#x27;t use a brush to style your hair it will stay on better.  But I straighten my thick curly/wavy hair with it and it comes out fine...if only the concentrator was more solid.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that folds for travel and yet is powerful enough to dry my long hair in a short amount of time. This one fit the bill. The only complaint I have is that the diffuser that is advertised with it (additional purchase) does not fit this dryer whatsoever. It fits my larger dryer otherwise I&#x27;d be more annoyed since it&#x27;s such a hassle to return things. I don&#x27;t normally assume but since it was advertised with this dryer I didn&#x27;t give it a second thought! :(</li>
            <li> I bought and returned 3 hairdryers from different companies before finding this one.  Superb.  I have thick hair that takes a while to dry normally.  Not with this drier.  I&#x27;m out in 2-3 min tops.  It&#x27;s light, it folds, it has a place to hang it.  It is a perfect hair dryer that is worth twice what I paid</li>
            <li> I had an old hair dryer from Vidal Sasson which was over 10 years old. When it started working weird, I ordered Ionic Travel Dryer from Amazon, I trusted the brand name Vidal Sasson, but it was defective and I had to return it. Then I bought the same from some place else. It was not what I expected. The new technology \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; should make the drying time short, but it was not true for me. It was even taking longer time compare to the 10 years old one. And this one was too big and heavy to be a travel dryer, it would take up the space in your suit case. I had to return it again then bought 2 dryer - one for travel and the other for home, from the local beauty store.</li>
            <li> Great product this is my third one.</li>
            <li> hello I&#x27;m from Venezuela and I commented that many times the excellence of a dryer Nose measured by its size but by the capacity and speed of its technology, as well as that of the hair dryer that I got on amazon a year ago, which is very good for its features, it weighs nothing, and is quick to dry your hair, since I bought this product on amazon, I have not used other than that and the good thing is you can take it with you so comfortable in your bag ..[[ASIN:B002ISETFO Vidal Sasson VS784N1 1875W Ionic Dryer Travel Kit]]</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9ce9c35dec714bbc2287e49eda6b7216]]I wanted to wait until I had used this for a few of months in the states and 2 weeks overseas.  This hair dryer has performed perfectly on both 110 and 220 voltage.  I use it every day in the U.S. and took it to Norway for 2 weeks.  When I used it overseas, I got the same amount of power on the lower setting as I get with the higher setting in a 110 outlet, so I did not ever put it on high.  The low setting was plenty of power and I would be hesitant to put it on high as it seemed that it would really be pushing the limit.  I have really thick, curly hair that I straighten and the low setting in a 220 outlet is the same power as you get on high in a 110 outlet.  It has performed great.  It&#x27;s light and folds up and packs easily.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for four weeks with no abnormal stresses on it and it started smoking one morning and failed. Low quality manufacturing.</li>
            <li> Could volumize better</li>
            <li> Not really a travel dryer because it is still a large product but it works great!</li>
            <li> This hair drier is collapsable, but by no means small.&lt;br /&gt;The power and heat is very inadequate.  It barely dries my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer for my teenaged daughter for Christmas and now I wish I had purchased one for myself.  It is light and small, BUT very powerful.  Not only is it the perfect travel dryer, but also perfect for every day use.  Our arms don&#x27;t get tired holding it up.  The only thing that doesn&#x27;t make sense is why you can turn off the \\&quot;ion\\&quot; feature since this in an \\&quot;ion\\&quot; dryer.  We turned it off and it didn&#x27;t blow dry any slower or faster.  Great little blow dryer that we definitely recommend.  Great price, too.</li>
            <li> I have bought blow dryers for many many years.  This has been my very favorite.  It is smaller in size than my previous models, but very powerful!!  The handle folds in for easy storage or travel.  I picked out this one by reading buyers reviews!!</li>
            <li> this is really a featherweight dryer and works well,  but caught my hair twice (in ionic settings) and a bunch of hairs went  inside, after that I was scared to use this dryer, so I could  use it for hardly a week after buying.</li>
            <li> So far I have loved my blow dryer. It is a small compact size and fits easily in my drawer. I use it for my regular blow dryer because I live in a small apartment and have to move frequently. I only wish it had a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> i wanted a hairdryer that was as small as possible because i travel a lot but still had enough power to dry my long hair quickly.  this dryer achieves both.  the plastic guards on the back are not as good as my old dryer - i.e. you have to watch out not to get your hair stuck in the backdraft but as long as you&#x27;re careful it&#x27;s ok.  the small size was my main objective anyway.</li>
            <li> Very powerful airflow. Noisy. Just warm air, does not dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer! It&#x27;s smaller than a normal hairdryer (perfect for traveling) but yet it&#x27;s still powerful enough to dry my super thick hair. This is actually the 2nd one I bought so I can have one for at home and one for the gym. It&#x27;s great because it folds up and fits perfectly in my side pocket of my gym bag &amp; cuts time in half because it dries my hair so much faster than other dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This portable dryer is wonderful... compact and works like a charm...  it folds in half to take up less space!  Wonderful work!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000PXYCHE Vidal Sasson VS784 1875W Ionic Travel Dryer]]  This hairdryer worked great in Italy, I didn&#x27;t need to change any voltage setting onthe dryer itself. All I needed was a plug adapter and to remember to run the dryer on low.  Even on low it dryed my hair fairly quick, especially considering I have long thick hair.  Light weight too, definately a good buy.</li>
            <li> i dont understand why is it soo cheap?!    i mean it preforms just great!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and when my old dryer suddenly burned out I wanted something light weight but powerful enough to dry my hair fairly quickly. This works, and as an added bonus folds and packs in a suitcase quite easily (and is smaller than my old one) so I&#x27;m not at the mercy of a hotel&#x27;s hair dryer. My only complaint is that the concentrator is fairly easy to knock off again, otherwise this would have had 5 stars for its price.  I have no idea what ionic does or doesn&#x27;t do - haven&#x27;t seen any difference.</li>
            <li> Not that small and attachment, very inconveniently, only goes in one direction- not the direction that is needed!</li>
            <li> Loud shrill high pitched whine when drying, but does dry a little faster than my other travel dryier that is not sonic but not by much, not worth hurting my hearing.  I have to wear earplugs with unit to safely dry my hair.  There is a reason why Vidal Sasson dropped &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; from his travel dryer title over past models which said that.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product from Amazon.  It arrived earlier than expected and it was what I wanted.  I had used this product before from another store and loved that it has an iconic setting for faster than ever drying. I love this Product.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but web site fails to add this warning from the printed Operating Instructions that come with the hair dryer: &amp;#34;The dryer switch must be in and remain in the &amp;#34;LOW&amp;#34; operating position when using 250 volts. This is normal for dual-voltage appliances.&amp;#34;  Well I don&#x27;t know about this being &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, but I certainly couldn&#x27;t dry my hair in any reasonable time using it only on LOW.  Wish it would have worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to San Fransisco, it was great there, but now used in Europe when away in my caravan</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the worst ever!!! It sparked and could have easily started a fire, yet when I tried to tell the supplier about it I find that it is &amp;#34;not eligible for return or replacement&amp;#34;. I think I used it a total of 15 - 20 times, and I do not have a lot of hair to dry. I have never had a faulty hair dryer before, but do not recommend anyone purchase this one!!!</li>
            <li> Very handy and useful</li>
            <li> I was just drying my hair with this dryer, and felt like writing a review.  I appreciate and genuinely enjoy using it every day, and I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years now.  Some of the good things I&#x27;d like to mention are:  - The power: it&#x27;s more powerful than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve used, which makes drying much faster.  - The weight: I haven&#x27;t thought about this too much until I read the other reviews, and, you know, they&#x27;re right! I would definitely say that it&#x27;s on the lighter side, and it&#x27;s small, too. You don&#x27;t get tired of holding it, but that may also be because your hair dries faster, so you don&#x27;t have to hold it as long.  - The temperature: it&#x27;s not too hot! I find this aspect extremely important because it helps not to overdry/cook your hair and your face.  - The price: it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sasson Ionic Travel dryer I received in the mail is working very well. It is light and flexible, and does a good job of drying my hair. I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference with my hair the first time i used this product. My hair felt softer, shinier and it dried my hair pretty quickly as well. It&#x27;s small but still has a powerful blow. I initially purchased this for a recent trip to countries around Asia. It works fine and switching the 120-250V was no problem at all. Though you can&#x27;t use the low heat setting at 250V but that didn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s lightweight and folds at the neck of the handle so I&#x27;m really glad I had this handy throughout the trip. Now I use it as my everyday hairdryer and my old one is stored in the back of my closet.</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine, but I was looking to replace a travel dryer I already have, and this on is twice as big.  If size isn&#x27;t an issue you will probably be happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I doubted the positive reviews I read on this product but decided to try anyway for our overseas trip.  I am completely impressed.  I found it just as the others stated...powerful, durable and compact.  I did not use the diffuser so have no comment on that. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than a conair it replaced. It leaves my hair shinier and less frizzy than conair.The only thing I wish it had is a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has two settings: low and high. High produces high wind speed and high temperature. Low produces low wind speed and low temperature. That does me no good! I need low to still be hot for styling. Also, with my fine hair the high setting is much too hot for my scalp.    The hair dryer is also loud (however my old one did claim to be \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;).     Oh well. I returned it. I would not recommend to people with fine hair or sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price..a little louder than I thought but OK..the older aqau/green model rocked...quiet/quick/light...wish they would have kept the engineering to incorporate in the newer model.</li>
            <li> A lot of power for a little hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Works great and is light weight which I really need. Use it when I travel so it isn&#x27;t used on a daily basis. Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer takes awhile to dry my hair.  My last dryer dried my hair quickly.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one like it, but its not the worst dryer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I give this blow dryer 4 stars because it worked great!  I was skeptic at first because of some of the ratings that this particular item had received, but I took a chance and it worked very well.  I took this item with me on a deployment to Kuwait.  I was so glad that I didn&#x27;t have any problems.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife returned this because it is not hot enough. I changed her morning routine from 45 minutes to over an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer since 2008 and it&#x27;s still stronger and better than quite a few others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This dryer has the high heat put out for fast drying but is light and portable for everyday use or travel.</li>
            <li> What a great hair dryer for the size.  Very packable and is more powerful than my everyday BIG one at home!!</li>
            <li> I had the full-size version of this Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for about 10 years. When it finally fizzled, I searched and read lots of reviews. I finally decided to go with what I had been happy with, but in the travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for about a month now. My hair is shoulder length and fine. It dries my hair quickly but without burning. I do not find the noise volume to be uncomfortably loud. It&#x27;s a nice size to pack in a travel bag, but also good for everyday use, so I don&#x27;t need to have two dryers. I like the light weight too. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this dryer. Hopefully it will last as well as its predecessor!</li>
            <li> Works great, is very compact, and works as well as my full size hair dryer! I highly recommend it to any traveler!</li>
            <li> needs to try and work very hard to dry.</li>
            <li> Wife used it for over 5 years all was good until it caught fire this morning. She liked it until that. Will be buying a different one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a VS travel hairdryer for both travel and home use. The last one I had lasted over ten years. This new one is larger and does not get as hot. I don&#x27;t really like it and will look for another kind of travel dryer soon.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot like a blow dryer should.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer. My wife is very picky about her dryers. We needed one for a trip to Europe and it worked great. Plenty of heat to keep her happy. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product before but thought the issues I had with this hair dryer warranted a review. If you are using this hair dryer in the US, then it&#x27;s a good product.  If you are buying this hair dryer for use in Europe (specifically France and Spain) the product&#x27;s voltage of 250 is not correct.  The voltage there is 230 so the hair dryer did not work.  I was also not able to turn the voltage button easily.  I ruined a pair of tweezers in the process.</li>
            <li> i hate this product. Low speed is too low, high speed is too high. It doesn&#x27;t blow hot air for the first 5 minutes. Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; when I want it to switch off. It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size worked great for me! traveled well looking forward to taking with me on future trips.</li>
            <li> My wife needed one that folds for travel. She had o VS like this before and it died after a long life do I foound the next gerneration on  Amazon. Works fine.</li>
            <li> This model is not as small as my original travel hairdryer but it is very powerful and does a great job!  My original&lt;br /&gt;VS dryer finally gave up the ghost after 12 years of hard use!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of this hair dryer. It is small enough to take in my suitcase and it seems to be gentle enough on my hair. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> just was i had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe only to discover that my existing travel hair dryer was convertible to either European or American electricity. But now I have a backup.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be an international dryer.  Plugged in while in the UK, smoked and died in 5 mins.  Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
            <li> Very heavy for a travel dryer.  Too heavy for me. . . shoulder issues.  previous version was perfect.  Can&#x27;t use this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer!  It travels the world with me, plus I use it at home - I love the dual voltage option.</li>
            <li> This used to be an OK dryer.  But 4 months ago, I purchased one from Amazon that burned out in 3 days.  The replacement I received has just burned out after 4 months.  I has a one year \\&quot;joke\\&quot; warranty, which means you can return it only during the first 30 days.  After that, you have to mail it to the company along with a $5 check for \\&quot;handling.\\&quot;  It would cost more than 50% of the price to avail yourself of this warranty.  When this thing burns up, expect a fireworks show.  It&#x27;s a shoddy and dangerous product.</li>
            <li> powerful and great that it folds for easy travel</li>
            <li> I purchased this dual voltage hair dryer to use on my trip to Asia.  It worked like a charm the first three times.  The fourth time it began emmitting a buzzing sound and smoke started coming out.  Had to throw it away because I would&#x27;ve returned past the 30 days warranty period and did not want to deal with shipping back and forth with the manufacturer.  If you intend to use in Asia, do not buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hair dryer so I&#x27;m keeping it but I think it&#x27;s too big to be a &amp;#34;travel dryer&amp;#34;! I couldn&#x27;t take on my trip after all.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer ... good for the money.  Small, and folds to close so you could pack it in a suite case.  Pretty good hair pressure/flow.... good for it&#x27;s size, and it does the trick.  I have it for over a year, and I use it all the time... good product!</li>
            <li> I had one of these for 2 years and liked it.  Functioned as promised but it frizzled out on me after two years (smoke and sudden loud noises).  Since I liked the funcitonality, I bought a second one.  It went belly-up in less than three days (smoke and a clanking sound this time).  Too bad, but it obviously has design flaws.</li>
            <li> Bought this cause I&#x27;ve been buying this IONIC dryer for years only to discover the style has changed from the picture shown. You still get the same IONIC dryer with built in IONIC setting, not a shut off option anymore. Ordered twice thinking I had the gotten the wrong product. FYI it&#x27;s the same one just different.</li>
            <li> The good points of the dryer are that it is indeed very light weight and does dry my hair quickly.  While it does have two power settings, it only has one temperature setting.  I was surprised that a previous reviewer said that it wasn&#x27;t too hot, because my experience is just the opposite.  It burns my scalp so badly that I have to keep pulling the hair dryer away so that my head can cool down.  It does have a cool shot button but it is rather awkwardly located and sort of stiff to push, so it doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  Besides, the purpose of the cool shot button is not to cool down your scalp.  My next hair dryer will have at least two choices for temperature settings.  I would suggest you not purchase this dryer if you have a tender scalp.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not worth it.  It does not get hot enough on the low setting to style my hair.  I also purchased the diffuser pictured with it.  The diffuser does not stay on.  It keeps popping off.  Please remember, you must also buy an electrical plug if you plan to travel abroad even though it says that it can be used internationally.</li>
            <li> I purchased two Vidal Sasson VS784 hair dryers.  Both stopped producing heat in less than a year.  They now reside in the local landfill.  Save your money.  Stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> The review would have been higher, however the movement of the low/off/high switch does not smoothly give the desired location. It often requires an extra effort to move the lever to the desired position.</li>
            <li> I have used the &#x27;Vidal Sasson VS784  1875 Ionic Travel Dryer, for several years.  I usually keep one in the bathroom and one in my suitcase (for traveling).  When 1 of the dryers broke down (after several years of use everyday) I tried to buy 1 in a local Meijers store, but they didn&#x27;t have any.  I looked on the internet under Amazon and found what I wanted.  I ordered several .. because you know you have a good product and there had better be a spare on hand.</li>
            <li> Perfect for apartment life and styling my short hair with ease. Very powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast and strong.</li>
            <li> cheap quality compared to my old vidal sasson hair dryer.  take longer to dry my hair compared to my last vidal sasson.  go get something else or a different model from Vidal Sasson.</li>
            <li> What a waste.  We traveled overseas and I didn&#x27;t test the 220 volt option before we left.  (We&#x27;re US and don&#x27;t have 220 volts but I still wish I&#x27;d tested the switch before we left).  So we get to Europe and the switch to move from 110 (US) to 220 Euro (well it says 250 but in Europe, it&#x27;s 220)  doesn&#x27;t move.  DOESN&#x27;T MOVE AT ALL.  Thankfully, the place we were staying had a Euro hairdryer.  We got home and I forgot about it, but I finally remembered to at least post and warn others.  BUYER BEWARE, THIS IS A TOTAL PIECE OF CRAP.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to use on a trip to Australia. The directions say to use on low setting when changing the voltage to 240, so I did and with the higher voltage, the low setting actually blows like it&#x27;s on high! It&#x27;s a great lightweight compact travel dryer that folds easily and takes up little space. Just change the voltage, add your adapter plug and you&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li> It was very good when it worked. I did not use it extensively, as I also have a bigger one I use when I&#x27;m at home. Today it started to vibrate in my hands, emit scratchy sounds and later smoke started to run the dryer. I immediately stopped it not to get an electric shock. Based on some previous feedbacks, it seems to be a &#x27;usual&#x27; way how these fans end their short lives. It also seems that with a so called &#x27;limited warranty&#x27; of this manufacturer, it would be easier (and maybe even cheaper for me) to buy a new one instead of trying to send this one to the manufacturer.  Simple conclusion - if you like it - buy it. It will probably work for some time and make you happy. But bear in mind, that it is very unreliable.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is my very favorite for home or for travel.  It is lightweight, easy to maneuver and blows the warm air just right.  I have had one before and liked it so much I bought another for my daughter.  This is definitely a dryer I would replace with another just like it!!</li>
            <li> I brought this blow dryer to France.  I made sure it was on the lowest voltage but the dryer overheated within seconds.  It looked like it was about to shot fire from the nozzle.  Save your money.  I left it in France.</li>
            <li> I brought this dryer and was so pleased I am buying a second one to keep at my dad&#x27;s house. Hair dries quickly and the unit is very light weight, easy to handle. This one is a good choice, I have owned many hair dryers so I know what I am talking about. Paula, NYC</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving this only one, because I suspect with five other five start reviews it was just a defective one in the bunch.  I gave to my sister, and she didn&#x27;t even get one full use out of it.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Lots of power and small for travel. Nice cold air option makes it a win win. !</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small and reliable hair dryer this is a wonderful choice. I needed a dryer for daily styling and volume. I have normal, straight, thick hair which is not difficult to manage so I did not feel the need to spend a fortune on a hair dryer with various special options or intense quality claims. Hair dryers generally do the same thing, provide warm air to help dry your hair. Much of the damage to hair comes from how people use the their hair dryer. Which hair dryer is best for you depends on how in depth your styling is. Certain parts of styling are made easier by correct use of different heats and at times the cooling option. If you need such precise attention you are likely aware of it and did not consider this hair dryer. Ceramic and high power dryers will provide hotter air allowing for quicker drying (however higher heats result in more damage and if you have thinner hair you should probably stick to lower heats). The ion option, now practically standard for hair dryers, is said to help provide smoother and shinier hair. While I personally leave the ion option on, and find many claims that it does work, I cannot find any scientific research on the topic however see no reason not to use it. What I find to be the most useful part of any hair dryer is the diffuser (the plastic attachment which focuses the air) as this allows for better control of air direction and focus. If you use a dryer without the diffuser you can notice your hair blowing around more wildly so it is useful for avoiding knots as well as keeping you from blowing hair upwards too much (if you blow hair in the direction it grows it will limit damage).     This hair dryer is extremely simple and provides very basic options. It offers only high and low speed options. It has a cooling button on the back and an ion switch on the top. The dryer can be folded (as it is a travel dryer) but the cord is not retractable. It comes with a diffuser that is of course detachable. It is extremely light and the most attractive dryer in this price range.    If you need a hair dryer for simply drying your hair or for daily styling needs yet do not need all the special options expensive hair dryers advertise this is a good choice. It is small, efficient, and has been working without fail for 6 months already. Obviously if you are checking out this hair dryer you are looking for an affordable option and this provides equal, if not better, results than its overpriced counterparts.</li>
            <li> Apparently my old hairdryer was pretty low quality because I LOVE this one. I have a ton of long hair and it only takes me about 3 minutes to full dry it. Great size and power. Obviously great for travel.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase. With a folding handle, it stores more easily. The noise level isn&#x27;t as bad as some hair dryers we have owned. The faster drying is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> Bought it about a month ago for travel but am now using it for home as well. For a small hairdryer it really has some power. I also like that it folds in half making it much easier to pack and store.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer.  I have used Vidal Sasson hair dryers for over 26 years and have used this model for over 5 years.  I just ordered 3 of them because I can no longer find this model in stores.  It&#x27;s light weight, dries your hair quickly without frizz (my hair is curly) and is compact and stores easily.  I&#x27;m new to Amazon and by chance searched to see if I could find this product here, needless to say I&#x27;m PSYCHED and loving ordering this way!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dyer. i use it to straighten my hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this blow dryer until  I turned it on and it sparked, a puff of white smoke came out of the back vent and it died.  Not good.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> I love is compact size and it is lightweight compared to others I have tried.  My only critique is that it only has a high and low setting.  I didn&#x27;t think I would mind but I have missed medium heat/power.</li>
            <li> This is really a good hair dryer! It has a voltage switch so that you can change the voltage made it work worldwide!!!</li>
            <li> Sparked and died on 2nd use. Will never buy Sassoon again. This item should be pulled off shelves.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer. I have very long and thick hair and it dries it well and quickly. The dryer is light weight and great for traveling.    The problem I have with this dryer is it burned out before 6 months and it just didn&#x27;t burn out, it created a minor explosion and I could hear a piece crash into something on the inside of the dryer, then the smell of burning.    I am returning it to Helen of Troy LP, who make this dryer and hope the same thing doesn&#x27;t happen to its replacement.</li>
            <li> This little blow dryer although small and compact has a lot of power. Also, easy to pack when I travel.  I flat iron my hair but blow dry it first.  And I can do so in under 5 minutes. (My hair is right to my shoulders.)  It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I borrow this when I was staying the night somewhere and loved it so much more than my old Conair hairdryer.  I immediately hopped on Amazon and purchased one.  As soon as it came I threw out my old hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and I love it!  The handle felt a little fatter than usual when I first started using it but I&#x27;ve grown used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is small and light weight. It seems to dry my hair a lot faster even though it&#x27;s the same wattage as my old dryer.  It fits into my bathroom cabinet drawer easily.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this is a great size for travel especially since the handle folds, but I use it everyday and haven&#x27;t taken it anywhere. I have a much smaller travel dryer that converts power so I can use it abroad that I prefer to take when on trips.</li>
            <li> Purchased in March 24, 2013, died December 2013.  Used two or three times a week.  Very disappointed in the quality of the dryer that it could not hold up for nine months.  Blew up in my hand, scared to death!</li>
            <li> All good and suits my needs, this I will be able to take with me where ever I travel in the world.</li>
            <li> The dryer is light weight. I like the fact that you can fold it for travel too.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is longer than some I have seen and that is good.  All in all a very&lt;br /&gt;good dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the one with the Ionic travel dryer. Then I received the one with the tourmaline ceramic travel dryer !!! I mean it&#x27;s not the one shown in the description photos. Why  Damn its a money and time wasting???. I will attach a photo with the one I received. and it has A big disadvantage, when the voltage is turned to be used  on 250v The high mode doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I travel alot for work and needed a dual voltage hair dryer that was lightweight to minimize additional luggage weight.  This hairdryer is lightweight and has a fairly strong motor too.  Its small, and fits in luggage, and is cheap.  My previous one which was the same model,  only lasted a couple of years, but I don&#x27;t expect much for the price, and would replace it with the same one again.  Wish it was ionic like my previous one though.</li>
            <li> This is a very light dryer.  It was larger than I anticipated, but will work okay to travel!  Worth the price.  ;))</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it seemed that it was a great small hair dryer to always have at hand in a small bathroom &amp; for travel. When drying your hair you must make sure that you always keep it clear of hair. I sometimes flip my hair upside down to dry it because it gives hair a lot more volume when I felt a huge pull on my head and smelt burning hair. The vent had sucked my hair into it and burnt off all the hair!! Thankfully it was the hair underneath in the back because I had to cut the burnt ends off! Absolutely do NOT recommend!!</li>
            <li> My old one gave up on me after faithfully working well all over the worl for 14 years! This new version is lighter and even quieter. I wish it would come with a travel case though. I hope it will keep blowing my hair for a long time as the old one did.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to other travel dryers… was going to use for travel with 220v where typically only &amp;#34;low heat&amp;#34; can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up returning - went for Babyliss Nano Titanium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;foldable&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;bubbly round design (see the bump on the top?) is elegant looking&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;0.8lb (found others at 0.6lb - babyliss nano titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;powerful heat&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;good low hum (not low noise, but lower than most)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;switch for low/high/off is a slide - like it (less slippery esp when working with hair products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;0.8lb (found others at 0.6lb - babyliss nano titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;bubbly round design (see the bump on the top?) makes bulky packing&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;elegant design but more basic feel than Revlon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the products tested… ended up keeping Babyliss.  See specific Pros/Cons with each review but here&#x27;s the highlight:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb) - loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;br /&gt;2.  Vidal Sassoon Vsdr5523 1875w Stylist Travel Dryer, Black (1lb) - great but found Babyliss much lighter&lt;br /&gt;3.  Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight&lt;br /&gt;4.  Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs) - looks elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish low/off/high switch&lt;br /&gt;6.  Vidal Sasson VS784 1875W Travel Dryer (0.8lbs) - good, looks like Revlon but better grip on switch to low/high/off&lt;br /&gt;7.  Andis Micro Turbo 1600 Watt Dual Voltage Hair Dryer - White (33805) (0.8lbs) - good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li> Small and works great.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and advertised.  What more can you say.  Works as it should.</li>
            <li> This dryer&#x27;s heat and blowspeed is perfect for me,  I can focus on one section of hair without the rest of my hair blowing and getting frizzy.  The size is very comfortable for my hand to hold, and it is light weight.  Also great for traveling&lt;br /&gt;because it takes up little space in my luggage.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT a real &amp;#34;Best Buy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No too noisy! And  for MN abate the cool is very easy!</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted this dryer when I tried it at a friends house. I recommend trying out this dryer before you buy it, the settings might not be for everyone. The dryer itself is very light and the &#x27;ionic&#x27; setting seems to make a small difference in how fast your hair dries. The high setting is very powerful and it might not be for everyone. Perfect for traveling and at home.</li>
            <li> Love it but it&#x27;s too big to carry on a trip. It is powerful enough to make your hair dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Used this in the UK and Africa and worked great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has good heat, a lot of air force and easy to control the air flow with the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also smaller than my regular blow dryer and fits better in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> This dryer is fine for traveling. It folds up nicely and is easy to pack.  The air flow concentrator attachment  falls off constantly when I&#x27;m drying my hair. It&#x27;s irritating but what can you expect for something at this price level?</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough.it took too long to the dry hair.I do not recommend it.I used it aboard with 240v.</li>
            <li> I purchased it along with a diffuser but it did not fit so I retuned it and never did get a chance to try it out.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use for travel to Germany since it will work at 240 volts.  Used it in the US and it does a good job for hair drying.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!  Very powerful!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because is was dual voltage so I could use it on my recent trip to Italy.  I was not able to use it.  I used the plug converter but it blew out the fuse in our room.  I will be able to use it for my US travels, but it is not usable in Europe.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in Europe.  It&#x27;s light, so now I use it as my main blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I travel internationally quite often and this blow dryer is perfect!! Don&#x27;t let the size fool you. It dries my hair fast - and I have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was a lifesaver on my recent trip to Australia. I love the dual voltage and included diffuser. Is very light &amp; compact.</li>
            <li> I bought it for trip where I needed dual voltage but we couldn&#x27;t get the voltage switch to turn.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair dryer for home and travel.  lots of power.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Not too big.  Louder than I wanted, but this was not advertised as a quiet dryer. Bought two.  Very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one in 2007 and one this year. The one from 2007 did not last long in my house because a family member liked it so much she took it home with her. I had other blow dryers I used in the meantime but bought this one again since I remember loving it. The newer one does not seem to be made as well as the one 6 years ago. It feels cheaper in my hands but performs the same. I love the concentrator on this one, just on the low setting it works wonders! I never use the high setting because the low seems to be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned a lot of Vidal Sasson blow dryers and like the travel size ones. They have just as much power as other full size ones and love the settings on them. Since this one feels cheaper than the other one I bought years ago, I will be giving it four stars. However, it is a wonderful blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have bought this hairdryer 13 years ago and use it both for traveling and when I stay at home. This is the only hairdryer I have and absolutely love it! I do buy quality product as I am not rich to buy cheap things that break.&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is a great size, powerful more than other travel hairdryers and reliable.</li>
