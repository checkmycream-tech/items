            <li>I have nice skin.</li>
            <li>Read up more about what vitamin C can do for you skin because a review won&#x27;t cover anything besides a stranger saying &amp;#34;it&#x27;s good, trust me&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always nice to know that they appreciate your business.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see a date on the product box showing 9/2016</li>
            <li>I really liked the serum</li>
            <li>it felt nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>Nice product...</li>
            <li>I was very happy with your product, also price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I was applying a good serum, filled with vitamin C!</li>
            <li>After so many months of searching for a good Vitamin C serum, I came across Salvere</li>
            <li>So every night, I wash my face with warm water, dove soap and fingertip towel, then apply a drop or 2 of Salvere Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>With that said, all my opinions are my own and they did not ask me to leave any feedbacks or pay me.</li>
            <li>I think it would be perfect if this also had vitamin A in it but works very well even as it is.</li>
            <li>The serum feels really nice on my skin, and absorbs thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice grade of serum.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a wonderful product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li>all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I totally am loving what this Vitamin C serum is doing to my skin and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think this could have been achieved without implementing Salvere Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
            <li>Its not greasy and drys fast and my face is glowing, my skin feels great!!</li>
            <li>Love love love thus serum!!</li>
            <li>Love love love my vitamin c serum!!</li>
            <li>The best: feel great and is making my dry skin much more moist!</li>
            <li>, This is a wonderful product i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply ,to use, smelled good and after rubbed into my skin</li>
            <li>It had a pleasant scent and went on really smoothly.</li>
            <li>It apply very easy .</li>
            <li>Tried it for many days, love it!</li>
            <li>This is just as good as those same serums that the plastic surgeons  and dermatologists push for $130.00 or more!!!</li>
            <li>very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li>This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;m always running them under water, I started using this every morning and night to soften my hands, and they feel soft and does not leave any greasy feeling, great product!</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is the best ingredient for youthful, clear, even-skin tone.</li>
            <li>and then seal it in with a nice application of moisturizer on top of it all.</li>
            <li>I really love this serum because it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>When I smiled before, I would notice more skin creasing around the corners and bottom of my eyes.</li>
            <li>include very lightweight, not greasy or sticky, and incredible customer service.</li>
            <li>58 yr old, sun damaged skin looks amazingly beautiful!!!!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is suitable for every women.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting or aggravate my hyper-sensitive skin (even after dermarolling) and seems to be doing a good job at keeping the lines and wrinkles at a comfortable distance.</li>
            <li>The packaging is superb, completely wrapped and sealed to prevent leakage.</li>
            <li>Best formula I have found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Most effective anti-wrinkle Vit C is in a formulation you mix and use immediately.</li>
            <li>goes on easy and cant wait to see the longer use outcome!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>Not so pleasant for the 10 seconds but afterwards, the scent quickly dissipated.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased many others but this one is by far the best!!!</li>
            <li>but so far so good, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s very smooth .</li>
            <li>I was very fortunate to have found this deal, just turning 60, and looking at lines, this was a blessing.</li>

            <li>it now my skin is very smooth and brighter</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s very light going on &amp; absorbes quickly -</li>
            <li>It is very light and does not absorb quickly (takes about 25 mins to absorb).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is simply pure magic!  </li>
            <li>What impressed me most was the personal \\&quot;after Sales\\&quot; follow-up service, received from this particular seller.</li>

            <li>I like that Salvere is a light weight serum, easy to apply with dropper provided.  </li>
            <li>I hope to continue to see improvements in clarity and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I can already see a reduction in the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>Those fine lines seem to blur.  </li>
            <li>I have some fine lines and they do seem fuller.  </li>
            <li>This serum did seem to reduce the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m an avid blogger and product tester, I was sent a free bottle of this serum in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>It seems to be helping the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used Mega Bright by Origins, Olay ProX and Roc  products on my face to fade brown spots but none have come close to the results I have experienced with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick service!</li>
            <li>Received it quickly, and love the way it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>I still wanna see more positive results :)</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in fine lines either.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and I have already noticed a reduction in fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I just started using this Vit C Serum, I use it under makeup, it does seem to allow my foundation to glide on smoothly and reduced the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Rose Water to counterbalance the pure Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference &amp; can feel it with my finger.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just my routine, it applies really smoothly and doesn&#x27;t really require you to leave it on there without touching it for more than maybe a minute or so.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>but as I have them for now,I shall enjoy them .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It has given me a more vibrant, glowing and well moisturized</li>
            <li>I find it spreads easier, sits better under makeup, smells better,  and gives the same results!</li>
            <li>My evening regiment also includes a mild retinol product.</li>
            <li>I think it will help my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and clear my skin still looks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C as an anti-wrinkle agent is &#x27;volatile&#x27; meaning it expires quickly in a suspension.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product with high hopes for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>she is so happy with this serum , She asked me to buy her another bottle although it is still half full , i recommend it for any person with skin aging problems ..</li>
            <li>They are so match,it also help the facial oil to absorb so quickly...!!!</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say Thank You Salvere Company for doing the free giveaway though you facebook.</li>
            <li>The only reason for giving it 4 stars is that the package does not look very appealing to me.</li>
            <li>Seems to work ok, need more time to see how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li>I used this one after using my Derma Roller and it was absorbed into my skin quickly</li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much!!</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it!!!</li>
            <li>I love Salvere so far!</li>
            <li>Really worked on fine lines.</li>
            <li>This serum really seems to have improved the texture and fine lines in my face.</li>
            <li>really like that the serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin and even sits well under makeup if you want to use it in your morning skin care routine!</li>
            <li>I had one pimple when I tried this the first day but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li>(it made my skin extremely smooth, soft, and touchably inviting)&lt;br /&gt;-Reduces fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>Absorption was fine and, better yet, left no tackiness or stickiness on my skin.  </li>
            <li>After just a few days of use I have noticed a great improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this and for the price definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Love these vitamins so far</li>
            <li>my natural make-up to go on better</li>
            <li>It was totally worth the price to try it.</li>
            <li>Also, keep your Vitamin C in the fridge to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>It is economical, too.</li>
            <li>It was quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my oily sensitive skin or cause a breakout and help with wrinkles and so far it&#x27;s seems to be doing a good job</li>
            <li>Also the with the lines when I smile I can tell they are going away some already too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for that alone.</li>
            <li>I have only used this a couple of times but liked it.</li>
            <li>I can not speak to it&#x27;s ability to slow or delay the aging process but being healthy looking is just as good.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>I love this serum it goes on light and is making a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>She says it makes her skin smooth, soft, and reduces the appearance of her wrinkles significantly.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>used to facial oil with my dry skin everyday,so i try to mix this serum with 1~2 pumps rose hip oil..!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice quality Vitamin C serum; more viscous than other brands I&#x27;ve tried like Obagi + Skinsceuticals yet equally fast-absorbing.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t pill your makeup.</li>
            <li>Maybe some betterment right as it is applied.</li>
            <li>and we both could tell a difference right away and wee both</li>
            <li>Soaks right in</li>
            <li>Absorbs right into my skin with no greasy residue...</li>
            <li>Goes on as a liquid and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Soaks right into my skin</li>
            <li>I am not wearing foundation right now</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away with the texture of my skin and the size reduction of my pores.  </li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this formulation of Salvere&#x27;s Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum because of the other natural ingredients and the pleasant experience I&#x27;ve had thus far!br /&gt;About</li>
            <li>My smile lines are becoming finer and my neck wrinkles are going away and my hands don&#x27;t look quite as old</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it, my face feels softer and dark spots are starting to fade.. there is no smell to it</li>
            <li>So far in the short term of things I absolutely love it, and genuinely hope that it will continue to be useful!</li>
            <li>Great product, After a few days my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The seller however waited about a week or more to complete the purchase on my debit/credit and it arrived on the very last estimated ship date which is okay</li>
            <li>Overall, I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I love how it goes easily into my skin and doesn&#x27;t interfer with my other skin care routines/products.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and makes your skin feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say how effective it is yet, as I have only used it one time.  </li>
            <li>This is actually my second bottle, I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product so far!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly, needing only 3-4 drops before a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this formulation of Salvere&#x27;s Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum because of the other natural ingredients and the pleasant experience I&#x27;ve had thus far!</li>
            <li>My skin is so much brighter!</li>
            <li>I have REALLY problematic skin (or HAD, it&#x27;s always a battle, but generally I&#x27;m a bit more oily/shiny than not).</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product!</li>
            <li>My skin just drinks it in and it feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It simply seems to stay on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my face on the first use, and continually so ever since.</li>
            <li>keeps my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have re ordered and recommend it to all my friends who want to see that plump, healthy and youthful glow back in their skin...</li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I try Salvere</li>
            <li>It is really fast absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li>The tinted container looked exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with what I received and, after having a chance to judge effectiveness, will update my rating, possibly to a 5.  </li>
            <li>have reduced and my skin overall just feels alot better.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use my entire bottle without it changing color.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I was able to use a 15% Vitamin C serum (no E Ferulic Acid added) under the eye prior to this and never had a problem.  </li>
            <li>i do put one drop on the back of each hand when i use itand LOVE the way that feels ....</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference!  </li>
            <li>This product has really made a difference!</li>
            <li>Thanks Salvere!</li>
            <li>I really like the dropper!</li>
            <li>For now, I love the short terms results!</li>
            <li>My skin seems much firmer &amp; the wrinkles around my mouth are softer!</li>
            <li>It leaves somewhat of a sticky residue, especially if used all over the face, so I would recommend this product more for spot treatments or for use overnight.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After only a couple of weeks using it my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I did not like this at all and knew I needed something to start working on this problem before they became larger and more visible.</li>
            <li>It feels like it tightens (but not too much!)  </li>
            <li>There is no weird smell to it, either.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not heavy, tacky, or greasy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>After I ran out of the first bottle, I noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This makes my skin smooth and soft and brighter.  </li>
            <li>Salvere Vitamin C Serum works as well as much higher priced serums.</li>
            <li>By then I think I should be able to definitely know if it works or not.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted, blemish free, dark spots/scars are fading, and skin looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>What I do love is how the overall health of my skin has improved.</li>
            <li>I need to take this more regularly.  </li>
            <li>but perhaps if I take it regularly I will feel better.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Good to use as an everyday serum in your skincare routine</li>
            <li>High quality product with quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Amazing serum in a tiny bottle!i use this as my DAY serum,because it protects against sun damage,and has more ingredients than the average vitamin c serum,such as hyluronic acid as well as vitamin e.</li>
            <li>I was using another product that was very expensive and honestly like this product better and love my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant fading of old acne scars on my jaw line.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the product and  think it has a good future.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>Received product very fast and will need to see how this really works on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But I do leave it on as long as I can and add a moisturizer on top just before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>Great mixed into my other skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how it works long term, but let me tell you why I already love it.</li>
            <li>complexion is becoming smoother and has smaller pores.  </li>
            <li>I love that it lasts a very long time, I&#x27;ve used it for maybe a month and havent put a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li>That means it&#x27;s pure.</li>
            <li>how raidiant my skin looks and that is without telling anyone I am using a new product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week now I been using this serum and LOVE my skin so much radiant and has calm my acne down in a way.</li>
            <li>loving this,my skins soft and glowing.i deff recommend this as the winter weather comes soon and dry skin follows</li>
            <li>Some fine lines have already started to disappear and it&#x27;s only been 5 days.</li>
            <li>It looked like I had sever sun burn with tons of peeling and huge red splotches.</li>
            <li>It looks promising.</li>
            <li>To see the real results will take some time, you just have to be patient.</li>
            <li>maybe it really does take a while to start seeing results --</li>
            <li>For real stunned.  </li>
            <li>Almost seems like a hallucination because it is happening so fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a very even tone to it now, and my pores have diminished.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>It has made the scar tissue much softer than it was before.</li>
            <li>3 days in use, which makes it so very elastic face.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Just want say this Vitamin C Serum is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It really brightened my 40+ year-old skin and made it radiant.</li>
            <li>this really works on my skin.</li>
            <li>This serum works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I see a difference like the texture, absorb fast, no smell</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin otherwise</li>
            <li>This is fast absorbing product.</li>
            <li>Make up application is much easier.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t really need a lot of drops to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>It actually goes on really smooth, almost silky.</li>
            <li>But after using it for a while I really want to put my thoughts and feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I can use it under my makeup and after the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product and think everyone should try this.</li>
            <li>A very soothing feel with no fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous results and would continue to have this product as part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li>this didn&#x27;t really do anything ....</li>
            <li>Since it has whitening effect, I will be using it for practically my whole body.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so if I use for a much longer time, I may see some changes in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I must say that my skin is feeling so much smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>After about 15 minutes my face feels fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>and I think it really has made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Delivery fast</li>
            <li>I have on brown spot on my cheek and really, really want it to go away.  </li>
            <li>and she said she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>It does not smell and goes very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After thorough cleansing I use a couple drops and it feels really silky when I start to rub it into my skin</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I am very choosy about the products that go on my skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so u can&#x27;t tell its on your face and drys fast not greasy feeling</li>
            <li>Im a clinical aesthetician and I can absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>The customer service is also appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great value as I&#x27;ve paid as much as 3x&#x27;s the price for similar serums, and I feel like the results are the same.</li>
            <li>Only just received this product, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried other serums before and so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have started on my second bottle and shall continue to monitor my own progress, for which I shall  give another follow-up review at a later time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many professional products and I would rank this with some of the best!</li>
            <li>love this it actually makes you feel young again.</li>
            <li>It sinks right in so it doesn&#x27;t really feel moist, but in the morning your skin will glow and feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>fact that this serum is prepared fresh and that customer service is exceptional, and wastes no time to ensure that one is satisfied, gives confididence to say the least in orodering this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Vitamin C for your face is the hot new item for face care.  </li>
            <li>excited to see further results!</li>
            <li>The  inclusion of fragrance doesn&#x27;t make sense (like so many other fragrance scented beauty products).  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using a retinol cream be sure to use your retinoid at night and the Vitamin C in the morning because, if combined, they cancel each other out.</li>
            <li>but I shop a lot and other merchants are ususally much more prompt.</li>
            <li>My neck also had many wrinkles in it due to weight lose.</li>
            <li>Building up my arsenal with high grade products and not unhappy so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>ok, rarely do I rave about a product but in one week: the &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; look I&#x27;ve battled for years on either side of my nose is gone, not better,</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and the first thing am glad for is that it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines are pretty deep</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a little light serum for my facial routine but it absorbs so quickly!!</li>
            <li>too, like another buyer mentioned utilized a special Tx roller to get extra benefit when using this serum.</li>
            <li>After i was sent Salvere , i gave it to her to give it a try, knowing that she has a pantry full of different skin care products, n</li>
            <li>I used Retin A for 11 days and ended up to have peeling, redness, dark skin, brown spots and more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural ingredients that help to remove the dead skin cells gently and brighten my skin effectively.</li>
            <li>The consistency during application was very light and the color was clear, both as expected.  </li>
            <li>When I used it on my whole face, it helped moisturize my dry skin significantly.</li>
            <li>Very dry mature skins or prominently lined ones benefit most and can see obvious improvements within a relatively short period of usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with problematic skin for many years and nothing seemed to help, products either dried out my skin or made it extremely oily and thus resulting in more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say no wrinkles now, but they are less prominent</li>
            <li>After repeated use, I had built up a crust under my eye that made me look quite a bit older.  </li>
            <li>I think everyone that has smile lines or just wants an overall improvement in skin appearance should give this a try.</li>
            <li>My face feels really smooth and makeup goes on much better, no more creasing lines or caked on look especially under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My pores are tight and I feel like my skin even has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Looks high quality.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It feels great going on and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling one but greasy or heavy like other moisturizers can.  </li>
            <li>After doing my due diligence and researching the ingredients of this product, I was ready to try out this advanced formula.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>When first smelling it, it smelled like orange just a little or just a light</li>
            <li>However my sagging skin got much better in just few days.</li>
            <li>Hoping to see even more results within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I ran across this product and I use it everyday absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Not  sure if she&#x27;s seen any changes, but Vitamin C seems to be a good thing overall.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it absorbs into my skin and does not make it feel heavy.</li>
            <li>Love this product and have been using everyday.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing an improvement about 10 days later on my laugh lines and crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>After washing and drying my face, I rub a couple of drops on my face until it is absorbed, then layer my regular day and night creams over it.</li>
            <li>I almost hardly never use lotion on my face anymore now that I use this.  </li>
            <li>And when I wake up in the morning, my face feels really soft, rejuvenated and really smooth unlike before its either dry or oily.</li>
            <li>Right now I only use it in the morning because I use oils at night.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a daily moisturizer under my make up and my makeup glides right on, and it does not change the look of my makeup at all or make it look oily.</li>
            <li>People always assume I am younger than I actually am, so imagine my surprise when I started noticing some fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin should be a little more cautious with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a could weeks now, and officially cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>the skin is new..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s time to buy a new bottle.</li>
            <li>(I believe this is a brand new product for this brand</li>
            <li>I think I notice a new smoothness to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Have tried at least 3 other serums with same ingredients but by far this is The BEST!!!!</li>
            <li>I woke up one morning to feel a light crust of dried skin over the patch of brown pigmentation on my cheek (the one that has bothered me for ages).I gently got rid of the flaky skin .</li>
            <li>My skin is more even toned, brighter and although minimal, my tiny freckles have started to fade.</li>
            <li>I have only been using a few days but so far I love it!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for awhile and it leaves your face very soft</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>makes skin feel very soft</li>
            <li>I feel my skin has been come very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, I was nervous about the acid</li>
            <li>It dried SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>but...you know, you&#x27;re supposed to start early to avoid them!</li>
            <li>satisfied customer after a few orders now !</li>
            <li>I decided to try this vitamin c product on it and it helped decrease it considerably!</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel so young!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a facial oil</li>
            <li>It has also helped make my fine lines less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It will take a while as the lines are 64 years old!  </li>
            <li>It came in a small glass bottle with a pump top.</li>
            <li>only difference is it made my skin break out consistently for the 2 months I used it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>You skin just feels silky, not dry and tight like most.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see big results, but I love the silky feel it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>In a few days the fine warts in my neck were gone.</li>
            <li>Initially it stings a bit, but it subsides quickly and it takes a few minutes to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>, I battle with acne that leaves my pores large and open.</li>
            <li>I typically use it after I get out of the shower, when my skin is clean.</li>
            <li>so I can really test if it does what it really claims to do (minus the wrinkle/fine lines part since I don&#x27;t have them yet).</li>
            <li>This one is clear with no fragrance whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I just received 2 days but so far i like the texture and when i apply on my skin.</li>
            <li>It immediately made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft after use.</li>
            <li>My sun damage has been reduced and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>Looks too much like a bottle of essential oil, wish it looked fancier but in no way does it effect the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin..  </li>
            <li>Can use this on sensitive skin without worrying about irritation.</li>
            <li>and I can see the natural brightening affect it has had on my skin.  </li>
            <li>the story began when she was young n</li>
            <li>it really gives the skin much younger appearance !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a very pricey serum and decided to try this brand, for which I had no prior knowledge.  </li>
            <li>I often have a reaction to Vitamin C serums, but this did not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I just wanted to warn users not to use it near the eye area.  </li>
            <li>But after just a week of use, my skin is so  much tighter and my pores smaller.  </li>
            <li>this Salvere help thank you so much and relived the itching on my back</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen results, but way too early</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for over two months now and I am in my early 30s.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so soft</li>
            <li>my face is so sensitive but this product works for me.</li>
            <li>Regarding the sun spots, I cannot really tell yet since it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>So overall, I give this serum a 5 star since I really like it</li>
            <li>I do use Salvere with a natural cleanser and a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>) professional.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the way my skin is looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>Got marked improvement in wrinkles and skin texture.</li>
            <li>I have oily and sensitive skin and this serum</li>
            <li>It doesnt feel greasy and has no harsh odor.</li>
            <li>I have always had very oily skin, so I have never been too worried about wrinkles and such.  </li>
            <li>Then my hands my grandson said they look old grandma why.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just been using it on the one area, but I think I&#x27;ll add this to my daily routine and put it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft</li>
            <li>It only takes two drops applied to each cheek to moisturize my whole face.</li>
            <li>This serum locks in the moisture you do have and leaves your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li>My scalp is now healing and my face is so soft.</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>You can use very sparingly so it will last!!</li>
            <li>I use only a few drops of Salvere serum morning and most of nights, (I also use twice per week .5</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how my skin will look after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was thick and easy to apply and a little went a long way!!</li>
            <li>I keep my bottle in the fridge and in just one week I have noticed that my skin is more supple and less dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helped with fine lines</li>
            <li>And last but not least, I have developed since towards end of December,lovely rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li>And last but not least, I have developed since towards end of December,lovely rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li>After one application of this product at first night almost all of my problems were gone in the next morning except those extra wrinkles</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this serum to anyone women or men to help with multiple things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m middle aged and have always had oily skin with mild acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>As this was an unknown brand to me, my comfort level went up even before I received the shipment because I knew exactly who to contact if I had questions..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a little early but it appears to be drying out my skin, it could be partly due to the winter season as well, I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 now and for the first time since I was 15 my face has a natural glow to it and when accompanied with a few other products Ive started using I can say Ive finally got that smooth skin</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about a week and a half and am already seeing a change,I am excited about the changes to come with continued use.</li>
            <li>Plus, C+E Ferulic is that it has anti-oxidant properties such as Vitamin E and Vitamin and as a 40+ lady signs of aging are becoming apparent and I like anything that has the potential of slowing down that process.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using ferulic acid and my skin is looking much improved since using this serum over the past 10 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few vitamin c serums and so far nothing that exciting.</li>
            <li>After the third time,I noticed that the  brown patch had kind of broken up (fragmented) .</li>
            <li>After the third time,I noticed that the  brown patch had kind of broken up (fragmented) .</li>
            <li>This is one of the serums that I had the opportunity to use for a few weeks before finding out that I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>So I can rub it on my face and then lay right down</li>
            <li>I have notice my fine line and wrinkles are slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li>After trying so many anti-aging products with little or no results, I was surprised to see results after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>I apply it every night before going to bed and the next morning I will have a soft skin</li>
            <li>and I like it so far especially in the morning</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue which i appreciate because I have such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am almost 42 years old but people mistake me for much younger.</li>
            <li>Her hands skin was too old compared to her actual age ( she is 45 ) ..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed tiny wrinkles near my eyes</li>
            <li>Have only used a handful of times so far, but like the feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old &amp; would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>It was slightly different in appearance as far as the color of the glass.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, this makes my face so soft, like silk.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that a product like this which takes time to be of optimal benefit would only have been tested for &amp;#34;months&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I used this for a few days now and it seems to brighten my skin and seems to be smoothing the laugh lines</li>
            <li>and I was wondering if this one would work any better or worse.</li>
            <li>I also incorporated  Per other feedback, I just purchased Mogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2 fl.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you can tolerate slight tingling when first applied.</li>
            <li>The Salvere  Vitamin C Serum has left my skin soft and my scars become smaller..</li>
            <li>have only been using this serum for about 3 weeks now, but I have noticed a marked improvement in the color and texture of my facial skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure if my facial skin is looking better due to learning how to properly use my Clarisonic, the ferulic acid, or a combination of the two.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like other serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>and I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The claims for this product is one that the benefits will only be seen over a long period of time but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>First I thought few drops won&#x27;t be enough</li>
            <li>This serum has helped reduce fine lines and has healed a few old, small scars from acne.</li>
            <li>I put this on first after cleansing &amp; let it soak in for a few minutes, then I add my essential oil blend!</li>
            <li>I havent noticed much as far as long term improvement in the absence of the product.  </li>
            <li>I usually use this serum right after cleansing and I allow 2-3 minutes for it to absorb before applying moisturizer (Naked Bee Vitamin C Enriched SPF 30).</li>
            <li>Usually my Vitamin C Serums come in dark brown or dark blue glass to keep the light from filtering through too much.</li>
            <li>Getting older I&#x27;ve noticed some dark spots and darkening around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really do anything except make my skin a little smoother.</li>
            <li>Definately notice a positive difference in my face , pore size has gone down and dry patches are gone, age spots lightened.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, there was no discernible odor, either bad or good, which is something I value in a product.  </li>
            <li>Does not seem to cause any results, good or bad.</li>
            <li>My oily combination sensitive skin has not broken out nor has it reacted in any negative way to this product.</li>

            <li> I have nice skin.</li>
            <li> Read up more about what vitamin C can do for you skin because a review won&#x27;t cover anything besides a stranger saying &amp;#34;it&#x27;s good, trust me&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always nice to know that they appreciate your business.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see a date on the product box showing 9/2016</li>
            <li> I really liked the serum</li>
            <li> it felt nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> Nice product...</li>
            <li> I was very happy with your product, also price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I was applying a good serum, filled with vitamin C!</li>
            <li> After so many months of searching for a good Vitamin C serum, I came across Salvere</li>
            <li> So every night, I wash my face with warm water, dove soap and fingertip towel, then apply a drop or 2 of Salvere Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> With that said, all my opinions are my own and they did not ask me to leave any feedbacks or pay me.</li>
            <li> I think it would be perfect if this also had vitamin A in it but works very well even as it is.</li>
            <li> The serum feels really nice on my skin, and absorbs thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice grade of serum.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a wonderful product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I totally am loving what this Vitamin C serum is doing to my skin and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this could have been achieved without implementing Salvere Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy and drys fast and my face is glowing, my skin feels great!!</li>
            <li> Love love love thus serum!!</li>
            <li> Love love love my vitamin c serum!!</li>

            <li> , This is a wonderful product i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was easy to apply ,to use, smelled good and after rubbed into my skin</li>
            <li> It had a pleasant scent and went on really smoothly.</li>
            <li> It apply very easy .</li>
            <li> Tried it for many days, love it!</li>
            <li> This is just as good as those same serums that the plastic surgeons  and dermatologists push for $130.00 or more!!!</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m always running them under water, I started using this every morning and night to soften my hands, and they feel soft and does not leave any greasy feeling, great product!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is the best ingredient for youthful, clear, even-skin tone.</li>
            <li> and then seal it in with a nice application of moisturizer on top of it all.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum because it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I smiled before, I would notice more skin creasing around the corners and bottom of my eyes.</li>
            <li> include very lightweight, not greasy or sticky, and incredible customer service.</li>
            <li> 58 yr old, sun damaged skin looks amazingly beautiful!!!!  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is suitable for every women.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting or aggravate my hyper-sensitive skin (even after dermarolling) and seems to be doing a good job at keeping the lines and wrinkles at a comfortable distance.</li>
            <li> The packaging is superb, completely wrapped and sealed to prevent leakage.</li>
            <li> Best formula I have found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most effective anti-wrinkle Vit C is in a formulation you mix and use immediately.</li>
            <li> goes on easy and cant wait to see the longer use outcome!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> Not so pleasant for the 10 seconds but afterwards, the scent quickly dissipated.  </li>

            <li> but so far so good, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty great skin already, but I did notice an improvement in the texture and softness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen some reduction in my fine lines already!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very smooth .</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to have found this deal, just turning 60, and looking at lines, this was a blessing.</li>
            <li> Very light not sticky.</li>
            <li> it now my skin is very smooth and brighter</li>

            <li> the serum has made my face more smooth and more radiant</li>
            <li> This combo seems to give my skin a nice rosy glow, to the point that I don&#x27;t feel the need to use much foundation or concealer (if any), which is really nice.</li>
            <li> but I love the smooth feeling on my face and top of hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m HAPPY with it, so far, and I think using it will probably reduce wrinkles (which I don&#x27;t seem to have, yet!</li>
            <li> Many of the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared, and my lip line is noticeably smoother.  </li>
            <li> I really love it, makes my face so smooth</li>

            <li> According to my Aunt it really work good...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and so far I love it!!  </li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C serums, this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> I also use glycolic (and other peels) and I find this product is excellent to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and smooth and allows for a very nice foundation application.  </li>
            <li> Great, Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>

            <li> This is the best vitamin C serum I have used so far, the liquid is watery and clear, easy to absorb and leaving a very smooth skin after applying.</li>
            <li> The area which is of most concern to me is the eye area and my fine lines are greatly improved in just a short time.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light going on &amp; absorbes quickly -</li>
            <li> It is very light and does not absorb quickly (takes about 25 mins to absorb).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is simply pure magic!  </li>
            <li> What impressed me most was the personal \\&quot;after Sales\\&quot; follow-up service, received from this particular seller.</li>
            <li> and I have seen some of my fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li> I am also using this product on my face for fine lines and sun damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this products I notice my pigmentation are lighten and any fine lines and wrinkles are faded.</li>
            <li> I like that Salvere is a light weight serum, easy to apply with dropper provided.  </li>
            <li> I hope to continue to see improvements in clarity and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I can already see a reduction in the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> Those fine lines seem to blur.  </li>
            <li> I have some fine lines and they do seem fuller.  </li>
            <li> This serum did seem to reduce the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m an avid blogger and product tester, I was sent a free bottle of this serum in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Mega Bright by Origins, Olay ProX and Roc  products on my face to fade brown spots but none have come close to the results I have experienced with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick service!</li>
            <li> Received it quickly, and love the way it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> I still wanna see more positive results :)</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in fine lines either.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and I have already noticed a reduction in fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I just started using this Vit C Serum, I use it under makeup, it does seem to allow my foundation to glide on smoothly and reduced the fine lines.</li>
            <li> Rose Water to counterbalance the pure Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can see a huge difference &amp; can feel it with my finger.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s just my routine, it applies really smoothly and doesn&#x27;t really require you to leave it on there without touching it for more than maybe a minute or so.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> but as I have them for now,I shall enjoy them .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I love this serum so much</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive skin, feels nice.</li>
            <li> Feels so smooth on your skin and soaks in right away.</li>
            <li> But so far, it&#x27;s very easy to use and no bad feeling (too oily or dryness)</li>
            <li> Would have loved to have a little bit more chemistry details on the product.</li>
            <li> Seriously this product is awesome!!</li>
            <li> This company also packaged and shipped the product quickly.  </li>
            <li> definitely they look so much better and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Skinceuticals (made in the USA) user.</li>
            <li> It has given me a more vibrant, glowing and well moisturized</li>
            <li> I find it spreads easier, sits better under makeup, smells better,  and gives the same results!</li>
            <li> My evening regiment also includes a mild retinol product.</li>
            <li> I think it will help my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and clear my skin still looks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C as an anti-wrinkle agent is &#x27;volatile&#x27; meaning it expires quickly in a suspension.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product with high hopes for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> she is so happy with this serum , She asked me to buy her another bottle although it is still half full , i recommend it for any person with skin aging problems ..</li>
            <li> They are so match,it also help the facial oil to absorb so quickly...!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say Thank You Salvere Company for doing the free giveaway though you facebook.</li>
            <li> The only reason for giving it 4 stars is that the package does not look very appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, need more time to see how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> I used this one after using my Derma Roller and it was absorbed into my skin quickly</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much!!</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it!!!</li>
            <li> I love Salvere so far!</li>
            <li> Really worked on fine lines.</li>
            <li> This serum really seems to have improved the texture and fine lines in my face.</li>
            <li> really like that the serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin and even sits well under makeup if you want to use it in your morning skin care routine!</li>
            <li> I had one pimple when I tried this the first day but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> (it made my skin extremely smooth, soft, and touchably inviting)&lt;br /&gt;-Reduces fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Absorption was fine and, better yet, left no tackiness or stickiness on my skin.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days of use I have noticed a great improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and for the price definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Love these vitamins so far</li>
            <li> my natural make-up to go on better</li>
            <li> It was totally worth the price to try it.</li>
            <li> Also, keep your Vitamin C in the fridge to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> It is economical, too.</li>
            <li> It was quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my oily sensitive skin or cause a breakout and help with wrinkles and so far it&#x27;s seems to be doing a good job</li>
            <li> Also the with the lines when I smile I can tell they are going away some already too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for that alone.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times but liked it.</li>
            <li> I can not speak to it&#x27;s ability to slow or delay the aging process but being healthy looking is just as good.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> I love this serum it goes on light and is making a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> She says it makes her skin smooth, soft, and reduces the appearance of her wrinkles significantly.  </li>

            <li> used to facial oil with my dry skin everyday,so i try to mix this serum with 1~2 pumps rose hip oil..!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice quality Vitamin C serum; more viscous than other brands I&#x27;ve tried like Obagi + Skinsceuticals yet equally fast-absorbing.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t pill your makeup.</li>
            <li> Maybe some betterment right as it is applied.</li>
            <li> and we both could tell a difference right away and wee both</li>
            <li> Soaks right in</li>
            <li> Absorbs right into my skin with no greasy residue...</li>
            <li> Goes on as a liquid and soaks right in.</li>
            <li> Soaks right into my skin</li>
            <li> I am not wearing foundation right now</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away with the texture of my skin and the size reduction of my pores.  </li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this formulation of Salvere&#x27;s Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum because of the other natural ingredients and the pleasant experience I&#x27;ve had thus far!br /&gt;About</li>
            <li> My smile lines are becoming finer and my neck wrinkles are going away and my hands don&#x27;t look quite as old</li>

            <li> So far in the short term of things I absolutely love it, and genuinely hope that it will continue to be useful!</li>
            <li> Great product, After a few days my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The seller however waited about a week or more to complete the purchase on my debit/credit and it arrived on the very last estimated ship date which is okay</li>

            <li> It is really fast absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li> The tinted container looked exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with what I received and, after having a chance to judge effectiveness, will update my rating, possibly to a 5.  </li>
            <li> have reduced and my skin overall just feels alot better.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use my entire bottle without it changing color.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I was able to use a 15% Vitamin C serum (no E Ferulic Acid added) under the eye prior to this and never had a problem.  </li>
            <li> i do put one drop on the back of each hand when i use itand LOVE the way that feels ....</li>

            <li> For now, I love the short terms results!</li>
            <li> My skin seems much firmer &amp; the wrinkles around my mouth are softer!</li>
            <li> It leaves somewhat of a sticky residue, especially if used all over the face, so I would recommend this product more for spot treatments or for use overnight.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After only a couple of weeks using it my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all and knew I needed something to start working on this problem before they became larger and more visible.</li>
            <li> It feels like it tightens (but not too much!)  </li>
            <li> There is no weird smell to it, either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not heavy, tacky, or greasy.</li>

            <li> High quality product with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum in a tiny bottle!i use this as my DAY serum,because it protects against sun damage,and has more ingredients than the average vitamin c serum,such as hyluronic acid as well as vitamin e.</li>
            <li> I was using another product that was very expensive and honestly like this product better and love my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant fading of old acne scars on my jaw line.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the product and  think it has a good future.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Received product very fast and will need to see how this really works on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But I do leave it on as long as I can and add a moisturizer on top just before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Great mixed into my other skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how it works long term, but let me tell you why I already love it.</li>
            <li> complexion is becoming smoother and has smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> I love that it lasts a very long time, I&#x27;ve used it for maybe a month and havent put a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s pure.</li>
            <li> how raidiant my skin looks and that is without telling anyone I am using a new product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week now I been using this serum and LOVE my skin so much radiant and has calm my acne down in a way.</li>
            <li> loving this,my skins soft and glowing.i deff recommend this as the winter weather comes soon and dry skin follows</li>
            <li> Some fine lines have already started to disappear and it&#x27;s only been 5 days.</li>
            <li> It looked like I had sever sun burn with tons of peeling and huge red splotches.</li>
            <li> It looks promising.</li>
            <li> To see the real results will take some time, you just have to be patient.</li>
            <li> maybe it really does take a while to start seeing results --</li>
            <li> For real stunned.  </li>
            <li> Almost seems like a hallucination because it is happening so fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a very even tone to it now, and my pores have diminished.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> It has made the scar tissue much softer than it was before.</li>
            <li> 3 days in use, which makes it so very elastic face.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just want say this Vitamin C Serum is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It really brightened my 40+ year-old skin and made it radiant.</li>
            <li> this really works on my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I see a difference like the texture, absorb fast, no smell</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin otherwise</li>
            <li> This is fast absorbing product.</li>
            <li> Make up application is much easier.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t really need a lot of drops to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> It actually goes on really smooth, almost silky.</li>
            <li> But after using it for a while I really want to put my thoughts and feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I can use it under my makeup and after the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product and think everyone should try this.</li>
            <li> A very soothing feel with no fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous results and would continue to have this product as part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t really do anything ....</li>
            <li> Since it has whitening effect, I will be using it for practically my whole body.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so if I use for a much longer time, I may see some changes in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I must say that my skin is feeling so much smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes my face feels fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> and I think it really has made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Delivery fast</li>
            <li> I have on brown spot on my cheek and really, really want it to go away.  </li>
            <li> and she said she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> It does not smell and goes very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After thorough cleansing I use a couple drops and it feels really silky when I start to rub it into my skin</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I am very choosy about the products that go on my skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so u can&#x27;t tell its on your face and drys fast not greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Im a clinical aesthetician and I can absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> The customer service is also appreciated.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great value as I&#x27;ve paid as much as 3x&#x27;s the price for similar serums, and I feel like the results are the same.</li>
            <li> Only just received this product, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other serums before and so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have started on my second bottle and shall continue to monitor my own progress, for which I shall  give another follow-up review at a later time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many professional products and I would rank this with some of the best!</li>
            <li> love this it actually makes you feel young again.</li>
            <li> It sinks right in so it doesn&#x27;t really feel moist, but in the morning your skin will glow and feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> fact that this serum is prepared fresh and that customer service is exceptional, and wastes no time to ensure that one is satisfied, gives confididence to say the least in orodering this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Vitamin C for your face is the hot new item for face care.  </li>
            <li> excited to see further results!</li>
            <li> The  inclusion of fragrance doesn&#x27;t make sense (like so many other fragrance scented beauty products).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a retinol cream be sure to use your retinoid at night and the Vitamin C in the morning because, if combined, they cancel each other out.</li>
            <li> but I shop a lot and other merchants are ususally much more prompt.</li>
            <li> My neck also had many wrinkles in it due to weight lose.</li>
            <li> Building up my arsenal with high grade products and not unhappy so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> ok, rarely do I rave about a product but in one week: the &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; look I&#x27;ve battled for years on either side of my nose is gone, not better,</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and the first thing am glad for is that it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines are pretty deep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a little light serum for my facial routine but it absorbs so quickly!!</li>
            <li> too, like another buyer mentioned utilized a special Tx roller to get extra benefit when using this serum.</li>
            <li> After i was sent Salvere , i gave it to her to give it a try, knowing that she has a pantry full of different skin care products, n</li>
            <li> I used Retin A for 11 days and ended up to have peeling, redness, dark skin, brown spots and more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural ingredients that help to remove the dead skin cells gently and brighten my skin effectively.</li>
            <li> The consistency during application was very light and the color was clear, both as expected.  </li>
            <li> When I used it on my whole face, it helped moisturize my dry skin significantly.</li>
            <li> Very dry mature skins or prominently lined ones benefit most and can see obvious improvements within a relatively short period of usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with problematic skin for many years and nothing seemed to help, products either dried out my skin or made it extremely oily and thus resulting in more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say no wrinkles now, but they are less prominent</li>
            <li> After repeated use, I had built up a crust under my eye that made me look quite a bit older.  </li>
            <li> I think everyone that has smile lines or just wants an overall improvement in skin appearance should give this a try.</li>
            <li> My face feels really smooth and makeup goes on much better, no more creasing lines or caked on look especially under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My pores are tight and I feel like my skin even has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looks high quality.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It feels great going on and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling one but greasy or heavy like other moisturizers can.  </li>
            <li> After doing my due diligence and researching the ingredients of this product, I was ready to try out this advanced formula.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> When first smelling it, it smelled like orange just a little or just a light</li>
            <li> However my sagging skin got much better in just few days.</li>
            <li> Hoping to see even more results within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I ran across this product and I use it everyday absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Not  sure if she&#x27;s seen any changes, but Vitamin C seems to be a good thing overall.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it absorbs into my skin and does not make it feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using everyday.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing an improvement about 10 days later on my laugh lines and crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> After washing and drying my face, I rub a couple of drops on my face until it is absorbed, then layer my regular day and night creams over it.</li>
            <li> I almost hardly never use lotion on my face anymore now that I use this.  </li>
            <li> And when I wake up in the morning, my face feels really soft, rejuvenated and really smooth unlike before its either dry or oily.</li>
            <li> Right now I only use it in the morning because I use oils at night.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a daily moisturizer under my make up and my makeup glides right on, and it does not change the look of my makeup at all or make it look oily.</li>
            <li> People always assume I am younger than I actually am, so imagine my surprise when I started noticing some fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin should be a little more cautious with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a could weeks now, and officially cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> the skin is new..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time to buy a new bottle.</li>
            <li> (I believe this is a brand new product for this brand</li>
            <li> I think I notice a new smoothness to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Have tried at least 3 other serums with same ingredients but by far this is The BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> I woke up one morning to feel a light crust of dried skin over the patch of brown pigmentation on my cheek (the one that has bothered me for ages).I gently got rid of the flaky skin .</li>
            <li> My skin is more even toned, brighter and although minimal, my tiny freckles have started to fade.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a few days but so far I love it!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile and it leaves your face very soft</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> makes skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> I feel my skin has been come very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, I was nervous about the acid</li>
            <li> It dried SUPER fast!</li>
            <li> but...you know, you&#x27;re supposed to start early to avoid them!</li>
            <li> satisfied customer after a few orders now !</li>
            <li> I decided to try this vitamin c product on it and it helped decrease it considerably!</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel so young!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a facial oil</li>
            <li> It has also helped make my fine lines less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It will take a while as the lines are 64 years old!  </li>
            <li> It came in a small glass bottle with a pump top.</li>
            <li> only difference is it made my skin break out consistently for the 2 months I used it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You skin just feels silky, not dry and tight like most.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see big results, but I love the silky feel it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> In a few days the fine warts in my neck were gone.</li>
            <li> Initially it stings a bit, but it subsides quickly and it takes a few minutes to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> , I battle with acne that leaves my pores large and open.</li>
            <li> I typically use it after I get out of the shower, when my skin is clean.</li>
            <li> so I can really test if it does what it really claims to do (minus the wrinkle/fine lines part since I don&#x27;t have them yet).</li>
            <li> This one is clear with no fragrance whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I just received 2 days but so far i like the texture and when i apply on my skin.</li>
            <li> It immediately made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft after use.</li>
            <li> My sun damage has been reduced and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Looks too much like a bottle of essential oil, wish it looked fancier but in no way does it effect the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin..  </li>
            <li> Can use this on sensitive skin without worrying about irritation.</li>
            <li> and I can see the natural brightening affect it has had on my skin.  </li>
            <li> the story began when she was young n</li>
            <li> it really gives the skin much younger appearance !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a very pricey serum and decided to try this brand, for which I had no prior knowledge.  </li>
            <li> I often have a reaction to Vitamin C serums, but this did not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to warn users not to use it near the eye area.  </li>
            <li> But after just a week of use, my skin is so  much tighter and my pores smaller.  </li>
            <li> this Salvere help thank you so much and relived the itching on my back</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen results, but way too early</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over two months now and I am in my early 30s.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so soft</li>
            <li> my face is so sensitive but this product works for me.</li>
            <li> Regarding the sun spots, I cannot really tell yet since it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> So overall, I give this serum a 5 star since I really like it</li>
            <li> I do use Salvere with a natural cleanser and a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ) professional.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the way my skin is looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> Got marked improvement in wrinkles and skin texture.</li>
            <li> I have oily and sensitive skin and this serum</li>
            <li> It doesnt feel greasy and has no harsh odor.</li>
            <li> I have always had very oily skin, so I have never been too worried about wrinkles and such.  </li>
            <li> Then my hands my grandson said they look old grandma why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using it on the one area, but I think I&#x27;ll add this to my daily routine and put it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft</li>
            <li> It only takes two drops applied to each cheek to moisturize my whole face.</li>
            <li> This serum locks in the moisture you do have and leaves your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> My scalp is now healing and my face is so soft.</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> You can use very sparingly so it will last!!</li>
            <li> I use only a few drops of Salvere serum morning and most of nights, (I also use twice per week .5</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how my skin will look after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I liked that it was thick and easy to apply and a little went a long way!!</li>
            <li> I keep my bottle in the fridge and in just one week I have noticed that my skin is more supple and less dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helped with fine lines</li>
            <li> And last but not least, I have developed since towards end of December,lovely rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li> And last but not least, I have developed since towards end of December,lovely rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li> After one application of this product at first night almost all of my problems were gone in the next morning except those extra wrinkles</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this serum to anyone women or men to help with multiple things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m middle aged and have always had oily skin with mild acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> As this was an unknown brand to me, my comfort level went up even before I received the shipment because I knew exactly who to contact if I had questions..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little early but it appears to be drying out my skin, it could be partly due to the winter season as well, I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 now and for the first time since I was 15 my face has a natural glow to it and when accompanied with a few other products Ive started using I can say Ive finally got that smooth skin</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about a week and a half and am already seeing a change,I am excited about the changes to come with continued use.</li>
            <li> Plus, C+E Ferulic is that it has anti-oxidant properties such as Vitamin E and Vitamin and as a 40+ lady signs of aging are becoming apparent and I like anything that has the potential of slowing down that process.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using ferulic acid and my skin is looking much improved since using this serum over the past 10 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few vitamin c serums and so far nothing that exciting.</li>
            <li> After the third time,I noticed that the  brown patch had kind of broken up (fragmented) .</li>
            <li> After the third time,I noticed that the  brown patch had kind of broken up (fragmented) .</li>
            <li> This is one of the serums that I had the opportunity to use for a few weeks before finding out that I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> So I can rub it on my face and then lay right down</li>
            <li> I have notice my fine line and wrinkles are slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> After trying so many anti-aging products with little or no results, I was surprised to see results after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I apply it every night before going to bed and the next morning I will have a soft skin</li>
            <li> and I like it so far especially in the morning</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue which i appreciate because I have such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am almost 42 years old but people mistake me for much younger.</li>
            <li> Her hands skin was too old compared to her actual age ( she is 45 ) ..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed tiny wrinkles near my eyes</li>
            <li> Have only used a handful of times so far, but like the feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 years old &amp; would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> It was slightly different in appearance as far as the color of the glass.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, this makes my face so soft, like silk.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a product like this which takes time to be of optimal benefit would only have been tested for &amp;#34;months&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days now and it seems to brighten my skin and seems to be smoothing the laugh lines</li>
            <li> and I was wondering if this one would work any better or worse.</li>
            <li> I also incorporated  Per other feedback, I just purchased Mogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2 fl.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you can tolerate slight tingling when first applied.</li>
            <li> The Salvere  Vitamin C Serum has left my skin soft and my scars become smaller..</li>
            <li> have only been using this serum for about 3 weeks now, but I have noticed a marked improvement in the color and texture of my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my facial skin is looking better due to learning how to properly use my Clarisonic, the ferulic acid, or a combination of the two.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like other serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> and I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The claims for this product is one that the benefits will only be seen over a long period of time but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> First I thought few drops won&#x27;t be enough</li>
            <li> This serum has helped reduce fine lines and has healed a few old, small scars from acne.</li>
            <li> I put this on first after cleansing &amp; let it soak in for a few minutes, then I add my essential oil blend!</li>
            <li> I havent noticed much as far as long term improvement in the absence of the product.  </li>
            <li> I usually use this serum right after cleansing and I allow 2-3 minutes for it to absorb before applying moisturizer (Naked Bee Vitamin C Enriched SPF 30).</li>
            <li> Usually my Vitamin C Serums come in dark brown or dark blue glass to keep the light from filtering through too much.</li>
            <li> Getting older I&#x27;ve noticed some dark spots and darkening around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything except make my skin a little smoother.</li>
            <li> Definately notice a positive difference in my face , pore size has gone down and dry patches are gone, age spots lightened.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, there was no discernible odor, either bad or good, which is something I value in a product.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem to cause any results, good or bad.</li>
            <li> My oily combination sensitive skin has not broken out nor has it reacted in any negative way to this product.</li>
            <li> Little strong for me, but I&#x27;ve began using it in my daily moisturizer and have had no more issues.</li>
            <li> I have to use sparingly because it seems a little heavy (as serums should be at first) but it dissolves completely into my skin.</li>
            <li> I had been using various Vitamin C Serums for a few months before trying this particular one</li>
            <li> Point in case, just the other day, a lady at the grocery store asked how old I was...</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well and does not leave a greasy residue or make my skin feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results yet.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about cosmetic products but in this case I am inclined to believe that this serum did clear my skin, making it appear more translucent and even.  </li>
            <li> This product worked miracles to my moms hands after no other product had any minimal effect on them..</li>
            <li> Right now my skin can get a little less oily as winter will soon be here</li>
            <li> The liquid is clear, has no scent, and is protected from oxidation by the dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s packaged in a bottle to protect the sensitive ingredients, with dark glass and a dropper.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a similar serum for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping my long terms results are the same as the well known brands.  </li>
            <li> Although I did not see any improvements on my wrinkles, I may have not used the product long enough.</li>
            <li> I may add to this review when I have used it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using it long enough</li>
            <li> This product will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Have been using it twice a day for the last week and my face is not as dry.</li>
            <li> the results are far less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and so far I like</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to attest to its long term effects</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it sinks in and it takes very little of the product to do your entire face, so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> enough or least my skin in certain places became really dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a little more than a month now and have seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for the one little patch of stubborn brown pigmentation on my face to clear up.</li>
            <li> My mother who is in her late 50s absolutely loves the serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this about a week or so now, however, I can definitely tell that the dark spots on my face from being in sun or just aging has lightened up a bit.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve not had it for too long.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do long term.</li>
            <li> I have used the product a few times so far</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive, nor oily and I do use the product as preventative rather than to cure something.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this item as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> The brown spots on my face are fading faster than I expected for the short amount of time I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6-7 weeks, so I will still observe long term results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this too long</li>
            <li> I am just amazed at the way this serum has decreased the smile lines I call them on my face.</li>
            <li> My hands on the other hand we starting t show there age.</li>
            <li> I know that I&#x27;ve tried other vit c serums that smelled like hotdogs upon initial application.  </li>
            <li> I got this almost at the same time with the other brand-Yeouth.</li>
            <li> Mi skin is extremely dry and hence this alone is not sufficient for me.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have always used my hands for work(Plant Jobs).</li>
            <li> My skin became dry during these days.</li>
            <li> I have a condition that causes severe dry skin, so I am grateful to have this product.</li>
            <li> It did start to dry my skin out</li>
            <li> it goes on my face and dry areas on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have dry to combination skin</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or over dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I concur with folks who say that only few drops is needed for the entire face.</li>
            <li> Mine was a slow steady process.</li>
            <li> I had foot surgery which has left a long scar down the front of my foot.</li>
            <li> It glides on like silk, has very little scent &amp; makes the skin feel ultra soft.</li>
            <li> In fact after the first month my skin looked worse.</li>
            <li> This alreay brightens my bare skin on my face shedding off the dead layer and hopefully midway through the bottle</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice daily for a week and a half .</li>
            <li> My pores are a bigger than what I would like and I have tried various products over the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> You can pay a fortune for vitamin c serums of similar strength and quality alone, much less with vitamin e and hyaluronic acid also included.</li>
            <li> The bottle seems really small, but it only takes a drop or two, so it&#x27;s going to last a while.</li>
            <li> I will probably still get a little botox every 6 months now--just for that extra</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit gritty, but I can get over it.</li>
            <li> and you only need a little.</li>
            <li> For reference I experience moderate acne and this product does not sting and has little to no scent to it.</li>
            <li> After just a little over a week, my skin is noticeably so much younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it only for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days now</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times, so I&#x27;m not giving it one star since I don&#x27;t  know whether or not it does what it claims to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using on a few spots on my face left from premenstal.</li>
            <li> The serum is as nice as the very expensive product I have purchased in the past from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out and this serum actually help other breakouts disappear completely.</li>
            <li> I cannot and will not live without it!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irate or dry my skin, just makes it feel firmer and less lines.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Reading all the other posted reviews, I have come to the conclusion that the results one gets, is predicated on the skin type one possesses.</li>
            <li> As of today,to my extreme delight,it is almost invisible now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling or wearing-a-mask feeling like the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> This serum works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I am going now to check on other face care items from Salvere.  </li>
            <li> I also layer products on my face and this layers well with other things that I</li>

            <li> A few drops of this goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After using it a few weeks, it seems as though it balanced out the ph of my skin because it isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
            <li> and it is rare that I can use a product that does not break my skin out in ugly red rash patches.</li>
            <li> The skin tone is very even and the small little dark spots I had are now hardly even visible.</li>
            <li> I had heavy wrinkles and frown lines as well as very dry skin</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my imagination that some of my wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> From PubMed : &amp;#34;L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin.</li>
            <li> It has also softened my little crow&#x27;s feet and lightened my dark spots..</li>
            <li> No strong smell or stickiness like other products of this nature</li>
            <li> and I know that a lot of the ingredients of the product are very active in anti aging serums.</li>
            <li> I like the formula&#x27;s feel and the way it absorbs and dries without a tacky, sticky or tight feeling.</li>
            <li> I also put it on a scar on my hand and it softens the tight, drawn look of it.  </li>
            <li> Am so skeptical about trying new things</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference on my face, and the amount used is so little..</li>
            <li> Just I wish it is not made in China and does not contains fragrance which sometimes makes me itchy a little bit.</li>

            <li> use it everyday .</li>
            <li> Going to give it a few weeks to see how it comes along though.</li>
            <li> the serum was clear, odorless, and not to thin but not too thick in texture.</li>
            <li> My one other complaint is that this product contains Butylene Glycol which I am not a fan of.</li>
            <li> Right away I was disappointed to see that the serum is manufactured in CHINA and the company Salvere is based in Oregon.</li>
            <li> And NO long, complicated regimen.</li>
            <li> ; after I put it on...I usually put it on and then make my bed or something, that gives it time to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; guess.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin so I am not sure how that works.</li>
            <li> no more cracks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I 100% trust the quality of ingredients from there.</li>
            <li> I am over forty and not satisfied with my appearance.</li>
            <li> Also sometimes, I get small bumps and some pimples</li>
            <li> One small drop covers quite a bit of area of when applying.</li>
            <li> I had a small bump on my forehead one day that I assumed was an emerging pimple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the hype is.</li>
            <li> There is no sticky residue or weird shine left on your skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m being patient because I know everything usually takes a while to see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the deeper lines around my mouth but with time...</li>
            <li> Not sure what benefit I&#x27;m suppose to see.</li>
            <li> she was at least 15 years off...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly researching skin products to slow my aging.</li>
            <li> serum is thick but not overly so.  </li>
            <li> I have tried just about every product from the sublime to the ridiculous, in every price range, but never have I had the results as I have had with this</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, my complexion was the worst it had ever been in my life.</li>
            <li> My face lady wanted me to take a break from Retinols, and I have tried a few expensive things that were ho-hum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a pleasant feeling to go about your day with.</li>
            <li> Which were very hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> My skin is delicate, harsh winters are especially hard on my face, and this winter was cruel where I live</li>
            <li> I have very delicate skin</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now with a hyluronic acid product and the two together have made my skin softer, decreased the size of my poors and help reduce blackheads.</li>
            <li> Especially my Melasma, I HATE my Melasma</li>
            <li> also didn&#x27;t realize the product contains fragrance which is an unnecessary (in my opinion) irritant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Rubs in very well, doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue.</li>
            <li> In fact, I thought the word &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; was false advertising until this product.</li>
            <li> The reason I can&#x27;t use it is that it makes my face so uncomfortable, like I&#x27;m wearing a thin mask.</li>
            <li> Have been around a few sick folks and have not had a sniffle yet</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink like some other Vit C serums, and I HATE that stinky smell on my face.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the results of SALVERE AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> soon so I won&#x27;t need to buy expensive beauty equipment.      </li>
            <li> seriously the FASTEST SHIPPING EVER!!  </li>
            <li> Took off at least 10 years of my skin!!!</li>
            <li> (cause I am lazy and sometimes forget to take my makeup off in the bathroom, so I have some wipes and my Vit C on my end table) without it getting my pillow all nasty.</li>
            <li> sorry!</li>
            <li> have bad undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li> &amp; i&#x27;ve been too inconsistent (crazy summer!)  </li>
            <li> I hate feeling like I have a glob or glop of stuff on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the worst serum I&#x27;ve ever applied texturally,</li>
            <li> I hate smells!  </li>
            <li> It feels awful and I&#x27;ve never used a product that has felt that way.</li>

            <li> I like this product, it does seem like it helps with the area around my eyes.  I havent noticed much as far as long term improvement in the absence of the product.  But I&#x27;ve not had it for too long.  I love that it lasts a very long time, I&#x27;ve used it for maybe a month and havent put a dent in the bottle. I almost hardly never use lotion on my face anymore now that I use this.  Seems like it has helped with my pores. I go tanning (I know, I know) and it seems like this helps with a brighter complexion.</li>
            <li> After using it a few weeks, it seems as though it balanced out the ph of my skin because it isn&#x27;t as dry. Now I don&#x27;t always have to apply moisturizer after applying the serum. I have also noticed the fading of ance spots. Though I&#x27;m only 22 and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, I battle with acne that leaves my pores large and open. the serum has made my face more smooth and more radiant</li>
            <li> It apply very easy . I just received 2 days but so far i like the texture and when i apply on my skin. it&#x27;s very smooth .</li>
            <li> Very happy with this serum!  It doesn&#x27;t burn or leave any greasy residue.  Goes on easy and makes your skin feel really soft.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands, and I&#x27;m liking what I&#x27;m seeing!</li>
            <li> I swear by Vitamin C to help combat signs of aging and this product is perfect. I put it on every morning after cleansing and sometimes at night too if I have been around smoke or out in the sun a lot. My skin is so much brighter!</li>
            <li> Only just received this product, but so far I love it. It immediately made my skin so soft. It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs well. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like other serums I have used in the past. I will update after I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks. It looks promising. 😄</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product and I can see my skin starting to change. It is softer and appears clearer. Initially it stings a bit, but it subsides quickly and it takes a few minutes to be absorbed. To see the real results will take some time, you just have to be patient.</li>
            <li> Just bought this last feed because of all the good things everyone is saying.  I will update here once I use this for a month and see what the results are. I concur with folks who say that only few drops is needed for the entire face. Mi skin is extremely dry and hence this alone is not sufficient for me. But I do leave it on as long as I can and add a moisturizer on top just before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it sinks in and it takes very little of the product to do your entire face, so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum in a tiny bottle!i use this as my DAY serum,because it protects against sun damage,and has more ingredients than the average vitamin c serum,such as hyluronic acid as well as vitamin e.Feels so smooth on your skin and soaks in right away.Good to use as an everyday serum in your skincare routine</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft after use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> Helps with wrinkles!  :)</li>
            <li> I have  noticed  the difference in my skin since using salvere. My sun damage has been reduced and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, now. I *think* my skin is improving. I&#x27;m wondering if you have to use it 2x a day to &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; see results. I typically use it after I get out of the shower, when my skin is clean. I personally put 3-4 drops in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together, then apply it my face rubbing in a circular motion. I have REALLY problematic skin (or HAD, it&#x27;s always a battle, but generally I&#x27;m a bit more oily/shiny than not). If you&#x27;re worried about this being &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;...don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s almost like one of those dry-suntan lotions. I feel like my skin &amp;#34;drinks it up&amp;#34; after I put it on...I usually put it on and then make my bed or something, that gives it time to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; guess. But that&#x27;s just my routine, it applies really smoothly and doesn&#x27;t really require you to leave it on there without touching it for more than maybe a minute or so. I will come back and update this review...maybe it really does take a while to start seeing results -- I&#x27;m HAPPY with it, so far, and I think using it will probably reduce wrinkles (which I don&#x27;t seem to have, yet! yay!) but...you know, you&#x27;re supposed to start early to avoid them! I&#x27;d say, if you&#x27;re on the fence, try it...it&#x27;s inexpensive enough to give it a go, and I DO think it&#x27;s already having SOME impact on my skin.</li>
            <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference. It&#x27;s okay.</li>

            <li> I love this serum. It glides on like silk, has very little scent &amp; makes the skin feel ultra soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and so far I love it!!  My skin feels smooth and I have already noticed a reduction in fine lines around my mouth. It also feels like my skin is tighter and I almost have a glow, my skin feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week now I been using this serum and LOVE my skin so much radiant and has calm my acne down in a way. And did i mention it makes my face feel like a babies bottom lol</li>

            <li> Love this!  Not oily and it&#x27;s not too liquid-like. I have tried other serums before and so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I really love it, makes my face so smooth and I use it on my hands as well.</li>
            <li> Got for my mom.  Have heard no complaints and she complains about almost everything</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  Helped reduce the look of a scar on my face!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I have really dry hands cause I&#x27;m always running them under water, I started using this every morning and night to soften my hands, and they feel soft and does not leave any greasy feeling, great product!</li>
            <li> perfect addition to my beauty regiment I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Great, Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Doesn&#x27;t irate or dry my skin, just makes it feel firmer and less lines.  Not a miracle, but an improvement.  A little goes a long way.  Have already ordered again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Ummmmmm- 3 days in and I am already getting compliments on my skin.  Stunned.  For real stunned.  The texture of my skin is changing and the pores appear to be minimizing.  Almost seems like a hallucination because it is happening so fast.  Fingers crossed for continued change.  This is the only thing that has ever impressed me this much and this fast.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it was shipped fast .</li>
            <li> Little strong for me, but I&#x27;ve began using it in my daily moisturizer and have had no more issues. haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements, however. Thanks for the product! No strong smell or stickiness like other products of this nature</li>
            <li> This is the only non drying vitamin C serum I have found.  You skin just feels silky, not dry and tight like most. Excellent customer service as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this serum thru amazon.  Didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this product but, wanted to give it a try.  This product works great!!  It feels great going on and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling one but greasy or heavy like other moisturizers can.  My husband also tried it and loves it as well.  Great face product.  This company also packaged and shipped the product quickly.  I would def order this product again!!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  It definately brightens my skin and discolorations look much better.  It isn&#x27;t irritating to my sensitive skin either.  Definately give it a try.  Vitamin C is the best ingredient for youthful, clear, even-skin tone.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product! I use it every day and I have noticed a big improvement to my skin. Wrinkles don&#x27;t seem as noticeable which makes me very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  My skin just drinks it in and it feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have try this serum , for about two weeks and all I can say it&#x27;s amazing...... I apply it every night before going to bed and the next morning I will have a soft skin and we&#x27;ll hydrated.... It&#x27;s not oily or sticky  ... Your face will not look shiny or greasy at all</li>
            <li> Quality quality! I was so excited to receive this package and it does not disappoint. Great size for your money and the product is wonderful. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great source for vitamin c. Easy to use</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Have been using it twice a day for the last week and my face is not as dry. This is not an overnight fix but gradually you will see a difference. The only thing I did not like was the packaging and look of the bottle. Looks too much like a bottle of essential oil, wish it looked fancier but in no way does it effect the product. I will continue to use this and for the price definitely worth it. My one other complaint is that this product contains Butylene Glycol which I am not a fan of.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! High quality product with quick shipping. I will never order from anyone else again! You have a custoimer for life</li>
            <li> I used this serum after cleansing my face and I like it so far especially in the morning, it make my face look more awake even though I did not put on any make up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a little light serum for my facial routine but it absorbs so quickly!! I love it,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to facial oil with my dry skin everyday,so i try to mix this serum with 1~2 pumps rose hip oil..!! They are so match,it also help the facial oil to absorb so quickly...!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, need more time to see how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> Great seller --- Love , Love I have used them so many times --- Thank you so much Happy Holidays</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin so I am not sure how that works. It simply seems to stay on top of my skin. I apply another moisturizer on top of this and after that this seems to disappear into my skin. Will not buy again but a good deal at the promotional $4 something price.</li>
            <li> After reading about the benefits of using Vitamin C along with my nightly retinol, I was excited to give this a try.  According to my dermatologist, the combination of these two ingredients stimulates collagen production dramatically.  I really like the light feel of this serum, and the ingredient list is great.  It&#x27;s a good balance between brightening ingredients as well as moisturizing ingredients.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, but my dull skin has already picked up a newfound glow! excited to see further results!</li>
            <li> So glad that I got the opportunity to test out this product. I love it so much! Highly recommended ! :)</li>
            <li> I havent tryed it but while be back with this products review in a month.</li>
            <li> LOVE USING THIS AT NIGHT, YOU WILL START TO SEE SOFTER SKIN AND A GLOW</li>
            <li> I love this Stuff. Since I started using it, On my face and hands I can see a big difference on my hands definitely they look so much better and more youthful. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles thank the good lord but it never hurts to take care of your skin. My hands on the other hand we starting t show there age. I have dry skin and have always used my hands for work(Plant Jobs). Which were very hard on my hands. The Salvere 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum and Hyaluronic Acid works great and make your skin look wonderful and feel great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now.  I have seen improvements in my skin where it has been applied.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a could weeks now, and officially cannot live without it. I noticed a difference in my face on the first use, and continually so ever since. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue which i appreciate because I have such sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has a very even tone to it now, and my pores have diminished. So far in the short term of things I absolutely love it, and genuinely hope that it will continue to be useful!</li>
            <li> Really worked on fine lines.</li>
            <li> Love these vitamins so far</li>
            <li> keeps my face smooth and soft.  use it everyday</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I am 42 and had, until trying Salvere 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, been an every 3 months regular at my dermatologist&#x27;s office for Botox..I have not needed a touch up since using this serum.  I have re ordered and recommend it to all my friends who want to see that plump, healthy and youthful glow back in their skin...It has also softened my little crow&#x27;s feet and lightened my dark spots..I will probably still get a little botox every 6 months now--just for that extra kick,..lol..but this serum is a wonderful anti-ager and is lovely under make-up.  I wish I found it sooner!</li>
            <li> Have been very happy with this serum.  Tried another brand and switched back to this one.</li>
            <li> love this product has many uses</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Not drying at all.  Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> This serum is great seeing better skin</li>
            <li> This is my first time using ferulic acid and my skin is looking much improved since using this serum over the past 10 days. Not sure if my facial skin is looking better due to learning how to properly use my Clarisonic, the ferulic acid, or a combination of the two. In case, the serum absorbs nicely into my skin. I apply it to my abs, decolletage, neck, and face every morning and then seal it in with a nice application of moisturizer on top of it all. No stickiness. Just make sure you top off your ferulic acid with a broad spectrum sunscreen. I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love the Serum - seems to work great</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My Beautician recommend Vitamin C at night.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for 6+ months, awesome results</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I spent a good deal of time researching ingredients and cost and found this product very reasonably priced with a good % of vit C.  It feels very good on my skin (age 58) and I have noticed improvement in lines around my eyes and mouth.  I use this morning and night on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have nice skin. Hopefully I inherit my mother&#x27;s or aunt&#x27;s skin because then I will have hit the genetic jackpot on skin. Just in case though, I do like to take care of myself and I&#x27;ve been using vitamin c serums as a form of prevention.  I like the texture of this product.  I like the ingredients and the percentage of Vit C.  (To those who don&#x27;t know, vitamin E and ferulic Acid work to stabilize vitamin c.  Together, these three ingredients form an antioxidant shield that helps with damage caused from UVA and UVB rays.)  Read up more about what vitamin C can do for you skin because a review won&#x27;t cover anything besides a stranger saying &amp;#34;it&#x27;s good, trust me&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big issue with this product is that fragrance is included.  I know that I&#x27;ve tried other vit c serums that smelled like hotdogs upon initial application.  Not so pleasant for the 10 seconds but afterwards, the scent quickly dissipated.  However, fragrance is a known irritant ingredient. People with sensitive skin should be a little more cautious with this purchase.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin..  However, having said that, how many of us don&#x27;t add perfume or cologne afterwards?  The  inclusion of fragrance doesn&#x27;t make sense (like so many other fragrance scented beauty products).  After all - I don&#x27;t want to attack a swarm of killer bees just because my lotion or vit c serum had a fragrance that said &amp;#34;Come and get me&amp;#34; to the bees.</li>
            <li> tried using to lighten some brown spot on my face and product seems to work, will surely buy more..</li>
            <li> wonderful product! fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but I&#x27;m loving it! It goes on so smooth. A little bit goes a long way. Also, they have outstanding customer service. It&#x27;s always nice to know that they appreciate your business. I will be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Great product. Skin feel smoth &amp; silky</li>
            <li> My skin became dry during these days. I feel improved after use Salvere 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum with Hyaluronic Acid. It looks like facial toner. If there is promotion deal in the future, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Thank you~&lt;br /&gt;best serum~</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week and I see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, After a few days my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> What impressed me most was the personal \\&quot;after Sales\\&quot; follow-up service, received from this particular seller. Immediately after my order was placed I received an email from one of the staff giving me tips on how to correctly use the Serum.When I expressed concerns about the product being manufactured in China, their Managing Director, Steve Hamlet  sent me a personal Email addressing my concerns. This gave me the confidence to buy two units of this product. Having now finished using up 1 bottle, I am in a position to give a factual review on it. Reading all the other posted reviews, I have come to the conclusion that the results one gets, is predicated on the skin type one possesses. Very dry mature skins or prominently lined ones benefit most and can see obvious improvements within a relatively short period of usage. As I have good Asian skin the results are far less pronounced. However I do see an improvement in overall skin tone and skin texture. I am still waiting for the one little patch of stubborn brown pigmentation on my face to clear up. I like the feel of the Serum when applied to the face and I do appreciate that it is odourless. Overall, I like the product and  think it has a good future. I have started on my second bottle and shall continue to monitor my own progress, for which I shall  give another follow-up review at a later time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW ...POSTED 16 JANUARY 2014&lt;br /&gt;As promised, this is my follow-up review on the Vitamin C Serum from Salvere to the one I wrote on 22 November 2013. It&#x27;s best to read my first review before this one, to fully understand the results I experienced. I do not belong to the category of users who had almost instantaneous results. Mine was a slow steady process. Only after finishing 2/3 of the second bottle ( a period of 2 months ) did I notice these results:&lt;br /&gt;1) I woke up one morning to feel a light crust of dried skin over the patch of brown pigmentation on my cheek (the one that has bothered me for ages).I gently got rid of the flaky skin . This crust re-appeared 3 times more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) After the third time,I noticed that the  brown patch had kind of broken up (fragmented) . The colour was no longer dense. As of today,to my extreme delight,it is almost invisible now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) My skin has taken on a luminance like the lustre of a pearl and overall skin tone has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) And last but not least, I have developed since towards end of December,lovely rosy cheeks.No need for rouge any more. I can&#x27;t explain this phenomenon but as I have them for now,I shall enjoy them .&lt;br /&gt;I now, with confidence can say that this is a great product.Only give it time to do it&#x27;s magic on your skin.ages).I gently got rid of the flaky skin .

            <li> I really love this serum because it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference on my face, and the amount used is so little..</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive brand. Checked with my dermatologist to verify.</li>
            <li> Can use this on sensitive skin without worrying about irritation. I have to use sparingly because it seems a little heavy (as serums should be at first) but it dissolves completely into my skin. Good product!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and I have noticed a big difference in the texture of my skin ,this is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile and it leaves your face very soft and I have seen some of my fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I&#x27;ve been using for a little more than a month now and have seen dramatic results. I get compliments all the time on how youthful my skin looks. I highly recommend this product. I am almost 42 years old but people mistake me for much younger. No complaints from me. :)</li>
            <li> Best serum!!! Have tried at least 3 other serums with same ingredients but by far this is The BEST!!!! Can&#x27;t live without it!!! Noticeable results after 1st application!!! Took off at least 10 years of my skin!!!</li>
            <li> very nice will buy it again</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome serum!! Have purchased many others but this one is by far the best!!! Love love love thus serum!! You will see results almost immediately! I saw results second day!!! I cannot and will not live without it!! My skin has improved so much!! Has taken at least 10 years or more off my skin wrinkle wise, but tone &amp; texture wise I don&#x27;t think my skin was ever this nice!! Seriously this product is awesome!!</li>
            <li> Like the product. Definitely want to try it again after finishing the product</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about two weeks now and I can see the natural brightening affect it has had on my skin.  I may have to change my foundation or not use one at all, which is okay with me. I am 60, with medium dark skin and some fines lines so I&#x27;m watching for changes with those by using this product, but it&#x27;s only been two weeks.  I love how it goes easily into my skin and doesn&#x27;t interfer with my other skin care routines/products.  Right now I only use it in the morning because I use oils at night.  I plan to purchase another one and I will start using it on my hands because the sun has darken my hands by more than 5 shades the color of my face. Great product and great price!!</li>
            <li> I usually use this serum right after cleansing and I allow 2-3 minutes for it to absorb before applying moisturizer (Naked Bee Vitamin C Enriched SPF 30). This combo seems to give my skin a nice rosy glow, to the point that I don&#x27;t feel the need to use much foundation or concealer (if any), which is really nice.</li>
            <li> After doing my due diligence and researching the ingredients of this product, I was ready to try out this advanced formula. I&#x27;ve used Salvere&#x27;s Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 2x a day (morning &amp; night) to reach maximized results. I realize that as we age, some of us get more wrinkling than others. I&#x27;ve seen this around my eyes the most with more noticeable crow&#x27;s feet. Sufficed to say, after using this product for over a week now, I have seen them practically vanish. I don&#x27;t say that lightly either. When I smiled before, I would notice more skin creasing around the corners and bottom of my eyes. I&#x27;m very pleased to say that with this serum; I feel more confident when I smile. Point in case, just the other day, a lady at the grocery store asked how old I was...she was at least 15 years off...bless her heart. I felt extremely happy knowing that there are ways to grow older gracefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too, like another buyer mentioned utilized a special Tx roller to get extra benefit when using this serum. I had foot surgery which has left a long scar down the front of my foot. Moreover, I wanted to test this product in more than one area. So, besides my face, I utilized it on my foot as well. So far, so good! It has made the scar tissue much softer than it was before. I hope that it will promote more antioxidants to become boosted in this area as well.

            <li> I just started using this Vit C Serum, I use it under makeup, it does seem to allow my foundation to glide on smoothly and reduced the fine lines.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> 3 days in use, which makes it so very elastic face. Once you have thought to buy.</li>
            <li> even skin tone. U will see the result the next day after use</li>
            <li> Feel great with this product, will refer to friends and shop again!</li>
            <li> I use Vitamin C serum for years and it is very good for my skin.  This is the first time that I try Salvere and I can say I love it.  It is really fast absorbed by my skin.  Good product in a great price.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wish there were 6 or more stars to give to this product.. This product worked miracles to my moms hands after no other product had any minimal effect on them.. the story began when she was young n she had a type of severe eczema n seasonal allergy , with the use of different cleaning products , so her hands skin was severely affected n she used to have scratch marks as well.. Her hands skin was too old compared to her actual age ( she is 45 ) .. After i was sent Salvere , i gave it to her to give it a try, knowing that she has a pantry full of different skin care products, n she uses creams , lotions daily.. After one month , her hands are almost recovered, plumped , shining , silky in touch , n no more cracks n the skin is new.. she is so happy with this serum , She asked me to buy her another bottle although it is still half full , i recommend it for any person with skin aging problems ..it really gives the skin much younger appearance !</li>
            <li> Love love love my vitamin c serum!! Works wonder on my skin!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week &amp; I love it!  My face is brighter &amp; pores are diminished!  You only need a few drops &amp; rub it all into your skin!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is simply pure magic!  I&#x27;ve been using it only for a few weeks and I already get complimented on the look of my skin  :)  I stopped using day creams - no reason for that any more. I use only a few drops of Salvere serum morning and most of nights, (I also use twice per week .5 Retinol cream for night).  My skin is delicate, harsh winters are especially hard on my face, and this winter was cruel where I live but Salvere serum not only made it feel like silk again, but it also diminished the appearance of wrinkles.  Both thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a very pricey serum and decided to try this brand, for which I had no prior knowledge.  The package arrived on schedule.  I was thrilled to see a date on the product box showing 9/2016 so I felt reassured as to freshness.  The tinted container looked exactly as pictured.  When I opened it, there was no discernible odor, either bad or good, which is something I value in a product.  The consistency during application was very light and the color was clear, both as expected.  Absorption was fine and, better yet, left no tackiness or stickiness on my skin.  I am pleased with what I received and, after having a chance to judge effectiveness, will update my rating, possibly to a 5.  What is unquestionably already a 5 however is customer service.  The seller contacted me via email, expressing appreciation for my purchase and soliciting feedback once I have a chance to use it.  As this was an unknown brand to me, my comfort level went up even before I received the shipment because I knew exactly who to contact if I had questions..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed tiny wrinkles near my eyes have reduced and my skin overall just feels alot better.  I supplement this with vitamin B plus biotin everyday, along with renew Avalon Organics vitamin C non-soap cleansing milk everyday and I must say I love the results! This is staying as a part of my everyday beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I like the gentleness of the serums absorption on my skin. My face feels and look more toned and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now with a hyluronic acid product and the two together have made my skin softer, decreased the size of my poors and help reduce blackheads. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been close to 2 months and I&#x27;m not seeing any results. In fact after the first month my skin looked worse. However, most things don&#x27;t work on me the way it does with the majority. I haven&#x27;t given up and will continue to wear it along with my regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Pros include very lightweight, not greasy or sticky, and incredible customer service. It was totally worth the price to try it. A little bit does go a very long way, so if I find my results have changed in a month or two, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Wifey here. Just want say this Vitamin C Serum is the real deal. It really brightened my 40+ year-old skin and made it radiant. I often have a reaction to Vitamin C serums, but this did not bother my sensitive skin. The liquid is clear, has no scent, and is protected from oxidation by the dark glass bottle. I only use this in the morning before my moisturizer and sunscreen. It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t pill your makeup. If you&#x27;re using a retinol cream be sure to use your retinoid at night and the Vitamin C in the morning because, if combined, they cancel each other out. Also, keep your Vitamin C in the fridge to keep it fresh. If it starts to turn yellow it&#x27;s time to buy a new bottle. I was able to use my entire bottle without it changing color. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Gets rid of the sun spots &amp; lines. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle. Buy 2 at a time you will see why!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the serum but I just wanted to warn users not to use it near the eye area.  After repeated use, I had built up a crust under my eye that made me look quite a bit older.  I was able to use a 15% Vitamin C serum (no E Ferulic Acid added) under the eye prior to this and never had a problem.  It took a couple of weeks to get rid of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now and see excellent improvement: dark spots slightly lightened and NO sticky residue ~</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is every bit as good as what I paying for vitamin C Serum at the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> I got this almost at the same time with the other brand-Yeouth. Both are gel like texture but this one is easier to apply on face while the other brand is less &#x27;liquid-ish. I did not compare the ingredient though. I could not commend on the outcome since I forgot to take the before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a wonderful experience with this product. It didn&#x27;t make me irritate when i use it and I can see the good result after using this serum. Totally a good product and worth to buy!!!</li>
            <li> The best: feel great and is making my dry skin much more moist!</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I read so many Amazon reviews before purchasing this product and still had my doubts.  But after just a week of use, my skin is so  much tighter and my pores smaller.  I&#x27;ve had the product for few weeks now,  I have oily skin and discovered that a few drops 2x a week is enough or least my skin in certain places became really dry.  I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on my problem skin and this product has produced the best results. I also incorporated  Per other feedback, I just purchased Mogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2 fl. oz (60 mL)  and Rose Water to counterbalance the pure Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also incorporated Hyaluronic Acid Serum with my sunscreen.  Remember to wear sunscreen, vit c leaves your skin exposed to the sun.</li>
            <li> WOW!! I never thought a product would do what this one has done for me! I had heavy wrinkles and frown lines as well as very dry skin and this has made a huge difference!! I am on my 2nd bottle and will continue to buy this. My skin is smoother, more supple and lines have diminished greatly!! I received this product in record time after ordering and great customer service! I am 100% sold on this product!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> this really works on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the results of SALVERE AT ALL!! Can I get refunded?</li>
            <li> ok, rarely do I rave about a product but in one week: the &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; look I&#x27;ve battled for years on either side of my nose is gone, not better, GONE!!! My rosacea is maybe 80% improved...seriously, it&#x27;s amazing!!!  My skin has turned around in one week...58 yr old, sun damaged skin looks amazingly beautiful!!!!  I&#x27;m ordering this in bulk so I never run out of it!!!</li>
            <li> Made my age spot lighter!</li>
            <li> Great product! My face feels softer and looks great.</li>
            <li> I used Retin A for 11 days and ended up to have peeling, redness, dark skin, brown spots and more wrinkles. After one application of this product at first night almost all of my problems were gone in the next morning except those extra wrinkles Retin A created. However my sagging skin got much better in just few days. Amazing! First I thought few drops won&#x27;t be enough but I woke up still moisturized in the morning. Just I wish it is not made in China and does not contains fragrance which sometimes makes me itchy a little bit. But overall this is a great product and I hope I&#x27;ll see a reduction in my all of wrinkles soon.</li>
            <li> Tried it for many days, love it! It leave the skin moisturize without sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> i like this product. doesn&#x27;t sting and doesn&#x27;t get irritate my skin. my skin tone gets smoother and little brighter.</li>
            <li> Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is suitable for every women.</li>
            <li> Great product! Made my skin smoother!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week and I already love it! My skin looks healthier and feels firmer. The product doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received a coupon to try these I am glad I did my face was full of acne style blemish cause by chemo this Salvere help thank you so much and relived the itching on my back</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this serum</li>
            <li> I love this product. I like that it does not leave me greasy. I was very fortunate to have found this deal, just turning 60, and looking at lines, this was a blessing.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days now and it seems to brighten my skin and seems to be smoothing the laugh lines</li>
            <li> I had always heard that Vit C was excellent for your skin but was always reluctant to give it a try. I Am so glad that I did. This was easy to apply ,to use, smelled good and after rubbed into my skin it felt nice on my skin. This is not a product that works right away , but I have noticed my skin has started to feel better. I will continue to use it and see if my fire lines and wrinkles go away. I am hoping.</li>
            <li> The vitamin c serum was so smooth and made my skin look fresher.  It seems to get better with continued use.</li>
            <li> I have pretty great skin already, but I did notice an improvement in the texture and softness of my skin. My skin drinks this serum up and I&#x27;m not left with an oily face.</li>
            <li> This serum is fabulous! Recommend</li>
            <li> This serum works really well. After just a few weeks I noticed that the lines around my eyes and mouth diminished drastically. It leaves your skin feeling soft and looking great. If you are looking for something that really works to make your wrinkles deminish and your skin look great then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> my love) really helps )</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything except make my skin a little smoother. I could do without this product in the future, and just use a basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It&#x27;s gentle and it makes my skin glow. I&#x27;ve noticed it smooths my skin as well. I&#x27;ve ordered it three times now.</li>
            <li> did brighten my face a lot which I loved and felt great, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before. It arrived as advertised and I have used it for three weeks. It is a satisfactory product for the price. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have used the product AM/PM for 2 weeks and have not noticed any improvement in my skin.... I will continue to use the product until it&#x27;s gone and decide if I will be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> as for now, me likie ... i haven&#x27;t been using daily, tho.  it&#x27;s very light going on &amp; absorbes quickly - i use it on bare skin, then sunscreen/primer, then makeup ... haven&#x27;t felt my face sliding off yet, so it&#x27;s good by me there.  haven&#x27;t seen results, but way too early &amp; i&#x27;ve been too inconsistent (crazy summer!)  i do put one drop on the back of each hand when i use itand LOVE the way that feels .... the hubby says they&#x27;re softer too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was seriously the FASTEST SHIPPING EVER!!  i blinked &amp; it was here!!  Jimmy John&#x27;s ain&#x27;t got nuthin on this company!!</li>
            <li> This serum has helped reduce fine lines and has healed a few old, small scars from acne. You have to use it regularly and for a couple weeks to see changes.</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results yet. But I plan on updating my review after a couple of months. The product came in a sealed box with the directions and ingredients listed on the box. Right away I was disappointed to see that the serum is manufactured in CHINA and the company Salvere is based in Oregon. Had I known it was manufactured in China, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. I&#x27;m not sure I 100% trust the quality of ingredients from there. With that being said...the serum was clear, odorless, and not to thin but not too thick in texture. It did not feel sticky, greasy, or heavy on my skin. It also did not sting when I used it after my derma roller. I am a loyal Skinceuticals (made in the USA) user. However, I was looking for a more affordable version of the $150 product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service.  This company contacted me to see how I like the product and to explain the percentages and quality of the ingredients.  I have been using this serum for over two months now and I am in my early 30s.  It makes my skin very soft and smooth and allows for a very nice foundation application.  My mother who is in her late 50s absolutely loves the serum.  She says it makes her skin smooth, soft, and reduces the appearance of her wrinkles significantly.  She has always been a sun worshiper and has quite some sun damage.  My mother just had me order 4 more bottles for her!  Now that&#x27;s one happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice quality Vitamin C serum; more viscous than other brands I&#x27;ve tried like Obagi + Skinsceuticals yet equally fast-absorbing. It doesn&#x27;t sting or aggravate my hyper-sensitive skin (even after dermarolling) and seems to be doing a good job at keeping the lines and wrinkles at a comfortable distance.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this serum.  I went a couple of months without it and won&#x27;t ever do that again. It really makes a difference!  My face feels really smooth and makeup goes on much better, no more creasing lines or caked on look especially under my eyes. Absolutely love it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I see a difference like the texture, absorb fast, no smell and you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to cause any results, good or bad. Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Maybe some betterment right as it is applied. But then within 10 mins. nothing looks different.</li>
            <li> i used it a couple of time and i do like the item. it does not have a storng smell and does not leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Great profuct. Will recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am no fan of writing rewiews, but this product is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend purchased this product for me and convinced me to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and it is rare that I can use a product that does not break my skin out in ugly red rash patches. I have tried just about every product from the sublime to the ridiculous, in every price range, but never have I had the results as I have had with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not it greasy nor is it smelly and overbearing. It is a serum that the skin just drinks in and allows to work. My oily combination sensitive skin has not broken out nor has it reacted in any negative way to this product. It has given me a more vibrant, glowing and well moisturized look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this serum is prepared fresh and that customer service is exceptional, and wastes no time to ensure that one is satisfied, gives confididence to say the least in orodering this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy&lt;br /&gt;Shar</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little early but it appears to be drying out my skin, it could be partly due to the winter season as well, I need to give it more time. The seller however waited about a week or more to complete the purchase on my debit/credit and it arrived on the very last estimated ship date which is okay but I shop a lot and other merchants are ususally much more prompt.</li>
            <li> I had ordered another brand and could not get it so ordered this. One and am really glad I did.  My face is smoother and glowing, well hydrated and the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my brows is much better.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more and it is not so pricey that it is out of reach for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes my face smoother and I feel it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it comes in a dropper.</li>
            <li> This serum really seems to have improved the texture and fine lines in my face. Having been somewhat of a sun worshiper in my youth, I have some sun damage to my skin. This product has really made a difference! I recommend this product if you can tolerate slight tingling when first applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly researching skin products to slow my aging. I am over forty and not satisfied with my appearance. I picked this up to add to my morning face and neck regimen. I must say this improves the absorption of cream applications. I am amazed at how youthful my skin looks. I use this in conjunction with other acne and anti-aging creams. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how rested I look. Vitamin C is now one of my staple skin products.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week, I love it and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> great stuff makes my face smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I have only been using a few days but so far I love it!  Hoping to see even more results within a few weeks.  As of now, it is helping to tighten and brighten my skin overall.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and makes my skin feel nice. I haven&#x27;t seen any effects yet, but I&#x27;m optimistic that I will!</li>
            <li> In LOVE with this product! I highly reccomend it!!!</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin and seems to has made improvements. I have very sensitive skin and it has no adverse affects to my skin in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I got this serum from a promotional deal from Amazon. I am very impressed with this product. After trying so many anti-aging products with little or no results, I was surprised to see results after a few days of use. My skin feels better and it looks better. I have a condition that causes severe dry skin, so I am grateful to have this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product...I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks and I like how my skin feels after using it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin otherwise but I hope to with continuing use of this product....</li>
            <li> With just one use I noticed improvement. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with your product, also price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love your Vit C Serum by Salvere. It is so smooth and I definitely have noticed a difference in my skin. I have notice my fine line and wrinkles are slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> My skin seems smoother after 1 week use. This is fast absorbing product. Need to apply night cream or sunscreen after thought.</li>
            <li> Very pleased  makes my skin  so soft</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about cosmetic products but in this case I am inclined to believe that this serum did clear my skin, making it appear more translucent and even.  It is very light and does not absorb quickly (takes about 25 mins to absorb).&lt;br /&gt;I was about to buy a 2nd bottle but it is no longer available. I hope it becomes available again.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and the first thing am glad for is that it doesn&#x27;t break me out. Am so skeptical about trying new things cos my face is so sensitive but this product works for me. It is light and non greasy which is also a plus for my oily face. The claims for this product is one that the benefits will only be seen over a long period of time but so far I like it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have tried some other brands of Vitamin C and they seemed to burn my skin.  This goes on like silk and immediately makes your skin feel smooth.  Make up application is much easier.  My skin is more smooth and brighter.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do long term.</li>
            <li> Great mixed into my other skin care routine.</li>
            <li> There was a smoothing of the skins appearance but nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;It dried my skin and I do not like that feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;Every body&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so I am not putting any failure on this&lt;br /&gt;it is just not for me.</li>
            <li> serum is thick but not overly so.  doesnt leave a sticky feeling makes skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> Love!!! What a difference this serum is making on my skin.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin silky smooth.  I can already tell a difference in the texture of my skin after only a couple weeks.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone wanting to improve the look and feel of their skin.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> you can see the glow from inside of your skin.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product, it has no scent which I appreciate and absorbs into the skin quickly.  Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Added to my day routine - very effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after i was told it will help with my scars from cancer surgery.I have been using it with another product called derma roller and I have seen great results. The Salvere  Vitamin C Serum has left my skin soft and my scars become smaller..the scar is not as raised as before.. I will continue to use this product and can not wait to see what my results will be in a few months. Usage #2. I am also using this product on my face for fine lines and sun damage. Being fair skin my face has sun damaged spots and i have noticed these spots fading since i used this product. I really do love this product and i do love the results i have seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a similar serum for a long time. This combination of anti aging ingredients is very potent and I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff!!! Made my skin feel and look better and I felt like I was applying a good serum, filled with vitamin C! I liked that it was thick and easy to apply and a little went a long way!! I used it on both myself and my husband and we both could tell a difference right away and wee both pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> After so many months of searching for a good Vitamin C serum, I came across Salvere and I am so happy that I gave it a try because this stuff is amazing! Upon receiving it in a mail, I knew that I wanted to try it with out using any other face products so I can really test if it does what it really claims to do (minus the wrinkle/fine lines part since I don&#x27;t have them yet). So every night, I wash my face with warm water, dove soap and fingertip towel, then apply a drop or 2 of Salvere Vitamin C serum. A little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t really need a lot of drops to cover your whole face. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling or wearing-a-mask feeling like the other reviewers said. It actually goes on really smooth, almost silky. And when I wake up in the morning, my face feels really soft, rejuvenated and really smooth unlike before its either dry or oily. Regarding the sun spots, I cannot really tell yet since it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. I will have to update once I see a noticeable improvement. Also sometimes, I get small bumps and some pimples but since I started using this, I haven&#x27;t had any. That makes me very happy. So overall, I give this serum a 5 star since I really like it and I am going to keep using it every night because I like waking up to very a nice smooth-baby-like skin. Thanks Salvere!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recommend. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for the price!  Just started using and noticed my complexion is smoother!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used skin ceuticals for years.&lt;br /&gt;I like this better. I find it spreads easier, sits better under makeup, smells better,  and gives the same results! Cheaper too...so I can use more and spread all over chest and hands , etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer after a few orders now !</li>
            <li> This was my third order of Salvere 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Serum. Each time, the product has arrived well packaged and on schedule. Salvere 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Serum is a great product! I initially ordered Salvere 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Serum to improve my grayish-looking skin following chemo. I appreciate the natural ingredients that help to remove the dead skin cells gently and brighten my skin effectively. I do use Salvere with a natural cleanser and a natural moisturizer. My evening regiment also includes a mild retinol product. Subsequently, my skin&#x27;s appearance is improving in color, tone, and texture. I really like the dropper! I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not drying at all. not too oil</li>
            <li> I have been sitting on pins and needles waiting to get this in! I can&#x27;t tell you how it works long term, but let me tell you why I already love it. 1) It doesn&#x27;t stink like some other Vit C serums, and I HATE that stinky smell on my face. 2) It isn&#x27;t sticky... I hate feeling like I have a glob or glop of stuff on my face. 3) It dried SUPER fast! So I can rub it on my face and then lay right down (cause I am lazy and sometimes forget to take my makeup off in the bathroom, so I have some wipes and my Vit C on my end table) without it getting my pillow all nasty. So, I am in love with this one and am excited to see what results I have in about a month!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this serum, and wanted to try it after finishing another one I was using.  I could feel the vitamin E in this serum, which is different from others, I have used.  I can&#x27;t really say how effective it is yet, as I have only used it one time.  I probably won&#x27;t have to use Vitamin E during the day, as I have, with the others.  I will update this review, after using it, for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Nice natural product.</li>
            <li> The texture is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before in a vitamin c + e ferulic serum. It&#x27;s almost gel like and not watery like all the others.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell.  My skin feels plump and moist as opposed to tight like other brands.  I&#x27;m just hoping my long terms results are the same as the well known brands.  For now, I love the short terms results!</li>
            <li> very good product ! I really love it. I can see the result after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I had a coupon code to get this serum for $4.99 &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I put this on first after cleansing &amp; let it soak in for a few minutes, then I add my essential oil blend! My skin seems much firmer &amp; the wrinkles around my mouth are softer!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say Thank You Salvere Company for doing the free giveaway though you facebook. With that said, all my opinions are my own and they did not ask me to leave any feedbacks or pay me. But after using it for a while I really want to put my thoughts and feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this products I notice my pigmentation are lighten and any fine lines and wrinkles are faded. This Serum is not smelly nor is it greasy. I really like the fact that I can use it under my makeup and after the end of the day. I really recommend this product and think everyone should try this. (I believe this is a brand new product for this brand and I would love to try more)</li>
            <li> I have to give this a bit more time.  It&#x27;s a little bit gritty, but I can get over it.</li>
            <li> Love this on my skin!  Makes it so nice and smooth!!</li>
            <li> Very light texture, easy to apply. Would have loved to have a little bit more chemistry details on the product. Even though the product states it contains perfume (as the last ingredient) I couldnt rly catch any smell from it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.  Tamper proof packaging (in a box wrapped in light plastic) professional. I like that Salvere is a light weight serum, easy to apply with dropper provided.  One small drop covers quite a bit of area of when applying. After applying to my face and hands, a shine to the skin appeared immediately.  Did not sting or burn, felt fantastic on the skin. A very soothing feel with no fragrance to it. I think it will help my skin tremendously. I was fortunate to be able to try this product provided to me in a complimentary promotion.  Therefore, I have done my best to provide an unbiased review.  Update: Fabulous results and would continue to have this product as part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Wow My face looks great, the tone is clearer. It also feels softer. I use it after my clairsonic cleaning. I have used other Vitamin C serums, this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> great vitamin c product.</li>
            <li> Package was arrived quickly and in good condition.when I used some times....this didn&#x27;t really do anything ....except make my skin a little smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to observe the condition of my skin moisturizer</li>
            <li> I had a small bump on my forehead one day that I assumed was an emerging pimple. However, after putting acne relief cream on it for a couple of days, the bump only became larger and darker. I decided to try this vitamin c product on it and it helped decrease it considerably! I&#x27;ve been putting it on the bump for about 4 days and the bump is almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;The product has an oily serum texture that absorbs into the skin very quickly. It leaves somewhat of a sticky residue, especially if used all over the face, so I would recommend this product more for spot treatments or for use overnight. When I used it on my whole face, it helped moisturize my dry skin significantly. Overall, I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product !! Definately notice a positive difference in my face , pore size has gone down and dry patches are gone, age spots lightened. Will not go without this !!!</li>
            <li> After having surgery I can no longer take pills. Everything has to be a chewable, gummy, or liquid. I ran across this product and I use it everyday absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Salvere 20% Vitamin C &#x3D; E Ferulic Acid Serum With Hyaluronic Acid. I was pleasantly surprised with the way my skin is looking and feeling. I have only been using it for about a week and a half and am already seeing a change,I am excited about the changes to come with continued use. i will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is light and won&#x27;t leave your skin oily.  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I have only used it for a few days now but so far so good, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff ! My complexion is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my stepmom and she seemed to like it. Not  sure if she&#x27;s seen any changes, but Vitamin C seems to be a good thing overall.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months now and I love the texture of the serum. However I do wish it didn&#x27;t contain any fragrances as I see no need for them. I feel my skin has been come very soft and moisturized. The skin tone is very even and the small little dark spots I had are now hardly even visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week and my face is already noticeably smoother. I hope to continue to see improvements in clarity and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week.  I love the way it goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this product! After just a few days of use I have noticed a great improvement in my skin. I have used many professional products and I would rank this with some of the best!</li>
            <li> At first I really enjoyed using this product. The product didn&#x27;t feel greasy and set in great. It did start to dry my skin out so I have to use extra moisturizer now. I also haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in fine lines either.  I will update in a few weeks. Nothing works over night.</li>
            <li> In a few days the fine warts in my neck were gone. I got few rashes on my face so am just using it on my neck instead. Got marked improvement in wrinkles and skin texture. The bug bite blemishes on my shoulder were almost gone in 3 weeks. It is economical, too. I only need 3 drops for my neck (front &amp; back). Since it has whitening effect, I will be using it for practically my whole body. (Age spots and blemishes). As they said the peak effect of topical Vit C will be seen in 6 months.</li>
            <li> Will continue using it, applying it to my neck: seems like it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the hype is. Been using it for 3 months and don&#x27;t see a difference. It&#x27;s also the worst serum I&#x27;ve ever applied texturally, it&#x27;s sticky and leaves my face feeling like I just washed in sugar water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I don&#x27;t know... It&#x27;s just not a pleasant feeling to go about your day with.</li>
            <li> My face lady wanted me to take a break from Retinols, and I have tried a few expensive things that were ho-hum. So I bought this, and immediately my skin looked and felt better! It sinks right in so it doesn&#x27;t really feel moist, but in the morning your skin will glow and feel really smooth. Highly recommended! Try it for yourself. You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Loved make my skin feel youthful and looks beautiful</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The Salvere vitamin C serum made my skin look brighter and maybe even a bit more youthful. It had a pleasant scent and went on really smoothly. It was quickly absorbed into my skin.  I can&#x27;t say no wrinkles now, but they are less prominent then they were before I started. I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> I have used the product a few times so far and I love how it makes my face feel.  I can already see a reduction in the fine lines on my face.  I cannot wait to see the results once I have used it for a longer period of ime.  I think everyone that has smile lines or just wants an overall improvement in skin appearance should give this a try.</li>
            <li> AFter one week,  my face looks and feels brighter and smoother</li>
            <li> Salvere is a great company.I have used many of their awesome products. Loved this Vitamin C i skipped my flu shot this year and decided on a more holistic approach. Have been around a few sick folks and have not had a sniffle yet, This is a wonderful product i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The World Best Hot item.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this review short and simple. It&#x27;s gentle to use on my skin care routine and did not cause any reaction, which is a good thing on my book. This alreay brightens my bare skin on my face shedding off the dead layer and hopefully midway through the bottle it will lighten my acne scars. (Fingers cross)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!! After only a couple of weeks using it my skin looks and feels better. Others are noticing it also!</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it made my face feel so soft. Although I did not see any improvements on my wrinkles, I may have not used the product long enough. I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 weeks. I think my pores were less noticeable so if I use for a much longer time, I may see some changes in my wrinkles. Its a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it absorbs into my skin and does not make it feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product! This product makes my skin feel so young!</li>
            <li> This serum is perfect because it is unscented. It is transparent and the glass bottle is beautiful. It comes with a pump. I have oily and sensitive skin and this serum is so good because I can wear my makeup after applying the serum and my moisturizer. It is very light and it absorbs pretty quickly through the skin. I like to use the serum twice a day, morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> This is a great fast absorbing serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and I must say that my skin is feeling so much smoother and firmer. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. I definitely look forward to reap the great benefits of this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It doesnt feel greasy and has no harsh odor. I use it daily and love how it makes my skin feel. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now and believe I&#x27;ve seen some improvement already in my skin tone and texture. I&#x27;m middle aged and have always had oily skin with mild acne breakouts. Right now my skin can get a little less oily as winter will soon be here so I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my oily sensitive skin or cause a breakout and help with wrinkles and so far it&#x27;s seems to be doing a good job but  I cant say what summer would be like as my skin is not as oily now as it can be then. I think it would be perfect if this also had vitamin A in it but works very well even as it is.</li>
            <li> Have only used a handful of times so far, but like the feeling.  Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.  Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This product feels good on my skin.  I think I notice a new smoothness to my skin.  The dropper is easy to use.  There is no scent  to the product, which could be a plus for some people.</li>
            <li> Tried it and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and so far I like that it does not smell and I like the feeling of it when I apply it on my face.  It is not sticky.  It does not cause my face to break out. I can&#x27;t wait to see more results as I use it more.</li>
            <li> This is the best vitamin C serum I have used so far, the liquid is watery and clear, easy to absorb and leaving a very smooth skin after applying. But no orange smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin dewy and moist. Feels so soft and looks so healthy :)</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling smooth.  Some fine lines have already started to disappear and it&#x27;s only been 5 days.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product! My face feels so smooth</li>
            <li> My mother loved it! Will offer to others as well!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I have been using it twice daily for a week and a half . I like the formula&#x27;s feel and the way it absorbs and dries without a tacky, sticky or tight feeling. I may add to this review when I have used it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I have always had very oily skin, so I have never been too worried about wrinkles and such.  People always assume I am younger than I actually am, so imagine my surprise when I started noticing some fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  I did not like this at all and knew I needed something to start working on this problem before they became larger and more visible. This serum did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;To begin, the bottle is much larger than I thought it would be. This might last me forever.  You really only need a drop or two each time you use it. The serum feels really nice on my skin, and absorbs thoroughly.  Almost immediately you can see a firmness in your skin.  Those fine lines seem to blur.  After about 15 minutes my face feels fresh and soft. There is no sticky residue or weird shine left on your skin. And NO long, complicated regimen. Just apply to a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this serum for about 3 weeks now, but I have noticed a marked improvement in the color and texture of my facial skin. Many of the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared, and my lip line is noticeably smoother.  I don&#x27;t know all the stuff that&#x27;s in this serum, I just know I like the results.  And it doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin greasier like some creams and lotions tend to.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to attest to its long term effects but I can say in the week I&#x27;ve used it my skin does feel softer and more smooth. It&#x27;s my first time using a facial oil but I really love this stuff. My skin just drinks it up!</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using everyday.  A wonderful product and I love the price. I am going to order again  I was using another product that was very expensive and honestly like this product better and love my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It has a nice consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Salvere sent me this serum to review for my blog GlamRiver.  I have been using this serum for awhile and I have noticed a great improvement in my skin.  Especially my Melasma, I HATE my Melasma and I am always looking for a product to help make the spots lighter or go away entirely and I have found that Vitamin C Serum does help so Salvere Vitamin C Serum has become a Must Have in my skin care routine!  It has also helped make my fine lines less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that the serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin and even sits well under makeup if you want to use it in your morning skin care routine!</li>
            <li> Love it.. I have seen some reduction in my fine lines already!  goes on easy and cant wait to see the longer use outcome!  Would recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> A few drops of this goes a long way! This product will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I love the effect this had on my skin. The texture just felt smoother and looked lighter and brighter. I love it.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT! WOULD BUY IT AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Working great so far. No irritation.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling and just the way it goes onto the skin! It isn&#x27;t greasy, but moist! I love it and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products!! Debbie</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy on my skin.  Soaks right in and I think it really has made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product has helped with the sun damage patches on my face, I have also had comments that my face is glowing, it has brightened &amp; evened out my skin tone. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helped with fine lines but I will continue to use it. I started seeing results &amp; getting complements after about 3 weeks of use, I have been applying it morning &amp; night. I am 50 years old &amp; would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> I love it. I still wanna see more positive results :)</li>
            <li> loved it but lost it all in a monster  home fire dec 14 and when can will buy more  when I have money</li>
            <li> Looks high quality. Gave as gift to friend</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
            <li> This serum works extremely well.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks now.  My skin looks more even tone and healthier.  I have some fine lines and they do seem fuller.  I will continue using this knowing I&#x27;ll see results.  Will be repurchasing.  Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I have use the vitamin C for 2 months. Love it. My pores have diminished. My frown lines have got a lot lighter. I will order this product again</li>
            <li> I am just amazed at the way this serum has decreased the smile lines I call them on my face. I had deep lines around my mouth probably from smoking and I always drink thru a straw. My neck also had many wrinkles in it due to weight lose. Then my hands my grandson said they look old grandma why. So I&#x27;ve used this serum on my face, neck and hands and am truly amazed at the results. My smile lines are becoming finer and my neck wrinkles are going away and my hands don&#x27;t look quite as old my grandson said lol. I&#x27;m going to continue to use the rest of this bottle and see the results afterwards so looking forward to them. I really like the fact that they sent me an email to inform on how to get the most benefits out of the product and if I had any concerns don&#x27;t hesitate to ask. They have great customer service and that is a great plus in my book . I would highly recommend this serum to anyone women or men to help with multiple things. Thank you..</li>
            <li> Great product will continue to purchase.  Delivery fast</li>
            <li> Good product , leaves my skin soft . Will continue to used for better results .</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.  My face never looked so toned.  I love this Salvere!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice grade of serum. I was impressed.</li>
            <li> excellent product and high quality ingredients, goes on easily , absorbs quickly and my skin is clearer and more radiant</li>
            <li> Vitamin C for your face is the hot new item for face care.  I wanted to try some &amp; this Salvere is great!  It feels so cool going on the face &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water or my skin burn.  My laugh lines are pretty deep and I feel I am seeing some improvement!  It will take a while as the lines are 64 years old!  I also put it on a scar on my hand and it softens the tight, drawn look of it.  I am going now to check on other face care items from Salvere.  Thanks for a wonderful product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!  My pores are a bigger than what I would like and I have tried various products over the past couple of years.  This, by far, has been my favorite!  It feels like it tightens (but not too much!)  the skin and leaves it refreshed!  There is no weird smell to it, either.  I hate smells!  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got this product after reading that vitamin C can help to reduce the signs of brown spots.  I have on brown spot on my cheek and really, really want it to go away.  I have been using this product twice a day for about a week and I can see that it&#x27;s starting to fade.  I&#x27;ve just been using it on the one area, but I think I&#x27;ll add this to my daily routine and put it on my whole face.  Extremely happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a *gift* all opinions are my own. What I like is the fact that C+E Ferulic is a revolutionary anti-oxidant that delivers protection against ageing. Plus, C+E Ferulic is that it has anti-oxidant properties such as Vitamin E and Vitamin and as a 40+ lady signs of aging are becoming apparent and I like anything that has the potential of slowing down that process. The packaging is superb, completely wrapped and sealed to prevent leakage. My skin is not sensitive, nor oily and I do use the product as preventative rather than to cure something. After washing my face well I do apply a couple drops and rub into my skin before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this about a week or so now, however, I can definitely tell that the dark spots on my face from being in sun or just aging has lightened up a bit. Also the with the lines when I smile I can tell they are going away some already too. The wrinkles by my eyes (crow&#x27;s feet) I guess my mom called them have tightened as well. I&#x27;ve never tried a product like this but I will definitely stick with this one. I can&#x27;s wait to see how much better my skin will look after like a month. :-)</li>
            <li> Absorbs right into my skin with no greasy residue...My skin feels soft an  looks radiant!!!!</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, my complexion was the worst it had ever been in my life. It looked like I had sever sun burn with tons of peeling and huge red splotches. Hyaluronic Acid was the only thing to help. At that time I used a Hyaluronic cream that I mixed with my regular moisturizer or used alone. When I saw this product I was very excited to try it in serum form. When it arrived, I was impressed by the glass bottle although the label design seems more medical than premier beauty packaging. But the product inside is AH-MAY-ZING!!! It only takes two drops applied to each cheek to moisturize my whole face. And while it is designed to be used in conjunction with your daily moisturizer, I have found no need and I have dry and sensitive skin. This serum locks in the moisture you do have and leaves your skin so soft and silky. It looks great under my makeup and holds up all day. I will definitely be buying this again when I run out and that says a lot because I have tried and tested 5 hyaluronic acid serums and THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!</li>
            <li> Awesome product thank you!</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth, can&#x27;t wait to see the result.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses this and she said she really likes it.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This serum has so many good things in it! You can pay a fortune for vitamin c serums of similar strength and quality alone, much less with vitamin e and hyaluronic acid also included. Since I&#x27;ve started using vitamin c I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks brighter and the tone more even. I think it looks like I&#x27;m wearing powder when I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;ve never used anything else that made my skin look brighter. In fact, I thought the word &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; was false advertising until this product. I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant fading of old acne scars on my jaw line. I think any skin could benefit from vitamin c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is also a wonderful moisturizing preparation. It&#x27;s light and not heavy, tacky, or greasy. Goes on as a liquid and soaks right in. The ingredients list fragrance but I detect none and have had no problems with irritation. I use it on my face, around my eyes, and on my neck. I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems. I also layer products on my face and this layers well with other things that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s packaged in a bottle to protect the sensitive ingredients, with dark glass and a dropper. This is essential for any product with vitamin c. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Give it a try. I think you&#x27;ll be pleased and that your skin will react well to it.</li>
            <li> This is actually my second bottle, I liked it so much. Excellent on crows feet (sides of the eyes). It has significantly reduced the depth of the lines.  I can see a huge difference &amp; can feel it with my finger.  Permanent results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bad undereye puffiness. This does nothing for that. It doesn&#x27;t reduce the forehead lines.  I gave it 5 stars for crows feet. It&#x27;s worth it for that alone.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle in 24 hours! It works great. I apply it once in the morning and once at night. I keep my bottle in the fridge and in just one week I have noticed that my skin is more supple and less dry. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few vitamin c serums and so far nothing that exciting. One actually broke me out a bit. This serum isn&#x27;t like others. Others are orange in color and has a citrus smell. You DONT want that in a serum. This one is clear with no fragrance whatsoever. That means it&#x27;s pure. The bottle comes with a dropper. I used it only in the morning after a cleaned face, just two to three drops is all I need. I par it on my face and the rest is rubbed on the tops of my hands. It&#x27;s not sticky. I haven&#x27;t broken out and this serum actually help other breakouts disappear completely. My face is totally clear and beautiful. I love this serum snd will definetly buy more when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Very light not sticky. Soaks right into my skin and you only need a little. My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> Love the product!!!! Noticing changes already, in 2 weeks. However, did not receive the copy of free periodical as advertised. The serum is as nice as the very expensive product I have purchased in the past from my dermatologist. Liking this product better not because of the price so much but it absorbs so easily. I will be purchasing this item as long as they keep making it. Great buy. Building up my arsenal with high grade products and not unhappy so far.</li>
            <li> i like the salvere serum for my skin!! not at all greasy, so i can put my makeup on right away! no difference in any  lines did i see! sorry!</li>
            <li> This serum did seem to reduce the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I think I&#x27;m seeing some fading of the find lines around my eyes and mouth but not 100% sure yet. (fingers crossed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back and update you a bit later but I&#x27;m hopeful at this point!</li>
            <li> Worked a little in the beginning. Now it seems to have stopped. I will continue to use it until it runs out, but won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and it has made my skin feel smooth and the tone is nrighter. Will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service! Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my skin already! Great product! Great price. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is one of the serums that I had the opportunity to use for a few weeks before finding out that I was pregnant. It came in a small glass bottle with a pump top. It was slightly different in appearance as far as the color of the glass. Usually my Vitamin C Serums come in dark brown or dark blue glass to keep the light from filtering through too much. What I did was simply keep the bottle inside of the box that it came in. The serum was a slightly different color than what I&#x27;m used to as well.&lt;br /&gt;How well did it work?&lt;br /&gt;Although there were a few visible differences that I mentioned above, the product still worked very well on my skin. I had been using various Vitamin C Serums for a few months before trying this particular one and I was wondering if this one would work any better or worse. I used this one after using my Derma Roller and it was absorbed into my skin quickly and I love how smooth it felt afterward. I love how smooth and clear my skin still looks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m an avid blogger and product tester, I was sent a free bottle of this serum in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different vitamin C serums. Salvere is the best Surro I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion is becoming smoother and has smaller pores.  It does not smell and goes very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely stick with Salvere vitamin C.  The company has kept in touch with me and sent emails to make sure I am satisfied and using their product correctly. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, this makes my face so soft, like silk. I don&#x27;t know about reducing lines, but it hydrates and softens, so I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times, so I&#x27;m not giving it one star since I don&#x27;t  know whether or not it does what it claims to. The reason I can&#x27;t use it is that it makes my face so uncomfortable, like I&#x27;m wearing a thin mask. It feels awful and I&#x27;ve never used a product that has felt that way. And the feeling, whenever I&#x27;d move my face, lasted for hours until I finally washed it off. I did use the appropriate amount.&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t realize the product contains fragrance which is an unnecessary (in my opinion) irritant.&lt;br /&gt;I received an email from the CEO of the company asking for feedback for future &amp;#34;product enhancements&amp;#34; and boasting that the product has been tested &amp;#34;for months&amp;#34;. I was surprised that a product like this which takes time to be of optimal benefit would only have been tested for &amp;#34;months&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> my skin looks brighter and more smooth. I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> So good for my face! I really am enjoying this product!</li>
            <li> great stuff...Purchased at discounted price for review</li>
            <li> Awesome makes my skin so flawless and amazing love it now my skin is very smooth and brighter would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times but liked it. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and looking healthy. I can not speak to it&#x27;s ability to slow or delay the aging process but being healthy looking is just as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin so muc that I&#x27;ve ordered some of your other products as well. Looking forward to seeing results.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly and in good condition.  This is my second time ordering this product.  After I ran out of the first bottle, I noticed a difference in my skin.  This makes my skin smooth and soft and brighter.  I use this product once a day at night.</li>
            <li> Salvere Vitamin C Serum works as well as much higher priced serums.</li>
            <li> I use this serum at night although they recommend using it twice a day. After thorough cleansing I use a couple drops and it feels really silky when I start to rub it into my skin (I&#x27;ve never tried patting it into my skin). It absorbs really well and does not leave a greasy residue or make my skin feel dry and tight. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes to my skin but I&#x27;m being patient because I know everything usually takes a while to see results. For reference I experience moderate acne and this product does not sting and has little to no scent to it. I will fill out another review when I up my usage to twice per day and I&#x27;ve used it for up to 3 months. By then I think I should be able to definitely know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> According to my Aunt it really work good...thanks</li>
            <li> makes my skin feels soft and smooth. like it a lot!</li>
            <li> We &#x27;ll see....haven&#x27;t been using it long enough</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum is awesome. Thank for having a great product :)</li>
            <li> love it. great customer service!!!</li>
            <li> I am very choosy about the products that go on my skin. I decided to give this one a try and I was not disappointed. I use it only at night and I feel like it has made a difference. It seems like my face has a smoother quality, a bit of a glow to it - a more even skin tone. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my imagination that some of my wrinkles are less noticeable. I will continue to use this serum.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my elbows and face.</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love Salvere so far! I have very sensitive skin, I was nervous about the acid but it&#x27;s not irritating at all. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my complexion, smoother overall texture. It seems to be helping the fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;m not sure about the deeper lines around my mouth but with time...we&#x27;ll see. I want to definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to start the product now...</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is not greasy at all and rubs right into the skin, I use it on my face, neck, and hands and it is wonderful. I use it as a daily moisturizer under my make up and my makeup glides right on, and it does not change the look of my makeup at all or make it look oily. I highly recommend this product. I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> no discernible improvement. only difference is it made my skin break out consistently for the 2 months I used it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandma and let me tell you, she LOVES IT. Believe it or not but she actually REPLACED her L&#x27;Oreal product for this. She&#x27;s so thankful that I gave this to her. So I definitely give this 5 stars. Great product</li>
            <li> It absorbs really fast on the skin and the texture is pleasant to spread, I still have to wait a bit more time to see actual results but I&#x27;m a skin care specialist and I know that a lot of the ingredients of the product are very active in anti aging serums. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands and so far, so good. The only reason for giving it 4 stars is that the package does not look very appealing to me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this product!  You can definitely feel and see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Loved this product I have only been using it for a week and can already see the difference in my skin.  The area which is of most concern to me is the eye area and my fine lines are greatly improved in just a short time.  Been getting many compliments how raidiant my skin looks and that is without telling anyone I am using a new product!!! I will definitley re-order this product again!!!!</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a week but I love the smooth feeling on my face and top of hands. Love having everything I need for my face in one jar. Thanks</li>
            <li> I put this product on at bedtime it goes on my face and dry areas on my scalp. My scalp is now healing and my face is so soft. Love the effects from this!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> I totally am loving what this Vitamin C serum is doing to my skin and wrinkles.  Softens and is making my skin look great.  After just a little over a week, my skin is noticeably so much younger looking.  I will be buying this serum again and again.</li>
            <li> Non greasy and no odor, I love it!</li>
            <li> Best formula I have found for my sensitive skin. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Great Product. My skin looks and feels and great. I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Salvere has been so great on my skin. I feel refresh and my skin looks great again with new life and I could see the difference every day. I have very delicate skin and there wasn&#x27;t much cream I could use but has been great Thank you for making this serum I will tell all my friends how great this is. Thank you</li>
            <li> love this it actually makes you feel young again.</li>
            <li> I love this serum it goes on light and is making a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife will be very good. The wife want to buy more.</li>
            <li> use it everyday . knees no longer keep me a wake at night pain is gone</li>
            <li> I got this at discounted price to review and I&#x27;m very happy with it, my face feels softer and dark spots are starting to fade.. there is no smell to it either so u can&#x27;t tell its on your face and drys fast not greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Fast and safe shipping. Easy to use product. When first smelling it, it smelled like orange just a little or just a light little sent. Very nice sent. But once I put it on, don&#x27;t smell anything. Not sticky at all. I&#x27;m using on a few spots on my face left from premenstal. Going to give it a few weeks to see how it comes along though. Think I&#x27;m going to like it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So glad I came across this.  Was using capsules, but this seems to work so much better.  Skin feels smoother and is clearer.  Also helps my husband.  Had some flaky patches of psoriasis and this calms it down.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews for this product and saw that there were no 1 or 2 star reviews so I decided to purchase.  I am using to fade brown spots on my face and I have to say this product is excellent. I have used this twice a day for the last week.  I had one pimple when I tried this the first day but other than that this product is great. I have dry to combination skin,  I use this product at night after washing my face and apply a moisturizer when I go to bed.  In the morning I splash water on my face and use again and apply moisturizer. I am not wearing foundation right now so I don&#x27;t know if this product affect make up use.  The brown spots on my face are fading faster than I expected for the short amount of time I have been using it. In the past I have used Mega Bright by Origins, Olay ProX and Roc  products on my face to fade brown spots but none have come close to the results I have experienced with this product. This product exceeded my expectations and  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results over the next few weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and use it every day. I&#x27;ve suffered with problematic skin for many years and nothing seemed to help, products either dried out my skin or made it extremely oily and thus resulting in more breakouts. I&#x27;m 31 now and for the first time since I was 15 my face has a natural glow to it and when accompanied with a few other products Ive started using I can say Ive finally got that smooth skin I&#x27;ve always wanted, blemish free, dark spots/scars are fading, and skin looks and feels healthy. I honestly don&#x27;t think this could have been achieved without implementing Salvere Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I just started using this a week ago and already my skin looks better! My skin is more even toned, brighter and although minimal, my tiny freckles have started to fade. I can only imagine how my skin will look after a few more weeks. Love this!</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I like the gentleness of the serums absorption on my skin. My face feels and look more toned and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Im a clinical aesthetician and I can absolutely recommend this product. Keep in mind that the 20% vitamin C is a wonderful unit-oxidant, which in itself is a powerful age slowing ingredient. Vitamin C as an anti-wrinkle agent is &#x27;volatile&#x27; meaning it expires quickly in a suspension. Most effective anti-wrinkle Vit C is in a formulation you mix and use immediately. That doesnt take away the effectiveness of this serum. Ive noticed my skin is smoother. I also use glycolic (and other peels) and I find this product is excellent to speed up the healing process. It goes on very smoothly, needing only 3-4 drops before a moisturizer. It absorbs very well. I am very happy and will continue to use and purchase this product. The customer service is also appreciated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not sure what benefit I&#x27;m suppose to see. It wears well with my other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I gave my sister it 2 weeks ago and I found her face is moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also recommend it for my friends who have troubles in his or her skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice!! I use it under my daily moisturizer and I like the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Product is as decribed.  Quick service!</li>
            <li> purchased this as gift.  it arrived on time, and the recipient was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> this works so great on the skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great. Very moisturizing. Absorbs easily. No sticky residue and it does not leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> In love with this product. Received it quickly, and love the way it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> OMG!!  I love this serum so much I recommended it to all my friends and family.  I noticed a difference right away with the texture of my skin and the size reduction of my pores.  I started noticing an improvement about 10 days later on my laugh lines and crows feet around my eyes.  This serum is magic!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This serum goes on very smooth and does not leave your skin feeling oily.  I have only used it about a week now, but am noticing that my skin is brighter and some wrinkles/lines are starting to diminish.  I really enjoy using this product so far!</li>
            <li> Great value, instantly softens.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see big results, but I love the silky feel it gives my skin. A little drop goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in exchange for writing an honest review. I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d used it for 4-6 weeks before posting a review. I&#x27;ve added this product to both my morning and evening routine. After washing and drying my face, I rub a couple of drops on my face until it is absorbed, then layer my regular day and night creams over it. It didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or over dry my skin at all. My skin tone appears more even, and has more of a health glow without any cosmetics. Overall, I think this is a great value as I&#x27;ve paid as much as 3x&#x27;s the price for similar serums, and I feel like the results are the same. I&#x27;ve recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6-7 weeks, so I will still observe long term results. I do not see my crows feet vanishing and I still have lines. However, I don&#x27;t believe in miracle products that erase all wrinkles. What I do love is how the overall health of my skin has improved. I have oily maturing skin. This delivers healthy ingredients to my skin without causing breakouts, which is rare for me. My pores are tight and I feel like my skin even has a healthy glow. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is so good for your skin! I&#x27;m excited to have a bottle at home now to hopefully help with some of the cracked skin on my hands! I haven&#x27;t been using this too long but it sure makes my skin feel good when I put it on!</li>
            <li> The bottle seems really small, but it only takes a drop or two, so it&#x27;s going to last a while. Rubs in very well, doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue. Started seeing a change in my cheeks very early and my hands love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin C serum for almost 3 weeks, and my skin looks smoother and feels softer than before....I think it has plumped up the lines around my mouth and at the corners of my eyes. I will continue using this product with high hopes for a more youthful appearance. Also, could not beat the price!</li>
            <li> So excited I was able to try this product definantly worth the money and super excited for this product.Was shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> good company and good product and good service , I love it.</li>
            <li> So far soo good. I love how it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy. The smell is light and looking forward to a change in my skin :)</li>
            <li> Update: Nov. 27th 2014  After using this serum for about 2 weeks (4 days a week), I can see my skin become softer and spot is bit lighter.   Hopefully the spot will \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; soon so I won&#x27;t need to buy expensive beauty equipment.      Nov. 15th 2014  Received product very fast and will need to see how this really works on my skin.  But so far, it&#x27;s very easy to use and no bad feeling (too oily or dryness) so far.</li>
            <li> Really good at a really decent price</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product, I would continue to use it. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive skin, feels nice.</li>
            <li> The pH of this product measures about 4.0.  Vitamin C will not absorb into the skin at this pH.  From PubMed : &amp;#34;L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin. Maximal concentration for optimal percutaneous absorption was 20%. Tissue levels were saturated after three daily applications; the half-life of tissue disappearance was about 4 days. Derivatives of ascorbic acid including magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl-6-palmitate, and dehydroascorbic acid did not increase skin levels of L-ascorbic acid.&amp;#34;  I have contacted the company about this as well.  The serum does provide moisturization due to the Hyaluronic acid. http://ncnskincare.com/images/Vitamin-C_paper.pdf The company rep did reply to my question and stated that the pH is 4.  Based on the results in the study link above, it appears from the graph that perhaps about 1/4 the vitamin c may be taken up at this pH versus a lower pH - see figure 1.  That is my guess.</li>
            <li> I love this C, E and ferulic acid serum!! Your skin gets a great glow as it drinks it in. You can use very sparingly so it will last!! This is just as good as those same serums that the plastic surgeons  and dermatologists push for $130.00 or more!!! Great free radical fighter and healer.Excellent and affordable product!! Will return for more!!!</li>
            <li> I need to take this more regularly.  I take it when I have a flare up of my RA but perhaps if I take it regularly I will feel better.  It does help!</li>
            <li> Awesome Seller, Great Product</li>
            <li> Product combines the top three skin care products. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it&#x27;s already brightened my face. Thank you</li>
            <li> Getting older I&#x27;ve noticed some dark spots and darkening around my eyes.  I&#x27;ve never used anything like this and figured I had nothing to lose.After a couple weeks I can say around my eyes does feel and look a bit better, time will tell for sure, but I can tell you I can feel something after I put it on</li>
            <li> Serum feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! My skin feels smooth. Its not greasy and drys fast and my face is glowing, my skin feels great!!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! Good Quality!!</li>
