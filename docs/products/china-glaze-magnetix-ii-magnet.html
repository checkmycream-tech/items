            <li>I bought this to use with my sally hansen nail polish, works great!!</li>
            <li>worked great!</li>
            <li>These patterns are just great.</li>
            <li>is great except for the stripes.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this magnet it works great with the magnetic polish love using it nice to have more options</li>
            <li>I used it on Sensational gel and plan to use it on Gelish.  </li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>but if it is anything like the first one it will work perfectly with any magnetic polish you purchase not just China Glaze.</li>
            <li>The patterns are great and it&#x27;s made from great material that will last.</li>
            <li>I wanted more choices than just the waves that come with the sally hansen and this did it.</li>
            <li>Though not my favorite patterns I have to admit.</li>
            <li>The more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; the nail polish,</li>
            <li>the better the result.</li>
            <li>Would like more styles but have heard that the magnetic nail polish has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be as easy as the sally Hansen, but some of the designs don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>extremely  easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use with any magnetic nail polish.</li>
            <li>extremely good product highly recommended by the lady I bought these for.</li>
            <li>They are unique and you can play around with the angle that you apply it with and will creat great images, not that it has only been tried with China Glaze nail polish.</li>
            <li>very fun way to change up a manicure.</li>
            <li>That really bothered me because I love to have the latest thing first.</li>
            <li>The designs look really cool</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen or other China Glaze magnets, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>so much fun to use with my gelish magneto polish.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>is new magnet 2013, all has strong magnetic power and design</li>
            <li>least the color of the polish is cute; so I can just wear it on its own.</li>
            <li>I can finally get this to work :)  </li>
            <li>this product worked for the first time, but then did not work after that.  </li>
            <li>goes with the Nabi nail polish really well.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to read about this new magnet by china glaze on a bloggers site, but when I checked my local beauty stores they didn&#x27;t have it yet.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked well and the designs are much more fun than the usual ones.  </li>
            <li>Such a fun tool to liven up your nail polish routine.</li>
            <li>Works well as long as you have steady hands.</li>
            <li>so you can be certain you get the design in the center of the nail.  </li>

            <li> These patterns are just great. They are unique and you can play around with the angle that you apply it with and will creat great images, not that it has only been tried with China Glaze nail polish.</li>
            <li> Works well as long as you have steady hands. The image is as described. My daughter loves the patterns. Recomend</li>
            <li> I thought it would be as easy as the sally Hansen, but some of the designs don&#x27;t work. Only the middle portion of my nail gets the design. I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! I ordered this product on Friday morning &amp; received it Monday afternoon. Love that! I&#x27;m obsessed with magnetic nail polish so here&#x27;s another for my collection. If you&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen or other China Glaze magnets, you&#x27;ll be happy. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> goes with the Nabi nail polish really well. extremely good product highly recommended by the lady I bought these for. she raves about the patterns &amp; that it&#x27;s easier than the ones that come with. extremely  easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my sally hansen nail polish, works great!! I wanted more choices than just the waves that come with the sally hansen and this did it. Though not my favorite patterns I have to admit.</li>
            <li> Does not work well with Magna Nails Magnetic Nail Polish....Probably need to purchase China Glaze Nail Polish for the magnet to work like it should.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I can&#x27;t wait to.  The designs look really cool and I&#x27;m hoping since I got the China Glaze Magnetic Polish I can finally get this to work :)  The item arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Such a fun tool to liven up your nail polish routine. It&#x27;s so easy to use with any magnetic nail polish. The patterns are great and it&#x27;s made from great material that will last.</li>
            <li> Works just as it should with magnetic polishes. Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t work. Extremely disappointing</li>
            <li> This magnet is a tad tricky but I appreciate that it has a finger rest on the underside so you can be certain you get the design in the center of the nail.  I used it on Sensational gel and plan to use it on Gelish.  So far it&#x27;s worked well and the designs are much more fun than the usual ones.  I bought both of them so... fingers crossed it works on gelish!</li>
            <li> this product worked for the first time, but then did not work after that.  Don&#x27;t know what happened.  was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these magnets.  Each &amp;#34;horseshoe&amp;#34; has 3 different magnets (designs) on it.  As with any magnetic polish, you need to get the magnet over the nail as quickly as possible.  The more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; the nail polish, the better the result.</li>
            <li> Works well with magnetic nail polish.  Would like more styles but have heard that the magnetic nail polish has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I got magnetic polishes at bargain price but didn&#x27;t like the magnet from last year.&lt;br /&gt;This is new magnet 2013, all has strong magnetic power and design is great except for the stripes.</li>
            <li> i hate having to pay for something that doesn&#x27;t work. paid for the darn item &amp; the shipping and handling and then you get a piece of ........ in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to read about this new magnet by china glaze on a bloggers site, but when I checked my local beauty stores they didn&#x27;t have it yet. That really bothered me because I love to have the latest thing first. So I checked amazon and saw that they had it. I immediately had to purchase this. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but if it is anything like the first one it will work perfectly with any magnetic polish you purchase not just China Glaze.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this magnet it works great with the magnetic polish love using it nice to have more options</li>
            <li> The patterns are not strong when used with all magnetic polishes or gel polishes.</li>
            <li> worked great! so much fun to use with my gelish magneto polish. i get lots of compliments. very fun way to change up a manicure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the China Glaze nail polish or the magnet.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get it to work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least the color of the polish is cute; so I can just wear it on its own.</li>
