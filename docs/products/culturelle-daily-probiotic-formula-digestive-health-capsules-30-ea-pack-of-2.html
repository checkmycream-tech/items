            <li>You do&lt;br /&gt;have to adjust dose and diet to get the best affect.</li>
            <li>WE are very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>and my GI tract has been great.  </li>
            <li>and it is every bit as good as Culturelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep mine in the refrigerator to preserve the good bacteria&#x27;s potency.  </li>
            <li>This pack of 2 is a good buy, but watch for sales in Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied and happy with this product.</li>
            <li>A good product to take if you have some kind of bowel issues.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing thing ever!</li>
            <li>I have never felt better!</li>
            <li>ti&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>I feel better in hours to days.</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;m magically cured.</li>
            <li>I bought the two-pack to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the non-dairy aspect of these probiotics.  </li>
            <li>As best I can tell, the only difference between this and the Culturelle Vegetarian Health one (which is advertised as gluten free) is that the Vegetarian capsule is vegetarian as opposed to gelatin.</li>
            <li>I was having a great deal of bloating and digestive discomfort as a result of being a 40ish year old woman.</li>
            <li>We eat too much processed food in the U.S., and it has destroyed all of the good bacteria in our gut.</li>
            <li>It is a powder inside a gel tab (easy on the stomach).</li>
            <li>I felt better after taking the first pill!</li>
            <li>I posted the user image to let people know that this package is gluten free.</li>

            <li>All Culturelle claims are true.</li>
            <li>It has received many high ratings both online and by publications.  </li>
            <li>The Culturelle works ok - better than most of the other probiotics I&#x27;ve tried but you really need to take a bunch of them to feel relief.</li>
            <li>the success I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product since I began traveling full time in 2011 and have gotten good results up drinking the different water in the different states.  </li>
            <li>Culturelle doesn&#x27;t write gluten free on the front of this package for some reason, or advertise on its website that it&#x27;s gluten free, but the back of the package clearly states gluten free.</li>
            <li>Like Culturelle very much.</li>
            <li>I have found that VSL#3 works much better, I think simply because it&#x27;s stronger.</li>
            <li>arrived hot (summer on UPS truck)  </li>
            <li>Wish I would&#x27;ve had this stuff when I was younger and more prone to illness.  </li>
            <li>I can tell if I don&#x27;t take it regularly; my stomach does not feel as healthy.</li>
            <li>I only drink one cup of coffee a day (bummer &#x27;cause I love coffee) and I limit chocolate intake as these are triggers for my attacks.</li>
            <li>My husband had a kidney and much more removed from the left side.</li>
            <li>Make sure you check out Dr. Oz recommendations on live cultures and what types prior to purchasing a probiotic, do your homework.</li>
            <li>I take a couple of these, and a day later am fine.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic if you suffer from intestinal issues such as bloating, gas, gastritis, or GERD.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product....should have started taking a probiotic sooner!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had gastro-anything illness in 3 years thanks to these probiotics.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This product does not upset his stomach and is helping a very damaged digestive system work.</li>
            <li>I take it when my normal gut micorflora has been disrupted by certain foods or alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Now, I won&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Thank goodness there are products like these to help out my body as it gets older.</li>
            <li>Works great whenever I have a general belly ache for multiple days, I know it&#x27;s time to take probiotics again for a few days.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t know but 33 years of no hard scientific/medical/governmental endorsements is deafening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had IBS for a while now and just figured I&#x27;d have to live with it and go through attacks.  </li>
            <li>Never having taken probiotics in the past I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>This product has been a lifesaver for a family member after a string of infections fought using antibiotics wiped out her natural bacterial flora in her gastrointestinal track.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone having a traveling problem with new water in the different locations.</li>
            <li>Culturelle is also apparently used as a supplement in hospitals/nursing homes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them for folks with IBS and other GI issues.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First read about this product in &amp;#34;Good Germs Bad Germs&amp;#34; by Jessica Sachs.  This bacterial isolate can survive the hostile conditions of the stomach and make it to the intestines to help out-compete pathogenic bacteria.  I take it when my normal gut micorflora has been disrupted by certain foods or alcohol.  I feel better in hours to days.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing uncomfortable bloating,etc. The pharmacist recommened this product.  On a scale of 1-10, it works an 8 on some days.  Other days, 0 out of 10.</li>
            <li> Works great whenever I have a general belly ache for multiple days, I know it&#x27;s time to take probiotics again for a few days. Then I&#x27;m magically cured. I posted the user image to let people know that this package is gluten free. Culturelle doesn&#x27;t write gluten free on the front of this package for some reason, or advertise on its website that it&#x27;s gluten free, but the back of the package clearly states gluten free. As best I can tell, the only difference between this and the Culturelle Vegetarian Health one (which is advertised as gluten free) is that the Vegetarian capsule is vegetarian as opposed to gelatin. Both are marketed as dairy free and gluten free though.</li>
            <li> This product has been a lifesaver for a family member after a string of infections fought using antibiotics wiped out her natural bacterial flora in her gastrointestinal track. Culturelle was recommended by her primary care physician and an allergist after other probiotics (Sacc. B.) caused a painful yeast overgrowth. It&#x27;s now become a daily supplement.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic if you suffer from intestinal issues such as bloating, gas, gastritis, or GERD.  It may be a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.  It was recommended to me by my aunt who is a nurse.  Culturelle is also apparently used as a supplement in hospitals/nursing homes.</li>
            <li> Never having taken probiotics in the past I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. This product works to keep things moving in the colon. A good product to take if you have some kind of bowel issues.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product....should have started taking a probiotic sooner!  Make sure you check out Dr. Oz recommendations on live cultures and what types prior to purchasing a probiotic, do your homework.</li>
            <li> 7/24/2013&lt;br /&gt;Still Like Culturelle very much. Nothing changed in it&#x27;s 5 star rating. However, I found another probiotic similar in performance (for me any ways) but 1/3rd of price of Culturelle. That probiotic is Digestive Advantage by Schiff. I bought it in local grocery store and have been using it for a month and it is every bit as good as Culturelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review&lt;br /&gt;I tried probiotic products that have 50 billion organisms per capsule. None of them worked as well as Culturelle did. My stomach has felt best it has in years. All Culturelle claims are true. You do&lt;br /&gt;have to adjust dose and diet to get the best affect. After stomach normalizes, the dose may be reduced to one per day or one every other day. Adding fiber to the diet may also help.</li>
            <li> The Hype on this stuff is annoying - discovered in 1985 at Tufts the copy on the box is endlessly referenced as &amp;#34;not been evaluated by the FDA&amp;#34; - Why not? - I don&#x27;t know but 33 years of no hard scientific/medical/governmental endorsements is deafening.</li>
            <li> I was having a great deal of bloating and digestive discomfort as a result of being a 40ish year old woman. My doctor told me to begin taking this product, and my issues literally changed immediately. I felt better after taking the first pill! Now, I won&#x27;t live without it! I take it at least once, if not twice a day. My issues have vanished! We eat too much processed food in the U.S., and it has destroyed all of the good bacteria in our gut. This product replaces it, and aids digestion.</li>
            <li> Probiotics are a lifeline for those of us with Crohn&#x27;s disase. The Culturelle works ok - better than most of the other probiotics I&#x27;ve tried but you really need to take a bunch of them to feel relief. I have found that VSL#3 works much better, I think simply because it&#x27;s stronger.</li>
            <li> This probiotic was recommended by my Gasteoenterologist.  It has received many high ratings both online and by publications.  I keep mine in the refrigerator to preserve the good bacteria&#x27;s potency.  This pack of 2 is a good buy, but watch for sales in Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> arrived hot (summer on UPS truck)  so it was that or it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a yogurt eater, so this keeps my insides balanced.  Haven&#x27;t had gastro-anything illness in 3 years thanks to these probiotics. (And I used to have a major bout at least once a year.)  When I start feeling queasy or unbalanced I take a couple of these, and a day later am fine.  Wish I would&#x27;ve had this stuff when I was younger and more prone to illness.  I recommend this to EVERYONE I know.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a month now, and I definitely notice a change in the way I feel. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I switched from Align to Culturelle because of an article I saw by Dr. Andrew Weil. My husband and I take it and it works well for us. I can tell if I don&#x27;t take it regularly; my stomach does not feel as healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had IBS for a while now and just figured I&#x27;d have to live with it and go through attacks.  Someone recommended that I try a probiotic and I tried Culturelle.  It has been six weeks and my GI tract has been great.  I only drink one cup of coffee a day (bummer &#x27;cause I love coffee) and I limit chocolate intake as these are triggers for my attacks. Thank goodness there are products like these to help out my body as it gets older. I bought the two-pack to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out of it.  Totally satisfied and happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband has stage four kidney cancer and this was recommended by name by his doctor. This is the only probiotic I have taken that does not make me sick and give me sores. It is a powder inside a gel tab (easy on the stomach). I have attempted to open other probiotics to see the insides and found granite like rocks inside them (painful on the stomach). My husband had a kidney and much more removed from the left side. This product does not upset his stomach and is helping a very damaged digestive system work. WE are very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing ever! I have never felt better! I can actually eat food again without worrying about getting sick!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I began traveling full time in 2011 and have gotten good results up drinking the different water in the different states.  I would recommend it for anyone having a traveling problem with new water in the different locations.</li>
            <li> After having my gall bladder removed a few years ago- my stomach and GI system was a mess.  Random foods would set me off and I would be home sick for an entire day after eating something that didn&#x27;t agree with me.  But ever since I starting taking these-- ti&#x27;s amazing the success I&#x27;ve had.  As long as I remember to take them in the AM or before a meal, I can eat almost anything without issue.  Highly recommend them for folks with IBS and other GI issues.</li>
            <li> Since our family started on this probiotic we have had improved digestion.  We don&#x27;t leave home without it.  High,y recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the non-dairy aspect of these probiotics.  I am lactose intolerant and require it.  I also require all the benefits like reducing gas.  I will continue to use these.</li>
