            <li>Very satisfied and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Although I have really good skin, I have always appreciated the way that I could just dot it on my blemishes and blend it perfectly to my skin tone with no foundation.  </li>
            <li>discovered it was good for a good cover-up foundation to use under my favorite makeup, and that is what I use it for as the color needs&lt;br /&gt;a</li>

            <li>Love this makeup!  </li>
            <li>A bit lighter than the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; pan stick shade, but certainly better than nothing!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it and hope they continue making it!</li>
            <li>You have to be creative!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I still love it and would order again and again!</li>
            <li>Love Max Factor Panstik Foundation!</li>

            <li>I Love It!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I was very excited!</li>
            <li>It covers amazing, I can swim in it and it lasts well.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>So I was extremely happy to find this makeup available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It hides all my freckles just like the kind before.</li>
            <li>I also liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, will buy again.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I am quite fair and to have the Truly Fair shade would be wonderful!</li>
            <li>It stays on nicely all day.</li>
            <li>THANKS for this wonderful product !</li>
            <li>Maxfactor Pan stick gives me the flawless look every girl wants.</li>
            <li>It is no comparison to the original Pan Stik by Max Factor that was a great coverage makeup.</li>
            <li>True beige is a great color.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I was able to find a place where I could continue to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>But the beautiful, flawless-looking coverage is worth it.</li>
            <li>But the beautiful, flawless-looking coverage is worth it.</li>
            <li>Love it, light weight blends in great with your skin tone</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, has great coverage, and lasts for the better part of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Best by far!</li>
            <li>and love it.. Modeled for Stephanie Koret in San Francisco many years ago..!</li>
            <li>I am extremely disappointed that Max Factor stopped making what had been a perfect product in a perfect consistency, in a perfect color for my under eye circles.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good product and should be available in the US.  </li>
            <li>I love Max Factor makeup for the amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>The makeup is great but the price isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to be able to find this product since no longer sold in retail non online stores ,the product is as good as I remember just sold as a much smaller size.</li>
            <li>Exactly what she needs to make her as beautiful as Cleopatra.</li>
            <li>what kind of makeup I use, they love the way it looks.  </li>
            <li>it is smooth going on and the coverage is good.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found another makeup that I liked better</li>
            <li>Love this product, great full coverage make up.</li>
            <li>I am using something else right now but was always happy with the Pan Stick by your company.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using this makeup for many many years and love it!  </li>
            <li>..of course, nothing is as good as the original..</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage smoothly and lightly.</li>
            <li>Even though I will have to pay a lot more for the Ultra Creamy I will do so reluctantly until I find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>True Beige is a good replacement.</li>
            <li>This order came in good time, but I thought this was full size.</li>
            <li>Very light, not acceptable.</li>
            <li>Very smooth application.</li>
            <li>What a great deal on exactly what I needed and free shipping from Dublin!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for just light evening out of my skin tone or when I need full coverage for a blemish.</li>
            <li>Pan Stik should be applied with the fingertips to warm the product and help it to blend easily.</li>
            <li>Pan Stik should be applied with the fingertips to warm the product and help it to blend easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and spreads nicely.  </li>
            <li>but, it certainly is making me happy.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years, since in my teens.  </li>

            <li>I Love this Makeup.</li>

            <li>The smell is captivating.</li>
            <li>I love the color and texture of the make up.  </li>

            <li>I love this foundation</li>
            <li>Just hope I will be able to continue purchasing Pan Stik through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would be better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I was so happy to find it on line for a reasonable  price.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this make up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a winning product since the 1960&#x27;s that I can vouch for.</li>
            <li>and she is completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The price per ounce is more comparable to that of a department store makeup now.</li>
            <li>The price per ounce is more comparable to that of a department store makeup now.</li>
            <li>but she did love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it covers the acne and redness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I love Max Factor</li>
            <li>I used this off and on for many years.</li>
            <li>Plus I need more coverage than most makeups provide.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a damp sponge and there is nothing better for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many, many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes this product, and makes me reorder it when ever she needs more.</li>
            <li>I NEED to order more soon.</li>
            <li>This makeup is okay</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product!I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and light in use, but provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, easy to blend and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, it really great stuff.</li>
            <li>Panstik was always famous for being able to easily cover scars or blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Even with the new container, still works just as great.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it is not so easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Love this product to use as a concealer, would like to see more colors available.  </li>
            <li>Someone who needs extra coverage for spots or blemishes can blend and layer and achieve excellent coverage (just like the original).</li>
            <li>So far,  it works great.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and hope it is still available.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love Max Factor Panstik, its a shame no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>Was delivered before expected and great price too!!</li>
            <li>it is becoming a problem.</li>
            <li>This makeup offers great coverage.</li>
            <li>The price was good, however, based on the size of the two I feel I paid too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really, really happy to be able to continue getting the same great results with this new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really, really happy to be able to continue getting the same great results with this new product.</li>
            <li>When I heard the original Pan Stik was being discontinued, I stocked up on my two favorite shades.</li>
            <li>say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be happy even if the product was the same I would have been okay</li>
            <li>It washes off easily and leaves your skin moist.  </li>
            <li>As for the &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; tubes I bought, they are still easy to blend, and I&#x27;ll still use them.</li>
            <li>I like the color, but have ordered True Beige because the Nouveau Beige is more of a summer color for me,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair/light in most foundations, and I can wear either cool or neutral shades.</li>
            <li>After using both, I have come to the conclusion that True Beige is much better shade for me.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to apply, love the portability of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not used it yet, but it looks fine.</li>
            <li>Easy and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>This works fine for covering age spots and discoloration.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, blends easily , and covers fine lines, pores, and blemishes with ease and STAYS ON all day .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy since it doesn&#x27;t give me black heads that causes my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li>everything ok received  quickly</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Hope Amazon continues to make it available since it is no longer sold in retail stores.</li>
            <li>and I could only find it at a great price on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Although the shipping was fast, that was nice.</li>
            <li>Too light....</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it is still available, for the time being.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and will definitely will reorder</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a product that isn&#x27;t available  in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>It stays put until you wash it off, and equally important</li>
            <li>It was so light that I gave it away to my niece.  </li>
            <li>but truthfully its worth it ,especially if you are like me and are happy with this product..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny, but still a great product</li>
            <li>Please let me know if this product will always be available?</li>
            <li>Color is a bit too light for a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If the color is too light for a foundation, just use it for concealer.  </li>
            <li>It is no longer available in stores</li>
            <li>I will buy this product whenever its available.</li>
            <li>I appreciate having it available again.  </li>
            <li>so if you want light and dewy not your stuff.</li>
            <li>I did not like the color too light for me.  </li>
            <li>This is just a fantastic product, and I don&#x27;t know what Max Factor was thinking taking this off the U.S. market.  </li>
            <li>Not such a great deal after all.</li>
            <li>It is creamy, smooth, and luxurious</li>
            <li>regard to the price, all makeup has gone up greatly in price and/or reduced the size of products in the last decade--</li>
            <li>but I was thrilled to find Max Factor Pan Stik in my color but also to find it at such a great price thanks to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It covers minor skin flaws beautifully.</li>
            <li>My wife used Max Factor True Beige 125 for over 10 years, and when she wasn&#x27;t able to get it in stores, I turned to Amazon to find a replacement for her, which turned out to be True Beige 12.  </li>
            <li>Used Panstik for many years rated it a 2 star now that its had to get and pricey, and cannot get my right color</li>
            <li>The Pan-Stik is light, creamy and rich.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to pay a bit more for such a great product.  </li>
            <li>It stays put in the highest humidity and is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I tried true beige and it is fine.</li>
            <li>Not as creamy as the original</li>
            <li>I wish that the old product was available, but this is still much better than anything else I have tried, so I&#x27;ll continue to order it for sure.  </li>
            <li>I did this rating because I feel it is quite light for a true beige.  </li>
            <li>Wish they would make the original NUDE IVORY again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original formula, which is what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon?</li>
            <li>The product got here faster than the original shipping date</li>
            <li>and I was quite excited to see it and the idea of (2) in the pkg.</li>
            <li>I realize Max Factor is no longer producing/selling cosmetics here in the United States and was excited when I found I could buy this on Amazon</li>
            <li>Make-up is no longer as creamy as the original.</li>
            <li>Colors are lighter than the original makeup.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as light as Nude Ivory, but falls somewhere between the original Nude Ivory and the original True Beige.</li>
            <li>I found I can use it instead of the original Nude Ivory.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be shopping for that summertime shade soon.excellent coverage (just like the original).</li>
            <li>Panstik is  lighter than the original was.  </li>
            <li>then I found it on amazon... lighter than my original true beige, but</li>
            <li>The shade is not the original True Beige shade.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty happy with this makeup.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to get the order but it was all good when finally received.</li>
            <li>I just thought true beige would be a lil darker.</li>
            <li>Nude - True Beige is too dark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not such a good buy after all.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t stop selling the Max Factor Panstik, especially at this fair price.</li>
            <li>I  can still get my true beige panstik....</li>
            <li>I use true beige no125..</li>
            <li>wish it would have been full size product........</li>
            <li>I use to purchase #125, True Beige.  </li>
            <li>I wanted 125 true beige</li>
            <li>I have use panstick by max factor for years, I was very upset when I couldnot buy it any more...</li>
            <li>was lighter in shade than what a true beige should be.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Max Faxtor Panstick Foundation in True Beige for YEARS...</li>
            <li>I have been using max factor true beige 125 for thirty years.</li>
            <li>Good coverage but gets smaller</li>
            <li>So they came up with True Beige Pan Stick.</li>
            <li>Most of the profits from the company went towards his legal team and also restitution for the victims.</li>
            <li>For the price I was expecting a full size product..</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my 125 True Beige in the stores</li>
            <li>Also, if you compare similar products gram for gram its still a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making this available Amazon!</li>
            <li>I found that the True Beige is basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Happy to find the product and delivered fairly timely but much smaller in size than expected or hoped for!</li>
            <li>I have light skin and it gives me just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this product, although it is a bit smaller than the original product.  </li>
            <li>Other than that every thing is great with the product</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist and hair designer, I love the smooth full coverage of the Pan Stick.</li>
            <li>My little cotton patch wife is a dandy and always wants to look her best.  </li>
            <li>The coverage with the original was better than what is offered by&lt;br /&gt;the new version that comes from Ireland.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Max Factor Pan Stik has been my favorite foundation since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>Works great for those dark under-eye lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the new Pan Stik.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the new Pan Stik.</li>
            <li>The service was great, I had it in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li>Ordering online is easy and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I purchased Nouveau Beige instead of True beige because I saw many reviews stating that the new True Beige color was much lighter tan before.  </li>
            <li>I goes on so smooth and blends really well at the neck line.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and have always love it because it covers well and can be used as a concealer or as complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with pink tones.  </li>
            <li>My mom requested that I look for this item for her, and I was able to order it and have it sent directly to her.</li>
            <li>so I can smile with confidence.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve remained just as fresh as when I bought them.</li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s still available; same quality and coverage.  </li>
            <li>I like the 101 Natural better.  </li>
            <li>I love it as I am 76 years old and need all the help I can get.  </li>
            <li>It was priced right, shipped quickly, &amp; exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li>I read a TON of reviews to make sure I was ordering the right shade since the old shades are no longer sold and ordered the two I thought would work for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mot really the original Max.  </li>
            <li>but, other than that it was good.</li>
            <li>Very greasy feeling and not the coverage level of the original pan stik.</li>
            <li>It may help someone to know that the new True Beige is lighter than the original.</li>
            <li>Like the original, the new True Beige is in the ivory/warm spectrum.</li>
            <li>I just so happened to pick the right color</li>
            <li>True Beige is true to original (American) True Beige.</li>
            <li>Not the same coverage as the original 125 true beige, but works for light coverage.</li>
            <li>would rather have had full size at a reasonable price(#25)</li>
            <li>She always looks so fresh and pretty.  </li>
            <li>She used to use this back in the 1950s or so, and wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any local U.S. stores, so it was nice to get it this way.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something for photo shoots or TV, I recommend Kryolan Grease Paintsticks, which are reasonably priced for the products, and again, full coverage.</li>
            <li>In the past, I used Nude Ivory but find the current True Beige is a perfect match now.</li>
            <li>It is not worth the money, although I have always loved this makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients:  The new Pan Stik did not include ingredients with the product, but the list is available on the Max Factor website.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients:  The new Pan Stik did not include ingredients with the product, but the list is available on the Max Factor website.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when received that they were not as big as used to be when I could buy them in stores,but just as good quality as before .</li>
            <li>Product quality is the same only greatly reduced in quantity.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that the container is smaller than it used to be but; otherwise, it is still a great product.</li>
            <li>was very, very disappointed&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;d prefer the larger size and lower price, but being able to continue using my favorite makeup is worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;d prefer the larger size and lower price, but being able to continue using my favorite makeup is worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One review I read said the new Pan Stik is greasier than the original.</li>
            <li>The new Pan Stik feels just like the original on my skin.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay to use, but does not provide the same coverage.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s much more sheer.  </li>
            <li>Over the years there have surely been formulation changes but the consistent coverage has been the key for me.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these concealers.</li>
            <li>the color and texture matches my skin type exactly.</li>
            <li>My only problem is this is more of a trial size,</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for years and did not think I would be able to purchase it because I have researched all local stores</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted since they do not make the exact make up</li>
            <li>Skin looks smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>&amp; that it comes in a smaller container &amp; costs more than before.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to finally find a break on the price.</li>
            <li>This is the first stick makeup I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the product but stick was smaller than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>still the right color and brand and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thus, getting less amount for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Actually a little light in color, but it is ok with my powder.</li>
            <li>This item is too light in color, true beige should have been much darker, this is almost white</li>
            <li>It comes in smaller tubes, but worth every penny .Great coverage and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li>it was smaller than I expected however it fits great in your purse on the go</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a reasonable price in the UK even with the postage and the smaller size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>12 True Beige is the same as my 125 True Beige there is no difference at all.  </li>
            <li>Someone with good skin needs very little to achieve the look of perfection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a Favorite of Mine for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as it reads, but I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the size</li>
            <li>I have worn Max Factor True Beige since I was 18 years old</li>
            <li>Concealer by itself is very good quality and last very long because it&#x27;s pretty big.</li>
            <li>While I was very excited to locate one of my favorite products, I was very surprised at the small size.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy as long as possible and the price is good.</li>
            <li>Anyway, once I learned that I could buy a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; True Beige warm 2  for $99 each, I was forced to I look for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>WANT THE OLDER KINDS!!!!!!!!!WHY DOES EVERY THING CHANGE??????????????????ANY WAY TO FIND THE OTHER KIND???</li>
            <li>just love it very much,I have used it for a very long time, nothing even comes close</li>
            <li>Love the foundation but there is not very much in the container.</li>
            <li>The product seems very similar, maybe a tad less oily (great).  </li>
            <li>It is very hard to find, so I was happy to find it Amazon.</li>
            <li>the shipping was very high.</li>
            <li>The Max factor is nice and creamy and maybe a little lighter than what I used before</li>
            <li>I am extremely pale (family background on one side of the family is black-haired &amp; VERY white-skinned Irish/Scottish/English), and as I have gotten a little older any incidental sun exposure hasn&#x27;t changed my tone much (mostly tried to avoid!); therefore, I ordered several tubes of both Fair and True Beige.  </li>
            <li>I compared original Pan Stik with the new Pan Stik made in Ireland and found the products to be so similar that I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>and I like it so much</li>
            <li>I would much rather have a darker color.  </li>
            <li>I tried this shade since the shade I really wanted was so</li>
            <li>The order came so fast</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoys using this makeup.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping from across the pond.</li>
            <li>The size is very misleading.</li>
            <li>I just found Maybeline now makes a shine free pan stick foundation almost similar to Max factor.  </li>
            <li>I am disapointed in i t and only used it once in a while because it was  too light.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They really messed up when they took it out of the United States.  </li>
            <li>; I remember, didn&#x27;t really care for i much.</li>
            <li>, I looked on amazon.com and found the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product although it has shrunk in size.</li>
            <li>She says there&#x27;s nothing that really compares to it.</li>
            <li>It is much closer to Nude Ivory, which I used to use.  </li>
            <li>I was very sastified</li>
            <li>The makeup is greasy, very greasy to me (-1 star).</li>
            <li>Panstick works very well.</li>
            <li>I wanted much darker color but Med.</li>
            <li>I found it here and really made my moms day.</li>
            <li>Items were smaller in ounces than I thought and didn&#x27;t want the color was too light for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found another makeup I like as much and didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
            <li>I was very upset when I found out</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Thanks Max Factor.  </li>
            <li>I am frequently complimented on my smooth complexion at 88 years old.</li>
            <li>the  coverage is  the  same,  the scent is different, but still nice.</li>
            <li>It makes me break out slightly if I wear it too long , but the coverage the MaxFactor pastick gives is great.  </li>
            <li>Pan Stik has always been indicated to be for normal to dry skin; I have oily skin and still love it.</li>
            <li>Foundation was great, I just thought it was too much for such a small container.</li>
            <li>She would like to return it if possible or exchange it for something close to Rich Beige.</li>
            <li>The size IS smaller than the original, but you have to take what you can get.</li>
            <li>Been using it for many, many years and am disappointed I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.  </li>
            <li>I use other foundation and then the Panstick where I need more coverage</li>
            <li>The shade is different than the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the True Beige is more yellow than pink undertones.</li>
            <li>Please bring back the original formula and colors.</li>
            <li>and they are smaller than the original ones</li>
            <li>It is slightly larger than a tube of lipstick and the price was doubled from the original price.</li>
            <li>This last time I ordered #12, True Beige and it was much lighter.  </li>
            <li>The foundation is good, but it is only half the size</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable in stores that lasts as long, goes on as smoothly,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s color stays true and doesn&#x27;t change the color of blush when brushed on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Product is nice as usual, so no complaints about the quality.</li>
            <li>It is ok except the color is to dark for me</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know they were not going to be the full regular size I have always bought.  </li>
            <li>Does anyone know what I can do to get the same True beige 125 foundation.</li>
            <li>Product must be old...was very dry and does not go on smooth nor stay on very long...had to mix it with a liquid foundation...disappointed</li>
            <li>You pay more for less.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve taken my favorite make-up something that I&#x27;ve been buying and wearing for 40 years and reduced the size of the container by half.</li>
            <li>I have one older</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find Max Factor in American stores anymore, so I was pleased to find it,finally, on line,but it is not the same size we used to get in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Now I use mainly for under-eye cover stick.  </li>
            <li>on the market at a halfway decent price.</li>
            <li>and I have been lucky enough to find it on Amazon for them.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have a company buy out the company that made my perfume after decades of me using it.</li>
            <li>from a older generation to now.</li>
            <li>Through the years I tried many other products, and ALWAYS went right back to Pan Stik-</li>
            <li>Per the manufacturer&#x27;s directions, I ordered the new True Beige #12, but it&#x27;s not the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pan Stik since 1986, when I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>This product has been around since I was in high school and before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Max Factor since high school.  </li>
            <li>I have never found any other makeup as easy to use as PanStik.</li>
            <li>I did notice when I received the order that the product contained a different amount than it used to and the product looked a little different, but I was so happy to receive my order.  </li>
            <li>After that I wasn&#x27;t able to find out who actually owns it, but although it is hard to get, it is still available.</li>
            <li>Light, not too pink.</li>
            <li>Hope it is the same as the old true beige 125 ..</li>
            <li>Plus the color did not match what I normally get</li>
            <li>the pic makes it look like what we are normally getting but not.....</li>
            <li>I found this stick useful in covering facial flaws!</li>
            <li>This make up is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t dark enough to replace the original True Beige as my summertime color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the right brand &amp; it was also a lot smaller than I wanted.</li>
            <li>Max Factor is the only foundation that does right on my face.</li>
            <li>I had to order twice to get the right shade since the colors are named differently.</li>
            <li>So yeah, I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra to have my favorite foundation..</li>
            <li>It does however go on smoothly like the other I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li>This is a new mini size.</li>
            <li>This new packaging is about 1/2 the size of what it used to be.  </li>
            <li>But what&#x27;s new, huh.</li>
            <li>Since these will eventually be gone, I wanted to try the new Pan Stik while I had those two for comparison.</li>
            <li>In comparing my two originals to the new one, I disagree.</li>
            <li>It is much less creamy and doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend and seems like the Irish factory is using the same recipe as the old PanStik.</li>
            <li>When I compare it with the new Pan-Stik, they look and feel exactly the same.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvery small but color looks ok.</li>
            <li>Smaller ounces and a higher price come on this</li>
            <li>The product is awesome, just disappointed in size.</li>
            <li>It  is all natural  no Chemicals !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old to change!</li>
            <li>too small but the color was OK</li>
            <li>I ordered another item (different company, different product) much larger size and twice as many</li>
            <li>no one can guess how old I am!  </li>
            <li>It covers completely but also keeps away fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>If applied too heavily, both the old and new will settle into any fine lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I tried everything including mixing the true beige with other panstick colors from max factor.</li>
            <li>Not as creamy and  long lasting coverage as the original Max Factor made in USA</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in this and the 125 True Beige that was discontinued &amp; now costs a small fortune if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find it.</li>
            <li>Good product, just seems to be smaller than the previous and more expensive.  </li>
            <li>The texture gives less coverage than the original and</li>
            <li>Only wish it was just a little more creamy.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup - just so hard to get now - can&#x27;t somebody make it in the States</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I ordered though it took nearly three weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Old company, still kickin&#x27; ..</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY, if you are accustomed to the OLD Max Factor.</li>
            <li>as I  have the old.  </li>
            <li>wow on or two uses will be out of it....</li>
            <li>Proctor and Gamble really should put it back on drugstore shelves.</li>
            <li>I had been using old Pan Stick color #121.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and started using this product when I was 14..</li>
            <li>I wish it was sold in the larger tube without costing so much.</li>
            <li>and then I began using it as an adult.</li>
            <li>Naturally UV protectant has protected my skin before anybody even knew about UV.</li>
            <li>But its a very goog product and wish that darker color would be the same price.</li>
            <li>It is really getting scarce and will have to find a different product, but they are fighting it all the way.</li>
            <li>ive been using this since early 70s</li>
            <li>I gave this Max Factor a 4 star rating just because they are still selling some old product.</li>
            <li>Yes the package is about 1/2 the size fo the old sticks</li>
            <li>Better price than where I have been purchasing this product for the last few years</li>
            <li>Keeps color true and long lasting.</li>
            <li>but this is better than any other I&#x27;ve tried, including much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Marlene wanted Rich Beige and found out it was not available.</li>
            <li>Too tiny - I want my old Max factor back so much!  </li>
            <li>There are only two left now -- a Nude Ivory (my basic color) and a True Beige (my summertime color).</li>
            <li>Some customers here have said this isn&#x27;t the same formula as the older makeup.</li>
            <li>It is smaller for the same or a little more cost.</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly and apply by warming it up with my fingertip on the stick, then dotting it on, and finally, using a slightly damp Takelon foundation brush, I smooth it out all over.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected and what She wanted.  </li>
            <li>complaint is that it&#x27;s a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying.</li>
            <li>While I love this makeup and have used it every day for years it is now hard to find, and what I do find is a much smaller amount for twice the price.  </li>
            <li>The formula seems to be the same, but the new size is 9 grams.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be similar to the new pan stick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Color Comparison: The new colors are different, as others have said.</li>
            <li>The color match is about the same as the previous version, however, it is much more sheer than the former product.  </li>
            <li>Too light of a shade and really not what I expected.</li>
            <li>True to shade but a small tube than the old one.. Not sold in USA anymore</li>
            <li>On occasion, I have tried a different base that advertised how wonderful their product was.  </li>
            <li>There is no other make-up to compare.  </li>
            <li>Max Factor is my favorite brand of make up but this tube is very small compared to the others of the same brand.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this, it is a tough product to find.  </li>
            <li>It is really too small for that much money.</li>
            <li>Apparently this product works.  </li>
            <li>The product wasn&#x27;t near the same size as the Pan Stik I have used since I was 16.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that it is considerably smaller than I had bought in the stores before.  </li>
            <li>Much faster shipping than expected.</li>
            <li>We ordered this at 3 times what she normally paid, only to find out it is slightly smaller.  </li>
            <li>I was forced to try many American products last year</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and only order Pan stick in the new packaging, as makeup tends to have a shelflife of only one year.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the new Pan Stik is considerably smaller.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the new Pan Stik is considerably smaller.</li>
            <li>they were about half the size they used to be in the stores but at an even HIGHER price than before.</li>
            <li>Less product &#x3D; higher price &#x3D; :</li>
            <li>It is smaller than the original but not as small as a lipstick as some have stated.</li>
            <li>Tube is 1/2 the size of the original and is hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li>She absolutely refuses to use any other product.  </li>
            <li>or I would be applying to much makeup, but again not sure if that is normal or not.</li>
            <li>Creamy not dry.</li>
            <li>It is getting harder to find even on line lately but hope this gets better</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve aged my skin has dried out significantly, so I can use  an oilier based makeup.</li>
            <li>A different pkg than I&#x27;m used to but still the same trusty foundation so hard to find worth the xtra money!</li>
            <li>very satisfied with max factor product, been using it for 20 yrs now, the only complaint I have is the smaller size it comes in now, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the previous size.</li>
            <li>I feel I paid way too much for half the product...</li>
            <li>but it is too dry on your sking and does not go on as well at the old Max Factor.</li>
            <li>Every other product tested from low end to high end has irritated my face.  </li>
            <li>Too much monet paid for the little makeup in it.</li>
            <li>At first I was able to find the original product on the internet, now it&#x27;s just crazy expensive, so I decided to try this out.  </li>
            <li>Since my complexion needs a little extra coverage, I have to use a very durable product.</li>

            <li> Very satisfied and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Although I have really good skin, I have always appreciated the way that I could just dot it on my blemishes and blend it perfectly to my skin tone with no foundation.  </li>
            <li> discovered it was good for a good cover-up foundation to use under my favorite makeup, and that is what I use it for as the color needs&lt;br /&gt;a</li>

            <li> A bit lighter than the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; pan stick shade, but certainly better than nothing!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it and hope they continue making it!</li>
            <li> You have to be creative!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I still love it and would order again and again!</li>

            <li> So I was extremely happy to find this makeup available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It hides all my freckles just like the kind before.</li>
            <li> I also liked the smell.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, will buy again.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I am quite fair and to have the Truly Fair shade would be wonderful!</li>
            <li> It stays on nicely all day.</li>
            <li> THANKS for this wonderful product !</li>
            <li> Maxfactor Pan stick gives me the flawless look every girl wants.</li>
            <li> It is no comparison to the original Pan Stik by Max Factor that was a great coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> True beige is a great color.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I was able to find a place where I could continue to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> But the beautiful, flawless-looking coverage is worth it.</li>
            <li> But the beautiful, flawless-looking coverage is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it, light weight blends in great with your skin tone</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, has great coverage, and lasts for the better part of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Best by far!</li>
            <li> and love it.. Modeled for Stephanie Koret in San Francisco many years ago..!</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that Max Factor stopped making what had been a perfect product in a perfect consistency, in a perfect color for my under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good product and should be available in the US.  </li>
            <li> I love Max Factor makeup for the amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> The makeup is great but the price isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to be able to find this product since no longer sold in retail non online stores ,the product is as good as I remember just sold as a much smaller size.</li>
            <li> Exactly what she needs to make her as beautiful as Cleopatra.</li>
            <li> what kind of makeup I use, they love the way it looks.  </li>
            <li> it is smooth going on and the coverage is good.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found another makeup that I liked better</li>
            <li> Love this product, great full coverage make up.</li>
            <li> I am using something else right now but was always happy with the Pan Stick by your company.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this makeup for many many years and love it!  </li>
            <li> ..of course, nothing is as good as the original..</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage smoothly and lightly.</li>
            <li> Even though I will have to pay a lot more for the Ultra Creamy I will do so reluctantly until I find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> True Beige is a good replacement.</li>
            <li> This order came in good time, but I thought this was full size.</li>
            <li> Very light, not acceptable.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.</li>
            <li> What a great deal on exactly what I needed and free shipping from Dublin!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for just light evening out of my skin tone or when I need full coverage for a blemish.</li>
            <li> Pan Stik should be applied with the fingertips to warm the product and help it to blend easily.</li>
            <li> Pan Stik should be applied with the fingertips to warm the product and help it to blend easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and spreads nicely.  </li>
            <li> but, it certainly is making me happy.</li>
            <li> I love this product....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, since in my teens.  </li>

            <li> I Love this Makeup.</li>

            <li> I purchased this products after many years of not seeing it on the market.  </li>
            <li> The smell is captivating.</li>
            <li> I love the color and texture of the make up.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting that this color would cover my skin more darker.</li>

            <li> I love it.  </li>

            <li> It is easy to apply, easy to blend and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, it really great stuff.</li>
            <li> Panstik was always famous for being able to easily cover scars or blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Even with the new container, still works just as great.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is not so easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Love this product to use as a concealer, would like to see more colors available.  </li>
            <li> Someone who needs extra coverage for spots or blemishes can blend and layer and achieve excellent coverage (just like the original).</li>
            <li> So far,  it works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and hope it is still available.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Max Factor Panstik, its a shame no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> Was delivered before expected and great price too!!</li>
            <li> it is becoming a problem.</li>
            <li> This makeup offers great coverage.</li>
            <li> The price was good, however, based on the size of the two I feel I paid too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really, really happy to be able to continue getting the same great results with this new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really, really happy to be able to continue getting the same great results with this new product.</li>
            <li> When I heard the original Pan Stik was being discontinued, I stocked up on my two favorite shades.</li>
            <li> say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be happy even if the product was the same I would have been okay</li>
            <li> It washes off easily and leaves your skin moist.  </li>
            <li> As for the &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; tubes I bought, they are still easy to blend, and I&#x27;ll still use them.</li>
            <li> I like the color, but have ordered True Beige because the Nouveau Beige is more of a summer color for me,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair/light in most foundations, and I can wear either cool or neutral shades.</li>
            <li> After using both, I have come to the conclusion that True Beige is much better shade for me.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to apply, love the portability of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet, but it looks fine.</li>
            <li> Easy and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> This works fine for covering age spots and discoloration.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, blends easily , and covers fine lines, pores, and blemishes with ease and STAYS ON all day .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy since it doesn&#x27;t give me black heads that causes my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> everything ok received  quickly</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Hope Amazon continues to make it available since it is no longer sold in retail stores.</li>
            <li> and I could only find it at a great price on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Although the shipping was fast, that was nice.</li>
            <li> Too light....</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it is still available, for the time being.  </li>
            <li> Great quality and will definitely will reorder</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a product that isn&#x27;t available  in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> It stays put until you wash it off, and equally important</li>
            <li> It was so light that I gave it away to my niece.  </li>
            <li> but truthfully its worth it ,especially if you are like me and are happy with this product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny, but still a great product</li>
            <li> Please let me know if this product will always be available?</li>
            <li> Color is a bit too light for a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If the color is too light for a foundation, just use it for concealer.  </li>
            <li> It is no longer available in stores</li>
            <li> I will buy this product whenever its available.</li>
            <li> I appreciate having it available again.  </li>
            <li> so if you want light and dewy not your stuff.</li>
            <li> I did not like the color too light for me.  </li>
            <li> This is just a fantastic product, and I don&#x27;t know what Max Factor was thinking taking this off the U.S. market.  </li>
            <li> Not such a great deal after all.</li>
            <li> It is creamy, smooth, and luxurious</li>
            <li> regard to the price, all makeup has gone up greatly in price and/or reduced the size of products in the last decade--</li>
            <li> but I was thrilled to find Max Factor Pan Stik in my color but also to find it at such a great price thanks to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It covers minor skin flaws beautifully.</li>
            <li> My wife used Max Factor True Beige 125 for over 10 years, and when she wasn&#x27;t able to get it in stores, I turned to Amazon to find a replacement for her, which turned out to be True Beige 12.  </li>
            <li> Used Panstik for many years rated it a 2 star now that its had to get and pricey, and cannot get my right color</li>
            <li> The Pan-Stik is light, creamy and rich.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to pay a bit more for such a great product.  </li>
            <li> It stays put in the highest humidity and is super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I tried true beige and it is fine.</li>
            <li> Not as creamy as the original</li>
            <li> I wish that the old product was available, but this is still much better than anything else I have tried, so I&#x27;ll continue to order it for sure.  </li>
            <li> I did this rating because I feel it is quite light for a true beige.  </li>
            <li> Wish they would make the original NUDE IVORY again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original formula, which is what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find it on Amazon?</li>
            <li> The product got here faster than the original shipping date</li>
            <li> and I was quite excited to see it and the idea of (2) in the pkg.</li>
            <li> I realize Max Factor is no longer producing/selling cosmetics here in the United States and was excited when I found I could buy this on Amazon</li>
            <li> Make-up is no longer as creamy as the original.</li>
            <li> Colors are lighter than the original makeup.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as light as Nude Ivory, but falls somewhere between the original Nude Ivory and the original True Beige.</li>
            <li> I found I can use it instead of the original Nude Ivory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shopping for that summertime shade soon.excellent coverage (just like the original).</li>
            <li> Panstik is  lighter than the original was.  </li>
            <li> then I found it on amazon... lighter than my original true beige, but</li>
            <li> The shade is not the original True Beige shade.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty happy with this makeup.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get the order but it was all good when finally received.</li>
            <li> I just thought true beige would be a lil darker.</li>
            <li> Nude - True Beige is too dark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not such a good buy after all.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop selling the Max Factor Panstik, especially at this fair price.</li>
            <li> I  can still get my true beige panstik....</li>
            <li> I use true beige no125..</li>
            <li> wish it would have been full size product........</li>
            <li> I use to purchase #125, True Beige.  </li>
            <li> I wanted 125 true beige</li>
            <li> I have use panstick by max factor for years, I was very upset when I couldnot buy it any more...</li>
            <li> was lighter in shade than what a true beige should be.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Max Faxtor Panstick Foundation in True Beige for YEARS...</li>
            <li> I have been using max factor true beige 125 for thirty years.</li>
            <li> Good coverage but gets smaller</li>
            <li> So they came up with True Beige Pan Stick.</li>
            <li> Most of the profits from the company went towards his legal team and also restitution for the victims.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting a full size product..</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my 125 True Beige in the stores</li>
            <li> Also, if you compare similar products gram for gram its still a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making this available Amazon!</li>
            <li> I found that the True Beige is basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Happy to find the product and delivered fairly timely but much smaller in size than expected or hoped for!</li>
            <li> I have light skin and it gives me just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product, although it is a bit smaller than the original product.  </li>
            <li> Other than that every thing is great with the product</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist and hair designer, I love the smooth full coverage of the Pan Stick.</li>
            <li> My little cotton patch wife is a dandy and always wants to look her best.  </li>
            <li> The coverage with the original was better than what is offered by&lt;br /&gt;the new version that comes from Ireland.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Max Factor Pan Stik has been my favorite foundation since I was in high school.</li>
            <li> Works great for those dark under-eye lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the new Pan Stik.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the new Pan Stik.</li>
            <li> The service was great, I had it in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Ordering online is easy and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I purchased Nouveau Beige instead of True beige because I saw many reviews stating that the new True Beige color was much lighter tan before.  </li>
            <li> I goes on so smooth and blends really well at the neck line.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have always love it because it covers well and can be used as a concealer or as complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin with pink tones.  </li>
            <li> My mom requested that I look for this item for her, and I was able to order it and have it sent directly to her.</li>
            <li> so I can smile with confidence.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve remained just as fresh as when I bought them.</li>
            <li> So glad it&#x27;s still available; same quality and coverage.  </li>
            <li> I like the 101 Natural better.  </li>
            <li> I love it as I am 76 years old and need all the help I can get.  </li>
            <li> It was priced right, shipped quickly, &amp; exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li> I read a TON of reviews to make sure I was ordering the right shade since the old shades are no longer sold and ordered the two I thought would work for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mot really the original Max.  </li>
            <li> but, other than that it was good.</li>
            <li> Very greasy feeling and not the coverage level of the original pan stik.</li>
            <li> It may help someone to know that the new True Beige is lighter than the original.</li>
            <li> Like the original, the new True Beige is in the ivory/warm spectrum.</li>
            <li> I just so happened to pick the right color</li>
            <li> True Beige is true to original (American) True Beige.</li>
            <li> Not the same coverage as the original 125 true beige, but works for light coverage.</li>
            <li> would rather have had full size at a reasonable price(#25)</li>
            <li> She always looks so fresh and pretty.  </li>
            <li> She used to use this back in the 1950s or so, and wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any local U.S. stores, so it was nice to get it this way.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something for photo shoots or TV, I recommend Kryolan Grease Paintsticks, which are reasonably priced for the products, and again, full coverage.</li>
            <li> In the past, I used Nude Ivory but find the current True Beige is a perfect match now.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money, although I have always loved this makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients:  The new Pan Stik did not include ingredients with the product, but the list is available on the Max Factor website.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients:  The new Pan Stik did not include ingredients with the product, but the list is available on the Max Factor website.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when received that they were not as big as used to be when I could buy them in stores,but just as good quality as before .</li>
            <li> Product quality is the same only greatly reduced in quantity.</li>
            <li> The only difference is that the container is smaller than it used to be but; otherwise, it is still a great product.</li>
            <li> was very, very disappointed&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;d prefer the larger size and lower price, but being able to continue using my favorite makeup is worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;d prefer the larger size and lower price, but being able to continue using my favorite makeup is worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One review I read said the new Pan Stik is greasier than the original.</li>
            <li> The new Pan Stik feels just like the original on my skin.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay to use, but does not provide the same coverage.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s much more sheer.  </li>
            <li> Over the years there have surely been formulation changes but the consistent coverage has been the key for me.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these concealers.</li>
            <li> the color and texture matches my skin type exactly.</li>
            <li> My only problem is this is more of a trial size,</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for years and did not think I would be able to purchase it because I have researched all local stores</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted since they do not make the exact make up</li>
            <li> Skin looks smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> &amp; that it comes in a smaller container &amp; costs more than before.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to finally find a break on the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first stick makeup I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the product but stick was smaller than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> still the right color and brand and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Thus, getting less amount for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Actually a little light in color, but it is ok with my powder.</li>
            <li> This item is too light in color, true beige should have been much darker, this is almost white</li>
            <li> It comes in smaller tubes, but worth every penny .Great coverage and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> it was smaller than I expected however it fits great in your purse on the go</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a reasonable price in the UK even with the postage and the smaller size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 12 True Beige is the same as my 125 True Beige there is no difference at all.  </li>
            <li> Someone with good skin needs very little to achieve the look of perfection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a Favorite of Mine for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as it reads, but I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the size</li>
            <li> I have worn Max Factor True Beige since I was 18 years old</li>
            <li> Concealer by itself is very good quality and last very long because it&#x27;s pretty big.</li>
            <li> While I was very excited to locate one of my favorite products, I was very surprised at the small size.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as possible and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Anyway, once I learned that I could buy a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; True Beige warm 2  for $99 each, I was forced to I look for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> WANT THE OLDER KINDS!!!!!!!!!WHY DOES EVERY THING CHANGE??????????????????ANY WAY TO FIND THE OTHER KIND???</li>
            <li> just love it very much,I have used it for a very long time, nothing even comes close</li>
            <li> Love the foundation but there is not very much in the container.</li>
            <li> The product seems very similar, maybe a tad less oily (great).  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find, so I was happy to find it Amazon.</li>
            <li> the shipping was very high.</li>
            <li> The Max factor is nice and creamy and maybe a little lighter than what I used before</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale (family background on one side of the family is black-haired &amp; VERY white-skinned Irish/Scottish/English), and as I have gotten a little older any incidental sun exposure hasn&#x27;t changed my tone much (mostly tried to avoid!); therefore, I ordered several tubes of both Fair and True Beige.  </li>
            <li> I compared original Pan Stik with the new Pan Stik made in Ireland and found the products to be so similar that I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I like it so much</li>
            <li> I would much rather have a darker color.  </li>
            <li> I tried this shade since the shade I really wanted was so</li>
            <li> The order came so fast</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys using this makeup.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping from across the pond.</li>
            <li> The size is very misleading.</li>
            <li> I just found Maybeline now makes a shine free pan stick foundation almost similar to Max factor.  </li>
            <li> I am disapointed in i t and only used it once in a while because it was  too light.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They really messed up when they took it out of the United States.  </li>
            <li> ; I remember, didn&#x27;t really care for i much.</li>
            <li> , I looked on amazon.com and found the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product although it has shrunk in size.</li>
            <li> She says there&#x27;s nothing that really compares to it.</li>
            <li> It is much closer to Nude Ivory, which I used to use.  </li>
            <li> I was very sastified</li>
            <li> The makeup is greasy, very greasy to me (-1 star).</li>
            <li> Panstick works very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted much darker color but Med.</li>
            <li> I found it here and really made my moms day.</li>
            <li> Items were smaller in ounces than I thought and didn&#x27;t want the color was too light for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found another makeup I like as much and didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
            <li> I was very upset when I found out</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Thanks Max Factor.  </li>
            <li> I am frequently complimented on my smooth complexion at 88 years old.</li>
            <li> the  coverage is  the  same,  the scent is different, but still nice.</li>
            <li> It makes me break out slightly if I wear it too long , but the coverage the MaxFactor pastick gives is great.  </li>
            <li> Pan Stik has always been indicated to be for normal to dry skin; I have oily skin and still love it.</li>
            <li> Foundation was great, I just thought it was too much for such a small container.</li>
            <li> She would like to return it if possible or exchange it for something close to Rich Beige.</li>
            <li> The size IS smaller than the original, but you have to take what you can get.</li>
            <li> Been using it for many, many years and am disappointed I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.  </li>
            <li> I use other foundation and then the Panstick where I need more coverage</li>
            <li> The shade is different than the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the True Beige is more yellow than pink undertones.</li>
            <li> Please bring back the original formula and colors.</li>
            <li> and they are smaller than the original ones</li>
            <li> It is slightly larger than a tube of lipstick and the price was doubled from the original price.</li>
            <li> This last time I ordered #12, True Beige and it was much lighter.  </li>
            <li> The foundation is good, but it is only half the size</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable in stores that lasts as long, goes on as smoothly,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s color stays true and doesn&#x27;t change the color of blush when brushed on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Product is nice as usual, so no complaints about the quality.</li>
            <li> It is ok except the color is to dark for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they were not going to be the full regular size I have always bought.  </li>
            <li> Does anyone know what I can do to get the same True beige 125 foundation.</li>
            <li> Product must be old...was very dry and does not go on smooth nor stay on very long...had to mix it with a liquid foundation...disappointed</li>
            <li> You pay more for less.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve taken my favorite make-up something that I&#x27;ve been buying and wearing for 40 years and reduced the size of the container by half.</li>
            <li> I have one older</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find Max Factor in American stores anymore, so I was pleased to find it,finally, on line,but it is not the same size we used to get in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Now I use mainly for under-eye cover stick.  </li>
            <li> on the market at a halfway decent price.</li>
            <li> and I have been lucky enough to find it on Amazon for them.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have a company buy out the company that made my perfume after decades of me using it.</li>
            <li> from a older generation to now.</li>
            <li> Through the years I tried many other products, and ALWAYS went right back to Pan Stik-</li>
            <li> Per the manufacturer&#x27;s directions, I ordered the new True Beige #12, but it&#x27;s not the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pan Stik since 1986, when I was in high school.  </li>
            <li> This product has been around since I was in high school and before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Max Factor since high school.  </li>
            <li> I have never found any other makeup as easy to use as PanStik.</li>
            <li> I did notice when I received the order that the product contained a different amount than it used to and the product looked a little different, but I was so happy to receive my order.  </li>
            <li> After that I wasn&#x27;t able to find out who actually owns it, but although it is hard to get, it is still available.</li>
            <li> Light, not too pink.</li>
            <li> Hope it is the same as the old true beige 125 ..</li>
            <li> Plus the color did not match what I normally get</li>
            <li> the pic makes it look like what we are normally getting but not.....</li>
            <li> I found this stick useful in covering facial flaws!</li>
            <li> This make up is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t dark enough to replace the original True Beige as my summertime color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right brand &amp; it was also a lot smaller than I wanted.</li>
            <li> Max Factor is the only foundation that does right on my face.</li>
            <li> I had to order twice to get the right shade since the colors are named differently.</li>
            <li> So yeah, I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra to have my favorite foundation..</li>
            <li> It does however go on smoothly like the other I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li> This is a new mini size.</li>
            <li> This new packaging is about 1/2 the size of what it used to be.  </li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s new, huh.</li>
            <li> Since these will eventually be gone, I wanted to try the new Pan Stik while I had those two for comparison.</li>
            <li> In comparing my two originals to the new one, I disagree.</li>
            <li> It is much less creamy and doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to blend and seems like the Irish factory is using the same recipe as the old PanStik.</li>
            <li> When I compare it with the new Pan-Stik, they look and feel exactly the same.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvery small but color looks ok.</li>
            <li> Smaller ounces and a higher price come on this</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, just disappointed in size.</li>
            <li> It  is all natural  no Chemicals !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old to change!</li>
            <li> too small but the color was OK</li>
            <li> I ordered another item (different company, different product) much larger size and twice as many</li>
            <li> no one can guess how old I am!  </li>
            <li> It covers completely but also keeps away fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> If applied too heavily, both the old and new will settle into any fine lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried everything including mixing the true beige with other panstick colors from max factor.</li>
            <li> Not as creamy and  long lasting coverage as the original Max Factor made in USA</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in this and the 125 True Beige that was discontinued &amp; now costs a small fortune if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find it.</li>
            <li> Good product, just seems to be smaller than the previous and more expensive.  </li>
            <li> The texture gives less coverage than the original and</li>
            <li> Only wish it was just a little more creamy.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup - just so hard to get now - can&#x27;t somebody make it in the States</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered though it took nearly three weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Old company, still kickin&#x27; ..</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY, if you are accustomed to the OLD Max Factor.</li>
            <li> as I  have the old.  </li>
            <li> wow on or two uses will be out of it....</li>
            <li> Proctor and Gamble really should put it back on drugstore shelves.</li>
            <li> I had been using old Pan Stick color #121.  </li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and started using this product when I was 14..</li>
            <li> I wish it was sold in the larger tube without costing so much.</li>
            <li> and then I began using it as an adult.</li>
            <li> Naturally UV protectant has protected my skin before anybody even knew about UV.</li>
            <li> But its a very goog product and wish that darker color would be the same price.</li>
            <li> It is really getting scarce and will have to find a different product, but they are fighting it all the way.</li>
            <li> ive been using this since early 70s</li>
            <li> I gave this Max Factor a 4 star rating just because they are still selling some old product.</li>
            <li> Yes the package is about 1/2 the size fo the old sticks</li>
            <li> Better price than where I have been purchasing this product for the last few years</li>
            <li> Keeps color true and long lasting.</li>
            <li> but this is better than any other I&#x27;ve tried, including much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Marlene wanted Rich Beige and found out it was not available.</li>
            <li> Too tiny - I want my old Max factor back so much!  </li>
            <li> There are only two left now -- a Nude Ivory (my basic color) and a True Beige (my summertime color).</li>
            <li> Some customers here have said this isn&#x27;t the same formula as the older makeup.</li>
            <li> It is smaller for the same or a little more cost.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly and apply by warming it up with my fingertip on the stick, then dotting it on, and finally, using a slightly damp Takelon foundation brush, I smooth it out all over.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and what She wanted.  </li>
            <li> complaint is that it&#x27;s a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying.</li>
            <li> While I love this makeup and have used it every day for years it is now hard to find, and what I do find is a much smaller amount for twice the price.  </li>
            <li> The formula seems to be the same, but the new size is 9 grams.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be similar to the new pan stick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Color Comparison: The new colors are different, as others have said.</li>
            <li> The color match is about the same as the previous version, however, it is much more sheer than the former product.  </li>
            <li> Too light of a shade and really not what I expected.</li>
            <li> True to shade but a small tube than the old one.. Not sold in USA anymore</li>
            <li> On occasion, I have tried a different base that advertised how wonderful their product was.  </li>
            <li> There is no other make-up to compare.  </li>
            <li> Max Factor is my favorite brand of make up but this tube is very small compared to the others of the same brand.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this, it is a tough product to find.  </li>
            <li> It is really too small for that much money.</li>
            <li> Apparently this product works.  </li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t near the same size as the Pan Stik I have used since I was 16.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it is considerably smaller than I had bought in the stores before.  </li>
            <li> Much faster shipping than expected.</li>
            <li> We ordered this at 3 times what she normally paid, only to find out it is slightly smaller.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to try many American products last year</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and only order Pan stick in the new packaging, as makeup tends to have a shelflife of only one year.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the new Pan Stik is considerably smaller.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the new Pan Stik is considerably smaller.</li>
            <li> they were about half the size they used to be in the stores but at an even HIGHER price than before.</li>
            <li> Less product &#x3D; higher price &#x3D; :</li>
            <li> It is smaller than the original but not as small as a lipstick as some have stated.</li>
            <li> Tube is 1/2 the size of the original and is hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li> She absolutely refuses to use any other product.  </li>
            <li> or I would be applying to much makeup, but again not sure if that is normal or not.</li>
            <li> Creamy not dry.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find even on line lately but hope this gets better</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my skin has dried out significantly, so I can use  an oilier based makeup.</li>
            <li> A different pkg than I&#x27;m used to but still the same trusty foundation so hard to find worth the xtra money!</li>
            <li> very satisfied with max factor product, been using it for 20 yrs now, the only complaint I have is the smaller size it comes in now, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the previous size.</li>
            <li> I feel I paid way too much for half the product...</li>
            <li> but it is too dry on your sking and does not go on as well at the old Max Factor.</li>
            <li> Every other product tested from low end to high end has irritated my face.  </li>
            <li> Too much monet paid for the little makeup in it.</li>
            <li> At first I was able to find the original product on the internet, now it&#x27;s just crazy expensive, so I decided to try this out.  </li>
            <li> Since my complexion needs a little extra coverage, I have to use a very durable product.</li>
            <li> so I have no real complaint and the expected delivery time was given up front.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I find different is the size, smaller and does not last as long.  </li>
            <li> Historically I would never have purchased any makeup with the word &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; in the name, because I would assume it&#x27;d be too dark; however, in this case, the true beige has much less pink even though it&#x27;s similar in lightness.</li>
            <li> Price is a little to high.</li>
            <li> When it disappeared from store shelves I was really disappointed, it was so hard to believe that the perfect product could be discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Same product, half the size of the old version...</li>
            <li> Plus the makeup was much greasier than in the past.</li>
            <li> Too small, nothing like real max factor.</li>
            <li> Also, it took entirely too long to receive.</li>
            <li> The pan stick is a lot smaller than it used to be, but I found when blended with the traditional red reusable sponge, it takes very little for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> The amount in the tubes are much less than the old ones.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what it used to be to dry and much smaller</li>
            <li> The price is high and the quantity is small and will not last as long as Panstik has lasted up until now.</li>
            <li> The new packaging/colors don&#x27;t bother me, I used Nude Ivory in the past and compared the two, this shade is the same.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is only about half the size of the ones I used to buy in local stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s three times as much for less than half the product.</li>
            <li> it is a little small but worth it..</li>
            <li> To bad, I always said this makeup was kind to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I am sad that it is no longer available in the USA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I sound so grumpy, but you asked evaluate my experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it works for me, is available in a quality product (not old) and not ultra expensive.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find Panstik in such a small size..</li>
            <li> the shipping took to long.</li>
            <li> have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> lighter than expected, but the same quality as before</li>
            <li> Tiny very tiny people don&#x27;t waste your money, no bigger than a tube of lipstick.</li>
            <li> Product seemed to be old and dried out.</li>
            <li> Do not have to use a lot or re apply so lasts long time</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this product a long time.</li>
            <li> product smaller then expected, some problems occurred after purchase</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, I recomend removing your makeup after a few hours and always washing your face in the mornings.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Tiny size, about 1/2 of what was expected.</li>
            <li> Item was much smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> I come from a long line of Max Factor users...</li>
            <li> I was expecting what I usually get from max factor, but I was even more confused about the amount of time it took to get it.  </li>
            <li> The shade is off, but since I bought it, I will have to live with it because there is no more Pan Stik in my shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the other pan stick</li>
            <li> Much smaller and cost way to much.&lt;br /&gt;I will explore other products.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 40 years, and always come back to it after trying other make ups.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to get without paying a high price for the make up.</li>
            <li> This pan stick makes your skin dry.  </li>
            <li> But at least we can get it online at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having such a hard time finding this particular make up which is the only make up I&#x27;ve used to cover my birthmarks for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> This was unexpected, so I&#x27;m paying approximately the same price for a much smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> to small for price and not at all like the original very disappointed to greasy and not the true color like the old one was</li>
            <li> I am disappointed by the smaller size for more money.</li>
            <li> I had read in a previous review that the tubes are smaller now.  </li>
            <li> The package is half the size it used to be, and almost double the price.</li>
            <li> Late 40&#x27;s with dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I had oily skin and was unable to use this all the time because it was too oily for my complexion during certain seasons of the year.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, I wish it were a larger container&lt;br /&gt;Lorraine</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others but always went back to Max after one try!</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and you only need a few dabs on your face and then blend it</li>
            <li> The coverage is heavy enough but without being goopey, lighter coverage than Bobbi Brown&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Not the size I expected.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for about 30 years and have no sun skin damage and minimal wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It arrived way before it was expected and was just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> WAS EXTRA PALE IN CONNECTICUT -NOW</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for drag, the only downside is that its small...</li>
            <li> Like the original round tube!!!!!</li>
            <li> a little does go a long way with me.</li>
            <li> I am going back to this after trying a lot of new expensive products.  </li>
            <li> and I have never seen such a small tube before now.</li>
            <li> I did not know it came in such a small size.  </li>
            <li> so we let each other know where to find it</li>
            <li> My mom has used this for years due to a dermatologist leaving some scaring on her face from dermabrasion.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as remember using many years ago and was all I would use.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair/sensitive skin and have been using this product for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li> In past when I&#x27;ve bought same product it was twice the size.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the other one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all other and nothing compares to Max Factor.  </li>
            <li> it is just such a small amount.</li>
            <li> May be a little heavy to use as total face makeup, although I used to use it for makeup.  </li>
            <li> Was expecting full size tube but was disappointed to find trial size purchases at regular price.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this color, as I&#x27;d never worn Panstik in Beige, always wore NUDE IVORY, but this is nearly the same color, just a bit darker.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to put on and it has a dry feel.</li>
            <li> I order this for my grandmother who loves this product and is hard for her to find locally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to buy makeup online from a color swatch, because monitors show color differently.</li>
            <li> More money for a lot less product is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Certainly not worth the price charged.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Therefore, an average rating.</li>
            <li> There just isn&#x27;t another product that comes close to covering up under eye dark circles and blemishes, plus evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li> Only complaint:  </li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for a similar product only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered, there was no clear warning that the produce would be so small.</li>
            <li> I had a color 13 before but it was too dark for me</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because my friend at work suggested it to me one day while I was complaining about my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I hate most foundations for that reason: I can FEEL them on my face.</li>
            <li> If you apply a base before foundation to get a smooth look,  this is the make up for you !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stock piling these smaller new tubes as I&#x27;m afraid they will stop selling them all together.</li>
            <li> They have cut down the size but not the price.  </li>
            <li> ANYMORE DUE TO RADIATION TREATMENTS!</li>
            <li> A larger size usually cost no more than &amp;8.00.  </li>
            <li> It is also slightly oilier, which may be a problem in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Nude Ivory until it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I myself could not care less.</li>
            <li> Its about half the size.</li>
            <li> about a half ounce less than the U.S. product.</li>
            <li> They were about half the size that I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I knew that from a previous purchase.  </li>
            <li> Everything was fine, but I was disappointed that they have downsized the amount in each tube.</li>
            <li> I did not know they made such small small small pan cover ups...</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little Nouveau Beige to get the look I want.  </li>
            <li> little warming up.</li>
            <li> Is there a little darker Max Facter pan stick?  </li>
            <li> Since we lost it&#x27;s American market, it&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I think I just will stay with Drugstore.com on my make up needs and few others.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> AND ALSO THE TEXTURE WAS DIFFERENT NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> So, she thought she would try True Beige and was disappointed with the shade.</li>
            <li> Not available in US stores</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 35 years, broken in time only by those couple of years where it stopped being sold in the US</li>
            <li> One of the few that is a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; beige without reds.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy coverage</li>
            <li> It covers any unsightly marks without that heavy makeup look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;IS NOT AVAILABLE IN STORES THAT SELL MAKEUP.  </li>
            <li> WITHIN A FEW DAYS</li>
            <li> this was just as expensive as the previous product (if not more) and it&#x27;s 1/2 the size, complete rip off.  </li>
            <li> Tubes were half the size I had ordered in the past and the shipping charge was $35.00.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a slight shade difference, I was NOT prepared for the size of the small pan stick from Ireland.  </li>
            <li> BEEN LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR 30 YEARS :(</li>
            <li> The tube is just a little small for the price</li>
            <li> I have ordered it a few times over the past year</li>
            <li> Love this product hate that the price increases and the quantity decreased</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the size has been cut down so much</li>
            <li> I have used this for years Is a little hard to find</li>
            <li> However, the size of the panstick has drastically been down sized and the price went up!!  </li>
            <li> A little overpriced as hard to find items usually are.  </li>
            <li> The wife loves it - delivery is a little slow -</li>
            <li> A little thick.</li>
            <li> Hated that they stopped selling in the U.S. as the size on these is smaller that the older one</li>
            <li> Sorry that I can no longer find the product here locally.</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for the past 50 + years.  </li>
            <li> Made product so small.</li>
            <li> kinda bate and switch when no size and i never seen one this small..</li>
            <li> Much smaller, and wrong shade.</li>
            <li> it was a small amount for the price  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t sell no more in the United States in stores</li>
            <li> The stick is small (-1 star) even after reading the reviews I was expecting a small stick but not this small but</li>
            <li> I usually use Sun Tone</li>
            <li> I even have used the expensive make up such as Sephora and boing and didn&#x27;t cover them the way that I wanted them to.  </li>
            <li> And the tubes are extremely small.</li>
            <li> Small in size.  </li>
            <li> I am also disappointed that the new manufacturer cut the size down to these small tubes and raised the price.</li>
            <li> The container is small but this seems to be the common size now.</li>
            <li> and it seems hard to find anymore</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this item in stores</li>
            <li> but it was hard on the internet to choose the correct color for myself.  </li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding this product?  </li>
            <li> I have a birthmark that has been hard to cover until I found the Panstik Foundation.</li>
            <li> Hardly any wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Item is hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> At least it was the correct shade I ordered</li>
            <li> Here is what I wrote: \\&quot;A wonder cosmetic, one used for over 60 years, bites the dust ... at least in the USA ...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s affordable ... at least for now.    </li>
            <li> Disappointing that it is now in a smaller container</li>
            <li> Only disappointing thing is the size.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the same size as I&#x27;ve always gotten, so that was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not as thick and creamy, and the color is a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li> I had not ordered this product in quite a while and was quite disappointed when I received it as to the smaller size and it seemed less in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Too pricey for the small amount!  </li>
            <li> Very small in size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very small, like a gift with purchase.</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL</li>
            <li> over priced for size, will not order again, very disappointed, should have been informed that size was smaller than the last time I ordered</li>
            <li> Being on a fixed income now I was really disappointed, but I guess I don&#x27;t have a choice .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Very small almost like a sample but</li>
            <li> She commented to me that it was in a very small container</li>
            <li> That is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to find the color I previously ordered.</li>
            <li> is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I truly was disappointed with the size of this produce and also the very high price which I don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive</li>
            <li> or it turns a weird green.  </li>
            <li> Expecting a bigger size :( will be nicer</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed when I could no longer buy it at our local  Walmart or CVS</li>
            <li> The stick is way too expensive and it is too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed you can&#x27;t buy locally.</li>
            <li> I also tried department store cosmetics as well as custom makeups which created negative results!</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> What a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I either look like I&#x27;m tired and trying to cover it up</li>
            <li> She is not happy with anything else.</li>
            <li> Previous version is now VERY EXPENSIVE if you can find....</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles and nothing seams to cover them up.  </li>
            <li> almost every time I wear it.(I have been tempted to send Max Factor a &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; pic of myself showing the dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> When Max Factor passed away, the company went to his brother, who was convicted of multiple brutal rapes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s disappearing from the market place.</li>
            <li> If the price gets too expensive, I will not buy it, so I hope a factory is still rolling them out.    </li>
            <li> So sad.  </li>
            <li> ( Not happy!</li>

            <li> Max Factor.&lt;br /&gt;It is sad it ended with my daughter&#x27;s generation!</li>
            <li> Max Factor  has made me mad moving it&#x27;s products to the UK.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this foundation!</li>
            <li> I love this product....but it has gotten smaller, plus more expensive...the shipping took to long.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get the order but it was all good when finally received.</li>
            <li> Perfect foundation for me--creates a flawless finish.  Hope Amazon continues to make it available since it is no longer sold in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Been using max factor for years as I have a blood red stain birthmark on my face and panstik is the only makeup that covers the birthmark. Sorry that I can no longer find the product here locally.</li>
            <li> Would like to see &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color come back, but this is a usable sub.  Product is great.  have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, since in my teens.  Also, it does not affect my skin allergies.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have always love it because it covers well and can be used as a concealer or as complete coverage.  I was disappointed that the size has been cut down so much and it seems hard to find anymore but I was glad to find it here and I like it so much, I will find it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for the past 50 + years.  It&#x27;s color stays true and doesn&#x27;t change the color of blush when brushed on the cheeks.  I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s disappearing from the market place.</li>
            <li> Not as creamy as the original</li>
            <li> Disappointed  in size and price.  A larger size usually cost no more than &amp;8.00.  Not made in this country,but inIreland.</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor Pan Stick for over 30 years.  When I received this item&lt;br /&gt;it looks as though it is just a sample of the product.  Very small in size.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly not worth the price charged.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this make up before through Drugstore.com and recieved what I wanted but what Amazon sent me was baby sized and I paid more for it. Not happy I think I just will stay with Drugstore.com on my make up needs and few others.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> its a good foundation.I just thought true beige would be a lil darker.Other than that every thing is great with the product</li>
            <li> this was just as expensive as the previous product (if not more) and it&#x27;s 1/2 the size, complete rip off.  I will never use Max Factor anything again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best by far! This item has been my favorite for 25 years and I could only find it at a great price on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;And shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Have used Max Factor Panstik for over 10 years.  The coverage with the original was better than what is offered by&lt;br /&gt;the new version that comes from Ireland.  The texture gives less coverage than the original and the color shade is&lt;br /&gt;slightly different.  Even so, Max Factor Panstik is still the best option for me.</li>
            <li> Not the same formula as a few years ago very disapointed. Did not like the product. Although the shipping was fast, that was nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this make up. And it was received real quick.</li>
            <li> Love my Max Factor foundation.... It is perfect</li>
            <li> Too light....texture is different than Sun Tone!</li>
            <li> This makeup is fabulous! Great color and coverage!</li>
            <li> Expecting a bigger size :( will be nicer</li>
            <li> lighter than expected, but the same quality as before</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this.  I THOUGHT I ordered Nude - True Beige is too dark.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to find someone else to give it to.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it - delivery is a little slow -</li>
            <li> Tiny very tiny people don&#x27;t waste your money, no bigger than a tube of lipstick. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very small, like a gift with purchase. Not worth the price. Product is nice as usual, so no complaints about the quality. For that I gave it 5 stars. It says in the ad 3 ounces I did not pay attention.</li>
            <li> Long time user very  disappointed in product in both size and product.  Will not order again.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great to get this product again.  Just wish there was a variety of shades to choose from.</li>
            <li> I would much rather have a darker color.  I tried this shade since the shade I really wanted was so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the tube was so much smaller than I use to buy.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;But I am disappointed by the smaller size for more money.</li>
            <li> would rather have had full size at a reasonable price(#25) but&lt;br /&gt;this seems to be doing the job</li>
            <li> Happy to find the product and delivered fairly timely but much smaller in size than expected or hoped for!</li>
            <li> Glad to find Max Factor again. The color works well and it lasts without the need to constantly touch-up.</li>
            <li> Love this make-up! I have used it for years!!!</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this item in stores but I was thrilled to find Max Factor Pan Stik in my color but also to find it at such a great price thanks to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. A great shopping experience. I will definetly shop here again.</li>
            <li> Product seemed to be old and dried out.</li>
            <li> The order came so fast I didn&#x27;t think it could be this order.  Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent as it has always been.  However, the size is considerably smaller than I have ever purchased before.  The price is high and the quantity is small and will not last as long as Panstik has lasted up until now.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product, although it is a bit smaller than the original product.  I&#x27;m just happy to be able to find this product.</li>
            <li> Product is as described.  My wife really enjoys using this makeup.  Thank goodness it is still available, for the time being.  Fast shipping from across the pond.</li>
            <li> I truly was disappointed with the size of this produce and also the very high price which I don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 9 years faithfully. Nothing compares. It covers completely but also keeps away fine lines and dark circles. This is a miracle Cream.</li>
            <li> I have used this foundation for about 40 years and I have never seen such a small tube before now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pan Stik since 1986, when I was in high school.  Although I have really good skin, I have always appreciated the way that I could just dot it on my blemishes and blend it perfectly to my skin tone with no foundation.  Through the years I tried many other products, and ALWAYS went right back to Pan Stik- I have several tubes of barely-used concealer even now.  When it disappeared from store shelves I was really disappointed, it was so hard to believe that the perfect product could be discontinued.  At first I was able to find the original product on the internet, now it&#x27;s just crazy expensive, so I decided to try this out.  The reviews are correct in stating that it&#x27;s smaller (but mine always lasted for a year anyway, so it&#x27;s still plenty).  It is also slightly oilier, which may be a problem in the summer.  I still love the way it covers, and with translucent powder it looks great.  I purchased Nouveau Beige instead of True beige because I saw many reviews stating that the new True Beige color was much lighter tan before.  I like the color, but have ordered True Beige because the Nouveau Beige is more of a summer color for me,  I wish that the old product was available, but this is still much better than anything else I have tried, so I&#x27;ll continue to order it for sure.  I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years Is a little hard to find so I have tried others but nothing covers like MF</li>
            <li> great been using for year cover everything</li>
            <li> Very light, not acceptable. The size is very misleading. I would not order again</li>
            <li> What a great deal on exactly what I needed and free shipping from Dublin!  WOW!  Good Job...</li>
            <li> This is great makeup. Good cover. Creamy not dry. Perfect for me. Do not have to use a lot or re apply so lasts long time</li>
            <li> I love this item. Great coverage..Quick shipping. Dependable. I would love to get more for my money but doesnt everyone.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product and have been using it for many years</li>
            <li> I did this rating because I feel it is quite light for a true beige.  I would like a shade darker if I purchased again</li>
            <li> While I love this makeup and have used it every day for years it is now hard to find, and what I do find is a much smaller amount for twice the price.  Therefore, an average rating.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup!  Wish they had not changed the formulation.</li>
            <li> Foundation was great, I just thought it was too much for such a small container. Should have been more.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet, but it looks fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using Max Factor Panstik for many years.  On occasion, I have tried a different base that advertised how wonderful their product was.  I didn&#x27;t agree and went back to Max Factor.  I did notice when I received the order that the product contained a different amount than it used to and the product looked a little different, but I was so happy to receive my order.  I guess I will always be a Max Factor Panstik user.</li>
            <li> Great quality and will definitely will reorder</li>
            <li> Only wish it was just a little more creamy.</li>
            <li> I love Pan Stik. I used it for years and was so glad when I could get it on line!!</li>
            <li> my wife has been using this product for over 40 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having such a hard time finding this particular make up which is the only make up I&#x27;ve used to cover my birthmarks for the past 30 years. Since it&#x27;s nit sold in the US anymore, it is now sold for up to $70 for something I used to pay $7 just a couple of years ago. This seller had quantity and great price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered though it took nearly three weeks to arrive.  I miss Max Factor in U.S. stores like before.  Good coverage.  I had read in a previous review that the tubes are smaller now.  O.K. by me in terms of carrying one around in a purse.  At least it was the correct shade I ordered so I have no real complaint and the expected delivery time was given up front.  Old company, still kickin&#x27; ..</li>
            <li> True to shade but a small tube than the old one.. Not sold in USA anymore</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL FOR THE MONEY  I WAS DISSAPOINTED IN THE SIZE AND ALSO THE TEXTURE WAS DIFFERENT NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
            <li> I loved the Panstick when it was still in stores.. since then I&#x27;ve been looking for something similar.  I just found Maybeline now makes a shine free pan stick foundation almost similar to Max factor.  So far,  it works great.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Very expensive. Made product so small. Hope it is the same as the old true beige 125 ..</li>
            <li> This product is not what it used to be, he formula has been changed. The price is also outrageous. It&#x27;s three times as much for less than half the product. DO NOT BUY, if you are accustomed to the OLD Max Factor. I truly wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> I did not know it came in such a small size.  Beware before you order this is not the regular size but about 1/2 the amount at regular price though.  Very disappointed this was not pointed out in ad.</li>
            <li> Was expecting full size tube but was disappointed to find trial size purchases at regular price.  I will double check in future.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find it here anymore-saw this came from Ireland.  I have a sister-in-law and niece that wear it too so we let each other know where to find it</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the price for Max Factor Panstick, but when my order arrived, they were much smaller than the ones I buy here in the states.  Not such a good buy after all.  (It didn&#x27;t show ounces, so there&#x27;s no way I could have compared).</li>
            <li> Been using this makeup for years.Was really disappointed when I could no longer buy it at our local  Walmart or CVS</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop selling the Max Factor Panstik, especially at this fair price. I&#x27;ve used this product since I was sixteen, I&#x27;m 43 now. Cant find it in stores anymore so when I found it on Amazon I was very excited! I would hate to have to find another brand of make up to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. My mom has used this for years due to a dermatologist leaving some scaring on her face from dermabrasion. This is the only makeup that covers it and this is now the only place I can find it for her.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest foundation and has been for close to 50 years for me and more than that for my mother.</li>
            <li> Was expecting the pan stik to be the same size as the ones I&#x27;ve been getting for years, but it&#x27;s alot smaller.  Plus the color did not match what I normally get - it is lighter.  It does however go on smoothly like the other I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor since the 1950s when they had the pancake make-up. When they discontinued selling in the American market I was very disappointed. I was astounded at the prices on e-bay a couple of years ago when I bought several of the larger tubes. When I ran out recently I was again astonished to see the prices listed here in the U.S. I was glad to find a reasonable price in the UK even with the postage and the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;It covers minor skin flaws beautifully. I am frequently complimented on my smooth complexion at 88 years old.</li>
            <li> I have been  wearing this make up  for 25 years.  although the packaging is smaller, I  have gotten  the same  amount of use from  the smaller  container  as I  have the old.  the  coverage is  the  same,  the scent is different, but still nice. I am extremely happy I  can still get my true beige panstik....thank you ireland for manufacturing my favorite makeup of all time!!!</li>
            <li> I did not know they made such small small small pan cover ups...wow on or two uses will be out of it.... the pic makes it look like what we are normally getting but not.....still the right color and brand and fast shipping it seems to be 9g and not the .5 oz we have bought before from another place...if one thing they should state that is is a 9g .....i would not have bought it if so....kinda bate and switch when no size and i never seen one this small..</li>
            <li> This is my 5th time to order this product for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Mom, has been pleased all 5 times with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.  Customer from Amory, MS</li>
            <li> My mother and I swore by this foundation for years.She is now gone, but I  still remember this product fondly. We had to have it all times.  I have tried just about everything out there, nothing compares to pan stik. The coverage is great! It has &amp;#34;lastibility&amp;#34;. Application leaves me with minimumly soiled hands.  Ordering online is easy and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this panstik after they stopped selling it in Canada. The USA version was great. It covered so well. I adored it. This is not the USA version! This version is made in Ireland. It&#x27;s okay to use, but does not provide the same coverage. The color shades are different too. Also, the size is much smaller.</li>
            <li> Since the Max Factor company was sold, this product is made now in Ireland.  The color match is about the same as the previous version, however, it is much more sheer than the former product.  Panstik was always famous for being able to easily cover scars or blemishes.  This one doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s much more sheer.  I don&#x27;t find fault with the prevalent sheer products as such,, except that they work best on perfect skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the other pan stick but it does work well</li>
            <li> Now we get a sample size and it cost more?????&lt;br /&gt;What is that about??  I will have to find another makeup.  That is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Actually a little light in color, but it is ok with my powder.</li>
            <li> Have used Pan stick all my life (85 yrs.) and love it.. Modeled for Stephanie Koret in San Francisco many years ago..! and give beauty classes today to Red Hatters,clubwomen and privately when asked !!</li>
            <li> Marlene wanted Rich Beige and found out it was not available. So, she thought she would try True Beige and was disappointed with the shade. She would like to return it if possible or exchange it for something close to Rich Beige.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  One of the best cover ups I have ever used.  Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Happy we found u on line.  I, my daughter, and her daughter were mourning not being able to purchase in the states . Very happy!</li>
            <li> Love it, light weight blends in great with your skin tone</li>
            <li> Not as creamy and  long lasting coverage as the original Max Factor made in USA..of course, nothing is as good as the original..</li>
            <li> This is a new mini size. Very poor value.  My last order was from Drugstore .com and the package was still the standard size from years ago.</li>
            <li> I Love this Makeup. It&#x27;s been a Favorite of Mine for a long time.  It is a product that isn&#x27;t available  in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation I have every used. It is easy to apply, easy to blend and lasts all day! (if you apply your make up properly)</li>
            <li> Max Factor Pan Stik has been my favorite foundation since I was in high school. Over the years there have surely been formulation changes but the consistent coverage has been the key for me. It stays put in the highest humidity and is super easy to apply. It&#x27;s great for just light evening out of my skin tone or when I need full coverage for a blemish.</li>
            <li> Been using for years, dependable coverage</li>
            <li> On my blog I review beauty products. Here is what I wrote: \\&quot;A wonder cosmetic, one used for over 60 years, bites the dust ... at least in the USA ... And what a dumbfounding loss it is.\\&quot;    There just isn&#x27;t another product that comes close to covering up under eye dark circles and blemishes, plus evens out skin tone. The Pan-Stik is light, creamy and rich. It stays put until you wash it off, and equally important, it&#x27;s affordable ... at least for now.    Proctor and Gamble really should put it back on drugstore shelves. You don&#x27;t discontinue quality.    I just hope there is a factory in Ireland still making the Pan-Stik. Otherwise, the price will raise and eventually we won&#x27;t be able to get it at all. If the price gets too expensive, I will not buy it, so I hope a factory is still rolling them out.    Some customers here have said this isn&#x27;t the same formula as the older makeup. I have one older, 14 gram Pan-Stick left. When I compare it with the new Pan-Stik, they look and feel exactly the same. The formula seems to be the same, but the new size is 9 grams.</li>
            <li> Works great for those dark under-eye lines.</li>
            <li> Much smaller in size and amount. Did not cover skin flaws as we&#x27;ll. Disappointed as remember using many years ago and was all I would use.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that Max Factor stopped making what had been a perfect product in a perfect consistency, in a perfect color for my under eye circles.  I had been using old Pan Stick color #121.  Per the manufacturer&#x27;s directions, I ordered the new True Beige #12, but it&#x27;s not the same.  The consistency is not as thick and creamy, and the color is a bit lighter.  I am also disappointed that the new manufacturer cut the size down to these small tubes and raised the price.</li>
            <li> I am disapointed in i t and only used it once in a while because it was  too light. I used to buy this at the stores before it became impossible to find. I always used this color and am very unhappy with it.  It was so light that I gave it away to my niece.  Hopefully you can send me a sample of the next darker color for me to try.  If not, I will try a different company altogether.  I am using something else right now but was always happy with the Pan Stick by your company. Hope to hear from you. Thanks. Buggnana</li>
            <li> The Panstik use to be larger and CHEAPER.  It is really too small for that much money. But, the service and the time period from Amazon was excellent. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with pink tones.  This shade helps to neutralize the redness.  I previously used Nude Ivory until it was discontinued.  So sad.  This works for me but I still prefer Nude Ivory but True Beige is a good replacement.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love MaxFactor Panstik Foundation!!! True beige is a perfect match. Light, not too pink. Not made in the USA any longer, so like that I can order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> to small for price and not at all like the original very disappointed to greasy and not the true color like the old one was</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mom since we can&#x27;t find Max Factor products in the USA anymore! She bought 3 of them...they were about half the size they used to be in the stores but at an even HIGHER price than before. Less product &#x3D; higher price &#x3D; : ( Not happy!</li>
            <li> I hope I can still find it.  I have used this for many years and hope it is still available.</li>
            <li> Love the foundation but there is not very much in the container.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these concealers. the color and texture matches my skin type exactly. im pleased</li>
            <li> I love this makeup and have worn it for years. Since max factor is no longer sold in the United States I order it through you. Thank you for selling it through your site.</li>
            <li> yes , I love my pan stik....</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because she wanted it. I myself could not care less. She likes it so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Best makeup ever!!!!!  I have used this for 45 years.  They really messed up when they took it out of the United States.  Thank goodness for Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Not the same &amp;#34;max factor&amp;#34; I remember, didn&#x27;t really care for i much. Ended up tossing it soon after arrival.</li>
            <li> just much smaller than I remember using years ago.the color and the product itself works wonderful.will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> it is a little small but worth it..I am 66 years old and started using this product when I was 14.. it seems like almost everyone else did too :-) I use true beige no125.. it the same color as always..I don&#x27;t see any difference.. it is smaller,,thats why I gave it a 4 star.. but truthfully its worth it ,especially if you are like me and are happy with this product..</li>
            <li> The stick is way too expensive and it is too small. Would not recommend to anyone.  Its a rip off</li>
            <li> This is great foundation but it was hard on the internet to choose the correct color for myself.  I would have to have makeup I liked&lt;br /&gt;and then buy it on line to get the correct colors.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this. It&#x27;s a replacement for color beige 125 that has been discontinued. I am so happy that I could find a replacement color for her</li>
            <li> My mom and I are obsessed with this make up and are so sad it was discontinued in the United States.  But at least we can get it online at a decent price.  It covers amazing, I can swim in it and it lasts well.  I goes on so smooth and blends really well at the neck line.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I have noticed that if someone takes my picture with a flash, I look like a ghost with this make up on.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN SIZE AND COLOR OF MAX FAXTOR FOUNDATION.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE BEEN LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR 30 YEARS :(</li>
            <li> I used this product for 35 years,then they quit selling it in the store. I started purchasing MAX from drugstore on line. then they quit handling that, I looked on amazon.com and found the real thing. My only complaint is, I wish it were a larger container&lt;br /&gt;Lorraine Lewis</li>
            <li> I really like this product although it has shrunk in size. You pay more for less.  Aside from that one issue, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and always reorder.  Only complaint:  the package seems to be getting smaller!  But it&#x27;s a good product and should be available in the US.  I had to contact Max Factor to learn how to reorder.</li>
            <li> very happy wtth the product</li>
            <li> Shade too lite. Need Olive.  Didn&#x27;t bother to send back. I can use onefor cover stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may return  or trade for Olive shade.</li>
            <li> Too tiny - I want my old Max factor back so much!  Help?&lt;br /&gt;I was warned too.  You won&#x27;t be happy even if the product was the same I would have been okay but it isn&#x27;t!!  Very dissapointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find Max Factor in American stores anymore, so I was pleased to find it,finally, on line,but it is not the same size we used to get in the drugstore.  Its about half the size. I just hope it is the same quality.</li>
            <li> I order this for my grandmother who loves this product and is hard for her to find locally.  Will order for her again.</li>
            <li> My sister requested this as one of her Christmas gifts. She loves the product and it gives her skin a dewy, not greasy, look and she&#x27;s in her 50s! We can&#x27;t get it locally so THANK YOU AMAZON. She was very happy with that present.</li>
            <li> Great product , good price. good transaction. thank you.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this product a long time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this color, as I&#x27;d never worn Panstik in Beige, always wore NUDE IVORY, but this is nearly the same color, just a bit darker. Wish they would make the original NUDE IVORY again. But one reviewer said this was closest to NUDE IVORY and I agree. The size IS smaller than the original, but you have to take what you can get. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup. I wish it was sold in the larger tube without costing so much. I use to buy this at Kmart in the states.&lt;br /&gt;Donna</li>
            <li> Used to be my favorite foundation.  Now I use mainly for under-eye cover stick.  Been using it for many, many years and am disappointed I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.  So glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Good price!</li>
            <li> Awesome product wish they came in two for one price...</li>
            <li> Came way before estimated date very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation, great coverage! Good for all skins types!!! My only problem is this is more of a trial size, wish it would have been full size product........Like the original round tube!!!!!</li>
            <li> The only makeup my wife will use.  She absolutely refuses to use any other product.  She always looks so fresh and pretty.  My little cotton patch wife is a dandy and always wants to look her best.  Apparently this product works.  Wife happy.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT LIKE THE OLD PANSTIK!!!!!!!!!!!!! WANT THE OLDER KINDS!!!!!!!!!WHY DOES EVERY THING CHANGE??????????????????ANY WAY TO FIND THE OTHER KIND???</li>
            <li> A bit lighter than the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; pan stick shade, but certainly better than nothing!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Although I can no longer find it in Us stores, I got it online.  Was disappointed when I received this, it was a very small size.</li>
            <li> This make  up is wonderful.  The tube is just a little small for the price Maybe there will be a larger tube soon</li>
            <li> This product has been around since I was in high school and before.  It is a great cover up for skin imperfections, works like an &amp;#34;Erase&amp;#34; stick.  May be a little heavy to use as total face makeup, although I used to use it for makeup.  This new packaging is about 1/2 the size of what it used to be.  They have cut down the size but not the price.  It&#x27;s tiny, but still a great product and I will continue to use it.  Highly recommend, it really great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Have used it before it left the USA. Glad to have found it again. The amount in the tubes are much less than the old ones.</li>
            <li> My mom requested that I look for this item for her, and I was able to order it and have it sent directly to her. She used to use this back in the 1950s or so, and wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any local U.S. stores, so it was nice to get it this way.</li>
            <li> My wife used the PanStik for over 30 years.  It got to the point where she could not find it anymore, despite seeing online ads for it at WalMart.  We ordered this at 3 times what she normally paid, only to find out it is slightly smaller.  As it turns out, Max Factor no longer makes or markets this in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;As for THIS foundation, it is authentic...about a half ounce less than the U.S. product.</li>
            <li> over priced for size, will not order again, very disappointed, should have been informed that size was smaller than the last time I ordered</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original formula, which is what I was wanting. It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging and product is quite a bit smaller then when I remember in the 60&#x27;s, the quality I think, is the same. The cost has shot up quite a bit....but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Max Factor Panstik, its a shame no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> everything ok received  quickly</li>
            <li> Max factor come back ! The best makeup ever</li>
            <li> Best makeup in the world and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have used MF&#x27;s Panstik for years for blemish coverage as well as for my face.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> It is ok except the color is to dark for me</li>
            <li> So happy to find my MaxFactor Pan Stik again! I took a make up class at my modeling school when I was 18 and they turned me on to this stuff way back then, I just happened to google it and can&#x27;t believe I found it! The container is much smaller than I remember it being but it is the same stuff!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this again after using panstck for years, ino longer could find it in stores. I was told max factor went to europe and could no loner br purcahses inthe usa. What a joy when I discovered it in amazon, while they didn&#x27;t have the shade I had used I tried true beige and it is fine. Please let me know if this product will always be available?</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I wanted.  I have used it for years and did not think I would be able to purchase it because I have researched all local stores and it is not carried locally.  So happy I could purchase it on line.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted since they do not make the exact make up I use to use. This make up is nice and thick. It hides all my freckles just like the kind before. It leaves me without a oily face by the end of the day. Very Pleased!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite make up and wish it was still sold in the unided states. i have to order from u.k. my sister wears the same product and is just a pain to order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close--buy it&#x27;s mot really the original Max.  Color is a bit too light for a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; beige. Hope it can be improved on with time.</li>
            <li> I use to purchase #125, True Beige.  This last time I ordered #12, True Beige and it was much lighter.  I prefer the darker #125, but couldn&#x27;t find it to order.</li>
            <li> Only thing I find different is the size, smaller and does not last as long.  Thus, getting less amount for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> wrong shade I wanted 125 true beige, also it&#x27;s a smaller container then it used to be.....I gave them away.&lt;br /&gt;I was very, very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;  Virginia</li>
            <li> covers so good.  Skin looks smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Im used to using Kryolan Paint Stick</li>
            <li> Even though the ounces were stated I did not realize it was a mini version of the pan stick I was expecting. Therefore I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding this product?  I was so excited to find it on Amazon? I ordered 5 of them. I didn&#x27;t know they were not going to be the full regular size I have always bought.  They were about half the size that I was expecting.  I will not be purchasing from that vendor again!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 50 years.  I do wish it still had sunscreen protection.  It is a shame that we can&#x27;t buy it in the US.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and years. But this last order was not the&lt;br /&gt;same. It was lighter, but didn&#x27;t cover as well. Much smaller and cost way to much.&lt;br /&gt;I will explore other products. To bad, I always said this makeup was kind to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 62 and look 52.&lt;br /&gt;Terry Lynn Smithart</li>
            <li> I have a birthmark that has been hard to cover until I found the Panstik Foundation. The foundation is good, but it is only half the size&lt;br /&gt;that I used to get. Being on a fixed income now I was really disappointed, but I guess I don&#x27;t have a choice .I&#x27;m just thankful its&lt;br /&gt;still on the market at a halfway decent price.</li>
            <li> This product is very different from Max Factor Ultra Creamy Panstik.  It is much less creamy and doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  It also has a fragrance to which I am allergic.  I gave it to my daughter who wanted to give it a try.  Even though I will have to pay a lot more for the Ultra Creamy I will do so reluctantly until I find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> its beige not ivory even though I ordered ivory, but that&#x27;s ok, its greasy, good coverage, its alright</li>
            <li> My mother always used it when I was growing up and then I began using it as an adult. I am 54 and can fool people with my age because of Max Factor pan stick!</li>
            <li> Love this product hate that the price increases and the quantity decreased but it&#x27;s the best foundation I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair/sensitive skin and have been using this product for about 4 years now. It goes on smoothly, has great coverage, and lasts for the better part of the day. Does not cause break outs or irritation with continuous use. Love it and hope they continue making it!</li>
            <li> I have use panstick by max factor for years, I was very upset when I couldnot buy it any more... then I found it on amazon... lighter than my original true beige, but okay....</li>
            <li> Much smaller, and wrong shade.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than the ones I got last time but, other than that it was good. I&#x27;m just happy to find Max Factor Panstik</li>
            <li> I was surprised when received that they were not as big as used to be when I could buy them in stores,but just as good quality as before . I&#x27;m disappointed you can&#x27;t buy locally.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to find this product, so I got on Amazon, and, of course, they had it. The product got here faster than the original shipping date and I am already using it. I have used it for 40 years, and always come back to it after trying other make ups.</li>
            <li> This is a product wishing and wanting to be a Max Factor Pan Stik. Very greasy feeling and not the coverage level of the original pan stik.</li>
            <li> A very good make up that I have used for many years. I am sad that it is no longer available in the USA. &amp; that it comes in a smaller container &amp; costs more than before.</li>
            <li> This was a great concealer that lasted all day.  I also liked the smell.  I will re-purchase this.  When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ve even used this instead of my liquid foundation.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Max Factor is my favorite brand of make up but this tube is very small compared to the others of the same brand.</li>
            <li> It is no comparison to the original Pan Stik by Max Factor that was a great coverage makeup. And I was furious at the small size compared to the first one I ordered off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! Was delivered before expected and great price too!!</li>
            <li> was lighter in shade than what a true beige should be.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation I have ever used. Thank you for providing this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for years.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, and she just loved it! She said it was just like in the 90&#x27;s. She says there&#x27;s nothing that really compares to it.</li>
            <li> I love Max Factor makeup for the amazing coverage. So yeah, I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra to have my favorite foundation.. It is very small though, but if you use your fingers to apply it, it works wonders!!!</li>
            <li> vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvery small but color looks ok. just not like I use to buy at store it was 14g....so make them bigger</li>
            <li> Great makeup, the best in the world. I order 5 at a time. It&#x27;s wonderful makeup and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> it was a small amount for the price  Product is still good but it should be a bigger tube for the amount of money</li>
            <li> The Max Factor Panstick Foundation was much smaller that I had bought before. The makeup is great but the price isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with max factor product, been using it for 20 yrs now, the only complaint I have is the smaller size it comes in now, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the previous size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for yrs the only problem is they have downsized it 1/2 the size it used to be for about the same price.</li>
            <li> Product quality is the same only greatly reduced in quantity. I was pleased to finally find a break on the price. In some cases it has risen 100%!</li>
            <li> I just received my Panstick from Healthxpress Ireland. It is smaller than the original but not as small as a lipstick as some have stated. I&#x27;m just happy to have found it. I use other foundation and then the Panstick where I need more coverage so it will probably last awhile. The service was great, I had it in less than two weeks. I will definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered a shade darker, but I remedy that with a shade darker in my powder. Nice fragrance, will buy again.</li>
            <li> purchased this product for my sister, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Perfect color.  Easy and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> Same product, half the size of the old version... Money grab</li>
            <li> I found this stick useful in covering facial flaws!</li>
            <li> The shade is not the original True Beige shade.  It is much closer to Nude Ivory, which I used to use.  I mix it with a little Nouveau Beige to get the look I want.  You have to be creative!  Still beats the department store prices.</li>
            <li> A different pkg than I&#x27;m used to but still the same trusty foundation so hard to find worth the xtra money!</li>
            <li> I have worn Max Factor True Beige since I was 18 years old and I am now 58. I love it! I have tried a few others but always went back to Max after one try!</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup since I was 16. Now at 59. Hardly any wrinkles.  Love it</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Max Faxtor Panstick Foundation in True Beige for YEARS...I will not wear anything else, the product is that good!</li>
            <li> I like product have used for years. Price is a little to high. Item is hard to find so I was very happy see you carry product.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOvES THEM!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Too pricey for the small amount!  They used to be 3 or 4 times bigger for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lost since they stopped selling this product in the US. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 40 years and it&#x27;s the best foundation on earth. Naturally UV protectant has protected my skin before anybody even knew about UV. It stays on all day and you only need a few dabs on your face and then blend it will just a touch of moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been stock piling these smaller new tubes as I&#x27;m afraid they will stop selling them all together. True beige is a great color. I have light skin and it gives me just the right amount of color. Perfect coverage and works so well as your skin ages. These tubes are selling for $90 on ebay! I sure don&#x27;t mind paying $10.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and what She wanted.  ;o)</li>
            <li> Love the great coverage this product provides and happy with the prompt service from this seller!</li>
            <li> I remember the pan stik from &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34; and this is close, but much smaller.  I was still very happy to find it.</li>
            <li> product smaller then expected, some problems occurred after purchase</li>
            <li> I love this product. Even with the new container, still works just as great. Also I received my order like 3 weeks before the estimated scheduled time:)</li>
            <li> I was very happy to be able to find this product since no longer sold in retail non online stores ,the product is as good as I remember just sold as a much smaller size.</li>
            <li> Tubes were half the size I had ordered in the past and the shipping charge was $35.00. I feel I paid way too much for half the product...</li>
            <li> I was very sastified and I will order more that is my favorite make up but they don&#x27;t sell no more in the United States in stores</li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty happy with this makeup. The stick is small (-1 star) even after reading the reviews I was expecting a small stick but not this small but a little does go a long way with me. The makeup is greasy, very greasy to me (-1 star). I just so happened to pick the right color and if I was rating overall they would of lost another star for not having the images of the shades of the product but this review is to rate the product and not the seller. This is the first stick makeup I have ever used. I have to apply this in sections then take my fingers and rub it in everywhere else or I would be applying to much makeup, but again not sure if that is normal or not.</li>
            <li> There is no other make-up to compare.  It makes you look flawless.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought this twice now, I love this as a cover up.</li>
            <li> Love this product to use as a concealer, would like to see more colors available.  Not available in US stores</li>
            <li> It was alittle smaller then I thought it would be.I like the product itself.I need to order a shade or 2 darker next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this makeup for over a decade, nothing else compares and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it in the US from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup - just so hard to get now - can&#x27;t somebody make it in the States</li>
            <li> I purchased this products after many years of not seeing it on the market.  It had been decades since I had used it, but the moment that I smelled it, memories came flooding back to my youth.  It had the same lovey smell, and the quality is still there.  Max Factor Stik is still as good as it ever was.  If the color is too light for a foundation, just use it for concealer.  It goes on flawlessly, and stays on all day if you set if with powder.  I never want to be without it again.  You will always find this is my makeup case.  Once you try it, you&#x27;ll never want to be without it.  The smell is captivating.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love the color and texture of the make up.  It is no longer available in stores and I found this a good alternative to purchase the product that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Received the shipment as stated. Great customer service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like the make up And it is difficult to find. The container is small but this seems to be the common size now.</li>
            <li> Disappointing that it is now in a smaller container and I was unable to find the color I previously ordered.</li>
            <li> I hate it it&#x27;s not what it used to be to dry and much smaller it used to be creamy Will not buy again</li>
            <li> I was expecting that this color would cover my skin more darker.But its a very goog product and wish that darker color would be the same price.</li>
            <li> My daughters 48,28, and 19 all wear Max Factor Pan Stick. They have stopped making it and I have been lucky enough to find it on Amazon for them. It is really getting scarce and will have to find a different product, but they are fighting it all the way. I was lucky enough to have a company buy out the company that made my perfume after decades of me using it. So I can share how we women feel when we can no longer find the products that we have used for years.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just okay. It wasn&#x27;t the product I thought it was. It wasn&#x27;t the right brand &amp; it was also a lot smaller than I wanted.</li>
            <li> It makes me break out slightly if I wear it too long , but the coverage the MaxFactor pastick gives is great.  If you have sensitive skin like me, I recomend removing your makeup after a few hours and always washing your face in the mornings.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I love the product but stick was smaller than it used to be.  I still love it and would order again and again!</li>
            <li> Good product, just seems to be smaller than the previous and more expensive.  Previous version is now VERY EXPENSIVE if you can find....</li>
            <li> Good , coverage.  A little thick.</li>
            <li> Love Max Factor and it&#x27;s no longer sold in the United States.  I will buy this product whenever its available.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 35 years, broken in time only by those couple of years where it stopped being sold in the US and I had to find the source again....  It is clean and light in use, but provides good coverage.  It washes off easily and leaves your skin moist.  I appreciate having it available again.  The only thing is I am quite fair and to have the Truly Fair shade would be wonderful!</li>
            <li> Hello to my fellow consumers. I have been using max factor true beige 125 for thirty years. It was the best makeup/concealer I have ever purchased. I have fair skin and was undetectable when using it on my face. This product is not the same formular. The shade is different than the original. I have searched far and wide for a similar product only to be disappointed.  Every other product tested from low end to high end has irritated my face.  Does anyone know what I can do to get the same True beige 125 foundation. I tried everything including mixing the true beige with other panstick colors from max factor. I also tried department store cosmetics as well as custom makeups which created negative results! All I can say is please help!</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied because I have ordered this makeup for years now, and all of the sudden it&#x27;s at a higher price and a smaller unit of makeup. Smaller ounces and a higher price come on this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Exactly what she needs to make her as beautiful as Cleopatra. She is always seeking things to make her attractive and this stuff is just the ticket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for years.  I am used to it and I love it. It stays on nicely all day.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped in time.</li>
            <li> As close as I can get to the max factor plus</li>
            <li> Great product. Hard to find</li>
            <li> I have some very bad scars on my face, it is very hard to find ANYTHING to cover them. Panstick works very well. It is very hard to find, so I was happy to find it Amazon. It comes in smaller tubes, but worth every penny .Great coverage and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS GREAT, HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS. NOT IN STORES ANYMORE.&lt;br /&gt;WAS  LIGHTER THAN I WANTED,  SO  JUST  ORDERRED DARKER SHADE</li>
            <li> love it, used it for years.</li>
            <li> Max Factor pan stick is the best, the coverage is unsurpassed! Four Generations of women in my family have used Max Factor.&lt;br /&gt;It is sad it ended with my daughter&#x27;s generation! Yet, I am overjoyed I can order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have worn for years. One of the few that is a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; beige without reds. Hated that they stopped selling in the U.S. as the size on these is smaller that the older one but the product is unchanged. This is a heavy coverage so if you want light and dewy not your stuff. But if you want matte finish and all day coverage this will do it.</li>
            <li> I wish they made the bigger size they made years ago.</li>
            <li> Good coverage but gets smaller</li>
            <li> They were tiny! In past when I&#x27;ve bought same product it was twice the size. The product is awesome, just disappointed in size.</li>
            <li> Love Max Factor Panstik Foundation!</li>
            <li> Me: Late 40&#x27;s with dry, sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a fair/light in most foundations, and I can wear either cool or neutral shades. I&#x27;d say the True Beige is more yellow than pink undertones. This works fine for covering age spots and discoloration. I use it sparingly and apply by warming it up with my fingertip on the stick, then dotting it on, and finally, using a slightly damp Takelon foundation brush, I smooth it out all over. Applied like this, it&#x27;s not cakey or heavy-feeling at all. I hate most foundations for that reason: I can FEEL them on my face. Not this one. I&#x27;m not in LOVE with ANY foundation...but this is better than any other I&#x27;ve tried, including much more expensive ones. I wish this had an SPF, then it would be almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Best Make- up ever made !! It was made for Lucy Ball ( she needed a make-up so she would not get a sunburn in front of the bright lights while she was filming ) So they came up with True Beige Pan Stick. It  is all natural  no Chemicals ! I have been using it since 1971. Great Coverage Also !!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this makeup for many many years and love it!  It is getting harder to find even on line lately but hope this gets better and we don&#x27;t have to go to another makeup!  Will continue to buy as long as possible and the price is good.</li>
            <li> I did not like the color too light for me.  I usually use Sun Tone but it is hard to get without paying a high price for the make up.</li>
            <li> This item is too light in color, true beige should have been much darker, this is almost white</li>
            <li> Product must be old...was very dry and does not go on smooth nor stay on very long...had to mix it with a liquid foundation...disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 70 and have been using Max Factor panstik all my life.  It covers any unsightly marks without that heavy makeup look.  I love it (of course),  and would not know what to do without it.  PLEASE do not take it off the market! !  THANKS for this wonderful product !</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t near the same size as the Pan Stik I have used since I was 16.  I am 76. I&#x27;m too old to change! Anyway, once I learned that I could buy a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; True Beige warm 2  for $99 each, I was forced to I look for a replacement.  The closest one I could find was the what I ordered. I was prepared for a slight shade difference, I was NOT prepared for the size of the small pan stick from Ireland.  When I ordered, there was no clear warning that the produce would be so small. The shade is off, but since I bought it, I will have to live with it because there is no more Pan Stik in my shade. I&#x27;m sorry I sound so grumpy, but you asked evaluate my experience so I did. Have a good week.</li>
            <li> too small but the color was OK</li>
            <li> More money for a lot less product is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Too light of a shade and really not what I expected.Too much monet paid for the little makeup in it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on Bobbi Brown&#x27;s so I tried this. The coverage is heavy enough but without being goopey, lighter coverage than Bobbi Brown&#x27;s. Super easy to apply, love the portability of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying.</li>
            <li> Tubes are smaller then they use to be.</li>
            <li> Not the size I expected.  Compared to the one I have. Color ok?</li>
            <li> Since my complexion needs a little extra coverage, I have to use a very durable product. Max Factor&#x27;s Pan Stick does all of that for me so I can smile with confidence.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.. It takes the place of a foundation and a powder. It gives great coverage smoothly and lightly. It is a smaller package than what i got at the department store though</li>
            <li> I wanted much darker color but Med. Beige was only one offered so I prayed it would work..  Now I have 5 of them and cannot use them. (Also a smaller amt/container than origional product) Before Max Factor Panstick went off market, I used it for perhaps the last 4yrs. VERY DISAPPOINTED and don&#x27;t know what to do!</li>
            <li> This order came in good time, but I thought this was full size. Wasn&#x27;t.  I love this product and can not find Max Factor anywhere but online and even online it is becoming a problem.</li>
            <li> Product gets a 5 star because it is the best makeup on the Earth. Since we lost it&#x27;s American market, it&#x27;s very hard to find. Watch pricing tho. And be advised it is not the 14G size we&#x27;re all  used to buying. Now it&#x27;s 9G. That makes it about 1/3 smaller. True Beige is true to original (American) True Beige. I still have some of the American tubes and compared. This seller, RM Cosmetics, has one of the lowest prices and a fair shipping charge.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product it was smaller than I expected however it fits great in your purse on the go</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to my beloved Panstick after they discontinued selling the good stuff in the USA.  I thought it might be similar to the new pan stick.  Not even close. Don&#x27;t  bother. This pan stick makes your skin dry.  It doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the other one.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom because she was looking for it all over stores and pharmacies and couldn&#x27;t find it. I found it here and really made my moms day. Good product, fair price, happy mom.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with my order</li>
            <li> Very small almost like a sample but perfect color  perfect for what I needed</li>
            <li> WAS EXTRA PALE IN CONNECTICUT -NOW IN FLORIDA, OLIVE BETTER- CANT DO SUN ANYMORE DUE TO RADIATION TREATMENTS!</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for probably 30 years and will be devastated if it is ever discontinued.  I recommend especially for women who are outside often. Unlike sunscreen this makeup won&#x27;t melt off and protects without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it is considerably smaller than I had bought in the stores before.  Almost double the price, but much smaller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Works for my skin which is not overly oily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve taken my favorite make-up something that I&#x27;ve been buying and wearing for 40 years and reduced the size of the container by half. The make up still is good though.</li>
            <li> The package is half the size it used to be, and almost double the price. What a rip-off. But what&#x27;s new, huh.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as it reads, but I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the size and I was disappointed when it arrived.  It looks like a sample size and it was 15.00.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery! I ordered for my Grandma because she loves this make up! Only disappointing thing is the size. Hopefully they will offer the larger one for the same price as before.</li>
            <li> best makeup in the world... from a older generation to now. its great.. ive been using this since early 70s</li>
            <li> The product is very good. the shipping was very high.</li>
            <li> This makeup is the best.  I&#x27;ve tried all other and nothing compares to Max Factor.  I truly wish they would bring it back to the U.S.A.!!  Women ask me all the time what kind of makeup I use, they love the way it looks.  However, the size of the panstick has drastically been down sized and the price went up!!  Still, it is the best makeup for me.  Please bring it back to America so we can buy it locally!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I just lovr it!</li>
            <li> Love this make-up! Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and irs still the best.... I would never use anything else... i love it &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Items were smaller in ounces than I thought and didn&#x27;t want the color was too light for me. Returned items</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I was able to find a place where I could continue to purchase this product.  The only drawback is that it is only about half the size of the ones I used to buy in local stores.  This was unexpected, so I&#x27;m paying approximately the same price for a much smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation it is smooth going on and the coverage is good.</li>
            <li> Tiny size, about 1/2 of what was expected.</li>
            <li> Item was much smaller than expected.  It has been very difficult to find this product and I was quite excited to see it and the idea of (2) in the pkg. was great, that is, until I received it.  The price was good, however, based on the size of the two I feel I paid too much.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find Panstik in such a small size.. but I am so grateful to find Pan Stik at all and it is the same terrific product,  I was forced to try many American products last year but nothing compares, especially at this price...  Just hope I will be able to continue purchasing Pan Stik through Amazon.  This foundation covers flaws but stays dewey..and does not pronounce wrinkles and lines.  I have been wearing this makeup since I was 17..eons ago Lol!  I tried to order Pan Stik from a European web site that messed with my computer..Sheesh! I was about to beg friends traveling to the UK to ship me some.. So you know I am happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size.  I was expecting what I usually get from max factor, but I was even more confused about the amount of time it took to get it.  I ordered another item (different company, different product) much larger size and twice as many and it was shipped within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Thank you good product</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. It was priced right, shipped quickly, &amp; exactly what i wanted! I have already told my friends about it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer. I couldn&#x27;t find it in retail because company don&#x27;t sell anymore in USA. I had to order it on-line. I had a color 13 before but it was too dark for me so I decided to try color 12. It was ideal. Concealer by itself is very good quality and last very long because it&#x27;s pretty big. I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Used Panstik for many years rated it a 2 star now that its had to get and pricey, and cannot get my right color</li>
            <li> Much faster shipping than expected. Very pleased. Better price than where I have been purchasing this product for the last few years so I will be a repeat customer now!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it ! It goes on smooth, blends easily , and covers fine lines, pores, and blemishes with ease and STAYS ON all day . If you apply a base before foundation to get a smooth look,  this is the make up for you ! It will also hide scars . Love it !</li>
            <li> The size is basically a travel size Max Factor Pan Stick. The make up doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same quality it use to have. It seems greasy and splotchy. Also, it took entirely too long to receive.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale (family background on one side of the family is black-haired &amp; VERY white-skinned Irish/Scottish/English), and as I have gotten a little older any incidental sun exposure hasn&#x27;t changed my tone much (mostly tried to avoid!); therefore, I ordered several tubes of both Fair and True Beige.  I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would be better. After using both, I have come to the conclusion that True Beige is much better shade for me.  Historically I would never have purchased any makeup with the word &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; in the name, because I would assume it&#x27;d be too dark; however, in this case, the true beige has much less pink even though it&#x27;s similar in lightness. It&#x27;s easy to blend and seems like the Irish factory is using the same recipe as the old PanStik. Even though the size is considerably smaller, I&#x27;d keep purchasing this indefinitely.  I have never found any other makeup as easy to use as PanStik. As for the &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; tubes I bought, they are still easy to blend, and I&#x27;ll still use them. This is just a fantastic product, and I don&#x27;t know what Max Factor was thinking taking this off the U.S. market.  I appreciate Max Factor UK for still manufacturing it, and Amazon for still selling it.</li>
            <li> Max Factor is the only foundation that does right on my face. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to order it but I do so Amazon is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I just received it so haven&#x27;t used it I&#x27;ll keep you up to date and see how&#x27;s it turns out</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have really bad dark circles and nothing seams to cover them up.  I either look like I&#x27;m tired and trying to cover it up or it turns a weird green.  I even have used the expensive make up such as Sephora and boing and didn&#x27;t cover them the way that I wanted them to.  I ordered this product because my friend at work suggested it to me one day while I was complaining about my dark circles.  Maxfactor Pan stick gives me the flawless look every girl wants.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a make up that was as close to sweat proof as I could get. I love this stuff. I use it all the time not just summer anymore!</li>
            <li> I realize Max Factor is no longer producing/selling cosmetics here in the United States and was excited when I found I could buy this on Amazon I&#x27;m assuming supplied from the Canadian or European manufacturer. I read a TON of reviews to make sure I was ordering the right shade since the old shades are no longer sold and ordered the two I thought would work for me. Neither did. Plus the makeup was much greasier than in the past. And the tubes are extremely small.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist and hair designer, I love the smooth full coverage of the Pan Stick. I have used it for years. For those who don&#x27;t know, I researched the reason for the product all but disappearing from the U.S. market. When Max Factor passed away, the company went to his brother, who was convicted of multiple brutal rapes. Most of the profits from the company went towards his legal team and also restitution for the victims. After that I wasn&#x27;t able to find out who actually owns it, but although it is hard to get, it is still available. The pan stick is a lot smaller than it used to be, but I found when blended with the traditional red reusable sponge, it takes very little for complete coverage.If you are looking for something for photo shoots or TV, I recommend Kryolan Grease Paintsticks, which are reasonably priced for the products, and again, full coverage. I gave this Max Factor a 4 star rating just because they are still selling some old product. Do yourself a favor and only order Pan stick in the new packaging, as makeup tends to have a shelflife of only one year.</li>
            <li> I have used max factor pan stik for 30+ years and I haven&#x27;t found another makeup that I liked better,you can no longer buy it in any store in my area.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MAKEUP FOUNDATIONS I HAVE EVER USED.&lt;br /&gt;IT GIVES A FLAWLESS COVERAGE.  IT IS A SHAME THAT MAX FACTOR&lt;br /&gt;IS NOT AVAILABLE IN STORES THAT SELL MAKEUP.  I RECEIVED THE&lt;br /&gt;MAKEUP WITHIN A FEW DAYS THAT I BOUGHT IT FROM THE SELLER.&lt;br /&gt;I VERY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> these are mini&#x27;s...I missed that when ordering.  Not such a great deal after all.</li>
            <li> I have worn Max Factor Panstick for years and think it is the best foundation every made. It covers beautifully and goes on so easily and blends so nice.  Was upset that the product is no longer sold in the U.S. so I was so happy to find it on line for a reasonable  price.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  Have used this product n shade for over 45yr</li>
            <li> I ordered ultra creamy and sent this formula. Won&#x60;t order it again.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this make up.  Unfortunately it is about 1/2 the size it was..almost the size of a tube of lipstick, and costs more.  But......since Max Factor cannot be found in my hometown, I have to&amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; for this.</li>
            <li> Make-up is no longer as creamy as the original. Colors are lighter than the original makeup. Tube is 1/2 the size of the original and is hard to hold on to. It&#x27;s a shame someone thought they had to improve this product. It&#x27;s been a winning product since the 1960&#x27;s that I can vouch for. Please bring back the original formula and colors.</li>
            <li> My wife used Max Factor True Beige 125 for over 10 years, and when she wasn&#x27;t able to get it in stores, I turned to Amazon to find a replacement for her, which turned out to be True Beige 12.  I have ordered it a few times over the past year and she is completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I compared original Pan Stik with the new Pan Stik made in Ireland and found the products to be so similar that I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more. When I heard the original Pan Stik was being discontinued, I stocked up on my two favorite shades. I&#x27;ve never found another makeup I like as much and didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. I&#x27;ve kept the stash in the refrigerator and they&#x27;ve remained just as fresh as when I bought them. There are only two left now -- a Nude Ivory (my basic color) and a True Beige (my summertime color). Since these will eventually be gone, I wanted to try the new Pan Stik while I had those two for comparison. Here&#x27;s what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color Comparison: The new colors are different, as others have said. It&#x27;s hard to buy makeup online from a color swatch, because monitors show color differently. It may help someone to know that the new True Beige is lighter than the original. It isn&#x27;t as light as Nude Ivory, but falls somewhere between the original Nude Ivory and the original True Beige. Like the original, the new True Beige is in the ivory/warm spectrum. It doesn&#x27;t have any pink/cool undertones. I found I can use it instead of the original Nude Ivory. It isn&#x27;t dark enough to replace the original True Beige as my summertime color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight and Feel: One review I read said the new Pan Stik is greasier than the original. In comparing my two originals to the new one, I disagree. The new Pan Stik feels just like the original on my skin. If applied too heavily, both the old and new will settle into any fine lines around your eyes. Blending well eliminates that problem.  Pan Stik has always been indicated to be for normal to dry skin; I have oily skin and still love it. It is creamy, smooth, and luxurious feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: Pan Stik provides smooth, flawless coverage. Someone with good skin needs very little to achieve the look of perfection. Someone who needs extra coverage for spots or blemishes can blend and layer and achieve excellent coverage (just like the original). Pan Stik should be applied with the fingertips to warm the product and help it to blend easily. I always do extra blending around my hairline with a sponge. The finish is matte and doesn&#x27;t need powder to set it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  The new Pan Stik did not include ingredients with the product, but the list is available on the Max Factor website. It&#x27;s different from the list of ingredients on the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  Obviously, the new Pan Stik is considerably smaller. The price per ounce is more comparable to that of a department store makeup now. Of course I&#x27;d prefer the larger size and lower price, but being able to continue using my favorite makeup is worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the new Pan Stik. Pricier -- yes. But the beautiful, flawless-looking coverage is worth it. I&#x27;ve been using Pan Stik since I was 19, and I&#x27;m 69 now. Pan Stik has kept my skin looking great for 50 years. I&#x27;m really, really happy to be able to continue getting the same great results with this new product. I&#x27;ll be shopping for that summertime shade soon.excellent coverage (just like the original). Pan Stik should be applied with the fingertips to warm the product and help it to blend easily.

            <li> The size of each tube is considerably smaller than when I ordered the foundation the last time, but the price remained the same..</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife and she loved it. She commented to me that it was in a very small container but she did love it.</li>
            <li> While I was very excited to locate one of my favorite products, I was very surprised at the small size. For the price I was expecting a full size product..</li>
            <li> Best place on the Internet to buy. Ty been using 48 yrs</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor all my life.  I was very upset when I found out I couldn&#x27;t get my 125 True Beige in the stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 4 of these and they are smaller than the original ones but in all honesty I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The 12 True Beige is the same as my 125 True Beige there is no difference at all.  I Love It!  Great Price Too!  😀</li>
            <li> Love this product, great full coverage make up.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I come from a long line of Max Factor users... got hooked from playing in my Grandmas make up bag!  I love how it covers the acne and redness on my cheeks.  And  lasts all day!  I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable in stores that lasts as long, goes on as smoothly, matches my skin so good or covers as great as Max Factor.  The new packaging/colors don&#x27;t bother me, I used Nude Ivory in the past and compared the two, this shade is the same.  The product seems very similar, maybe a tad less oily (great).  Yes the package is about 1/2 the size fo the old sticks but I&#x27;m willing to pay a bit more for such a great product.  Also, if you compare similar products gram for gram its still a good deal.  Thanks for making this available Amazon!</li>
            <li> A little overpriced as hard to find items usually are.  Item exactly as described.  Good quality &amp; prompt shipping,</li>
            <li> I love Max Factor Panstik # 12.  I have used it for about 30 years and have no sun skin damage and minimal wrinkles.  I am daily complemented on my  facial skin from friends and my Dermatologists. Problem?  too expensive.</li>
            <li> I used this off and on for many years. When I was younger I had oily skin and was unable to use this all the time because it was too oily for my complexion during certain seasons of the year. As I&#x27;ve aged my skin has dried out significantly, so I can use  an oilier based makeup. Plus I need more coverage than most makeups provide. So I was extremely happy to find this makeup available on Amazon. In the past, I used Nude Ivory but find the current True Beige is a perfect match now. I use a damp blender sponge to stipple on this makeup. I can build up or buff out with the blender sponge to get a perfect coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to the price, all makeup has gone up greatly in price and/or reduced the size of products in the last decade--so has Max Factor. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it works for me, is available in a quality product (not old) and not ultra expensive.</li>
            <li> I am going back to this after trying a lot of new expensive products.  I apply it with a damp sponge and there is nothing better for me.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application. Very low odor. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> You kept your promise.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years and I love it.  The only difference is that the container is smaller than it used to be but; otherwise, it is still a great product.</li>
            <li> I had not ordered this product in quite a while and was quite disappointed when I received it as to the smaller size and it seemed less in the tube.  I remembered a larger tube when I ordered before but I still like the product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I used Max Factor&#x27;s Panstik  starting in my teens.  So glad it&#x27;s still available; same quality and coverage.  Plus, it&#x27;s made in Ireland!  Very good price and service.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works fine.</li>
            <li> It was actually lighter than the Ivory Bisque which doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product, and makes me reorder it when ever she needs more. She is not happy with anything else.</li>
            <li> Expensive..the last one l bought was twice the size for a quarter the price....! however ..l have used this product for over 58 years...</li>
            <li> Too small, nothing like real max factor. Sorry I bought it</li>
            <li> The color of this Max  Factor Panstik is  lighter than the original was.  I knew that from a previous purchase.  I still bought this because&lt;br /&gt;I discovered it was good for a good cover-up foundation to use under my favorite makeup, and that is what I use it for as the color needs&lt;br /&gt;a little warming up.</li>
            <li> I was in shock when I opened this. It is slightly larger than a tube of lipstick and the price was doubled from the original price. It is not worth the money, although I have always loved this makeup.I could not believe it when Max Factor quit selling it in the stores. It is like everything else in the world now...all about money. Customer loyalty means nothing anymore..Shame on them!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and am sorry it is not sold in the US any more.  This order came from England and arrived promptly from England.  No problems at all with the order.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for drag, the only downside is that its small... I just didn&#x27;t pay attention when it came to that haha. Great product, great coverage. I would buy again, but maybe a bigger size if they have them.</li>
            <li> The products were what I use, but they were much smaller than what I&#x27;ve bought in the States.  These came from England.  They were quite expensive for the size they are.  I thought I was getting the same size as I&#x27;ve always gotten, so that was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I like it... they changed the package size.  It is smaller for the same or a little more cost.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this, it is a tough product to find.  This makeup offers great coverage. I like it for lip base coverage under lipstick.  Keeps color true and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This Panstik is not like it used to be. It is not easy to put on and it has a dry feel. I was hoping it was like I used years ago.</li>
            <li> just love it very much,I have used it for a very long time, nothing even comes close I NEED to order more soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Max Factor for years and I love it!</li>
            <li> Max Factor  has made me mad moving it&#x27;s products to the UK.  I like the  way this cvers flaws.</li>
            <li> Small in size.  I like the 101 Natural better.  Always used the 101, If you can get it for me I would like that.  Terri Z</li>
            <li> Not the same coverage as the original 125 true beige, but works for light coverage.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 30 years and I am so happy I can still find it here.they stopped selling it in the US💋</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is not so easy to find.  It goes on easily and spreads nicely.  It covers blemishes and spots well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Max Factor since high school.  I graduated in 1962.  I started using the pan stick in my 20&#x27;s and at 71 people still comment on my &#x27;beautiful skin&#x27; and no one can guess how old I am!  Without pan stick it&#x27;s not as great!  Thanks Max Factor.  Keep it coming.</li>
            <li> It blends well on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I&#x27;m very happy since it doesn&#x27;t give me black heads that causes my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, but I was disappointed that they have downsized the amount in each tube. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This makeup is okay but it is too dry on your sking and does not go on as well at the old Max Factor. I thought I was getting the same color I use to use before the company move out of the US but this one is lighter. But it stays on good.</li>
            <li> Makeup good but it is a trial size  so price is too high.thats why not 5 star</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s the only makeup I like!</li>
            <li> I love this product!I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 25 years.I get compliments from total strangers on my skin almost every time I wear it.(I have been tempted to send Max Factor a &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; pic of myself showing the dramatic difference. I am 56 and have very fair skin AND rosacea. Getting compliments on my skin shows what a wonderful product it is!)&lt;br /&gt;I was quite upset when they stopped selling it in the U.S.!Finding out I could get in online from Europe made me very happy. I had to order twice to get the right shade since the colors are named differently. I used Nude ivory for years. I found that the True Beige is basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. It arrived way before it was expected and was just what I ordered. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 30 or 40 years.  I love it.  It conceals everything. Try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> The product is good it is just such a small amount.</li>
            <li> All i can say. This is the only make-up my wife will wear.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in this and the 125 True Beige that was discontinued &amp; now costs a small fortune if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find it. The only issue I had was the smaller size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Very satisfied and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> The Max factor is nice and creamy and maybe a little lighter than what I used before but, it certainly is making me happy. I love it as I am 76 years old and need all the help I can get.  Is there a little darker Max Facter pan stick?  Regards, Willa Porter</li>
