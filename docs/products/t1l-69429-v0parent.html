            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a great complexion but</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>I loved the Weleda Iris Cleansing Milk.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing (herbal and bright, not flowery) and does the job without being drying or greasy.</li>
            <li>I love using it!</li>
            <li>I love the scent too!</li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser!  Smells wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li>Weleda is a brand you can trust -and one that I love!</li>
            <li>this cleanser is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Excellent gentle night cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have used many Weleda products and they are all top notch!</li>
            <li>Very gentle yet cleanses beautifully.  </li>
            <li>fabulous smell that makes me feel good the moment I put it on my skin</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be too gentle for my skin, but it&#x27;s really great stuff.</li>
            <li>and my face has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>It smells better</li>
            <li>My skin responded better to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite from Weleda.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been a bit wacky...</li>
            <li>This cleansing milk is the most gentle cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, great for mornings.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, but not the way the Iris one did.</li>
            <li>I love the toner but not this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>you feel softer, smoother, and even more</li>
            <li>it was an unrequited love.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and a good value over the cosmetic counter products.</li>
            <li>Cleansing milk is healthier and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up on ever having beautiful skin without the help of makeup.</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite attractive (I love blue bottles), but I am terrified I&#x27;ll drop it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product smells good and all natural</li>
            <li>Easily removes make up without drying.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to clean ok without overdrying.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a light refreshing cleanser with a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>it only takes a bit, and is great at removing makeup</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up, it goes on smooth and you almost feel like it&#x27;s not cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that this would be good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if my skin&#x27;s any better for having used it, but it feels great, a bit like spreading a smoothie on your face, and it smells good (Faint lavender/floral odor.).</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a great German cosmetics company that does NOT have alcohol in their top 5 or top 10 list of ingredients for facial products and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has really sensitive skin, she uses it without any problems and her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I grabbed the cleansing milk, the refining toner, the wild rose eye cream, and wild rose face lotion (which was labeled for normal/combo skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started to use this face wash because my tried and true Neutrogena face wash was stripping my skin of all</li>
            <li>This face wash leaves my face feeling &amp;#34;elastic&amp;#34; and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion for cleaning off my sensitive dry-normal face.</li>
            <li>(More oily than the old bottle we were finishing up.)</li>
            <li>The 2 n 1 cleanser and toner is the one that doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off, but I suggest rinsing off all the products because the moisturizers are plenty if you choose the right one for your skin type.</li>

            <li>I was looking for an alternative because Hauschka can get very very pricey.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a change in my skin within the first week of using Weleda.</li>
            <li>You have to use the almond oil or the 2 in 1 cleanser toner to remove the makeup first, then use the cleansing milk to wash.</li>
            <li>I use the 2 n 1 toner to remove makeup first, or just some makeup remover wipes from Alcone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve been embarrassed by zits.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it with a facial sponge to wipe out my makeup.</li>
            <li>(and yes it helps my skin to be soft as well as clean</li>
            <li>My rosacea has cleared up tremendously, I rarely break out, my skin is super soft, and I don&#x27;t have as much excess oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li>its the only thing i use to clean my face and its bomb  makes you soft clean  heaven in a blttle</li>
            <li>body products are amazing too and next on my list of ordering as I only got samples of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>body products are amazing too and next on my list of ordering as I only got samples of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well, one day I was in Whole Foods and a woman was there offering up samples of Weleda products, I took the samples, but I figured hey why not just try the whole line anyway.</li>
            <li>really wanted to make this work since it has a lotion texture and the modus operandi</li>
            <li>But then, I don&#x27;t use much make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used so many other products and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, that is also very oily and acne prone and has rosacea on my cheeks!</li>
            <li>My pores are dramatically smaller and my face is softer and actually feels more relaxed when I use it.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep your natural skin moisture as promised.</li>
            <li>These products work with the natural rythm of your skins CRF ( cell renewal factor ), and are not abrassive ;they will not strip your skin of its natural oils , and will work in conjunction with your acid mantle in providing the ultimate protection from free radicals .</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>normally glycerin based cleansers, and suddenly my normal regime stopped working, but this is the first new product in a long time that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I do not like the fragrance, but I can live with it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it not only didn&#x27;t remove my light foundation powder, but also left my skin feeling like it was burning, and I had to wash my face again with another product to wash it off and stop the burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, beware!</li>
            <li>The scent, though pleasant, is very weak.</li>
            <li>Your skin sometimes needs to adjust to new products and may act crazy at first, but you will notice how much better it looks!</li>
            <li>Please try them, your skin will thank you for using these natural products withing a week .</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Then it felt like it never rinsed completely off.  </li>
            <li>I do not spend much $ on beauty products and consider myself very low maintenance, but this is one product I have to have.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the most recent one we bought, smelled somewhat more oily than we expected.</li>
            <li>I am ordering my next bottle now because I have a feeling I am going to think it&#x27;s full one day and find it empty</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s full one day and find it empty so big fat con there.</li>
            <li>Your skin sometimes needs to adjust to new products and may act crazy at first, but you will notice how much better</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing is that its such a gentle wash, that sometimes I feel it doesn&#x27;t get all of my make-up off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels like putting a lotion on at first, you will probably feel crazy doing it to your face, but after the first day I didn&#x27;t break out, so I kept forward 2x a day using the whole routine, and I stopped using makeup for a week to fully test out the products</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils after washing; leaving my face feeling very dry.</li>
            <li>It is very runny and a little greasy.  </li>

            <li> might be preaching to the choir, but...alcohol is extremely drying to the skin, it completely counteracts any other moisturizers</li>
            <li> recommend you trying the full line, following the directions for use properly, and give it at least 30 days before giving up!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used all natural skin products on my skin for the past 10 years...</li>
            <li> I usually cleanse twice when I use this product and my skin is soft and glowing after.</li>
            <li> only cons about this product is the heavy glass bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was told to only use a few drops, but no I need at least the size of a nickel to wash my face, and this definitely DOES need to be rinsed off your face.</li>

            <li> have noticed that Weleda is switching to plastic bottle for some of the other</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little greasy after.  </li>
            <li> The smell seemed to diminish after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> It totally dried out my face and clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of make-up, but this takes it all off along with the usual grit, etc. of living in a city.</li>
            <li> Not really sure why.</li>
            <li> --feels like you put thick body lotion on your face if you don&#x27;t rinse it.</li>
            <li> At this point I discovered the cleansing milk is not good for removing makeup.</li>

            <li> I thought it was going to be too gentle for my skin, but it&#x27;s really great stuff. I&#x27;ve used all natural skin products on my skin for the past 10 years...normally glycerin based cleansers, and suddenly my normal regime stopped working, but this is the first new product in a long time that really works for me. I&#x27;m a big fan. Really helps keep your natural skin moisture as promised.</li>
            <li> Hello,  I have to say , Weleda carries the best products at an affordable price !!! Please try them, your skin will thank you for using these natural products withing a week . I noticed a change in my skin within the first week of using Weleda. I am never changing my skin care products again . These products work with the natural rythm of your skins CRF ( cell renewal factor ), and are not abrassive ;they will not strip your skin of its natural oils , and will work in conjunction with your acid mantle in providing the ultimate protection from free radicals . I will never leave Weleda!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my face has never looked better.  Very gentle yet cleanses beautifully.  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash after using Dr. Hauschka for a year.  I was looking for an alternative because Hauschka can get very very pricey.  I&#x27;m so happy with Weleda that I won&#x27;t go back!&lt;br /&gt;a) It&#x27;s cheaper&lt;br /&gt;b) It smells better (Hauschka has a bit of a yeasty smell to me.)&lt;br /&gt;c) My skin responded better to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cleansing milk is creamy and emollient, without being greasy, like some milks.  I love using it!</li>
            <li> this cleanser is amazing.  it only takes a bit, and is great at removing makeup</li>
            <li> fabulous smell that makes me feel good the moment I put it on my skin (and yes it helps my skin to be soft as well as clean</li>
            <li> Simply love it!!! My favorite from Weleda. Ex-user of all the expensive lines like La Prarie, Sisley, Lancom, Shu Uemura, Shiseido, etc...</li>
            <li> its the only thing i use to clean my face and its bomb  makes you soft clean  heaven in a blttle</li>
            <li> My skin has always been a bit wacky... I have sensitive skin, that is also very oily and acne prone and has rosacea on my cheeks! So I have a ton of conditions I need to watch out for. I pretty much gave up on ever having beautiful skin without the help of makeup. Well, one day I was in Whole Foods and a woman was there offering up samples of Weleda products, I took the samples, but I figured hey why not just try the whole line anyway. I grabbed the cleansing milk, the refining toner, the wild rose eye cream, and wild rose face lotion (which was labeled for normal/combo skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first use I pretty skeptical of this stuff... it contained lots of oils in it and felt slightly greasy, but I decide to go forward anyway even though I was insanely terrified of putting it on my oily skin. (OCM did NOT work out well for me) At this point I discovered the cleansing milk is not good for removing makeup. You have to use the almond oil or the 2 in 1 cleanser toner to remove the makeup first, then use the cleansing milk to wash. I use the 2 n 1 toner to remove makeup first, or just some makeup remover wipes from Alcone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like putting a lotion on at first, you will probably feel crazy doing it to your face, but after the first day I didn&#x27;t break out, so I kept forward 2x a day using the whole routine, and I stopped using makeup for a week to fully test out the products only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost a month and I am hooked. My rosacea has cleared up tremendously, I rarely break out, my skin is super soft, and I don&#x27;t have as much excess oil throughout the day. I just ordered my second bottle of cleansing milk from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper here by a dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only cons about this product is the heavy glass bottle it comes in. I am so scared of breaking it, but I did drop it once and it didn&#x27;t break. It sucks because you can&#x27;t see how much product is left inside. I am ordering my next bottle now because I have a feeling I am going to think it&#x27;s full one day and find it empty so big fat con there. I was told to only use a few drops, but no I need at least the size of a nickel to wash my face, and this definitely DOES need to be rinsed off your face. The 2 n 1 cleanser and toner is the one that doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off, but I suggest rinsing off all the products because the moisturizers are plenty if you choose the right one for your skin type. (Red for aging/normal-dry skin, Purple for dry-sensitive skin, Pink for normal to combo skin just to help those not familiar with the line)&lt;br /&gt;The body products are amazing too and next on my list of ordering as I only got samples of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you trying the full line, following the directions for use properly, and give it at least 30 days before giving up!!! Your skin sometimes needs to adjust to new products and may act crazy at first, but you will notice how much better it looks!o think it&#x27;s full one day and find it empty so big fat con there.

            <li> This cleansing milk is the most gentle cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, great for mornings. The scent, though pleasant, is very weak.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite attractive (I love blue bottles), but I am terrified I&#x27;ll drop it.  The cleanser is fine.  I do not like the fragrance, but I can live with it.  I am just too afraid I&#x27;ll drop and break that bottle.</li>
            <li> I started to use this face wash because my tried and true Neutrogena face wash was stripping my skin of all it&#x27;s natural oils after washing; leaving my face feeling very dry. This face wash leaves my face feeling &amp;#34;elastic&amp;#34; and fresh afterwards. My only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing is that its such a gentle wash, that sometimes I feel it doesn&#x27;t get all of my make-up off.</li>
            <li> I loved the Weleda Iris Cleansing Milk. They longer carry it, and according to the company, this is the next closest thing. It smells lovely, but not the way the Iris one did. And it&#x27;s not quite as creamy.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion for cleaning off my sensitive dry-normal face. I don&#x27;t use a lot of make-up, but this takes it all off along with the usual grit, etc. of living in a city. Leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I adore this face wash. It smells and feels great, works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product smells good and all natural</li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would be good for my sensitive skin. Unfortunately it not only didn&#x27;t remove my light foundation powder, but also left my skin feeling like it was burning, and I had to wash my face again with another product to wash it off and stop the burning sensation. If you have sensitive skin, beware!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is different. It doesn&#x27;t foam up, it goes on smooth and you almost feel like it&#x27;s not cleaning your skin. I usually cleanse twice when I use this product and my skin is soft and glowing after. I love the scent too!</li>
            <li> I did not like the way it felt or washed off.  It is very runny and a little greasy.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it was taking off any face makeup and I do not wear a lot.  Then it felt like it never rinsed completely off.  My skin felt a little greasy after.  I love the toner but not this.</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle night cleanser. Easily removes make up without drying.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smells amazing (herbal and bright, not flowery) and does the job without being drying or greasy.</li>
            <li> We use this after washing our face or shaving every night. You can feel the difference on your skin the next morning: you feel softer, smoother, and even more rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the most recent one we bought, smelled somewhat more oily than we expected. (More oily than the old bottle we were finishing up.) The smell seemed to diminish after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Caused me to break out really bad. Used for almost a month and my skin got horribly covered in pimples. Not really sure why. I&#x27;ve always had a great complexion but this is the first time I&#x27;ve been embarrassed by zits. I&#x27;m 28!! Went back to using Acure and my face started clearing up the very next day! Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if my skin&#x27;s any better for having used it, but it feels great, a bit like spreading a smoothie on your face, and it smells good (Faint lavender/floral odor.).</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it with a facial sponge to wipe out my makeup. I have used so many other products and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that Weleda is switching to plastic bottle for some of the other products.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DON&#x27;T CHANGE THE GLASS BOTTLE TO PLASTIC. KEEP GLASS BOTTLE- this is one of the reasons why I buy this, to avoid enviromental hormone from plastics.</li>
            <li> Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol!!! The bane of my existence in what would otherwise be an excellent product. I have yet to find a great German cosmetics company that does NOT have alcohol in their top 5 or top 10 list of ingredients for facial products and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Ahem, Hauschka, Marie Borland, and now Weleda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might be preaching to the choir, but...alcohol is extremely drying to the skin, it completely counteracts any other moisturizers a product contains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to make this work since it has a lotion texture and the modus operandi is to apply and then wipe off with a moist towel. No rinse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was an unrequited love.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has really sensitive skin, she uses it without any problems and her skin looks amazing. It is also cheaper to buy through here than Weleda&#x27;s on line store.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to clean ok without overdrying. But then, I don&#x27;t use much make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels greasy--feels like you put thick body lotion on your face if you don&#x27;t rinse it. The directions suggest just wiping and going, but I have to wipe and rinse and then wipe to feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;- You have to use a lot. It doesn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li> This product has alcohol in it which is disappointing. It totally dried out my face and clogged my pores. I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have hypersensitive combination skin and have had terrible luck finding reliable, gentle face cleanser. This is perfect. Works well for me in all seasons, in all climates from desert of Idaho to tropical Florida to blustery Vermont. My pores are dramatically smaller and my face is softer and actually feels more relaxed when I use it. I do not spend much $ on beauty products and consider myself very low maintenance, but this is one product I have to have.</li>
            <li> Great quality. A little goes a long way. Cleansing milk is healthier and great for sensitive skin. Does not strip skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser!  Smells wonderful!!!! I wish they had a moisturizer with same fragrance! I have used many Weleda products and they are all top notch!</li>
            <li> Use this along with the Toner for perfect skincare. Soft and gentle on skin. No harsh chemicals or fragrances. Weleda is a brand you can trust -and one that I love!</li>
            <li> This is a light refreshing cleanser with a mild fragrance. Very gentle and a good value over the cosmetic counter products.</li>
