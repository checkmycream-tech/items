            <li>but this one is just magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to use a nice cloth because otherwise your are going to leave your own fingerprints after you clean.</li>
            <li>but I know people in the health care field have used and love this product</li>
            <li>This product works well on wounds where blood flow is OK.  </li>
            <li>Magic item.</li>
            <li>This spray has helped the healing process, which wasn&#x27;t going to good at first.</li>
            <li>Works great on controlling proud flesh with just a small spray.</li>
            <li>it was quickly under control and the gash opening looked clean, with the wound closing nicely.</li>

            <li>Proud flesh was a must to close the gash and begin healing, but it occasionally over grew it&#x27;s desired boundaries and size.</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered a can which was delivered quickly thank you because this product WORKS !  </li>
            <li>It was a fine aid in wound care at $17.oo a can, but not so hot at $40.00.</li>
            <li>The service from Grace HealthCare was quick and the product was well packaged.</li>
            <li>also it is realy fresh for</li>

            <li>Great for small wound care.</li>
            <li>Who know it and have a relative with lesson in their skin will love to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have for every first aid kit</li>
            <li>She used this spray and with in a couple days the wound was starting to heal/feel better.  </li>
            <li>As a pharmacist, I generally know what to use and when, but when animals are concerned, sometimes you just get one shot at it, or things start going south very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve treated general staph infections to hot spots to severe and deep wounds with Granulex; all with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I used this product to help fill in the large hole in his leg.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to give this a try as it has worked wonders on my horses when they have had large wounds.  </li>
            <li>And best of all it only takes a little so my can will probably still have some left when I die.</li>
            <li>The vet was ready to amputate his leg</li>
            <li>This product really made the difference in our dogs wound.  </li>
            <li>it really works...</li>
            <li>This was a last ditch effort to clean up an infection that did not respond to antibiotics.</li>
            <li>Like a pro fast action</li>
            <li>My mother needed this granule spray for a wound just above her buttocks right before her tail bone.  </li>
            <li>My dog had very severe injuries that left large gapping wounds.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of continued use, the wound healed and is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>After over 30 days using this product his leg has filled in and there will be very little scarring.  </li>
            <li>This product will cure a huge gaping wound or a small scratch.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this primarily for my honey who mangled the middle finger of her left hand with a hedge trimmer all the way to the center joint.</li>
            <li>As far as the cost goes - yes - it is much more expensive than other treatments you can buy in the feed stores, pet stores or pharmacies - but it is so worth it.</li>

            <li> Great for proud flesh and good fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have no idea why the price of this product has doubled.  It was a fine aid in wound care at $17.oo a can, but not so hot at $40.00.</li>
            <li> Life on a farm, with lots of animals to take care of, means constantly treating various wounds on all different types of animals.  This is by far the best wound treatment I have found over the years and I have tried everything.  (Polysporin powder, betadine, triple antibiotic ointment, silvadene cream, gentamicin ointment, etc.)  As a pharmacist, I generally know what to use and when, but when animals are concerned, sometimes you just get one shot at it, or things start going south very quickly.  Thus, I will generally turn to Granulex spray if it is a wet wound and Vetericyn if there is a chance that the bug may be aneroebic (yeast, mold, etc).  I&#x27;ve treated general staph infections to hot spots to severe and deep wounds with Granulex; all with amazing results.  As far as the cost goes - yes - it is much more expensive than other treatments you can buy in the feed stores, pet stores or pharmacies - but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Neighbor borrowed it to seal and re-grow skin on her dog&#x27;s leg after snakebite.  Solve a big part of the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to use it, but my greyhound pals swear by it and I&#x27;ve seen the results. I keep it on hand in case I need it, and I&#x27;ve handed off two cans to those who do.&lt;br /&gt;royalhounds.org</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t use it because sensitive skin and allergies but I know people in the health care field have used and love this product</li>
            <li> This product is so good Who know it and have a relative with lesson in their skin will love to use it. Prety soon the lesson clouse  and the skin go back helth also it is realy fresh for</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; medicine !  My dog got bit by a rattlesnake and his skin literally dissolved off his leg !  I used this product to help fill in the large hole in his leg.  After over 30 days using this product his leg has filled in and there will be very little scarring.  The vet was ready to amputate his leg but I wanted to give this a try as it has worked wonders on my horses when they have had large wounds.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is dealing with any kind of large wounds.  Great product !  Don&#x27;t know why they have discontinued making it !</li>
            <li> Amazing product ! I purchased this primarily for my honey who mangled the middle finger of her left hand with a hedge trimmer all the way to the center joint. Cut all the way to the bone removing flesh and nail. Surgeons advised probable amputation. When she told me it had turned black ( necrotic ) and the granulation ( filling in ) wasn&#x27;t happening it made me sick to my stomach. I immediately went to the web and started reading for medications that helped with the granulation process. After reading the reviews about Granulex I quickly ordered a can which was delivered quickly thank you because this product WORKS !  I find it incredible that the medical community doesn&#x27;t know how great this product is. Within a week all the necrotic tissue was gone and the finger was healing fine. Also as soon as she started using it the uncontrollable excruciating pain was finally abating. As she told me \\&quot;I could be a spokesperson for this stuff\\&quot; ! Needless to say I ordered two more cans ( one for me and one for my daughter ). I&#x27;m 68 and still active with all sorts of cuts, scratches, and lacerations from work. Because of my age the healing process has slowed down but this product is a marvel indeed. Even healing a spot of ingrown hairs that were painful and raw for two months in just a couple of weeks. And best of all it only takes a little so my can will probably still have some left when I die. Simply wonderful !&lt;br /&gt;There are no downsides or side effects I&#x27;ve experienced. The only unknown I couldn&#x27;t find information on was when to stop using it. Any ideas out there ?</li>
            <li> This product will cure a huge gaping wound or a small scratch.  Its best feature is how is wards off or eats away proud flesh.</li>
            <li> This product really made the difference in our dogs wound.  It stings a little but nothing major, worked just like it was supposed to.  Will definitely keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> Used to treat a broken skin on a sensitive area it helped the healing as well as the discomfort pleasant aroma not medicinie great price too</li>
            <li> Like a pro fast action</li>
            <li> Great! it really works...</li>
            <li> Great for small wound care. The wound healed without any issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent for healing wounds. It&#x27;s a must have for every first aid kit</li>
            <li> This product works well on wounds where blood flow is OK.  Be very careful if you are diabetic and have limited or compromised blood flow especially in the extremities.  You must consult your doctor before using this medicine.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use another products before but this one is just magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to use a nice cloth because otherwise your are going to leave your own fingerprints after you clean. I don&#x27;t complicate it, it works with paper towel too.</li>
            <li> My mother needed this granule spray for a wound just above her buttocks right before her tail bone.  She used this spray and with in a couple days the wound was starting to heal/feel better.  After a couple weeks of continued use, the wound healed and is completely gone.  The spray does work.  Must follow directions and ask your physician before using.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, my filly took all the skin off her knee in an accident and this product expedited the healing plus reverting proud flesh!9</li>
            <li> Magic item. This with met gel healed a bad wound on my hound that kept popping stitches.</li>
            <li> One of my fellow volunteers at the humane society recommended this to me when one of my dogs had a wound that was not healing despite using the $25 cream the vet gave me. I used this and the wound finally healed.  I plan to always keep one of these in the house.  The volunteer who recommended it told me she uses it on her horses and well as her house pets.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! My dog had very severe injuries that left large gapping wounds. Granulex healed them.</li>
            <li> Did an incredible job on the proud flesh on my horses leg!</li>
            <li> An earlier version had an application tube which made use more precise and easier. It should return to that packaging.</li>
            <li> The service from Grace HealthCare was quick and the product was well packaged. No magic cure yet.... But my dog doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. This was a last ditch effort to clean up an infection that did not respond to antibiotics.</li>
            <li> good stuff, helps healing</li>
            <li> Great product!  It appears to be healing my dog&#x27;s &amp;#34;worry wound&amp;#34;, when nothing else I tried helped!  And it was delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my vet for our dog recovering from surgery.  This spray has helped the healing process, which wasn&#x27;t going to good at first.</li>
            <li> This spray will not sting any wound- excelerates healing amazingly. doesn&#x27;t have a smell -- it has been approved for human use now.</li>
            <li> Works great on controlling proud flesh with just a small spray. Have a gelding with a 6 inch gash on the inside of his hock that has taken FOREVER to heal! Proud flesh was a must to close the gash and begin healing, but it occasionally over grew it&#x27;s desired boundaries and size. A little Granulex spray for a couple of days and it was quickly under control and the gash opening looked clean, with the wound closing nicely.</li>
