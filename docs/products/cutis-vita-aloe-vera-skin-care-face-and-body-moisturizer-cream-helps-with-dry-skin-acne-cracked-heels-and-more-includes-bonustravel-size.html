            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly which is nice.</li>
            <li>If the colors pop and your skin feels nice, you know that the product is being absorbed well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, just a very light clean</li>
            <li>It is easy to rub in, and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>complexion went from fairly blotchy to mostly evened out overnight, which is pretty much</li>
            <li>I want a huge jar of it.</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated and smooth after.</li>
            <li>Light, clean smell and rich moisture.</li>
            <li>So excited to be using it</li>
            <li>I know it sounds strange but testing it on a tattoo is a great way to see the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels nice and soft!</li>
            <li>This is my true experience with this cream.</li>
            <li>Also most expensive I&#x27;ve ever bought (I&#x27;m cheap lol)!</li>
            <li>This is the most smooth, rich, soft feeling moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li>, isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Feels very refreshing and it&#x60;ll keep your face moisturized for several hours!</li>
            <li>After I wash them the moisture is sucked right out.</li>
            <li>I like to use it on my body right after shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, thick, and creamy, and does a great job softening and moisturizing some of my most dry skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps with that problem!</li>
            <li>Pretty nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used this cream more on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy again ;)</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>started using this moisturizer at night and in the morning, and after the first day my breakouts were literally gone.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I love to use it at night before I go to bed for extra hydration..</li>
            <li>it smells nice, but I have super dry skin, and I have found better as far as deep moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love how natural this cream is and how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>specially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Normally Aloe Vera based lotions kind of get flaky after they dry, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li>It has a nice slightly citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li>But if your face tends to be more on the dry side, you will likely enjoy this cream.</li>
            <li>Looking at the packaging it looks very high end.</li>
            <li>This is very yummy stuff.  </li>
            <li>Better han I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I got it fast, with no problems in shipping or customer</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not too perfumy and not too harsh or chemically.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and makes my skin feel soft and keeps it moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>It really absorbs well, which I have found not to be the case with so many other moisturisers.</li>
            <li>Basically no fragrance other than the nice scent of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been having some trouble with breakouts for the first time in my life, pretty sure it&#x27;s attributable to my new birth control.</li>
            <li>I needed a moisturizing cream that would not &amp;#34;vanish&amp;#34; off my skin in less than a minute like many water based creams.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They are creamy, silky but not thick, doesn&#x27;t give me oil or greasy feeling after using it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice thick cream..</li>
            <li>Also, my hands often get super dry.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hands VERY soft.</li>
            <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t super dry, this is the ticket!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I want to use such a rich product on my face, as I tend to have more of a combination skin than dry skin.</li>
            <li>Gives me soft skin</li>
            <li>I have dry and very sensitive skin and normally use only pure and raw coconut or shea butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, but it goes on thick and soaks in quickly.</li>

            <li> The cream is thick and you dont have to use very much.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands at work all day long, and having this in a tube would have made it possible to carry with me.</li>
            <li> also had very dry skin on my t-zone, and I was having to apply moisturizer several times a day.</li>
            <li> The scent is natural and not strong citrus smell.</li>
            <li> My husband has some dry skin areas as he works around chemicals</li>
            <li> Only used a few days so no major findings</li>
            <li> I got the little container and its going to last me a long time because you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> My skin is already getting really dry in the cold winter air, and this product helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> The jar is not huge, and I can take it with me when traveling.</li>
            <li> I really wish this works for me but this made my face oily, greasy and break me out badly after the first use. :(</li>
            <li> I just got a couple of small tattoos and have been using this cream on them as they heal.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on small patches of sun burn and healing scabs to keep them supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick, absorbs well and hydrates my face.</li>
            <li> it is fairly thick.</li>
            <li> If your skin feels greasy or if theres a weird haze over your ink, you know the product has fillers that just dont absorb.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Unpleasant in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Really nice cream! It has a very nice &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; texture to it. Doesn&#x27;t go on slimy, and is nicely hydrating. Leaves my hands VERY soft. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, just a very light clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is 5 stars, but the packaging could be better.

            <li> I love how natural this cream is and how soft it makes my skin feel. It really absorbs well, which I have found not to be the case with so many other moisturisers. My husband has some dry skin areas as he works around chemicals and I put it on his skin too and it works great. Very good product!</li>
            <li> I like this cream it smells nice, but I have super dry skin, and I have found better as far as deep moisturizing. It does absorb quickly which is nice. If your skin isn&#x27;t super dry, this is the ticket!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I like that it contains aloe. I like using it for not just the face. I just got a couple of small tattoos and have been using this cream on them as they heal. It has been working great! Also, my hands often get super dry. After I wash them the moisture is sucked right out. This stuff really helps with that problem! I like the smell too. It is light and fresh-smelling. For someone with allergies and a great sensitivity to smell, this really is nice!</li>

It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or greasy and you can practically feel it putting good nutrients into you skin.  It feels wonderful and the results are smooth, hydrated feeling skin.

            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer. They are creamy, silky but not thick, doesn&#x27;t give me oil or greasy feeling after using it on my skin. The scent is natural and not strong citrus smell. It is easy to rub in, and absorbs well. I don&#x27;t like a cream that takes time to absorb and gives me sticky feeling, this moisturizer does not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it can be used all over the body. The jar is not huge, and I can take it with me when traveling. One moisturizer can serve my face and body, very nice. I like to use it on my body right after shower. My skin feels hydrated and smooth after. Pretty nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this moisturizer at a discount in exchange for my honest review. This is my true experience with this cream. I like it.</li>
            <li> Gives me soft skin and I&#x27;ve been using it with Derma Rollers and Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin by Amara Organics. Best cream I&#x27;ve used. Also most expensive I&#x27;ve ever bought (I&#x27;m cheap lol)! So, I&#x27;d hoped it worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in agreement to leave my honest feedback. Oh my gosh. This is the most smooth, rich, soft feeling moisturizer ever. Not greasy, just marvelous. I even put it on the backs of my hands. It&#x27;s not greasy. I love it. I want a huge jar of it. Will definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> Better han I expected. specially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used this cream more on my hands and feet. It&#x27;s rich, thick, and creamy, and does a great job softening and moisturizing some of my most dry skin.

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this cream. I have dry and very sensitive skin and normally use only pure and raw coconut or shea butter. I needed a moisturizing cream that would not &amp;#34;vanish&amp;#34; off my skin in less than a minute like many water based creams. This is very good, it feels refreshing and soothing, not greasy at all and because of its perfect density you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it. Basically no fragrance other than the nice scent of the natural ingredients. I&#x27;ll buy again ;)</li>

Unpleasant in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this moisturizer at night and in the morning, and after the first day my breakouts were literally gone.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion went from fairly blotchy to mostly evened out overnight, which is pretty much magic.&lt;br /&gt;I also had very dry skin on my t-zone, and I was having to apply moisturizer several times a day. With this stuff, I apply it once a day and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about the consistency- it is fairly thick. It&#x27;s not oily, but it goes on thick and soaks in quickly. I love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. Normally Aloe Vera based lotions kind of get flaky after they dry, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel soft and keeps it moisturized for hours. I got the little container and its going to last me a long time because you only need a little bit. It smells nice but not too perfumy and not too harsh or chemically. I got it fast, with no problems in shipping or customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just received my Cutis Vita order. It was delivered on time. Looking at the packaging it looks very high end. The cream is thick and you dont have to use very much. It has a nice slightly citrus scent to it. I was told that it contains no animal products and was not tested on animals which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my hands face and tattoo. I know it sounds strange but testing it on a tattoo is a great way to see the quality of the product. If the colors pop and your skin feels nice, you know that the product is being absorbed well. If your skin feels greasy or if theres a weird haze over your ink, you know the product has fillers that just dont absorb.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a great moisturizing toner.&lt;br /&gt;Check it out</li>
            <li> Nice thick cream.. Feels good on skin.. Only used a few days so no major findings but my skin feels nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I use it on my hands and it feels silky. It does not feel greasy and makes my hands feel great. I&#x27;d buy this product again in flash.</li>
            <li> Light, clean smell and rich moisture. I love to use it at night before I go to bed for extra hydration..</li>
