            <li>Price was great and these are lasting for me forever.  </li>
            <li>These work much better than the rounded spatulas, the angle cut makes it much easier to apply the wax more precisely.</li>
            <li>This was the first time buying this size and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect size for eyebrows, lips &amp; any small areas that need an intricate wax.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for this set up, unlike microwave wax (hard to handle).</li>
            <li>Got a starter pack with my Gigi Bikini Waxing kit and just loved these big applicators.</li>
            <li>Makes dealing with hot wax easy.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use too many per session, so these last a long time, good investment, don&#x27;t get stuck trying to stick with one at a time, once the ax gets on too much you need to swap, glad to have more</li>
            <li>A lot come in a package so you dont have to worry about running out quickly.</li>
            <li>Large surface, easy to spread.</li>
            <li>Large enough to handle a good amount of wax and not have it drip all over.</li>
            <li>The big advantage with Accu Edge applicators is that you can get the wax more precisely where you want it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use them until I get the right wax.</li>
            <li>it gives you much more control while your waxing I won&#x27;t use any other times strongly recommend them</li>
            <li>These applicators are great for larger areas, but are too big for the eyebrow/face area.</li>
            <li>it will not make a mess and it is easy to use i love the shape of it</li>
            <li>They pick up the most hair and are tick enough to handle the wax.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!!</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and they are tapered which helps get the wax to the right places.</li>
            <li>I bought the large hot wax container and the warmer.</li>
            <li>I know I could just buy popsicle sticks from a craft store and save a little money, but I really do think that the angled edge on these works better for waxing precisely.</li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had success with nearly all GiGi waxing products.</li>
            <li>I love these applicators they are much better that the standard round edge applicator.</li>
            <li>You can use the Large size on any body part, but they are particularly helpful in waxing the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Other people say you can get better or cheaper or use Popsicle sticks, whatever.  </li>
            <li>The angled end did come in quite handy in delicate situations.</li>
            <li>The spatulas were sturdy (didn&#x27;t break or bend much), so they are easy to use for applying hard wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are ok for bigger surfaces, but not for anything less than that.  </li>
            <li>No mess, no fuss!</li>
            <li>Found much cheaper at Sallys Beauty Supply same product.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so much better than a standard round tip stick</li>
            <li>A package of 100 is inexpensive and will last a long time, so I find GiGi&#x27;s Accu Edge Applicators well worth the cost for home bikini waxing.</li>
            <li>They are of decent quality (split and splinter-free) and work well for waxing larger areas  - I use for Brazilian waxes.  </li>
            <li>Waxing has been so much cleaner with these because I get the line I want in the proper thickness without having to try several times.</li>
            <li>I use the large size (carefully) for eyebrows as well.  </li>
            <li>They work just fine for smoothing hot wax onto hairy legs and they&#x27;re not too expensive. .</li>
            <li>They are the same material and thickness of standard applicators, but the pointed edge makes it MUCH easier to apply wax to the proper place.</li>
            <li>This package was very large, so a friend of mine purchased the small size and we split the packages.</li>
            <li>It cut my waxing time down tremendously and less chance of dripping wax.</li>

            <li> Cleaner work area and less wax wasted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got a starter pack with my Gigi Bikini Waxing kit and just loved these big applicators. Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> If you do Brazillian Waxing then these are for you. Price is reasonable and they are tapered which helps get the wax to the right places.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that I was buying expensive tongue depressers but I&#x27;m glad I bought these.  The angled end did come in quite handy in delicate situations.</li>
            <li> Good quality wax spatulas...no splinters.  Work well</li>
            <li> What can I say about wooden spatulas? They work just fine for smoothing hot wax onto hairy legs and they&#x27;re not too expensive. . .yay spatulas.</li>
            <li> They are the same material and thickness of standard applicators, but the pointed edge makes it MUCH easier to apply wax to the proper place. Waxing has been so much cleaner with these because I get the line I want in the proper thickness without having to try several times. This package was very large, so a friend of mine purchased the small size and we split the packages. I would recommend these applicators to anyone who waxes at home!</li>
            <li> This wax system with the warmer is so great and getting replacement supplies at reasonable prices and shipped quickly makes it even better.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a stick?  There&#x27;s a lot of em.  I can&#x27;t use them until I get the right wax.</li>
            <li> These are the best wax strip. Always get the all white ones. They pick up the most hair and are tick enough to handle the wax.</li>
            <li> This product works very well it will not make a mess and it is easy to use i love the shape of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had success with nearly all GiGi waxing products. Waxes, sticks, warmers, all have been nice quality and I&#x27;ve been happy with all my GiGi purchases. These sticks were no different!</li>
            <li> expected the round one and came the flat sticks. thought to return but we were in urgent need so used</li>
            <li> Very good. A little thinner and flimsier than I&#x27;d thought they&#x27;d be but that&#x27;s not really an issue for me. I love the quantity. 100 is quite a lot.</li>
            <li> This is such a bargain compared to what they go for at my local beauty supply shop. I use these with my Gigi hard wax. Sticks are pretty sturdy and work great.</li>
            <li> I love these applicators they are much better that the standard round edge applicator. The \\&quot;accu-edge\\&quot; allows you to get a more precise application of the wax. Try them, you&#x27;ll like them.</li>
            <li> Can never have too many spatulas for waxing! Wel lworth the amount of money spent.  Now if they only made colored ones1!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first time buying this size and I absolutely love them. It cut my waxing time down tremendously and less chance of dripping wax. I use this size for everything including my upper lip. I would not recommend using it for your brows though - definitely too big to get enough control for small areas</li>
            <li> Makes dealing with hot wax easy. Large surface, easy to spread. I bought the large hot wax container and the warmer. They are perfect for this set up, unlike microwave wax (hard to handle).</li>
            <li> These are very good sticks that I use with my Gigi microwaveable wax. They are strong and durable so they will not snap easily. Also I like how the sticks are angled, it allows for me to apply my wax on more easily. They were a great price for the amount you get, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for under arms, legs &amp; bikini.  I use the large size (carefully) for eyebrows as well.  I love the angled edge; works much better than a rounded applicator.  Definitely the size I&#x27;ll be reordering!</li>
            <li> These GiGi Accu Edge Wax Applicators can be used with any hard wax. The Large size are 5.5 inches (14 cm) long, 0.75 inches (2 cm) wide, and about 1.5 mm thick, which is not as thick as a popsicle stick or other applicators that I&#x27;ve used. These are a little flexible. The big advantage with Accu Edge applicators is that you can get the wax more precisely where you want it. I have the large size, which are ideal for bikini waxing. The angled edge allows you to wax just along the hairline. Don&#x27;t want any hair? The Accu Edge helps get the wax onto hard-to-reach areas. I haven&#x27;t tried the small size, but I imagine that the angled edge is helpful in eyebrow waxing. You can use the Large size on any body part, but they are particularly helpful in waxing the bikini area. They don&#x27;t split or splinter. A package of 100 is inexpensive and will last a long time, so I find GiGi&#x27;s Accu Edge Applicators well worth the cost for home bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> Found much cheaper at Sallys Beauty Supply same product. Product works well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain. The spatulas were sturdy (didn&#x27;t break or bend much), so they are easy to use for applying hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;Their shape + user&#x27;s skill makes coating easy and effective.</li>
            <li> I love cheese sticks they&#x27;re so much better than a standard round tip stick it gives you much more control while your waxing I won&#x27;t use any other times strongly recommend them</li>
            <li> Price was great and these are lasting for me forever.  I haven&#x27;t waxed in a while but because these are so big when I did was I only needed one or two.</li>
            <li> Nice grip, sanded on the edges so there are no splinter. spreads my hard wax very well with precision. Highly recommend these!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what you can really say about wooden sticks?  They are as described - perform the task at hand.  They are of decent quality (split and splinter-free) and work well for waxing larger areas  - I use for Brazilian waxes.  Other people say you can get better or cheaper or use Popsicle sticks, whatever.  I am just rating these sticks, not alternative options.  They aren&#x27;t too expensive - there are a lot in the pack and they work.  I could go 5-stars, but they are just sticks.  I like them.  How could you \\&quot;love\\&quot; a stick?</li>
            <li> They are ok for bigger surfaces, but not for anything less than that.  Good quality and edges provide convenient area definition.</li>
            <li> These applicators are great for larger areas, but are too big for the eyebrow/face area. They work great on leg and bikini areas.</li>
            <li> I thought about skimping on these, but soon realized they were necesary for a job well done.  The edge allows you to be more stratigic in the placement of the wax.  Cleaner work area and less wax wasted.</li>
            <li> These are very handy to have. They are sturdy and make wax placement easy.  A lot come in a package so you dont have to worry about running out quickly.</li>
            <li> I was going to get the 250 sticks for around $16 but keep having problems with shipping. So I got this and shipped on time and tryed and loved it. Sticks wer smooth and strong</li>
            <li> They spread the wax just fine and they don&#x27;t break. What else are they supposed to do? Cool, Good luck.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for eyebrows, lips &amp; any small areas that need an intricate wax. It work for me!</li>
            <li> These are wide and sturdy.  I&#x27;m not sure what to compare them to since this is my first time to buy wax application spatuIas.  I can&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use too many per session, so these last a long time, good investment, don&#x27;t get stuck trying to stick with one at a time, once the ax gets on too much you need to swap, glad to have more then I need!</li>
            <li> Great - I like the slanted tip</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Very handy, made it easy to put the wax where it was wanted.  Large enough to handle a good amount of wax and not have it drip all over.</li>
            <li> Glad I can purchase these angled waxing spatulas in bulk! I know I could just buy popsicle sticks from a craft store and save a little money, but I really do think that the angled edge on these works better for waxing precisely. And if you do your own waxing at home, particularly in sensitive areas, precision is important, lol! I will repurchase when I run out, but this pack of 100 will last a long time. Appreciate also that they come in smaller bundles, which makes storing them neater.</li>
            <li> These work much better than the rounded spatulas, the angle cut makes it much easier to apply the wax more precisely.</li>
            <li> I love to use the wood spatula. No cleaning after...just throw it in the garbage! Applies wax properly and evenly! No mess, no fuss!</li>
            <li> If you are waxing on your own or if you are a business these spatulas are great for all your waxing needs.</li>
