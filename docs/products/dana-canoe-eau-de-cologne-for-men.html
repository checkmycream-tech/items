    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Canoe by Dana is my best cologne to use.</li>
            <li>He is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I am a great fan and have been using this cologne forever.</li>
            <li>Still smells great as as ever.</li>
            <li>great used for 50 years</li>
            <li>and I find it pleasant and (desirably) lingering for hours.</li>
            <li>Buy from the store so you can get a good product, because this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect combination, and I always feel secure dealing with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I just transfer to a spray bottle and love it!.</li>
            <li>To each his own...</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem of any kind, when Amazon is involved.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL WAS REALLY GOOD........  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for many years</li>
            <li>I love the smell, what else is there to say?  </li>
            <li>I love the smell because it makes me think of him and my childhood.</li>
            <li>It arrived timely and the packaging was outstanding.</li>
            <li>love when he has it on.</li>
            <li>I am a senior citizen, who has been using Dana Canoe Eau de Cologne for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I also have been using Amazon for many years.  </li>
            <li>A SHAME TO RUIN SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I think it is a good smell and masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I use to wear this back in the 70&#x27;s, the girls loved it then and the ladies love it now.</li>
            <li>that I started wearing in high school many many years ago.</li>
            <li>Mild and not over powering scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always been a &amp;#34;Class&amp;#34; scent, fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>What can I say, its an old favorite of my husbands and he loves this one.  </li>
            <li>Made a nice Birthday present.</li>
            <li>NOT ANY MORE - please go back to the original formula.</li>
            <li>With all the non-descript scents out there it&#x27;s a real pleasure to use this unique product.</li>
            <li>Small size is great for travel.</li>
            <li>It is soothing, mild and reminds me of being very clean!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the right power for me, especially for those close encounters..:)</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>Canoe has been my favorite fragrance for over 30 years, but my last bottle, which was 4 ounces, lasted about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I graduated from high school in 1964 and always had numerous people tell me how much they liked the cologne I was wearing (CANOE).</li>
            <li>DOES NOT LAST NOR IS IT AS STRONG.....</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed Dana Canoe for as long as I can remember!!</li>
            <li>For some reason it&#x27;s fine they can mail it to me, but I can&#x27;t mail it back.  </li>
            <li>I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED&lt;</li>
            <li>THIS THE REAL THING</li>
            <li>Thanks for ruining Christmas, Amazon.  </li>
            <li>UNTIL THEY GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA........  </li>
            <li>I USED CANOE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN 1965-1966......  </li>
            <li>I started using this in the 1960&#x27;s in high school.</li>
            <li>This item is hard to find in the retail stores and I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>THE BOTTLES WERE MARKED (MADE IN FRANCE ) .....  </li>
            <li>I was told by Dana, that this product was years OLD.  </li>
            <li>Masculine aroma.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.  </li>
            <li>, IT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE EXPECTED</li>
            <li>This is not the product that we remember from the 70s - apparently the formula has been changed.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using this product for 40 years,it always smells fresh not too harsh like some,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the same old familiar stuff, very difficult to find in stores, and the two ounce bottle I&#x27;m sure will go a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my observation, though, that the bottle seems to be thicker than it needs to be: in other words, it gives the impression of being heftier than the contents really are.</li>

            <li> Sounds stupid maybe, but if you use any similar product daily, for years, you&#x27;d hunt out the old favorite!</li>

            <li> I just transfer to a spray bottle and love it!. I guess that you could use it straight out of the bottle but a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> This is not the product that we remember from the 70s - apparently the formula has been changed.  It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.  My husband says he will use it, but will not replace it when it is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for many years and I find it pleasant and (desirably) lingering for hours. It&#x27;s my observation, though, that the bottle seems to be thicker than it needs to be: in other words, it gives the impression of being heftier than the contents really are.</li>
            <li> Just like it was 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Canoe in 30 years. It&#x27;s always been a &amp;#34;Class&amp;#34; scent, fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;What memories it brought back. With all the non-descript scents out there it&#x27;s a real pleasure to use this unique product.</li>
            <li> To each his own...and although you&#x27;l probably disagree with me, I&#x27;d feel lost if I didn&#x27;t have my canoe. Sounds stupid maybe, but if you use any similar product daily, for years, you&#x27;d hunt out the old favorite!</li>
            <li> Canoe by Dana is my best cologne to use. I am a great fan and have been using this cologne forever.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the Canoe I.m used to using.</li>
            <li> I am sorry but I just cannot find the CANOE COLOGNE  that I started wearing in high school many many years ago. I graduated from high school in 1964 and always had numerous people tell me how much they liked the cologne I was wearing (CANOE). NOT ANY MORE - please go back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, what else is there to say?  I think it is a good smell and masculine fragrance.  Some products just keep going and going and..........................</li>
            <li> I USED CANOE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN 1965-1966......  THE BOTTLES WERE MARKED (MADE IN FRANCE ) .....  THE&lt;br /&gt;CURRENT CANOE HAS BEEN REFORMULATED AND CHANGED.....  THIS IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT ....&lt;br /&gt;SMELL DOES NOT LAST NOR IS IT AS STRONG..... THIS IS LIKE AN AFTERSHAVE....  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL WAS REALLY GOOD........  WHAT A SHAME TO RUIN SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT.....&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE SEEN OTHER REVIEWS SAYING THE SAME THING......  IF WOULD BE AT LEAST ETHICAL IF DANA&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RELEASE A STATEMENT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FORMULA WAS REVISED.....  I WILL NEVER BUY IT&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN UNTIL THEY GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA........  JIM /ATLANTA  6/1/15</li>
            <li> I started using this in the 1960&#x27;s in high school. Haven&#x27;t seen it in years. Still smells great as as ever. Mild and not over powering scent.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING CANOE FOR OVER 50 YEARS. ON APRIL 17TH I ORDERED EAU DE COLOGLE.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS SUPPSED TO HAVE ALCOHOL BECAUSE IT IS COLOGNE.&lt;br /&gt;IF IT WAS COLOGNE THE SMELL WOULD NOT DISSAPATE SHORTLY AFTER APPLYING.&lt;br /&gt;IS THIS THE REAL THING OR A KNOCK OFF IN THE CANOE BOTTLE?</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking all over for this product. He is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> What can I say, its an old favorite of my husbands and he loves this one.  Still smells the same and it is one of my favorites also.  Made a nice Birthday present.</li>
            <li> MY NEPHEW LIKES HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT, IT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE EXPECTED&lt;br /&gt;WE WILL USE THE SERVICE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Dana Canoe for as long as I can remember!! It is soothing, mild and reminds me of being very clean!!&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible to get tired of it!!</li>
            <li> great used for 50 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an oldie but a goldie.  Not an overpower smell and it doesn&#x27;t smell like all the others</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.  I bought two of these for Christmas gifts.  They do NOT smell like the Canoe from the store, and the labels on the bottle looks marred, like they got wet or are seconds or something like that, the edges look worn and old.  And worst, I cannot even return these to Amazon!  I am MOST DISAPPOINTED in Amazon for offering these inferior &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; without even the chance to return.  For some reason it&#x27;s fine they can mail it to me, but I can&#x27;t mail it back.  Thanks for ruining Christmas, Amazon.  If you like Canoe, please don&#x27;t make the mistake I made in ordering these.  Buy from the store so you can get a good product, because this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Canoe has been my favorite fragrance for over 30 years, but my last bottle, which was 4 ounces, lasted about 10 years.  This is the same old familiar stuff, very difficult to find in stores, and the two ounce bottle I&#x27;m sure will go a long way.</li>
            <li> My dad loves Canoe so I get it for him all the time.  I love the smell because it makes me think of him and my childhood.</li>
            <li> The item was received as advertised.  This item is hard to find in the retail stores and I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of it when I was in the military back in the mid 60&#x27;s.  The fragrance is as I had remembered...I like it.  It arrived timely and the packaging was outstanding.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for 40 years,it always smells fresh not too harsh like some,&lt;br /&gt;I love when he has it on.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen, who has been using Dana Canoe Eau de Cologne for many years.  It is my favorite. I also have been using Amazon for many years.  It is the perfect combination, and I always feel secure dealing with Amazon.  I have never had a problem of any kind, when Amazon is involved.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Howard Neckin  castnec1969@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I was told by Dana, that this product was years OLD.  Not a new item I their product line at this time.</li>
            <li> Dana Canoe Eau de Cologne for Men, 2 Ounce Just the right power for me, especially for those close encounters..:)</li>
            <li> did&#x27;nt smell like canoe</li>
            <li> I use to wear this back in the 70&#x27;s, the girls loved it then and the ladies love it now.</li>
            <li> Small size is great for travel. Scent is not overpowering but subtle and long lasting. Masculine aroma. Like it very much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happens, but the scent vanishes at once.  No lasting power at all.  I am disappointed.  Sorry./</li>
